00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:05.920
 
so I looked at the topic of what's

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930
so I looked at the topic of what's
 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.329
so I looked at the topic of what's
happening in the brain when we deal with

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:07.339
happening in the brain when we deal with
 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.130
happening in the brain when we deal with
money and there's a part of the brain

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.140
money and there's a part of the brain
 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.870
money and there's a part of the brain
that activates it's called the nucleus

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880
that activates it's called the nucleus
 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.580
that activates it's called the nucleus
accumbens it's deep within this sort of

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590
accumbens it's deep within this sort of
 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.040
accumbens it's deep within this sort of
evolutionary the oldest part of the

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050
evolutionary the oldest part of the
 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.249
evolutionary the oldest part of the
brain and they compared people who make

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259
brain and they compared people who make
 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.470
brain and they compared people who make
money to those who are high on cocaine

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480
money to those who are high on cocaine
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.960
money to those who are high on cocaine
and remarkably the brain scans were

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970
and remarkably the brain scans were
 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.489
and remarkably the brain scans were
almost identical because there was

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:24.499
almost identical because there was
 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.899
almost identical because there was
activation in this part of the brain

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:25.909
activation in this part of the brain
 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.089
activation in this part of the brain
called the nucleus accumbens they've

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099
called the nucleus accumbens they've
 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.609
called the nucleus accumbens they've
also looked at brain scans of people who

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
also looked at brain scans of people who
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.700
also looked at brain scans of people who
are high looking looking at women naked

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710
are high looking looking at women naked
 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.099
are high looking looking at women naked
women dead bodies and money it what got

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109
women dead bodies and money it what got
 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.709
women dead bodies and money it what got
the most activation it was money so

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719
the most activation it was money so
 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.029
the most activation it was money so
money obviously acts as a neuro

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039
money obviously acts as a neuro
 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.000
money obviously acts as a neuro
stimulant and it makes us act in very

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010
stimulant and it makes us act in very
 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.029
stimulant and it makes us act in very
sort of irrational ways and so the part

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039
sort of irrational ways and so the part
 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.439
sort of irrational ways and so the part
that the brain lights up again the

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449
that the brain lights up again the
 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.419
that the brain lights up again the
nucleus accumbens keeps on firing and

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429
nucleus accumbens keeps on firing and
 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.069
nucleus accumbens keeps on firing and
firing and firing and obviously money

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079
firing and firing and obviously money
 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.709
firing and firing and obviously money
excites us the nucleus accumbens is part

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719
excites us the nucleus accumbens is part
 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.150
excites us the nucleus accumbens is part
of the reward center of the brain and

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160
of the reward center of the brain and
 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.090
of the reward center of the brain and
it's part of the brain that activates

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100
it's part of the brain that activates
 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.619
it's part of the brain that activates
when you're excited when you're aroused

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629
when you're excited when you're aroused
 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.229
when you're excited when you're aroused
when you're feeling happiness or or even

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239
when you're feeling happiness or or even
 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.130
when you're feeling happiness or or even
joy and I was part of the there's many

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140
joy and I was part of the there's many
 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.300
joy and I was part of the there's many
parts of the brain to activate when

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
parts of the brain to activate when
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.410
parts of the brain to activate when
using money but this is where it's

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420
using money but this is where it's
 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.690
using money but this is where it's
concentrated where we process rewards

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700
concentrated where we process rewards
 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.789
concentrated where we process rewards
and brain scientists have been able to

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799
and brain scientists have been able to
 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.069
and brain scientists have been able to
scan your brain and they say okay you

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079
scan your brain and they say okay you
 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.160
scan your brain and they say okay you
can invest in a stock that's more risky

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
can invest in a stock that's more risky
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.389
can invest in a stock that's more risky
a conservative bond or someone gets that

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399
a conservative bond or someone gets that
 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.969
a conservative bond or someone gets that
no option at all I got like a my cash

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979
no option at all I got like a my cash
 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.160
no option at all I got like a my cash
right and so they find that if there's

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170
right and so they find that if there's
 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.569
right and so they find that if there's
activation in the nucleus accumbens

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
activation in the nucleus accumbens
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.580
activation in the nucleus accumbens
you're more likely to take the risk of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
you're more likely to take the risk of
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.139
you're more likely to take the risk of
your option I mean you're more likely to

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149
your option I mean you're more likely to
 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.780
your option I mean you're more likely to
choose a stock well there's activation

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
choose a stock well there's activation
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.280
choose a stock well there's activation
in the insula which is the anxiety

in the insula which is the anxiety
 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.440
in the insula which is the anxiety
center of the brain you're more likely

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450
center of the brain you're more likely
 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.469
center of the brain you're more likely
to be risk averse and you're taking on

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479
to be risk averse and you're taking on

to be risk averse and you're taking on
investing in the bonds so what they find

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659
investing in the bonds so what they find
 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.480
investing in the bonds so what they find
is that obviously what happens in the

for example when you sit outside on a

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020
for example when you sit outside on a
 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.639
for example when you sit outside on a
sunny day you're more likely to tip more

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649
sunny day you're more likely to tip more
 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.929

for the waiter you feel like you're in a

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939
for the waiter you feel like you're in a
 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.240
for the waiter you feel like you're in a
better mood that the Sun affects you and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250
better mood that the Sun affects you and
 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.920
better mood that the Sun affects you and
you tip more money whereas if you sit on

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930
you tip more money whereas if you sit on
 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.650
you tip more money whereas if you sit on
sit inside YouTube less money so

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660
sit inside YouTube less money so
 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.490
sit inside YouTube less money so
researchers went back

researchers went back
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.260
researchers went back
look to this and they said well one

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270
look to this and they said well one
 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.370
look to this and they said well one
thing that we have really good data on

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.250
the part of your brain that activates is
the prefrontal cortex meaning the part

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
the prefrontal cortex meaning the part
 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.199
the prefrontal cortex meaning the part
of the brain that sort of makes us human

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
of the brain that sort of makes us human
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.690
of the brain that sort of makes us human
the part that evolved to give

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700
the part that evolved to give
 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.699
the part that evolved to give
self-awareness and reflection so in a

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709
self-awareness and reflection so in a
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.530
self-awareness and reflection so in a
point when we see the price that part of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540
point when we see the price that part of
 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.600
point when we see the price that part of
the brain activates and when the price

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610
the brain activates and when the price
 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.690
the brain activates and when the price
is too expensive the insula activates

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700
is too expensive the insula activates
 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.479
is too expensive the insula activates
which is again part of the fear sensor

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489
which is again part of the fear sensor
 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.430
which is again part of the fear sensor
and when you make a bad financial

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
and when you make a bad financial
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.310
and when you make a bad financial
decision you may feel in your gut and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320
decision you may feel in your gut and
 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.750
decision you may feel in your gut and
there's actually a reason for that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
there's actually a reason for that
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.090
there's actually a reason for that
because there's a part of there's a cell

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100
because there's a part of there's a cell
 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.610
because there's a part of there's a cell
called a spindle cell and it's there's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620
called a spindle cell and it's there's
 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.229
called a spindle cell and it's there's
some spindle cells in your stomach and

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239
some spindle cells in your stomach and
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.210
some spindle cells in your stomach and
that they're connected to your insula in

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220
that they're connected to your insula in
 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.250
that they're connected to your insula in
the brain so when you make an irrational

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260
the brain so when you make an irrational
 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.050
the brain so when you make an irrational
financial decision when you put money in

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060
financial decision when you put money in
 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.819
financial decision when you put money in
that stock and it falls precipitously

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829
that stock and it falls precipitously
 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.740
that stock and it falls precipitously
you feel it in your insula you feel like

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750
you feel it in your insula you feel like
 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.479
you feel it in your insula you feel like
in your gut that oh my gosh it's a

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489
in your gut that oh my gosh it's a
 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.530
in your gut that oh my gosh it's a
neurological mechanism and so

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540
neurological mechanism and so
 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.850
neurological mechanism and so
increasingly I think we're gonna be

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860
increasingly I think we're gonna be
 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.120
increasingly I think we're gonna be
seeing neuroscientists they'll be able

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130
seeing neuroscientists they'll be able
 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.620
seeing neuroscientists they'll be able
to forecast our financial

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630
to forecast our financial
 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.210
to forecast our financial
decision-making based on what's

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220
decision-making based on what's
 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.789
decision-making based on what's
happening in our brains and they look at

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799
happening in our brains and they look at
 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.270
happening in our brains and they look at
studies of identical twins and when they

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
studies of identical twins and when they
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.040
studies of identical twins and when they
separate identical twins they find that

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
separate identical twins they find that
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.350
separate identical twins they find that
they invest in a similar

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360
they invest in a similar
 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.959
they invest in a similar
manor right between stocks bonds and

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969
manor right between stocks bonds and
 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.719
manor right between stocks bonds and
cash and currency and of course genetics

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
cash and currency and of course genetics
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.700
cash and currency and of course genetics
isn't the only thing but genetics has a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710
isn't the only thing but genetics has a
 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.439
isn't the only thing but genetics has a
strong influence not just on how we

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449
strong influence not just on how we
 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.990
strong influence not just on how we
spend but even our credit scores in one

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000
spend but even our credit scores in one
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.580
spend but even our credit scores in one
study they found that there's this one

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590
study they found that there's this one
 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.770
study they found that there's this one
gene and those who have one variant of

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780
gene and those who have one variant of
 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.020
gene and those who have one variant of
the gene are more likely to be risk

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030
the gene are more likely to be risk
 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.749
the gene are more likely to be risk
averse have fewer credit lines and a

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759
averse have fewer credit lines and a
 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.730
averse have fewer credit lines and a
higher FICO scores have higher credit

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740
higher FICO scores have higher credit
 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.770
higher FICO scores have higher credit
scores and just the inverse of that if

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780
scores and just the inverse of that if
 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.029
scores and just the inverse of that if
you have that another cop another

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039
you have that another cop another
 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.059
you have that another cop another
variant of that gene so it shows that

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069
variant of that gene so it shows that
 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.100
variant of that gene so it shows that
genes can help influence our credit

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110
genes can help influence our credit
 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.899
genes can help influence our credit
score in a very statistically

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909
score in a very statistically
 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.900
score in a very statistically
significant way
