00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730
you see one specialist and then another
 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.189
you see one specialist and then another
specialist but they don't talk to each

other and what they're telling you
 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.279
other and what they're telling you
doesn't make sense or fit together a

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289
doesn't make sense or fit together a
 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.870

third of patients by the end of their

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
third of patients by the end of their
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.779
third of patients by the end of their
life have 10 or more specialists in

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789
life have 10 or more specialists in
 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.350
life have 10 or more specialists in
their care and we're not very good at

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360
their care and we're not very good at
 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.589
their care and we're not very good at
knitting all of that together and so I

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599
knitting all of that together and so I
 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.109
knitting all of that together and so I
think the most important part the

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119
think the most important part the
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.430
think the most important part the
patient plays is not being passive about

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440
patient plays is not being passive about

their part on the team they are we're
not great at drawing out the patient

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660
not great at drawing out the patient
 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.020
not great at drawing out the patient
we've wanted the patient to be passive

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030
we've wanted the patient to be passive
 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.309

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.410
act together I think what we're learning
is the patient's play a key role
