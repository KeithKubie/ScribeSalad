the answers it must be integrated and it

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640
the answers it must be integrated and it
 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.729
the answers it must be integrated and it
must be done now

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739
 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.770
corruption affects every aspect of human

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780
corruption affects every aspect of human
 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.289
corruption affects every aspect of human
life it's very unfortunate but if you

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299
life it's very unfortunate but if you
 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.449
life it's very unfortunate but if you
think about why corruption affects

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
think about why corruption affects
 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.009
think about why corruption affects
education and affects everything else

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019
education and affects everything else
 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.649

the fundamental problem in most

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659
the fundamental problem in most
 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.259
the fundamental problem in most
societies and this is particularly true

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269
societies and this is particularly true
 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.870
societies and this is particularly true
in emerging and developing countries but

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880
in emerging and developing countries but
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.729
in emerging and developing countries but
it's not exclusively a problem of

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739
it's not exclusively a problem of
 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.620
it's not exclusively a problem of
developing countries but it's more

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630
developing countries but it's more
 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.390
developing countries but it's more
prevalent in poor countries and the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
prevalent in poor countries and the
 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.129
prevalent in poor countries and the
reason why that is the case is because

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139
reason why that is the case is because
 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.020
reason why that is the case is because
there is a complete lack of transparency

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
there is a complete lack of transparency
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.629
there is a complete lack of transparency
and accountability so if you want a

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639
and accountability so if you want a
 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.879
and accountability so if you want a
tacky corruption which is essential for

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889
tacky corruption which is essential for
 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.980
tacky corruption which is essential for

good quality education you have to

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539
good quality education you have to
 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.750
good quality education you have to
address the issue of transparency and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760
address the issue of transparency and
 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.909
address the issue of transparency and
accountability without that there's

solution to corruption so and it is a
 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.290
solution to corruption so and it is a
deep disease it cuts at the very

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300
deep disease it cuts at the very
 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.540
deep disease it cuts at the very

so yes corruption as a endemic disease

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
so yes corruption as a endemic disease
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.950
so yes corruption as a endemic disease
but it can be tackled and it must be

is now a new new economy a new country

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710
is now a new new economy a new country
 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.770
is now a new new economy a new country
which is just opening up new in the

this as an akan creat example of what
the private sector can do to respect

the private sector can do to respect
human rights and this is a good example

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930
human rights and this is a good example
 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.900
human rights and this is a good example
because the government there is very

can think through this logically to its
to its end conclusion you can be sure

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560
to its end conclusion you can be sure
 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.490
to its end conclusion you can be sure
that any

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500
that any
 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.680
that any
potential negative consequences are

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690
potential negative consequences are
 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.050
potential negative consequences are
taken care of just as you do with say

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060
taken care of just as you do with say
 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.760
taken care of just as you do with say
health and safety just as you do with

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770
health and safety just as you do with
 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.340
health and safety just as you do with
environmental damage will your actions

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350
environmental damage will your actions
 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.650
environmental damage will your actions
cause a human rights damage so at least

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660
cause a human rights damage so at least
 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.440
cause a human rights damage so at least
at a minimum it's a do no harm but

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.450
at a minimum it's a do no harm but
 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.150
at a minimum it's a do no harm but
ideally businesses should be actually

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160
ideally businesses should be actually
 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.130
ideally businesses should be actually
promoting human rights promoting the

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.140
promoting human rights promoting the
 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.320
promoting human rights promoting the
basic values that underlie human rights

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330
basic values that underlie human rights
 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.670
basic values that underlie human rights
and I think they have a huge road

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680
and I think they have a huge road
 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.070
and I think they have a huge road
cleaner
