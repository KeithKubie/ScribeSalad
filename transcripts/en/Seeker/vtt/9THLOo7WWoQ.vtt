00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm going all-in on this gamble of a DNews
episode, how is it that casinos keep people

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.590
gambling, even if they don't really want to?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.650
Hey penny-slotters Trace here for DNews today
diving into the flashy world of gambling.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.810
Literally, it's flashy, there are lights and
sounds and smells, adventures to be had money

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.810
to be won!

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.090
But when you're in a casino, hundreds of papers
and experiments are brought to bear to keep

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.070
you in their gilded halls.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.490
So how do casinos keep us gambling?
increased arousal

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.010
A 2010 study in the Journal of Mental Health
Addiction found both lights and music created

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.859
"increased arousal" effects.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.900
And a new study in the Journal of Neuroscience
looked at the brains of rats finding increased

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.390
arousal increases dopamine reception -- one
of our brain's powerful reward chemicals.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.329
Feeling good means we spend more, so casinos
cash in on dopamine at every turn.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.030
Numerous studies say more arousal means more
gambling, and faster music paired with flashing

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.079
lights makes people bet more quickly and spend
more money!

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.290
But that's not all…
colored lights

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.180
Marketers know the color red makes people
more aroused too.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.250
And studies show red light makes people more
gambley than blue light!

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.270
Thus, casinos put red everywhere!

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.630
The Journal of Gambling Studies revealed a
bunch of other insights into gambling behavior

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.630
as well.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
Things like "the illusion of control," the
idea that if you're pushing a button or pulling

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.390
a lever, you have control over the situation…
and if the risk seems low and you get an immediate

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200
response to your bet, you'll bet more, and
then more.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.410
free drinks/design
Some casinos even offer free drinks, great,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.410
right?

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.410
For the casino.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.410
Alcohol lowers your inhibitions and increases
expectations, further increasing play.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.560
architecture
Even the architecture has evolved.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.259
I find this particularly fascinating.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.970
Originally casinos focused on "gaming design:"
all the slot machines and tables were lined

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.930
up, all together in a maze-like configuration.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.090
It was thought that this design would make
us step up and gamble at every turn.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.259
But based on scientific studies, casino design
has been radically redefined.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.729
New casinos are based on the idea of "adult
playgrounds" with high-ceilings and expansive,

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.200
opulent, easy-to-navigate spaces; the Bellagio
is the quintessential example.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.560
Old-style casinos famously avoid windows and
clocks to help gamblers lose their sense of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
place and time, but "playground" casinos make
people feel happy and comfortable, with sunshine,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.610
high-ceilings and art; keeping us gambling,
having fun, and spending that money.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.950
A study published in the journal Environment
&amp; Behavior proved that this is working.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.970
People like the playground design, especially
women.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.319
In the compact "gaming design" women felt
crowded by others around them, if they were

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.660
too close to other people they'd gamble less.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.690
The adult playground design mitigates these
problems, and women now gamble even more.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.819
Slots, for example, are historically very
popular with women, and revenue increased

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.720
over 30 percent since 1970.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.660
It turns out, adding windows, bright colors,
and a resort feel, has a huge payoff for the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.660
House.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.959
The research showed, gamblers in a resort
playground casino feel more comfortable and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.970
are reminded to have fun constantly.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.000
So they do.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.830
oxygen
The thing casino's don't do, though, is pump

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.459
in oxygen to give gamblers a modest high.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.319
It's a myth, dating back decades.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.080
What they actually do is pump in scents which
keep people aroused (back to that arousal

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.470
effect, thing) and according to the scent
designer for one company who does it, AromaSys:

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.680
refreshing and soothing scents keep people
gambling longer.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.409
conclusion
In the end, casinos cash in on exploiting

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.720
our psychology to the tune of 240 billion
dollars a year.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.569
They do it with the games, the decor, the
drinks, the smells, assaulting our senses

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.160
to get us to make it rain in the desert in
Vegas and elsewhere.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.690
But what about gambling addiction?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.019
Isn't that worth considering?

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.160
Gambling addiction does have a genetic component,
meaning if your mother or father has gambling

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.610
addiction, you could too!

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.220
Laci explains how that works here.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:10.900
I don't really like gambling, I'm just not
taken in by it all…

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.330
I like wandering the hotels, but I don't feel
the need to pump quarters into a slot machine.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.330
But how you y'all feel?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.330
Do you gamble?

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.889
Have you stopped to think about why?
