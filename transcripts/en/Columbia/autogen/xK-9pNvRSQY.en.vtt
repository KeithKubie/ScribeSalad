themes that tie the presentations
 

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:54.660
themes that tie the presentations
together and and which we could talk

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:54.670
together and and which we could talk
 

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:57.630
together and and which we could talk
about it seems to me that uh three

understood as a series of neighborhoods
and the fact that this relative

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:39.310
and the fact that this relative
 

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:42.600
and the fact that this relative
independence gives a kind of opportunity

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:42.610
independence gives a kind of opportunity
 

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.900

thought that as a pedagogical exercise

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.210
thought that as a pedagogical exercise
 

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:29.240
thought that as a pedagogical exercise
which you presented it as a kind of

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:29.250
which you presented it as a kind of
 

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:33.770

pedagogical exercise for students to
 

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:39.680
pedagogical exercise for students to
engage and and it resonates with the

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:39.690
engage and and it resonates with the
 

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.780

immigrant neighborhood is really quite
 

01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:06.230
immigrant neighborhood is really quite
interesting and maybe something we can

01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:06.240
interesting and maybe something we can
 

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.360

propose this with this word you know
that we think about this notion of

01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:17.220
that we think about this notion of
 

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.710
that we think about this notion of

thought of immigrant neighborhoods is

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.010
thought of immigrant neighborhoods is
 

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:36.170
thought of immigrant neighborhoods is
precisely that the place in which

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:36.180
precisely that the place in which
 

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.599
precisely that the place in which
assimilation takes place so the attack

01:09:38.599 --> 01:09:38.609
assimilation takes place so the attack

pad for them to become assimilated into

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020
pad for them to become assimilated into
 

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:50.599
pad for them to become assimilated into
the larger culture something that's not

01:09:50.599 --> 01:09:50.609
the larger culture something that's not
 

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:55.210
the larger culture something that's not
happening in Japan as you pointed out

01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:55.220
happening in Japan as you pointed out
 

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.770

instrumentally so they're kept out of
 

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.960
instrumentally so they're kept out of
integration so that's for me also

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:05.970
integration so that's for me also

transitional object and in its in that

beginning to unpack this notion of the
transitional space and so I think this

01:17:12.389 --> 01:17:12.399
transitional space and so I think this
 

01:17:12.399 --> 01:17:13.859
transitional space and so I think this
relation between the transitional space

01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:13.869
relation between the transitional space
 

01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:15.479
relation between the transitional space
in the transitional object is something

01:17:15.479 --> 01:17:15.489
in the transitional object is something
 

01:17:15.489 --> 01:17:17.850
in the transitional object is something
for us to think about in relationship to

for us to think about in relationship to

for us to think about in relationship to

been talking in the early panel also
about the relationship between the

about the relationship between the

about the relationship between the
physical urban space and the social and

01:17:28.199 --> 01:17:28.209
physical urban space and the social and

these two things I think what we are

these two things I think what we are
 

01:17:34.329 --> 01:17:36.239
these two things I think what we are
trying to do is precisely to understand

trying to do is precisely to understand
 

01:17:36.249 --> 01:17:37.979
trying to do is precisely to understand
the relationship and I thought maybe

01:17:37.979 --> 01:17:37.989
the relationship and I thought maybe
 

01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:41.100
the relationship and I thought maybe
these questions of the transitional are

these questions of the transitional are

these questions of the transitional are
a way to kind of unpack this this

a way to kind of unpack this this
 

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:46.469
a way to kind of unpack this this
