1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,840
A striking in nearly unique feature
of human reproduction is menopause

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,520
and it's puzzling if evolution
actually runs on reproductive success.

3
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:16,400
Then why should an
organism stop reproducing?

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,050
It has five suggested functions and
we'll go through them in some detail.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,430
The first is the idea that it is for
the safety of the last offspring.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,740
It's the mother hypothesis.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,300
The second is that the grandmother could
help her daughter because she's being

8
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,210
released from taking
care of her own babies.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,740
The third idea is that daughters
in law are out competing.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,930
The target female.

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,030
A fourth is that it's a byproduct
of quality control of oocytes,

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,620
and the fifth idea is that is
the result of self domestication,

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,540
so let's step through those.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,740
Yeah.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,250
Menopause is rare in mammals
and it's derived in humans.

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,270
Our closest relatives do not
have menopause. Chimpanzees,

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Bonobos and gorillas do not.
We'll see some data on that in a moment.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,670
There are two citations to Wales that
do have menopause and they have clothes

19
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,480
enduring maternal offspring interactions,
pilot whales and the killer whales.

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,180
They are rather difficult to study.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,680
Okay,

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,680
we're going to now look at four panels
and what I want to stress in these panels

23
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,050
is the patterns of
survival and reproduction.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,630
So the blue is fertility,
the red is survivorship,

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,340
this is chimpanzees,

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,910
and what you can see is
that chimpanzee survival,

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,400
this is the percentage which uh,

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,710
are surviving from birth is dropping.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Chimpanzees are starting to reproduce
at about 10 to 12 years of age and they

30
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:06,380
continue to reproduce right through
until they're about 50 years old.

31
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,730
So they reproduce right
up to the end of life.

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,660
And if we take the chimpanzee reproduction
curve and put it over here in black,

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,360
that's just the same
curve brought over here.

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,590
This is births per female per year and
we plot onto it the reproduction curves

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,060
for two human Honda Hunter gatherers,
the corn and the ACI.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,680
We see that in broad outline.
They're pretty similar.

37
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,680
We start reproducing a little bit later,

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,230
but we stopped reproducing
it about the same age,

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,770
about 45 to 50 however,

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,770
when we look at the survival curves,
in this case for the Kong and for the ACI,

41
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,600
the survival is in red.
The reproduction is in blue.

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
What we see is that in cases there are
several decades of survival after less

43
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:03,991
reproduction,

44
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:08,860
so this is menopause kicking in
at the end of reproductive life,

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,820
but with a couple of decades of life
potential life lift. After that,

46
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,990
this means that we compare
humans to chimpanzee patterns.

47
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:21,280
Menopause results from an evolve
change in survival, not fertility.

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,690
There were five hypotheses
for this mother, grandmother,
reproductive conflict,

49
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:32,610
byproduct. In self domestication,
we'll start with the mother hypothesis.

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,173
It

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,260
posits that menopause evolved is part of
the terminal reproductive investment of

52
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:46,460
mothers to ensure that children would
not be endangered by the increasing risk

53
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:51,230
with age that the mother has of dying
while giving birth. In other words,

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,920
make sure that the mother survives
to take care of her last child.

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,180
Okay.

56
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,380
It makes some sense,

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,440
but it's also clear that mothers now
survive longer than their parental care

58
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,584
would be needed,

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,460
and theoretical models indicate that the
effects of maternal mortality are not

60
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:13,410
large enough to make this
a standalone explanation,

61
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,000
so it might have an element of
truth to it, but it's insufficient.

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,093
Yeah.

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,790
The grandmother hypothesis
is that menopause evolve
to reduce the increasingly

64
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,480
compromised reproduction of grandmothers
so that they could gain more fitness by

65
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,730
helping their offspring
raised their grandchildren.

66
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,240
Okay.

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
So this is an intergenerational transfer
from the old to the young and that

68
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:43,860
could support selection to extend
the post reproductive period. So the,

69
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,870
the idea here is that survival actually
evolve to be longer in order to allow

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,630
grandparents to take
care of grandchildren.

71
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,400
Yeah.

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,780
Evidence on this is mixed.

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,250
Sometimes the presence of grandmothers
improves the survival of grandchildren in

74
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,780
some societies that does not.

75
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,240
The third idea that's out there is
the reproductive conflict hypothesis.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,020
And this is couched in
terms of kin selection,

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,150
mothers in law or more related to their
own offspring oh 0.5 than to those of

78
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:22,151
their daughters in law oh 0.25 whereas
daughters in law or unrelated to their

79
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,960
mother-in-law's offspring
zero relationship and are
more related to their own

80
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,943
whole 0.5.

81
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,970
So daughters in law would be under greater
selection to when a conflict over any

82
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,740
resource used in reproduction that
could select against Rick continued

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,950
reproduction in older women
in a small scale society.

84
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,693
Yeah.

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,750
The biproduct hypothesis says that
menopause didn't evolve itself.

86
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,090
It is the byproduct of selection
for quality control of o sites.

87
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,030
So if you have high quality
control early in life,

88
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,060
it's screening out lot of ohs sides
and producing high quality offspring.

89
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,640
If their fitness outweighs what you might
gain from having more offspring late

90
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,880
in life who might be of lower quality
because the screen wasn't as good,

91
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,550
then menopause could
evolve as a byproduct.

92
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,470
This effect would be stronger if the
aging of the quality control filters means

93
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:31,220
that offspring born later or more likely
to be defective. In fact, they are.

94
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,083
We know that

95
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,790
the idea here is that menopause occurs
when women run out of Oh sides and they

96
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,840
run out of those sites because they're
discarding defective ones for quality

97
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,674
control.

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,270
Now the self domestication hypothesis
has elements of both the grandmother

99
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,060
hypothesis and the quality
control if offices.

100
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,020
It posits that post reproductive life
resulted from improvements in survival

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,160
caused by soulfulness social cooperation
and the agricultural revolutions.

102
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:08,120
So that's when we domesticate it
ourselves once it then existed.

103
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,930
So once there was a post
reproductive survival,

104
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,480
it's existence made possible selection
then to modify the behavior of those post

105
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:22,250
reproductive individuals to help
grandchildren if they were around and they

106
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:26,480
could be made useful by changing their
behavior a little bit then and that

107
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:30,410
improved fitness and got more
genes into future generations,

108
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,700
then that would be operated on.

109
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,140
So the idea here is that post reproductive
life came first as a consequence of

110
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:42,050
culture and then grand
parental behavior was selected.

111
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,410
So that combines the
grandmother hypothesis and the
quality control hypothesis.

112
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,610
These five hypotheses are
not mutually exclusive.

113
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,460
So to summarize on menopause,

114
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,210
it probably evolved for a combination
of reasons that include these,

115
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,280
the mother hypothesis.

116
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,220
Mothers need to survive long
enough to care for the last child,

117
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,020
the grandmother hypothesis.

118
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,430
There comes a point in aging females at
which they can get more out of helping

119
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:13,800
their daughters than out
of reproducing themselves.

120
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,220
The reproductive conflict hypothesis,

121
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,790
the daughters in law or less closely
related to their mother-in-law's offspring

122
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,300
than they are to their own and should be
more strongly selected to win conflicts

123
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:28,560
over resources.
The quality control hypothesis,

124
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:32,490
which is that menopause is a byproduct
of quality control for Gametes.

125
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,720
That,

126
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,720
and it occurs when women run out of
oocytes and the self domestication

127
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:39,781
hypothesis,

128
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:44,781
which is that the first post reproductive
life appeared when cultural evolution

129
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:49,680
improved survival, and then selection
shaped grand parental behavior.
