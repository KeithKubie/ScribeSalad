00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.560
Throughout history and across all
cultures, whether it's a tribal ritual

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.730
the two-step or "twerking" we all have a
personal way of expressing ourselves on

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.719
the dance floor, or at home in front of
the mirror. And well some of us are seemingly a

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.969
lot better than others, the question
remains; are these expressions actually

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.869
individual or part of an imbedded human code? Why are we so drawn to dance and

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.060
it it really equivalent to a human meeting
call?  More importantly does dancing

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.720
increase your potential to "get some"?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.000
From a viewers perspective dance can be
pleasurable to watch for many of the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.170
same reasons music is enjoyable to
listen to. But it was the science legend

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.550
Charles Darwin who first suggested that
dance could be part of mating rituals and entangled

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.030
with the evolution and survival
of our species.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.720
But if this is true the ability to dance
must somehow relate to the ability to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.520
survive and reproduce,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.070
so does it?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.800
It turns out that early humans who were
co-ordinated, symmetrical and rhythmic

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.120
were seen as more viable to a mate
because these traits were often linked to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.110
survival.  The ability to run faster,
defend against prey and ultimately survive.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.860
And dancing just happens to be an
outward manifestation and display of

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.050
many of these qualities.  A quick external
way of documenting and proving your

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.890
fitness in order to attract to mate.  This
desire to dance can even be seen in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
babies as early as five months old bopping
to a beat, in fact many species use

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.800
dance or movement to swoon the opposite
sex.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.820
From spiders to a variety of birds

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.980
and even bees which use dance moves to
communicate entire messages.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.830
But why are humans compelled to dance to
music?  It likely has something to do with

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.310
the fact that many of the brains reward systems are directly connected to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.850
the motor areas.  For example, music
stimulates the cerebellum at the base of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.930
the brain which is involved in the timing
and coordination of movement.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240
In a contemporary sense, dance is known
to show confidence and fearlessness, and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.259
sometimes intoxication.  But most
importantly, movements associated with

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.039
good dancing are indicative of good
health and reproductive potential.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.279
And in many cases, the human courtship
ritual in our natural habitat of a

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.869
nightclub mirrors that of animals in the
wild.  This gives

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.399
"being an animal on the dance-floor" a
new meaning, except are liquid courage

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.250
doesn't come from the local water hole.
Ironically many men feel as though they

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.700
can't dance or that dancing isn't for
them.  But in most animals the males must

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.950
impress the female.  So what is a good
dancing then?  Scientists have actually studied

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.959
which male dance movements were most
attractive to women.  Interestingly, it was

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.200
seen that twisting, bending and fluid
movements of the core body region (like

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.299
the torso neck and head) garnered the
most positive attention from women.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.599
Showing variability, flexibility and
creativity

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.159
was perceived as good dancing.  On the
other hand, repetitive rigid and twitchy

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.989
movements were not particularly attractive.
Sometimes called "dad dancing".  And

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.459
truthfully, your dad probably dances a
little slower and more rigid than his

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.449
youthful counterpart because, simply put,
he isn't as youthful or fit anymore.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.829
So whether you're in a club, a bar, you're own living room, engage and embrace your

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.680
animal instincts.  And if you are asked where you got those moves, just say millions of years of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.259
evolution have led to this dance baby.
Who knew science could be so groovy?
