00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
issue oriented and and I think we've
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.279
issue oriented and and I think we've
certainly gone in that direction at the

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289
certainly gone in that direction at the
 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.510
certainly gone in that direction at the
Late Show and so that's the evolution of

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520
Late Show and so that's the evolution of
 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.180
Late Show and so that's the evolution of
that now I think that if i was to

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190
that now I think that if i was to
 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.240
that now I think that if i was to
predict and believe me I'm always wrong

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250
predict and believe me I'm always wrong
 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.089
predict and believe me I'm always wrong
so put your money elsewhere I think

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099
so put your money elsewhere I think
 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.430
so put your money elsewhere I think
we're going to reach a critical mass

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440
we're going to reach a critical mass
 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.219
we're going to reach a critical mass
with the the topicality thing and people

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229
with the the topicality thing and people
 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.730
with the the topicality thing and people
getting their news because I think it's

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740
getting their news because I think it's
 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.170
getting their news because I think it's
going to get a little too partisan and I

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180
going to get a little too partisan and I
 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.260
going to get a little too partisan and I
think that late night shows are going to

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270
think that late night shows are going to
 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.590
think that late night shows are going to
be put in

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600
be put in
 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.590
be put in
a situation that they shouldn't be put

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600
a situation that they shouldn't be put
 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.730
a situation that they shouldn't be put
in you know unbeknownst to them and I

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
in you know unbeknownst to them and I
 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.290
in you know unbeknownst to them and I
think it's probably going to go back to

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300
think it's probably going to go back to
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.390
think it's probably going to go back to
a little sillier and a little less

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400
a little sillier and a little less
 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.530
a little sillier and a little less
celebrity-driven and and and kind of

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540
celebrity-driven and and and kind of
 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.100
celebrity-driven and and and kind of
easier to take unless fo serious you

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110
