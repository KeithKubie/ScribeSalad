CHRIS PELICANO: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.360
My name is Chris Pelicano.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.010
I'm the security engineering
manager here at Google.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.167
Very briefly, I will introduce
our guest this afternoon.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.724
He's a blogger.

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.835
Most of you know him
from schneier.com.

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.680
He's an author.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.110
Many works including "Liars and
Outliers," which he'll be

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.858
talking about today.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.246
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bruce Schneier.

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:32.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.110
BRUCE SCHNEIER: If you put that
near me, there's feedback

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.320
and it's all bad.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.960
Hi, thanks.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.250
I'm actually not going to talk
about my book, because I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.080
figure if you want to hear about
it, you can read it.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.640
I'd rather talk about stuff that
I've been thinking about

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.050
since that.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.810
This is very much ideas in
progress, which makes it good

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.930
for a talk here.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.060
I'm always interested in
feedback and comments, and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.230
there will be time for that.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.860
What I want to talk about is
security and power because I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.060
think that is a lot of what's
interesting right now, and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.820
going on right now.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.720
So basically, technologies
are disruptive.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.130
They disrupt society by
disrupting power balances.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.890
And you can look at the history
of the plow, or the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.260
stirrup, or gun powder, the
printing press, telegraph,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.760
radio, airplane, container
shipping, disease resistant,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.450
drought resistant wheat and
see how those technologies

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.020
changed the balance of power.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.370
And there's a lot written
about this--

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.350
written as history.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.890
Harder is doing this
in the present--

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.290
which is really what I'm
thinking about--

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.030
on the internet.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.830
The internet is incredibly
disruptive.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.770
We've seen entire industries
disappear.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.470
We've seen entire industries
created.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.010
We've seen industries upended.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.300
We've seen the computer
industry, itself, upended

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.680
several times.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.510
Government has changed a lot.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.990
We see governments losing power
as citizens organize.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.360
We're seeing political movements
become easier.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.550
We're seeing totalitarian
states use power.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.130
Really, the Obama campaign was
revolutionary in how they used

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.540
the internet to organize
and engage people.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.760
You could look at how technology
has changed the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.490
media, ranging from the
24-hour news cycle, to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.860
bloggers, and citizen
journalism, and two-way

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.880
communications, and the acute
explosion of media sources,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.000
social power-- there's
a lot here--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.480
personal publishing,
the internet

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.890
email, criminal power--

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.500
certain crimes becoming
easier--

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.090
identity theft, which is really
impersonation fraud

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.720
done to scale, and how the
internet has changed things.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.426
And I think about how this
affects computer security--

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:03.400
which is basically what I do--

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.540
and then, how that affects
the rest of the world.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.990
So traditionally, computer
security has had the model of

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.530
the user takes care of it.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.000
That's been the traditional
model.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.190
It's actually a very
strange model.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.680
We are selling products that
aren't secure, aren't any

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.170
good, and expect the user
to make them good.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.390
I think of it as an automobile
manufacturer, when they sell

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.440
you a car, saying, that car
doesn't come with breaks.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.306
But brakes are really important,
and we think you

00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:37.100
should have them.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.900
There's some good aftermarket
dealers.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.860
But you should get some break
installed pretty quickly,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.590
maybe on the drive home.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.820
It's a much safer
car that way.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.470
In a lot of ways, that's what
we would do with anti-virus,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.010
with firewalls.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.870
We would sell these products and
expect the user to do it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.690
themselves, to have some level
of expertise necessary to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.780
secure their environment.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.670
There's a lot of reasons
why we did this.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.320
It's the speed of
our industry.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.930
It's the youth of
our industry.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.820
But it was the norm.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.570
That model is breaking.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.040
That model is less becoming
the norm.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.260
It's changing, not because
we've realized there are

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.025
better ways to do security, but
because of how computers

00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:28.640
and the net are working today.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.120
There are two trends that, I
think, change this model.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.720
The first is cloud computing.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.290
Now on the one hand, cloud
computing isn't anything new.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.680
In the '60s, we called
it time sharing.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.800
In the '80s, we called
it client server.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.400
In the '90s--

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
I had a company-- we
called it managed

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.160
security or managed services.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.610
It's, fundamentally, a balance
between the cost of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.520
computation and the cost
of data transport.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.710
In the '60s, computation's very
expensive, so it makes

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.060
sense to centralize computers in
their own rooms with their

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.930
own air conditioning and
give people badges.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.740
In the '80s, what becomes
expensive is large storage, so

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.880
you end up with a client
server model.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.260
In the '90s, it's
more services.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.220
Right now, the cost of computing
is really dropping

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.010
towards free.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.350
The cost of transport is
dropping towards free.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.030
So what makes sense economically
is to put your

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.000
computers on the places on the
planet where they can be run

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.560
the most cheaply, and access
them from wherever you are.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.530
That seems to be the endgame.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.000
There's nothing cheaper
than free.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.110
The times where you see
computation pushed to the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.550
edges are places where you
have relatively low

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.990
bandwidth--

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.300
maybe mobile applications--

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.550
or relatively high
need for local

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.530
computation, like gaming.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.460
But even those are becoming
more of a cloud model.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.450
So that's the first trend.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.400
The second trend is locked
down endpoints.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.210
And I think this is more of a
trend in businesses than in

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.430
technology.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.600
But nowadays, the computing
platforms we buy, we have much

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.750
less control over.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.710
I have an iPhone.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.300
I can't clear my cookies
on an iPhone.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.150
I can't get a program
that does that.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.650
I can't even get a program that
erases files, because I

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.360
don't have direct control
over the memory map.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.845
There's weird things going
on in your system.

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:36.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.050
I'm trying to deal with it.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.620
BRUCE SCHNEIER: Wow.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.760
She's solving on her laptop.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.230
OK.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.572
All right, go.

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:44.822
MALE SPEAKER: Do you want
to borrow this?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.000
BRUCE SCHNEIER: So these end
user devices, whether they are

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.700
tablets, or phones, or Kindles,
the user has much

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.080
less control over.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.940
On a Kindle, updates are
downloaded automatically and I

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.780
can't even say yes.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.340
At least, on the iPhone,
I can say yes or no.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.030
But I still don't have anywhere
near the control I

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.230
have on my OSs.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.820
OSs are moving that
direction as well.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.780
Both Windows 8 and Mountain
Lion are moving to the

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.990
direction of these mobile
platforms, to give the user

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.640
less control.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640
And I think this is just
purely economics.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.220
The companies have realized that
the more they can control

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.860
the supply chain, the
better they'll do.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.660
So whether it's Apple, with
their Apple store--

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.702
however the system works, you're
just better off if you

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:41.840
can control as much of the
environment as possible.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.210
So this brings us to a new
model of security.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.720
And the model is someone
else takes care of it.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.300
The model is it just happens
automatically, by magic.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.940
This happens on my
Gmail account.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.700
I have no control over
Gmail security.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.510
I have to simply trust
that Google does it.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.300
I have no control over my
pictures on Flickr, or my

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.320
Facebook account, any
of that stuff.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.290
And I have less and less control
over the devices where

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.540
I view these things.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.065
So users have to trust vendors
to a degree we hadn't, before.

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:25.480
There are a lot of good reasons
why we do this.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.280
All the reasons why these
models make sense--

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.059
convenience, redundancy,
automation, the ability to

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.820
share things.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.900
And the trust can be
surprisingly complete.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.590
We're living in a world where
Facebook mediates all of our

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.840
friend interactions.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.120
Already, Google knows more about
my interests than my

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.320
wife does, which is a
little bit freaky.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.510
Google knows what kind of porn
every American likes, which is

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.760
really freaky.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.550
But it's a trade off.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.880
It's a trade off we actually
do pretty willingly.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.140
We give up some control in
exchange for the environment

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.130
that works well for us.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.020
And we trust that the vendors
will treat us well, and

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.860
protect us from harm.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.280
On the other hand, we're running
out of other options.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.940
For most everybody, there
aren't any real, viable

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.370
alternatives.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.770
I run Eudora, but I'm,
increasingly, a freak.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.690
My mother has a way better time
on her computer since she

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.380
got an Apple and has Apple
handling every part of her

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.400
computing environment.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.250
She loses a phone, she
gets a new one.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.300
It just works great.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.080
And most of us can't
do it ourselves.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.470
This is becoming more
and more complex.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.040
I can't offer advice to
tell people to run

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.470
their own mail servers.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.100
That didn't make sense
20 years ago.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.615
It really doesn't
make sense now.

00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:05.180
And you can't run your
own Facebook.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.500
So the model I think of when
I think of this type of

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.230
computing environment
is feudal security--

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:17.400
and that's "feudal" with a "d,"
and not with a "t." It's

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.850
that we, as users, have to
pledge our allegiance to some

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:27.180
powerful company who, in turn,
promises to protect us.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.870
And I like it as a metaphor both
because there's a real,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.610
rich historical metaphor, and
because everyone's watching

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:40.650
"Game of Thrones." So you can
pull from both sources.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.250
And if you go back to classic,
medieval feudalism, it was a

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.080
system designed for a dangerous
environment where

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.620
you needed someone more
powerful than

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.080
you to protect you.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.970
It was a series of hierarchical
relationships.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.960
There were obligations
in both directions.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.740
It was actually a pretty complex
political system.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.620
And I see more of it permeating
the environment

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.630
that we work in today.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.750
It has its advantages.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.390
For most people, the cloud
providers are better at

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.420
security than they are.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.750
Automatic cloud backup
is fantastic.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.520
Automatic updates
is fantastic.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.350
All these things are good.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.920
So feudal security provides this
level of security that

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.010
most everybody is below.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.460
So it will raise them up to
whatever level the providers

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.990
are providing.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.410
For those up here, it
lowers them down.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:43.090
And where you see barriers to
people adopting this are

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.350
things like the banks, who,
naturally, have a higher level

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.570
of security, and don't
want to go down.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.990
I assume that at some point, we
are going to see a business

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.950
model of a high security
cloud vendor--

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.460
whether it's a Dropbox
or an email service--

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.810
just something for some
of these more

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.185
high assurance users.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.180
We also have the problem
of regulation.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.270
For a lot of companies, they
have auditing reporting

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.250
requirements.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:22.500
And if you go to Dropbox and
say, we're using you for our

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.880
company, we need to audit your
system, they will say, go

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.820
away, or to Rackspace.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.910
I assume we're going to see
some water flow auditing

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.530
model, where the Rackspace audit
flows down to whatever

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.190
service works on top of that,
which flows down to whatever

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.965
company now uses that service.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:45.010
Because I think we
have to solve the

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.820
regulatory barriers, here.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.710
Feudal security has risks.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.020
The vendors are going to act
in their self interest.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.800
You hope that their self
interest dovetails with your

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.900
self interest, but that's
not always the case.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.580
It's much less the case when
you're not paying for the

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.850
service, when, in fact, you are
a user, not a customer.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.770
As we see, vendors will make
side deals with the

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.850
government.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.610
And the legal regime
is different.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.710
If the data is in your
premises, then

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.650
it's in their premises.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.080
Vendors can act arbitrarily.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.680
Vendors can make mistakes.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.670
And vendors have an incentive
to keep users tied to

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.070
themselves.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.610
You guys are an exception by
allowing users to take their

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.940
data and leave.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.950
Most companies don't do that.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.050
Because tying the data to the
company increases lock in,

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.150
increases the value
of the company.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.550
So this model is inherently
based on trust.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.370
It's inherently based
on the companies--

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.700
the feudal lords--

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.830
convincing the users to trust
them with their data, their

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.100
photos, their friends--
with everything.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.170
And unfortunately, the business
model for a lot of

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.290
these companies is basically
betraying

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.610
that trust for profit.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.540
And that is, depending on which
company, more or less

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.430
transparent, more
or less salient.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.520
A lot of effort does go into
hiding that fact, to

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.790
pretending it's not true.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.270
And as it turned out, these
companies have a side business

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.830
betraying the trust to
the government, too.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.740
So there is a little bit, or
in some cases, a lot, of

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.550
deceit that this is
all based on.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:54.280
And I do worry about how
long that can sustain.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.340
Some of it, it seems to be
able to be sustained

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.330
indefinitely.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.570
For others, I'm not so sure.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.770
The feudal model is also
inherently based on power.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.840
And that's what I'm thinking
is interesting, right now.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.850
And it does dovetail very
nicely with the current

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.850
alignment of power
on the internet--

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:20.020
the rise of the controlled
endpoints, and the third party

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.140
holding your data--

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.580
those two different polls.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.600
So I started the talk by
mentioning about the internet

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.840
changing power.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.960
And if you look back at history
of the internet, a lot

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.225
of us thought that it would flow
in a certain direction.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.710
The internet was really designed
in the way that made

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.270
most technical sense.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.530
There wasn't a lot of agenda
placed on the net, as it was

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.980
first designed.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.580
And if you look back at the
literature around that time,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.080
you read about the natural laws
of the internet, that the

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.460
internet works a certain way
because it's like gravity.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.300
It's just the way
it has to work.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.360
It's the way that makes sense.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.050
And a lot of us thought this was
inevitable, this was the

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.230
way the world had to work.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.890
I have two quotes.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.310
One is John Perry Barlow.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.360
In 1996, he's addressing the
World Economic Forum.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.370
And he has something called
"The Declaration of

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.500
Independence of Cyberspace,"
which is a

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.300
great document to read.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.540
And he's telling governments
things like, "You have no

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.460
moral right to rule us, nor do
you possess any methods of

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.910
enforcement we have reason to
fear." Three years earlier,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.440
John Gilmore writes that, "The
internet interprets censorship

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.450
as damage, and routes
around it."

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.180
These are very Utopian
quotes, but we all

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.530
believed them back then.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.630
We believed that is how the
internet works, that the

00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:01.700
internet takes the masses, makes
them powerful, takes the

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.505
governments and makes
them powerless.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.470
It turns out, that's
just not true.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.089
That's not the way it works.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.859
What the internet
does, like many

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.660
technologies, is magnify power.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.089
It magnifies power,
in general.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.800
And what happened is, when the
powerless discovered the

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.974
internet, suddenly
they had power.

00:17:31.974 --> 00:17:34.980
The hackers, the dissidents,
the criminals, the

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.080
disenfranchised--

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.640
as those marginal groups
discovered the net, suddenly,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.470
they had power they didn't
have before.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.550
And the change was fast,
and it was stark.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.820
But when powerful interests
realized the potential of the

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.120
internet, they had more
power to magnify.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.250
They were much slower, but
their ability to use the

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.240
internet to increase their
power is greater.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.030
The unorganized were more nimble
and quick, and the

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.290
institutions were slower
and more effective.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.580
And that's where we are today.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.380
So I look around and I
see four classes of

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.660
internet tools of power.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.010
And what's interesting about
them is they all are tools by

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.000
which a totalitarian government
can increase their

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.880
power, but they all have viable

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.570
market reasons for existing.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.620
So censorship is also a content
filtering, or data

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.220
loss prevention.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.180
Propaganda is marketing.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.180
Surveillance is surveillance.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.630
I guess, personal
data collecting.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.620
Surveillance is the business
model the internet.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.200
Use control--

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.100
in China, programs have to be
certified by the government in

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.930
order to be used on computers
there, which sounds an awful

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.180
lot like the Apple store.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.080
I mean we laugh, but
this is important.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.570
We're building tools that have
very different sorts of uses

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.580
depending on who's using
them, and why.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.820
And in both the government and
the corporate sphere, powerful

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.880
interests are gaining power
with these tools.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.580
Censorship and surveillance
are both on the rise.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.920
The internet censorship
project, which tracks

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.270
censorship around the world,
finds more of it every year.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.460
We see more surveillance by
governments every year, even

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.940
before the United States stuff
that happened two weeks ago.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.920
More personal data is being
collected and correlated.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.470
More control over our hardware
and software.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.230
Less purchasing, more
licensing--

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.430
we saw Adobe move
to that model.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.100
This is getting harder.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.830
I'm trying to find a taskless
productivity tool, and I can't

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.490
find a good one that doesn't
require me to use the cloud.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.340
And we have corporations--

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.280
I think Facebook is one
interesting example--

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.280
that are actually changing
social norms.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:29.530
They are affecting what people
think is normal, is regular,

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.110
for a profit motive.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.270
I think propaganda is something
we don't talk about

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.450
a lot, but it's both in
companies and governments.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.120
I mean we might call it viral
marketing, and there are some

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.400
cute names for it, but
basically, it's propaganda.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.350
And we're seeing more
and more of it.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.100
And now, we're at the point
where power basically controls

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.830
everyone's data.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.736
Because in a lot of ways,
personal data equals power,

00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:01.880
both on the government side
and the corporate side.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.630
Even in non-internet businesses,
the need to own

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.260
the relationship, to know more
about the customer, is driving

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.355
a lot of data collection, and
all that back end correlation.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.710
And I worry a lot about the
commingling of corporate and

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.960
government interests here.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.630
We live in a world--

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.350
I don't have to go through the
details-- of ubiquitous

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.610
surveillance.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.580
Basically, everything
is collected.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.870
Charlie Strauss has written
about this as the end of

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.560
pre-history, that sometime in
our lifetime we're going to

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.700
switch from pre-history, where
only some things were saved,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.850
to actual history, where
everything is saved.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.442
Now, we're in a world where
most everything is saved.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.960
And what's happening now-- and I
think it's something I'm not

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.850
happy about, but try
to understand--

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.680
is how powerful interests are
trying to steer this.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.040
I mentioned Facebook changing
social norms.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.470
But we're seeing industries
lobbying for laws to make

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.950
their business models
more profitable.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.100
So that's laws to prevent
digital copying, laws to

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.380
reduce privacy, laws allowing
different businesses to

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.240
control bandwidth.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.220
And on the government side,
we're seeing international

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:34.380
bodies trying to get rulings to
make the internet easier to

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.150
surveil, and to sensor.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:40.240
I've heard this called "cyber
nationalism." And last

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.655
November in Dubai, there was a
meeting of the ITU-- that's

00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:45.470
the International
Telecommunications Union.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.470
Those are the guys that
run the phone system.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.910
They're not really very tech
savvy, but they are very

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.570
international.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.110
They are very non-US centric.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:01.670
And they want to wrest control
of the internet from the US.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.760
For a lot of reasons, I think
this would be a disaster.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.320
But there's a strong push.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.470
And unfortunately--

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.760
I wrote this in my
blog, today--

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.740
I think all the Snowden
documents make their case a

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.530
lot easier.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.220
Because now, when they say,
well you can't trust the

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.650
Americans, everyone will say,
oh yeah, you're right.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.900
You can't trust the Americans.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.320
So these things are
happening now.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.880
We're seeing a large rise in the
increase of militarization

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.550
of cyberspace, which will push
more of the internet under

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.210
government control.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.040
I very much believe we are
in the middle of a

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.400
cyber war arms race.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.880
And it's heated up a
little bit in the

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.590
past couple of weeks.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.590
Because we've been complaining
about China for

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.140
the past few years.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.660
I've always assumed we've
been giving as

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.350
good as we're getting.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.290
And now, we're getting data that
we are giving as good as

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.790
we're getting, which is just
going to make things worse.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:02.120
We're pretty sure that the cyber
attack against the Saudi

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.350
oil company Aramco was
launched by Iran in

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.280
retaliation for Stuxnet, which
sounds complicated.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.640
But I don't know geopolitics.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.890
Maybe that makes sense.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.880
And we're seeing a lot of
alignment of corporate and

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.130
government power.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.270
I'm pretty sure I'm quoted in
"The New York Times," today,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.930
as calling Facebook "the NSA's
wet dream." I'm surprised I

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.800
used those words.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.050
It was probably a
long interview.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.890
So here's a way to
think of it.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.080
In our country, we have two
different types of law.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.630
There's constitutional law,
that regulates what

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:54.000
governments do, and there's
regulatory law, that

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.200
constrains what corporations
so.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.250
And they're kind of separate.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.710
We're now living in a world
where each group has learned

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:07.440
to use the other's law to get
around its own restrictions.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.690
If the government said, you
all have to carry tracking

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:15.870
devices 24/7, that would
be unconstitutional.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.260
They could never get
away with it.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.810
Yet, we all carry cell phones.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.360
If they all said, you must
register whenever you meet a

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.110
new friend, we'd
never allow it.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.360
Yet, we all go on Facebook.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.360
And actually, I played
this earlier.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.500
Two years ago, "The Onion"
did a video.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.980
Just go to YouTube and type "the
onion facebook cia." It's

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.750
a short news video
about Facebook

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.140
being the new CIA program.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.040
It's hysterical.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.370
And is two years old, which
makes it kind of sad.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.420
On the other hand, we're seeing
corporations use the

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.620
governments to enforce their
business models.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.940
If, I don't know, the movie
industry said that we're going

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.580
to go into people's computers
that trash them if we think

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.160
they're copying files,
that would be wrong.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.670
But they're going to
try to get a law

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.590
to do the same thing.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:18.380
Copyright--

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.980
a lot of examples where
industries are bypassing their

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.405
own problems by going
through government.

00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:30.090
And I think this only gets
exacerbated as there's more

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.770
technology.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.330
Feudal lords get
more powerful.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.830
And some of that is just the
natural order of bigness in

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.810
our society right now.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.050
The way technology is right
now, it favors the big.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.602
It doesn't favor many small.

00:26:45.602 --> 00:26:47.990
It favors two or three on
top and nobody else.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.790
And it's true in geopolitics,
too.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.200
Think about it.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.412
In any climate change
negotiation on the planet, who

00:26:59.412 --> 00:27:00.200
do you think has more power--

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.910
Exxon or Bolivia?

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.720
It's not even close.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.230
Who has more power--

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.230
Exxon or the United States?

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.780
That's actually a discussion.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.030
This is weird.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.010
So that's one trajectory.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.300
There's another trajectory.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.570
There's a counterbalancing
one, based on different

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.850
natural laws of technology.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.660
So in the book I'm not talking
about, "Liars and Outliers," I

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.760
discuss something called
a security gap.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.510
And in that book, I'm talking
about, effectively, the arms

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.720
race between attackers and
defenders, and that technology

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.140
causes disruptions in that arms
race, and then, there's a

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.560
rebalancing.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.970
So firearms are invented,
fingerprint

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.200
technologies are invented.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.330
All those things upset
the balance between

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.580
attackers and defenders.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.380
And one of things I point out
is that, as technology

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.540
advances, attackers have
a natural advantage.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.920
Some of it's a basic first
mover advantage.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:14.450
But in general, unorganized
attackers can make use of

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.500
innovations faster.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.410
So imagine someone invents
the motor car.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.930
And the police say,
well that's a

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:23.820
really interesting thing.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.290
We could use one of those.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.080
So they have a group to study
the automobile, and they

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.440
produce an RFP, and they get
bids, and they pick an

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.410
automobile manufacturer, they
get a car, they have a

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.680
training system.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.620
Meanwhile, the burglar says,
oh look, a new getaway

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.560
vehicle, and can, much more
quickly, use that.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.130
We saw that on the internet.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.960
And if you remember, as soon
as the internet became a

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.180
commercial entity, we saw a new
breed of cyber criminal

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.380
appear organically, out of the
ground, immediately able to

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.870
commit crimes, and fraud,
and identity theft.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.320
All of these new things
just showed up.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.070
Meanwhile, the police, who
were trained on Agatha

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:04.110
Christie novels, took, what,
10 years to figure it out.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.490
And they have figured it out.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.790
But if you were around during
that time, it was really

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:14.090
painful, as they had no
idea what cyber crime

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.050
was, or how it worked.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.690
So there's this delay when
a new technology appears.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.220
And that's what I think
of as a security gap--

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.045
the delay between when the
non-powerful can make use of

00:29:30.045 --> 00:29:31.550
the new technology--

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.410
the fast and nimble--

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.950
and when the powerful, the big
and ponderous, can make use of

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.130
the technology.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.950
And that gap gives attackers
a natural advantage.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.030
And I'll spare you the details,
but basically, that

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.790
gap tends to be greater when
there's more technology--

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.780
when your curve is greater.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.930
And it's greater in times
of rapid technological--

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.070
actually, it's greater in times
of rapid social change

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.320
due to technological change.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.920
And today, we're living in a
world with more technology

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:13.800
than ever before, and greater
ramp of social change, due to

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.430
technological change,
than ever before.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.030
So we're seeing an ever
increasing security gap.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.930
So this is the big question
that I do not

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.700
have an answer to--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.410
who wins?

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.060
Who wins, and in what
circumstance?

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.310
Does big, slow power beat
small, nimble power?

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.440
And there's going to be some
David and Goliath metaphor, or

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.090
Robin Hood and sheriff.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.370
I guess I'm going to need a
more medieval metaphor.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:52.310
But that seems like an open
question that we don't know.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.660
So for example, in Syria,
recently, we saw the Syrian

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.940
dissidents use Facebook
to organize.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.730
We saw the Syrian government
use Facebook to arrest

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.490
dissidents.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.230
So right now, it's
kind of a mess.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.610
As this shakes out, who
gets the upper hand?

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.320
Right now, it seems like
governments do.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:23.520
It seems like the ability to
collect, to analyze, to employ

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.600
police beats dissidents.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.970
It seems like the big
corporations win.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:36.100
That the need to have a credit
card, or be on Facebook, and

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.110
to do all these things to live
your life are such that you

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.880
can't shut them off.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.340
And they win.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.240
But it's not clear to me.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.610
It does seem clear to me that
those that want to get around

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.040
the systems always
will be able to.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.850
But really, I'm now concerned
about everyone in the middle.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.830
The nimble are here.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.400
The powerful are here.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.530
Here's the rest of us,
which, I guess,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.780
is the hapless peasants.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.480
And as the powerful get more
control, I think we get

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.160
largely left out of
any negotiations.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.610
And you see this in arbitrary
rules, in

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.870
arbitrary terms of service.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:22.910
You see this in secret NSA
spying programs, or secret

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:27.910
overrides to rules, and power
aligning with power.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.090
It's not clear to me that
these actually do catch

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.190
terrorists.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.050
It's pretty clear to me that
they don't, actually.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.610
But they do affect
the rest of us.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.980
And I think these power issues
are going to affect all of the

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.070
discussions we have about the
future of the internet in the

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.700
coming decade.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.140
Because these are actually
complex issues.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.710
We have to decide how we balance
personal privacy

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.990
against law enforcement.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.050
How do we balance them when
we want to prevent copy

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.760
protection, or prevent
child pornography?

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.340
When we decide, is it acceptable
for us to be judged

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.590
by computer algorithms.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.210
Is it acceptable to feed
us search results?

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.290
To loan us money for a house?

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:23.630
To search us at airports?

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:27.720
To convict us of
drunk driving?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.110
How do these algorithms
affect us?

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.250
Do we have the right to correct
data about ourselves,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.490
or to delete it?

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.960
Do we want computers
to forget?

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.780
There's a lot of social
lubricant in our society by

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.765
the fact that we are a
forgetting species.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.530
Do you really want--

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.550
I mean, I don't want Google
Glass because I don't my wife

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:56.050
to be able to pull
up old arguments.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.300
That seems bad.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.140
There's a lot of power
struggles.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.660
And there are bigger
ones coming.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.659
Cory Doctorow writes about the
coming battles having to do

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.830
with 3D printing.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.100
And they're very much the same
as the copyright battles.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.820
There will be powerful interests
that want to stop

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.730
the execution of certain
data files.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.159
It was music and movies.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.219
In the future, it will
be working guns.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.050
It will be the Nike swoosh.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.080
His favorite example is
anatomically correct,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.170
interchangeable Barbie torsos,
which I never thought of, but

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:47.830
would freak out Mattel,
probably, rightly so.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:52.310
Or little statues of Mickey
Mouse, which will freak out a

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.560
very powerful company.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.050
RECORDED VOICE: Of
Mickey Mouse

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.300
BRUCE SCHNEIER: Who is that?

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.290
We see some incredibly
destabilizing

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.170
technologies coming.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.170
And this whole debate on weapons
of mass destruction--

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.400
nuclear, chemical,
biological--

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:22.960
the idea is that, as technology
magnifies power,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.970
society can deal with
fewer bad events.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.940
So if the average bad guy--

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.960
I'm just going to make this up--
can kill 10 people before

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.010
he's captured, or rob 10 houses
before he's captured,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.160
we could handle so
many robbers.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.180
But if they can now do 100 times
as much damage, we now

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.100
need only 1/100 of them
to maintain the

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.850
same security level.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.180
A lot of our security is
based on having some

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.640
low level of badness.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.520
But as power magnifies the
amount of badness each

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.810
individual can do, you suddenly
start needing much

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.650
more control.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.530
I'm not even convinced
that that will work.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.010
But that's going to
be a huge debate.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.260
And that's going to
push fear buttons.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.675
Today, largely, the powerful
are winning these debates.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.870
And I worry that these
are actually

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.170
very complicated issues.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.490
They required meaningful
debate, international

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:31.230
cooperation, innovative
solutions, which doesn't sound

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.895
like I just described
the US government.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.710
But we're going to
have to do this.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.460
In a lot of ways, the internet
is a fortuitous accident.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.150
It is a combination of lack
of commercial interests,

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.080
government benign neglect,
some military core

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.730
requirements for survivability
and resilience, and computer

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.060
engineers with vaguely
libertarian leanings, doing

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.000
what made technical sense.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.560
That was, kind of, the
stew of the internet.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.290
And that stew is gone.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.250
There are policy battles going
on, right now, over the future

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.100
of the internet, in legislatures
around the world,

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:18.330
in international standards
bodies, in international

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.580
organizations.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.930
And I'm not sure how this is
all going to play out.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:32.610
But I have some suggestions
for different people.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.820
For researchers, I want to see a
lot more research into these

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.700
technologies of social
control--

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.790
surveillance, censorship,
propaganda, and use control.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.140
And especially for you guys at
Google, you're in a unique

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.650
position to study propaganda.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.880
There is very little work being
done on recognizing

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.850
propaganda.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.310
And what I want is for my
internet to come with all

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.230
propaganda with a little yellow
box, kind of like what

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.360
you do on your search pages.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.310
My paid commercial is
flagged as such.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.760
I would like to be done
automatically.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.210
This seems vaguely impossible,
but I think we need to start

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:12.900
thinking about it.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.510
There is some research done
around the edges.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.890
There's research done in
recognizing fake Yelp reviews,

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.310
recognizing fake
Amazon reviews.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.730
But there's, right now,
questions whether trending

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:32.370
topics on Twitter
is being gamed.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.630
So when we're losing this
transparency, there's a lot of

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:40.470
questions about the information
we get.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.960
But I think we need research.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.130
Because those four
things are going

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.830
to become very important.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.850
And understanding how they work,
and how to get around

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.450
them, is going to become
very important.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.690
We need safe places to
anonymously publish.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:01.460
Wikileaks was great, but
now seems no more.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.150
Right now, the best thing we
have is something called

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.910
Strongbox, that "The New
Yorker" is running.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.880
I'm in the process of trying
to review that

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.780
system right now.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:15.870
I think we need a lot more of
these, all around the world.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.540
We do need research into
use limitation.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.950
I believe we're going to get
legislation on, basically,

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.580
copy protection for digital
objects because of the 3D

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.410
printers, because of bio
printers, because of software

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.880
defined radio.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.800
And that's going to really
hurt our industry.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.770
Because lawmakers are not
going to get this right.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.840
They're going to do something
draconian, and

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.030
it's going to be ugly.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.500
So the better we can solve the
actual problems, the less

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.170
likely we are to be handed
solutions that won't work, and

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.420
will hurt everything else.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:01.820
To vendors, I want people to
remember that a lot of the

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.870
technologies we build have dual
use, that business and

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.950
military uses are basically
the same.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:13.070
So you see Blue Coat used to
censor the Syrian internet, or

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:18.030
Sophos used to eavesdrop on the
internet, or social media

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.590
enabling surveillance.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.690
On the one hand, the FBI is
trying to get laws passed to

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.900
have us put back doors in our
communication systems.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.880
On the other hand, we don't want
other countries to do the

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.210
same thing.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.460
This is hard.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.912
The policy prescriptions,
I think, are harder.

00:40:42.912 --> 00:40:45.810
I think in the near term, we
need to keep circumvention

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.130
legal, and keep net
neutrality.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:52.760
I think those two things give
us some backstop towards the

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.360
powerful becoming even
more powerful.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.810
Long term, fundamentally, we
have to recognize we can't

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:05.245
have it both ways, that if we
want privacy, we have to want

00:41:05.245 --> 00:41:08.020
it everywhere-- our country
and abroad.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.450
If we think that surveillance
is good, we have

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.340
to accept it elsewhere.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.400
Fundamentally, I want to
see power levelled.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.521
Because the relationship
is real unbalanced.

00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:25.670
If you think about historical
feudalism, or you read about

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.390
it, it eventually evolved into
a more balanced government

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.730
relationship.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:35.320
So you had feudalism, which
started out as this bilateral

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.890
agreement--

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.980
we're in a dangerous world.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.800
I need you to protect me.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.950
So I will pledge my allegiance
to you--

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.630
turned into something
very unbalanced--

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.520
I'm powerful.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.540
I can do whatever I want.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.940
I will ignore my agreements.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.690
You're powerless.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.780
You can't do anything.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:57.130
And that eventually changed with
the rise of the nation

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:05.560
state, with, basically, rules
that gave the feudal lords

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.160
responsibilities as well as
rights, culminating in

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.410
something like the
Magna Carta.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.380
And I think we're going to need
something like that on

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:22.320
the internet, with the current
set of powers on the internet,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.990
which will be both government
and corporate--

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:29.240
some basic understanding that
there are rights and

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.660
responsibilities.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.415
There's some more balanced
relationship.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:38.010
And whether that's limitations
on what vendors can do with

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:44.050
our data, or some public
scrutiny for the rules by

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:48.750
which we are judged by
our data, I expect--

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.840
no time soon, but eventually--
these will come.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.890
Because I think this is
how we get liberty in

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.060
your internet world.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.340
And I think this is actually
a very long

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.900
and difficult battle.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.990
I think some of the results
will upend your company.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.280
But they might not be coming
for a decade or more.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.810
So that's what I
have prepared.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.070
I'm happy to take questions.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:23.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.980
BRUCE SCHNEIER: So there are
some rules about a microphone

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.870
that are confusing to me.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:30.790
AUDIENCE: You talked about a
game between governments, on

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.280
one hand, and corporations, on
the other, using each other's

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.030
power systems to essentially get
at everyone in the middle.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.370
How long do you think that
that game can play out?

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.650
Is it indefinite?

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.090
Can it continue for the
foreseeable future?

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:48.460
Or do you see some sort of
turning point in which some

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.350
scandal or something will so
threaten the middle as to

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.120
galvanize them?

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.050
BRUCE SCHNEIER: I don't know.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.980
And I think we're very much in
uncharted territory, here.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:01.180
We're living in a world where
it's very hard for the middle

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.460
to be galvanize, for lots
of different reasons.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.030
A lot of people have
written about this.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.910
I have trouble predicting the
future, because things are

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.490
changing so fast.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.960
Right now, it all seems quite
dysfunctional, and that

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.120
there's no mechanism for
things to change.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.740
But of course, that's
ridiculous.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.310
That things will change.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.640
Exactly how, I don't know.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.320
And which way they'll change,
I don't know.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.130
If the world is the terrorists
might have nukes, and we're

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.200
all going to die unless we live
under totalitarianism,

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.910
people are going
to accept that.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:36.870
Because when people
are scared, that's

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.750
what they'll accept.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.060
And technology is to the point
where that actually

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.210
might be the world.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.980
But there are a lot of other
ways this can play.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.690
I think this is, vaguely, the
topic of my next book, so I

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.190
hope to explore the different
avenues we

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.900
might move out of this.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.370
I haven't even begun to have an
idea of which is likely to

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:01.260
be correct.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.985
And I think I wouldn't trust
me when I've decided.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:10.710
Just read science fiction
20 years ago.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.860
We're really bad at predicting,
not technical

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.090
future, but social future.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.440
Everyone could predict
the automobile--

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.920
that it would make people
drive faster.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.810
But no one predicted
the suburb.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.640
It's always the second
order social effects.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.520
And that's what this
is all about.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.770
So I just don't know.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.580
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
convergence of power,

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.040
convergence of objectives,
for the corporations and

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.970
governments, and also, sort
of the convergence of

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.700
capabilities, like the
Exxon Mobil comment.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.830
Do you see anything along the
lines of the distinction

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.730
between them vanishing?

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:55.530
Corporations as states

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.140
BRUCE SCHNEIER: --I think they,
largely, are vanishing.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.890
And this is my main complaint
with libertarianism as a

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.600
philosophy.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.760
In the mid 1700s, it was great,
because it identified

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.470
the fact that power imbalance
is bad, and we need to

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.470
equalize power.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:11.340
But it kind of got stuck there,
and didn't notice that

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.320
power changed.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.550
I think there is a
lot of blurring.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.210
And some of it is the fact
that money controls

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.940
government.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.690
And powerful corporations
have the money.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.100
We have seen blurring at other
times in history--

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.760
the Dutch East India
Company in Africa.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.780
There are different examples
where corporations were de

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.930
facto governments in areas where
they were operating.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:40.680
This is not as stark.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.600
But power is changing.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.170
Power is less hard power.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:49.560
Power is more soft power,
to use Nye's term.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.390
That the nature of power
is changing, such--

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:55.650
so I do think there
is a blurring.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.970
But it's different than
we thought, when we

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.320
worried about this.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.110
The nature of social control is
very, very different now,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.070
than it was.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.890
The nature of surveillance
is very different.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.230
And it's going to
change again.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.730
What is the half-life of
these technologies?

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.350
10 years?

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.020
Five?

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.120
So what's going to happen in
five to 10 years that will be

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.230
completely different?

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.770
I don't know.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:31.200
AUDIENCE: I really liked your
feudalism analogy, and I see

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.820
one potential flaw in it.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.280
And I wanted your--

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:33.850
BRUCE SCHNEIER: Oh, good.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.380
Flaws are good.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:34.880
I love those.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.150
AUDIENCE: --thought about it.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.070
As I understand it, feudal
lords were pretty much

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:39.780
monopolists.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.330
Like, the Russian serfs were
bound to the land, and so they

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.970
didn't get a choice of which
Lord to be with.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.970
Whereas, people do, in fact,
have a choice when there's two

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.740
or three big guys, right?

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.360
BRUCE SCHNEIER: They
have a choice.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.800
But is it really a choice?

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.040
If all three cellphone companies
are collecting the

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.530
same data, and giving it to the
same government under the

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.910
same rules, it's not
really a choice.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.770
AUDIENCE: But if I can get a lot
more customers by having a

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.890
very clear privacy policy the
respects you in a way the

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:05.520
other guy doesn't, then--

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.590
BRUCE SCHNEIER: It seems
not to be true.

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.500
It seems you get more customers
by obfuscating your

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.600
privacy policy.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.080
And there are a lot of great
psych experiments about this,

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.530
that if you make privacy
salient by showing your

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:20.480
privacy policy, people will
say, whoa, that's bad.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.590
Facebook is a great example.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.550
They make the privacy policy
really hard to find.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:27.150
Because they don't want
you think about it.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:30.660
Because if you don't think
about it, you share.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.980
So this is the problem
with mini-big.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.300
Your normal market economics,
which involves multiple

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.040
sellers competing on features,
only works if you've got a lot

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.620
of sellers competing
on features.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.690
If the three companies that
do the same thing--

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.220
I mean, what's the difference
between Apple and Microsoft in

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.870
operating systems?

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:57.260
Is it really that different
where privacy matters?

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.500
Around the edges-- unless the
companies choose to compete on

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.540
those features--

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.410
I can't fly less secure airlines
where we'd get you

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.360
through air security quicker.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.100
There is no competition
in that.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.300
Or more secure airlines--
we do a

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.840
background check on everybody.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.500
It's a perfectly reasonable
feature to compete on, but

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.200
there isn't any competition.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.830
So especially if some of these
deal with government demands,

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.870
you're just not going to
have the competition.

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:31.680
And there's a lot a reason
to make that go

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.940
away as much as possible.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.540
Because these companies want
people to share more.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.630
[INAUDIBLE] land
is interesting.

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:43.000
No.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.040
Well, yes and no.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.280
It's very hard for someone
regular to leave Facebook.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.910
That's where your party
invites come from.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:51.970
That's where your friends are.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:55.640
That's where your social
interaction is.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.890
You don't go on Facebook, you
don't get invited to parties,

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.800
you never get laid, you have
a really sucky college

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.040
experience.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.360
So you're not bound.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.510
But there's a lot of social
push to stay.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.640
It's very hard to take your data
when you leave-- again,

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.210
Google is an exception, here.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.000
Remember the whole battles
about cellphone number

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.670
portability?

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.840
That was all to bind people to
the cellphone companies, to

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.540
raise the cost of switching.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:29.820
You raise the cost of switching,
you can do a lot

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.430
more to your customers,
or users.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.813
If the customers can't
switch, you can piss

00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:37.063
them off a whole lot.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.105
So, yeah.

00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:43.880
And the other reason I kind of
like the serf model is the

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.220
notion of people doing stuff
online, which is the raw

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.830
material that companies
use to make profits.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.200
So it's kind of like you're
farming for your life.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.232
And I guess Farmville would be
perfect for this, right?

00:50:58.232 --> 00:51:01.650
But maybe that's too much.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:05.620
The other way that the metaphor
works-- and other

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.460
people have written
about this--

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.570
the feudal metaphor--

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.310
is that, in a feudal system,
everything is owned.

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.010
There's no commons.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.100
And we're seeing this on the
internet, that no piece of the

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.880
internet is a commons.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.660
In the United States,
we have very

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.570
particular rules about commons--

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.340
free speech rules, association
rules, rules about

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.440
protesting--

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.670
because you're on a street.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.900
You're on a public street.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.870
And those rules don't apply in,
for example, Zuccotti Park

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.300
in New York, because that
was a privately

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.900
owned public space.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:42.850
The internet is, entirely,
privately owned public spaces.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:47.930
So Apple is well within its
rights to say, to an app

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.210
creator who made an app to
show US drone strikes in

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.840
Pakistan, you can't have
your app on my store.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.600
Because it is not a free
speech-- it is not a protest.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.750
This is a private space.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.410
Apple gets to decide.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:08.460
So this lack of a public sphere
in the world where we

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:14.300
are all associating is another
way the feudal model works.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.960
I don't know how to fit it
in to what I'm doing.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.380
I'll probably figure it
out sooner or later.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.530
AUDIENCE: The feudal
model is really

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:21.790
appealing at first blush.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:25.340
But another problem with it is
that we actually do live in a

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.220
democracy, at least
theoretically.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.480
And we do have the power to
vote, at least theoretically.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.490
The problem seems, to me, not
that there are currently all

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.720
kinds of tricks, like the
people who obfuscate the

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.340
privacy policies win.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.780
It's more about the lassitude
of those who are being

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.920
governed by the government
they set up, or the

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.180
corporations they choose
to do business with.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.170
And so ultimately, the problem
is we aren't looking after our

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.310
own interests.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.810
And so that seems to be what
needs to be fixed.

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.370
And it's not feudalism,
because we have the

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:52.670
opportunity to escape.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:53.860
We're just not taking advantage

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.460
of it through tricks.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.920
BRUCE SCHNEIER: I
agree with that.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.730
It's just getting harder
and harder.

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:03.030
And some of it is the fact that
we are just too good at

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.930
psychological manipulation.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:09.780
Advertising, political speeches,
have gotten to good.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.140
I don't know how fair
the game is.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.450
Yes, you are fundamentally
right.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.670
The question is does
that translate to

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.670
being right in practice.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:20.850
The United States is
particularly hard.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:25.410
Our political system is not
designed for a huge spectrum

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.640
of political ideas.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.450
Go to any other countries and
you just realize how narrow

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.160
our political debate is, just
because of the way our two

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.010
party system is set up.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.740
But again, unless the parties
choose to compete on these

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:44.480
features, we don't really
have a choice.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.400
And some features they do,
and some they don't.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.160
But yes, you are inherently
right.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.660
By the book, that's correct.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.080
The question is how does that
translate into to what we can

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.420
actually do, realistically.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.880
AUDIENCE: So we need to
trick Facebook into

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.820
becoming the EFF.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.070
BRUCE SCHNEIER: I'm game.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:07.610
AUDIENCE: Does that mean that
governments have an incentive

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.520
to encourage there to be a few
small companies, so that then,

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.145
they don't compete on
things like privacy?

00:54:14.145 --> 00:54:18.820
If there's only three, it's
much harder for them to

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.910
compete on something
like that.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.840
BRUCE SCHNEIER: I don't know.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.630
There are a lot of examples
we could look at.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:27.220
We could start poking
at some of them.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.230
Automobile manufacturers--

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:33.010
they do compete on safety,
and have for many years.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.750
Saab built an industry on our
car is safer than your car.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:40.530
So you do see security
features, sometimes.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.640
In a lot of ways,
the organic food

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.912
movement is a food safety--

00:54:44.912 --> 00:54:46.330
MALE SPEAKER: Saab is gone.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.810
BRUCE SCHNEIER: Yeah, but
in the '70s, that

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:49.540
was what they did.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.210
MALE SPEAKER: Organic
food was safe.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.260
BRUCE SCHNEIER: Yeah but,
organic food is

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:55.930
believed to be more pure.

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:59.440
It's a food purity sale, which
is inherently a health sale,

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.150
and a safety sale.

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:03.440
You can argue whether it's real
or fake, but it's how the

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.340
companies are competing.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:10.800
I don't think the government
is incenting any particular

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.710
economic outcome.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:16.340
I think there's just, right now,
a very happy confluence.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.410
Thank you very much.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:22.055
