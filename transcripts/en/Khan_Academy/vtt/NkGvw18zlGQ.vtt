00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.667
- [Instructor] "Kaito grows
tomatoes in two separate fields.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.837
"When the tomatoes are ready to be picked,

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:09.577
"he is curious as to whether
the sizes of his tomato plants

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:11.957
"differ between the two fields.

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:15.517
"He takes a random sample
of plants from each field

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:18.957
"and measures the heights of the plants.

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:22.140
"Here is a summary of the results:"

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.240
So what I want you to
do, is pause this video,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.070
and conduct a two sample T test here.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.580
And let's assume that
all of the conditions

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.870
for inference are met,
the random condition,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.090
the normal condition, and
the independent condition.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.670
And let's assume that we are working

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.150
with a significance level of 0.05.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.650
So pause the video, and conduct
the two sample T test here,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.910
to see whether there's evidence

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.220
that the sizes of tomato plants
differ between the fields.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.800
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.770
So like always, let's first
construct our null hypothesis.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.980
And that's going to be the situation

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.230
where there is no difference
between the mean sizes,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.300
so that would be that
the mean size in field A

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.110
is equal to the mean size in field B.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.080
Now what about our alternative hypothesis?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.430
Well, he wants to see whether
the sizes of his tomato plants

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.140
differ between the two fields.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980
He's not saying whether
A is bigger than B,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.950
or whether B is bigger than A,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.060
and so his alternative hypothesis

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.830
would be around his suspicion,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.810
that the mean of A is not
equal to the mean of B,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.370
that they differ.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.760
And to do this two sample T test now,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.210
we assume the null hypothesis.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.030
We assume our null hypothesis,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.160
and remember we're assuming that all

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.940
of our conditions for inference are met.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.850
And then we wanna calculate a T statistic

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.160
based on this sample data that we have.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.190
And our T statistic is going to be equal

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.253
to the differences
between the sample means,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.550
all of that over our estimate

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.370
of the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.920
of the difference of the sample means.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.500
This will be the sample standard deviation

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.500
from sample A squared, over
the sample size from A,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.000
plus the sample standard deviation

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.970
from the B sample squared,
over the sample size from B.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.940
And let's see, we have
all the numbers here

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.250
to calculate it.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.250
This numerator is going to
be equal to 1.3 minus 1.6,

00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:36.580
1.3 minus 1.6, all of that over

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.270
the square root of, let's see,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.060
the standard deviation, the
sample standard deviation

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.790
from the sample from field A is 0.5.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.553
If you square that, you're gonna get 0.25,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.840
and then that's going to
be over the sample size

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.250
from field A, over 22,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.050
plus 0.3 squared, so that is,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.050
0.3 squared is 0.09,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.770
all of that over the
sample size from field B,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.420
all of that over 24.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.227
The numerator is just gonna be -.3,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.140
divided by the square root

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.140
of .25 divided by 22,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
plus .09 divided by 24,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.543
and that gets us -2.44.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.370
Approximately -2.44.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.810
And so if you think
about a T distribution,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.300
and we'll use our calculator
to figure out this probability,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.490
so this is a T distribution
right over here,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.080
this would be the assumed
mean of our T distribution.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.930
And so we got a result that is,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.540
we got a T statistic of -2.44,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.490
so we're right over
here, so this is -2.44.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.630
And so we wanna say
what is the probability

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.230
from this T distribution
of getting something

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.570
at least this extreme?

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.570
So it would be this area, and
it would also be this area,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.890
if we got 2.44 above the mean,
it would also be this area.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.220
And so what I could do is,
I'm gonna use my calculator

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.340
to figure out this
probability right over here,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.400
and then I'm just gonna
multiply that by two,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.350
to get this one as well.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.350
So the probability of getting a T value,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.580
I guess I could say
where its absolute value

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.230
is greater than or equal to 2.44,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.960
is going to be approximately equal to,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.320
I'm going to go to second, distribution,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.410
I'm going to go to the
cumulative distribution function

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.650
for our T distribution, click that.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.950
And since I wanna think about
this tail probability here

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.160
that I'm just gonna multiply by two,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.370
the lower bound is a very
very very negative number,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.330
and you could view that as
functionally negative infinity.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.984
The upper bound is -2.44.

00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:16.573
- 2.44.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.980
And now what's our degrees of freedom?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.590
Well if we take the conservative approach,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.290
it'll be the smaller of
the two samples minus one.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.470
Well the smaller of the two samples is 22,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.193
and so 22 minus one is 21.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.420
So put 21 in there.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.752
Two...

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:39.530
21.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.530
And now I can paste, and I get
that number right over there,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.970
and if I multiply that by
two, 'cause this just gives me

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.300
the probability of getting
something lower than that,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.660
but I also wanna think
about the probability

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.530
of getting something 2.44
or more above the mean

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.870
of our T distribution.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.870
So times two, is going to be
equal to approximately 0.024.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.240
So approximately 0.024.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.870
And what I wanna do then is compare this

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.400
to my significance level.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.540
And you can see very clearly,
this right over here,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.063
this is equal to our P value.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.210
Our P value in this situation,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.650
our P value in this
situation is clearly less

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.290
than our significance level.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.480
And because of that, we said hey,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.320
assuming the null hypothesis is true,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.490
we got something that's
a pretty low probability

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.110
below our threshold, so
we are going to reject

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.980
our null hypothesis, which
tells us that there is,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.080
so this suggests,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.010
this suggests the alternative hypothesis,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.500
that there is indeed a
difference between the sizes

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.203
of the tomato plants in the two fields.
