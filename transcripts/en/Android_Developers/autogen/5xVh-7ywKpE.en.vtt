you Jeff
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959
you Jeff
so before I begin my talk you're

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
so before I begin my talk you're
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.910
so before I begin my talk you're
probably wondering what are these

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
probably wondering what are these
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.799
probably wondering what are these
permissions what is this guy gonna be

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
permissions what is this guy gonna be
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.160
permissions what is this guy gonna be
talking about and and so before I get

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
talking about and and so before I get
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660
talking about and and so before I get
into the nuts and bolts of permissions

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
into the nuts and bolts of permissions
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.069
into the nuts and bolts of permissions
how the new runtime permission model

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
how the new runtime permission model
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.130
how the new runtime permission model
works I want to cover the very basics

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
works I want to cover the very basics
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930
works I want to cover the very basics
and what what is the permission so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
and what what is the permission so
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939
and what what is the permission so
permission is a complete controls access

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
permission is a complete controls access
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.849
permission is a complete controls access
to sensitive data for example in my

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
to sensitive data for example in my
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.020
to sensitive data for example in my
contacts my SMS my in critical resources

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
contacts my SMS my in critical resources
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520
contacts my SMS my in critical resources
so critical resources are for example

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
so critical resources are for example
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.450
so critical resources are for example
the camera the GPS and so permissions

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
the camera the GPS and so permissions
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.550
the camera the GPS and so permissions
are granted to applications by the user

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
are granted to applications by the user
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130
are granted to applications by the user
and there are three different rotational

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
and there are three different rotational
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.320
and there are three different rotational
levels of permissions one of them is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
levels of permissions one of them is
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.890
levels of permissions one of them is
normal dangerous and signature normal

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
normal dangerous and signature normal
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050
normal dangerous and signature normal
permissions are considered not that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
permissions are considered not that
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.990
permissions are considered not that
harmful to the user and applications

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
harmful to the user and applications
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640
harmful to the user and applications
usually get them immediately as soon as

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
usually get them immediately as soon as
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649
usually get them immediately as soon as
they're installed they don't need user

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
they're installed they don't need user
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.380
they're installed they don't need user
approval dangerous permissions they are

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
approval dangerous permissions they are
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020
approval dangerous permissions they are
more critical to the user and these are

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
more critical to the user and these are
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.980
more critical to the user and these are
things like your contacts your camera

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990
things like your contacts your camera
 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.899
things like your contacts your camera
location which required the user to opt

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
location which required the user to opt
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.460
location which required the user to opt
in and allow the application to use the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
in and allow the application to use the
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740
in and allow the application to use the
permission there is a third type of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
permission there is a third type of
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.060
permission there is a third type of
permission which is called signature

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
permission which is called signature
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.730
permission which is called signature
permissions signature permissions are

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
permissions signature permissions are
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.870
permissions signature permissions are
defined by an application or the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
defined by an application or the
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.090
defined by an application or the
platform and in order for another

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
platform and in order for another
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.889
platform and in order for another
application to get this provision it has

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
application to get this provision it has
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.080
application to get this provision it has
to be signed with the same certificate

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090
to be signed with the same certificate
 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.870
to be signed with the same certificate
this pretty much means that it should be

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
this pretty much means that it should be
 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.700
this pretty much means that it should be
developed by the same developer so I'm

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
developed by the same developer so I'm
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.670
developed by the same developer so I'm
gonna do a very quick dive on how

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
gonna do a very quick dive on how
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520
gonna do a very quick dive on how
permissions used to work before on L and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
permissions used to work before on L and
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.550
permissions used to work before on L and
priam devices in general before I dive

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
priam devices in general before I dive
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.970
priam devices in general before I dive
into the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
into the
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.750
into the
your permission molo so what you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
your permission molo so what you
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.880
your permission molo so what you
probably most of you know on L devices

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
probably most of you know on L devices
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.119
probably most of you know on L devices
you just go to the Play Store you find

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129
you just go to the Play Store you find
 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.240
you just go to the Play Store you find
an application you wanna install you see

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
an application you wanna install you see
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.190
an application you wanna install you see
the familiar install button you click

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
the familiar install button you click
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.770
the familiar install button you click
the install button you see this nice

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
the install button you see this nice
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420
the install button you see this nice
list of all the permissions that the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
list of all the permissions that the
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910
list of all the permissions that the
application is using and you have

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
application is using and you have
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.280
application is using and you have
basically two options at this point

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
basically two options at this point
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.770
basically two options at this point
except operations or go away go back and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
except operations or go away go back and
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.509
except operations or go away go back and
even if you don't like one of those

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
even if you don't like one of those
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.069
even if you don't like one of those
permissions and if you have some doubts

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079
permissions and if you have some doubts
 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.809
permissions and if you have some doubts
you basically have still these two

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
you basically have still these two
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.390
you basically have still these two
options like opt in or completely don't

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
options like opt in or completely don't
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.900
options like opt in or completely don't
install the application at all assume

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
install the application at all assume
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000
install the application at all assume
that times approve all permissions the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
that times approve all permissions the
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.099
that times approve all permissions the
application gets downloaded I open the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109
application gets downloaded I open the
 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.160
application gets downloaded I open the
app and the application can be used all

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
app and the application can be used all
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.400
app and the application can be used all
the time so the old permission model had

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
the time so the old permission model had
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.030
the time so the old permission model had
had several limitations so for for one

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
had several limitations so for for one
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.890
had several limitations so for for one
the user had no control so basically you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
the user had no control so basically you
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660
the user had no control so basically you
have the big hammer you gotta hit the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
have the big hammer you gotta hit the
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.400
have the big hammer you gotta hit the
nail or you don't is basically either

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
nail or you don't is basically either
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.170
nail or you don't is basically either
accept all permissions and install the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180
accept all permissions and install the
 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940
accept all permissions and install the
app or you don't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
app or you don't
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.580
app or you don't
there is no context for the user why

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
there is no context for the user why
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.839
there is no context for the user why
this application needs this permission

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849
this application needs this permission
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.420
this application needs this permission
so you're probably asking why is the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
so you're probably asking why is the
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.080
so you're probably asking why is the
flashlight app asking for some

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
flashlight app asking for some
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.879
flashlight app asking for some
permission and there's probably a good

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889
permission and there's probably a good
 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.319
permission and there's probably a good
reason for that but the thing is it's

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329
reason for that but the thing is it's
 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.900
reason for that but the thing is it's
not it's not obvious everytime why the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910
not it's not obvious everytime why the
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.780
not it's not obvious everytime why the
applications is certain permission

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
applications is certain permission
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.490
applications is certain permission
another problem we had was we had too

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500
another problem we had was we had too
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.129
another problem we had was we had too
many permissions and it was really hard

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139
many permissions and it was really hard
 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.539
many permissions and it was really hard
to make an informed choice when you have

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549
to make an informed choice when you have
 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.210
to make an informed choice when you have
30 options and interest and 30 different

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220
30 options and interest and 30 different
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.170
30 options and interest and 30 different
concepts to decide what to do another

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180
concepts to decide what to do another
 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.089
concepts to decide what to do another
problem is the technical jargon that was

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099
problem is the technical jargon that was
 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.280
problem is the technical jargon that was
used by explanation for certain

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
used by explanation for certain
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.909
used by explanation for certain
permissions mainly because it's been

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919
permissions mainly because it's been
 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.220
permissions mainly because it's been
evolving over time and we've been adding

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
evolving over time and we've been adding
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.690
evolving over time and we've been adding
more and more concepts and to be honest

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
more and more concepts and to be honest
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.069
more and more concepts and to be honest
I'm an engineer working on this and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079
I'm an engineer working on this and
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.990
I'm an engineer working on this and
still it was kind of hard to understand

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
still it was kind of hard to understand
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.809
still it was kind of hard to understand
all the permissions at some point I just

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819
all the permissions at some point I just
 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.280
all the permissions at some point I just
need to look it up and of what it would

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
need to look it up and of what it would
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.740
need to look it up and of what it would
what was it and the other s which is

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
what was it and the other s which is
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.599
what was it and the other s which is
really important for you guys sub

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609
really important for you guys sub
 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.400
really important for you guys sub
developers is there was friction on

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
developers is there was friction on
 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.069
developers is there was friction on
upgrade because if you get an update for

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079
upgrade because if you get an update for
 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.390
upgrade because if you get an update for
your application and require new

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400
your application and require new
 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.159
your application and require new
permission the user has to explicitly

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169
permission the user has to explicitly
 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.819
permission the user has to explicitly
approve it before the upgrade occurs and

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829
approve it before the upgrade occurs and
 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.430
approve it before the upgrade occurs and
this is problematic because many times

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
this is problematic because many times
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.230
this is problematic because many times
developers are afraid to add new

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240
developers are afraid to add new
 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.790
developers are afraid to add new
features because they may require you

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
features because they may require you
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.030
features because they may require you
permission

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040
permission
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.430
permission
since this can limited this can limit

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
since this can limited this can limit
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.170
since this can limited this can limit
the adoption of their application and

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
the adoption of their application and
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.210
the adoption of their application and
they're really trying to or or district

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220
they're really trying to or or district
 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.080
they're really trying to or or district
leader the other pal to the other

pathological case where you request all

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
pathological case where you request all
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.490
pathological case where you request all
permissions up front just in case you

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500
permissions up front just in case you
 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.990

never know so in order to solve all

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000
never know so in order to solve all
 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.630
never know so in order to solve all
these problems I'm presenting how

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640
these problems I'm presenting how
 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.100
these problems I'm presenting how
permissions work on em or marshmallow so

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110
permissions work on em or marshmallow so
 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.860
permissions work on em or marshmallow so
what we did is we realized that we have

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
what we did is we realized that we have
 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.860
what we did is we realized that we have
too many permissions and we decided to

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870
too many permissions and we decided to
 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.240
too many permissions and we decided to
group the permissions into nine

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250
group the permissions into nine
 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.300
group the permissions into nine
permission groups which are oriented by

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310
permission groups which are oriented by
 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.870
permission groups which are oriented by
topic

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880
topic
 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.670
topic
and and this is what we present to the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680
and and this is what we present to the
 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.220
and and this is what we present to the
user when they manage the permission so

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230
user when they manage the permission so
 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.140
user when they manage the permission so
the user can give the permission if the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
the user can give the permission if the
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.120
the user can give the permission if the
user grants you the contacts permission

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130
user grants you the contacts permission
 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.550
user grants you the contacts permission
they under the hood grant you all the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560
they under the hood grant you all the
 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.330
they under the hood grant you all the
permissions in the contacts group so all

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340
permissions in the contacts group so all
 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.800
permissions in the contacts group so all
the permissions are runtimes

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810
the permissions are runtimes
 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.810
the permissions are runtimes
so there is no permission UI when you

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820
so there is no permission UI when you
 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.220
so there is no permission UI when you
install the app so if you go to the Play

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230
install the app so if you go to the Play
 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.810
install the app so if you go to the Play
Store you find your application you see

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820
Store you find your application you see
 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.950
Store you find your application you see
the install button then you click

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960
the install button then you click
 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.670
the install button then you click
install and the installation starts

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
install and the installation starts
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.740
install and the installation starts
right away you don't see any UI and it

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750
right away you don't see any UI and it
 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.960
right away you don't see any UI and it
dialogues for permissions you can you

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
dialogues for permissions you can you
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.090
dialogues for permissions you can you
can open the app so what the app does is

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100
can open the app so what the app does is
 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.650
can open the app so what the app does is
when the application needs permissions

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660
when the application needs permissions
 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.380
when the application needs permissions
it does request them at runtime and this

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390
it does request them at runtime and this
 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.180
it does request them at runtime and this
is one example of how the calendar app

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190
is one example of how the calendar app
 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.200
is one example of how the calendar app
is accessing asking for your contacts so

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210
is accessing asking for your contacts so
 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.970
is accessing asking for your contacts so
the idea behind this permission model is

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980
the idea behind this permission model is
 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.740
the idea behind this permission model is
that the user has more context where the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
that the user has more context where the
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.540
that the user has more context where the
permission is needed for because you're

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
permission is needed for because you're
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.860
permission is needed for because you're
trying to use the feature you're trying

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870
trying to use the feature you're trying
 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.710
trying to use the feature you're trying
to take you know to use the camera and

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720
to take you know to use the camera and
 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.540
to take you know to use the camera and
you when you when you try to use the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550
you when you when you try to use the
 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.890
you when you when you try to use the
feature it's asking for the camera

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900
feature it's asking for the camera
 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.630
feature it's asking for the camera
permission it's pretty obvious why the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640
permission it's pretty obvious why the
 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.730
permission it's pretty obvious why the
permission is needed and you have more

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740
permission is needed and you have more
 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.180
permission is needed and you have more
contacts in more informed choices the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190
contacts in more informed choices the
 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.440
contacts in more informed choices the
other benefit of the new permission

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450
other benefit of the new permission
 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.180
other benefit of the new permission
model is that you can always change your

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
model is that you can always change your
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.220
model is that you can always change your
mind you can say hey I granted this up

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230
mind you can say hey I granted this up
 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.530
mind you can say hey I granted this up
this permission but I don't feel

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540
this permission but I don't feel
 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.690
this permission but I don't feel
comfortable for the app to use this

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700
comfortable for the app to use this
 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.100
comfortable for the app to use this
permission you can go always go to

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110
permission you can go always go to
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.790
permission you can go always go to
settings and change that or so you have

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800
settings and change that or so you have
 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.520
settings and change that or so you have
access to permissions by application so

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530
access to permissions by application so
 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.720
access to permissions by application so
now you can see all the permissions that

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730
now you can see all the permissions that
 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.070
now you can see all the permissions that
the hangouts app is using you can also

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080
the hangouts app is using you can also
 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.200
the hangouts app is using you can also
see the permissions so which apps are

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210
see the permissions so which apps are
 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.820
see the permissions so which apps are
using this permission so for example

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830
using this permission so for example
 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.590
using this permission so for example
which permissions are which apps are

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600
which permissions are which apps are
 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.630
which permissions are which apps are
using the camera permission on my device

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640
using the camera permission on my device
 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.410
using the camera permission on my device
and you can you can control that

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420
 
 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.130
 
so so this is how modern applications

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140
so so this is how modern applications
 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.540
so so this is how modern applications
works the reapplication has to be

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550
works the reapplication has to be
 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.700
works the reapplication has to be
explicitly written to use the new

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710
explicitly written to use the new
 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.470
explicitly written to use the new
runtime permission model which is

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480
runtime permission model which is
 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.050
runtime permission model which is
probably 0.1% of the applications from

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060
probably 0.1% of the applications from
 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.730
probably 0.1% of the applications from
the Play Store and you're probably

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740
the Play Store and you're probably
 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.240
the Play Store and you're probably
asking yourself what do I do for all

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250
asking yourself what do I do for all
 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.110
asking yourself what do I do for all
this 99.9% of the applications how do

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120
this 99.9% of the applications how do
 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.730
this 99.9% of the applications how do
they work because the way they're

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
they work because the way they're
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.620
they work because the way they're
written they don't expect permissions to

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630
written they don't expect permissions to
 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.720
written they don't expect permissions to
be revoked on them so if you--if you

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730
be revoked on them so if you--if you
 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.640
be revoked on them so if you--if you
revoke the permission on an app it will

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650
revoke the permission on an app it will
 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.620
revoke the permission on an app it will
just blindly call the API and will just

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630
just blindly call the API and will just
 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.880
just blindly call the API and will just
crash so the way a permissions work for

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890
crash so the way a permissions work for
 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.230
crash so the way a permissions work for
legacy apps is you go to the Play Store

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240
legacy apps is you go to the Play Store
 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.270
legacy apps is you go to the Play Store
again you find the application you click

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280
again you find the application you click
 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.040
again you find the application you click
the install button you see the familiar

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050
the install button you see the familiar
 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.740
the install button you see the familiar
permissions dialog and again you have

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750
permissions dialog and again you have
 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.390
permissions dialog and again you have
two options you have to accept all

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400
two options you have to accept all
 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.690
two options you have to accept all
permissions only or you go back the

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700
permissions only or you go back the
 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.430
permissions only or you go back the
difference though is when you install

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440
difference though is when you install
 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.630
difference though is when you install
the application and accept all

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640
the application and accept all
 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.260
the application and accept all
permissions now you can go to settings

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270
permissions now you can go to settings
 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.940
permissions now you can go to settings
and you can manage permissions for those

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950
and you can manage permissions for those
 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.920
and you can manage permissions for those
applications even though they don't

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
applications even though they don't
 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.770
applications even though they don't
support a new runtime permission mode

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780
support a new runtime permission mode
 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.300
support a new runtime permission mode
and then the question is again you have

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310
and then the question is again you have
 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.800
and then the question is again you have
the nice permission than the nine

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810
the nice permission than the nine
 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.480
the nice permission than the nine
permission groups so from this point on

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490
permission groups so from this point on
 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.410
permission groups so from this point on
it's for you the application is

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.420
it's for you the application is
 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.640
it's for you the application is
controlling permissions for legacy and

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650
controlling permissions for legacy and
 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.290
controlling permissions for legacy and
non legacy apps is absolutely the same

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300
non legacy apps is absolutely the same
 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.750
non legacy apps is absolutely the same
there is no difference and then the

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:57.760
there is no difference and then the
 

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.960
there is no difference and then the
question is how did you guys do this the

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970
question is how did you guys do this the
 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.640
question is how did you guys do this the
way we do it is instead of revoking

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.650
way we do it is instead of revoking
 

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.770
way we do it is instead of revoking
permissions for legacy applications we

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:04.780
permissions for legacy applications we
 

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.200
permissions for legacy applications we
just disabling the API we using a

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.210
just disabling the API we using a
 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.940
just disabling the API we using a
feature called a pops probably some of

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:08.950
feature called a pops probably some of
 

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.530
feature called a pops probably some of
you are familiar with it

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:10.540
you are familiar with it
 

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.960
you are familiar with it
and what we do is literally for example

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:12.970
and what we do is literally for example
 

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.510
and what we do is literally for example
you revoke the contacts permission so

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520
you revoke the contacts permission so
 

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040
you revoke the contacts permission so
the application really has contacts

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.050
the application really has contacts
 

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.240
the application really has contacts
permission we don't revoke the

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.250
permission we don't revoke the
 

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.010
permission we don't revoke the
permission but what we do is when the

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.020
permission but what we do is when the
 

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.960
permission but what we do is when the
application is asking for contacts we

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:21.970
application is asking for contacts we
 

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.870
application is asking for contacts we
say sorry no contacts on the device so

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:24.880
say sorry no contacts on the device so
 

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.450
say sorry no contacts on the device so
we basically making the apps the app the

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.460
we basically making the apps the app the
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.180
we basically making the apps the app the
API is do nothing or return default

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.190
API is do nothing or return default
 

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.440
API is do nothing or return default
errors or empty data sets it's it's case

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.450
errors or empty data sets it's it's case
 

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.060
errors or empty data sets it's it's case
dependent so we basically had to visit

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.070
dependent so we basically had to visit
 

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.380
dependent so we basically had to visit
all the api's and just make them work

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:37.390
all the api's and just make them work
 

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:43.260
all the api's and just make them work
appropriately so how do you ask for

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.270
appropriately so how do you ask for
 

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.690
appropriately so how do you ask for
permission before I before I go into the

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.700
permission before I before I go into the
 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.460
permission before I before I go into the
nuts and bolts a hydrating code I really

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:47.470
nuts and bolts a hydrating code I really
 

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.140
nuts and bolts a hydrating code I really
want to cover the UX because it's really

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.150
want to cover the UX because it's really
 

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.730
want to cover the UX because it's really
really important to have consistent

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:50.740
really important to have consistent
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.170
really important to have consistent
permission experience for all

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.180
permission experience for all
 

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.490
permission experience for all
applications for

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:53.500
applications for
 

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.990
applications for
it's good for the user it's good for you

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000
it's good for the user it's good for you
 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.400
it's good for the user it's good for you
it's good for the ecosystem it's good

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.410
it's good for the ecosystem it's good
 

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.310
it's good for the ecosystem it's good
for everyone so you can imagine a

00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320
for everyone so you can imagine a
 

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.220
for everyone so you can imagine a
2-dimensional matrix so in one dimension

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:02.230
2-dimensional matrix so in one dimension
 

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.560
2-dimensional matrix so in one dimension
you have how important is this

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:04.570
you have how important is this
 

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.450
you have how important is this
permission for my application is it

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:06.460
permission for my application is it
 

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.490
permission for my application is it
critical or is it is it is it an

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.500
critical or is it is it is it an
 

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.310
critical or is it is it is it an
optional feature so for example if I

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320
optional feature so for example if I
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.470
optional feature so for example if I
have a camera app the camera permission

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480
have a camera app the camera permission
 

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.390
have a camera app the camera permission
is critical for my app I mean it will

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:15.400
is critical for my app I mean it will
 

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.560
is critical for my app I mean it will
not work if I don't have the camera

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:16.570
not work if I don't have the camera
 

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.450
not work if I don't have the camera
permission however location is a

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.460
permission however location is a
 

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.280
permission however location is a
different story maybe I have a Jew

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.290
different story maybe I have a Jew
 

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.120
different story maybe I have a Jew
tagging feature but most users probably

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.130
tagging feature but most users probably
 

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.740
tagging feature but most users probably
don't understand why how location is

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:25.750
don't understand why how location is
 

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.770
don't understand why how location is
related to photos and in this case

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:27.780
related to photos and in this case
 

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.880
related to photos and in this case
probably I don't need a stranger right

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:29.890
probably I don't need a stranger right
 

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.020
probably I don't need a stranger right
away it's not critical for my

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.030
away it's not critical for my
 

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.690
away it's not critical for my
application to work also it's about

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:33.700
application to work also it's about
 

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.430
application to work also it's about
context the other dimension of this

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440
context the other dimension of this
 

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.730
context the other dimension of this
matrix is the context so is it is it

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:38.740
matrix is the context so is it is it
 

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.170
matrix is the context so is it is it
clear to the user why you need the

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.180
clear to the user why you need the
 

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.240
clear to the user why you need the
permission form or it's not clear and

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.250
permission form or it's not clear and
 

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.360
permission form or it's not clear and
based on that I'll cover all the cases

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.370
based on that I'll cover all the cases
 

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.670
based on that I'll cover all the cases
and what is the UX recommendation in

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680
and what is the UX recommendation in
 

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.140
and what is the UX recommendation in
each of these cases so case 1 assume

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.150
each of these cases so case 1 assume
 

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.790
each of these cases so case 1 assume
that it's a critical permission that

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800
that it's a critical permission that
 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.920
that it's a critical permission that
your application needs but it's not

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:55.930
your application needs but it's not
 

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.570
your application needs but it's not
clear to the user why do you need this

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.580
clear to the user why do you need this
 

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.820
clear to the user why do you need this
permission so now it's that's a great

00:09:59.820 --> 00:09:59.830
permission so now it's that's a great
 

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.190
permission so now it's that's a great
opportunity for you to have a warm

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200
opportunity for you to have a warm
 

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.890
opportunity for you to have a warm
welcome screen where you present the

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:04.900
welcome screen where you present the
 

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.750
welcome screen where you present the
core features of your application and

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760
core features of your application and
 

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.640
core features of your application and
how to use the application and you

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:08.650
how to use the application and you
 

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.250
how to use the application and you
educate the user and in this context you

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:11.260
educate the user and in this context you
 

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.350
educate the user and in this context you
can it will be clear to the user why

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360
can it will be clear to the user why
 

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.480
can it will be clear to the user why
this permission is needed and at the end

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.490
this permission is needed and at the end
 

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.890
this permission is needed and at the end
of this flow you can just literally

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:16.900
of this flow you can just literally
 

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.050
of this flow you can just literally
request permission and so the user will

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.060
request permission and so the user will
 

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.400
request permission and so the user will
not be wondering why you need this

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.410
not be wondering why you need this
 

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.590
not be wondering why you need this
permission at all so the second pattern

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600
permission at all so the second pattern
 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.260
permission at all so the second pattern
asking upfront so if you have an

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.270
asking upfront so if you have an
 

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.030
asking upfront so if you have an
application that really needs this

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040
application that really needs this
 

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.310
application that really needs this
permission is very obvious so the camera

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320
permission is very obvious so the camera
 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.290
permission is very obvious so the camera
app is a perfect example you have a

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:34.300
app is a perfect example you have a
 

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.610
app is a perfect example you have a
camera app you need the camera

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:35.620
camera app you need the camera
 

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.740
camera app you need the camera
permission without the camera permission

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:37.750
permission without the camera permission
 

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.960
permission without the camera permission
the application cannot work so for the

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:39.970
the application cannot work so for the
 

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.970
the application cannot work so for the
user is not surprised if you ask for the

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980
user is not surprised if you ask for the
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.320
user is not surprised if you ask for the
camera permission they just download at

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.330
camera permission they just download at
 

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.960
camera permission they just download at
the camera app so the third case is for

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:48.970
the camera app so the third case is for
 

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.870
the camera app so the third case is for
secondary features where it's it's it's

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880
secondary features where it's it's it's
 

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.640
secondary features where it's it's it's
obvious why you need this permission for

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:53.650
obvious why you need this permission for
 

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.770
obvious why you need this permission for
example let's pick the geo-tagging

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:55.780
example let's pick the geo-tagging
 

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.140
example let's pick the geo-tagging
example that i gave you a little I mean

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.150
example that i gave you a little I mean
 

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.980
example that i gave you a little I mean
it earlier so if I have a photo and I

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:01.990
it earlier so if I have a photo and I
 

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.550
it earlier so if I have a photo and I
select geotag the photo and I'm asked

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560
select geotag the photo and I'm asked
 

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.110
select geotag the photo and I'm asked
for location permission

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120
for location permission
 

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.700
for location permission
I wouldn't be surprised it's it's

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:08.710
I wouldn't be surprised it's it's
 

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.350
I wouldn't be surprised it's it's
obvious to me again see in the context

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360
obvious to me again see in the context
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.940
obvious to me again see in the context
that oh yeah I know what this permission

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:11.950
that oh yeah I know what this permission
 

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:16.200
that oh yeah I know what this permission
is needed so the fourth context the the

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.210
is needed so the fourth context the the
 

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.820
is needed so the fourth context the the
fourth pattern the fourth the fourth

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:17.830
fourth pattern the fourth the fourth
 

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.090
fourth pattern the fourth the fourth
pattern excuse me is educating context

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:21.100
pattern excuse me is educating context
 

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.670
pattern excuse me is educating context
so this is for cases where it's a

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680
so this is for cases where it's a
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.710
so this is for cases where it's a
secondary feature for your application

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720
secondary feature for your application
 

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.110
secondary feature for your application
and it's unclear to the user so you

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120
and it's unclear to the user so you
 

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.269
and it's unclear to the user so you
really shouldn't have features that fall

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279
really shouldn't have features that fall
 

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.690
really shouldn't have features that fall
into this bucket but in case you do you

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:33.700
into this bucket but in case you do you
 

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.670
into this bucket but in case you do you
should educate you can explain before

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680
should educate you can explain before
 

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.170
should educate you can explain before
you request a permission you can educate

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.180
you request a permission you can educate
 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.030
you request a permission you can educate
the user why you need this permission

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040
the user why you need this permission
 

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.160
the user why you need this permission
before you ask in the permission we have

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.170
before you ask in the permission we have
 

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.769
before you ask in the permission we have
for even a dedicated API which has this

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:43.779
for even a dedicated API which has this
 

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:45.810
for even a dedicated API which has this
long name should show request permission

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:45.820
long name should show request permission
 

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.450
long name should show request permission
rationale that that you can use as a

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:48.460
rationale that that you can use as a
 

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.860
rationale that that you can use as a
hint whether you whether to show uh

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:49.870
hint whether you whether to show uh
 

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.260
hint whether you whether to show uh
permission rationale I'll cover this in

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.270
permission rationale I'll cover this in
 

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.440
permission rationale I'll cover this in
in detail a bit later but what is what I

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.450
in detail a bit later but what is what I
 

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.150
in detail a bit later but what is what I
forgot to mention is really important is

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160
forgot to mention is really important is
 

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.890
forgot to mention is really important is
that when you ask for permission the

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:58.900
that when you ask for permission the
 

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.260
that when you ask for permission the
very first time the user does has two

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:01.270
very first time the user does has two
 

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.769
very first time the user does has two
options

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:01.779
options
 

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.690
options
except the permission or denied a

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:03.700
except the permission or denied a
 

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.579
except the permission or denied a
permission they do not have the option

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:05.589
permission they do not have the option
 

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:06.780
permission they do not have the option
to say don't ask me again

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:06.790
to say don't ask me again
 

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.769
to say don't ask me again
so the very first time it's safe to ask

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779
so the very first time it's safe to ask
 

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.050
so the very first time it's safe to ask
the second time if the user says no but

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
the second time if the user says no but
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.180
the second time if the user says no but
the application keeps asking for the

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.190
the application keeps asking for the
 

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.130
the application keeps asking for the
same permission now the user has the

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.140
same permission now the user has the
 

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.850
same permission now the user has the
option say nah don't ask me again so the

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:20.860
option say nah don't ask me again so the
 

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.290
option say nah don't ask me again so the
very first time is safe that's very

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.300
very first time is safe that's very
 

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.510
very first time is safe that's very
important message to just just ask for

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.520
important message to just just ask for
 

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.269
important message to just just ask for
the permission upfront so there is a

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279
the permission upfront so there is a
 

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:32.040
the permission upfront so there is a
fifth pattern which I would say it's

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.050
fifth pattern which I would say it's
 

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.980
fifth pattern which I would say it's
more like anti-pattern I've been asked

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:34.990
more like anti-pattern I've been asked
 

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.510
more like anti-pattern I've been asked
this question many times so this way I

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:36.520
this question many times so this way I
 

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.890
this question many times so this way I
decided to bring it up to your attention

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:37.900
decided to bring it up to your attention
 

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.680
decided to bring it up to your attention
but to be honest from all the all the

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:40.690
but to be honest from all the all the
 

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.040
but to be honest from all the all the
Google apps that were seeing this as a

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.050
Google apps that were seeing this as a
 

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.829
Google apps that were seeing this as a
problem nobody actually had to implement

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839
problem nobody actually had to implement
 

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:48.180
problem nobody actually had to implement
this pattern and there was another way

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.190
this pattern and there was another way
 

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.180
this pattern and there was another way
around that so that's the case where you

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.190
around that so that's the case where you
 

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.620
around that so that's the case where you
have a service it runs in the background

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:52.630
have a service it runs in the background
 

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.010
have a service it runs in the background
and these you don't have UI the users

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.020
and these you don't have UI the users
 

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.540
and these you don't have UI the users
not using do you have the UI of your

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:57.550
not using do you have the UI of your
 

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.010
not using do you have the UI of your
application and now we need a permission

00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.020
application and now we need a permission
 

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.310
application and now we need a permission
so what do you do

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320
so what do you do
 

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.540
so what do you do
we don't have api's to request

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.550
we don't have api's to request
 

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.670
we don't have api's to request
permissions from services and that's on

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680
permissions from services and that's on
 

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.110
permissions from services and that's on
purpose because we don't want to

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120
purpose because we don't want to
 

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.530
purpose because we don't want to
interrupt a user so definitely when the

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:10.540
interrupt a user so definitely when the
 

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.480
interrupt a user so definitely when the
user is using another app it's it you

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:12.490
user is using another app it's it you
 

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.640
user is using another app it's it you
shouldn't throw an activity in front of

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:14.650
shouldn't throw an activity in front of
 

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.770
shouldn't throw an activity in front of
them asking for the permission because

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:16.780
them asking for the permission because
 

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.110
them asking for the permission because
this is disrupting the user flow what

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120
this is disrupting the user flow what
 

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.740
this is disrupting the user flow what
you should do is

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:20.750
you should do is
 

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.069
you should do is
first avoid this if possible and the

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079
first avoid this if possible and the
 

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.809
first avoid this if possible and the
other is just post a notification and

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:25.819
other is just post a notification and
 

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:28.869
other is just post a notification and
say hey this feature won't work and when

00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:28.879
say hey this feature won't work and when
 

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.369
say hey this feature won't work and when
the user has time they can open a

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:30.379
the user has time they can open a
 

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:33.189
the user has time they can open a
notification which when they click on

00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199
notification which when they click on
 

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:34.629
notification which when they click on
the notification you should bring a

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639
the notification you should bring a
 

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.470
the notification you should bring a
fullscreen UI where you can explain what

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480
fullscreen UI where you can explain what
 

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.179
fullscreen UI where you can explain what
feature needs this permission why is

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:40.189
feature needs this permission why is
 

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:42.939
feature needs this permission why is
this permission used for and let the

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:42.949
this permission used for and let the
 

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:44.410
this permission used for and let the
user choose whether they want to obtain

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.420
user choose whether they want to obtain
 

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.389
user choose whether they want to obtain
a - at which point you can request

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399
a - at which point you can request
 

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:52.179
a - at which point you can request
permission or opt out so here are the

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:52.189
permission or opt out so here are the
 

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:54.249
permission or opt out so here are the
permissions api's it you can they're

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:54.259
permissions api's it you can they're
 

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:56.050
permissions api's it you can they're
just a few API you need to learn they're

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.060
just a few API you need to learn they're
 

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.809
just a few API you need to learn they're
very very simple that's I really want to

00:13:58.809 --> 00:13:58.819
very very simple that's I really want to
 

00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:00.519
very very simple that's I really want to
have this message that it's very very

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:00.529
have this message that it's very very
 

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:03.129
have this message that it's very very
very simple to use permissions so the

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:03.139
very simple to use permissions so the
 

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:04.869
very simple to use permissions so the
first permission is very at the first

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:04.879
first permission is very at the first
 

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:07.360
first permission is very at the first
API is very simple do I have this

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.370
API is very simple do I have this
 

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.629
API is very simple do I have this
permission which means does my app have

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639
permission which means does my app have
 

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.980
permission which means does my app have
the permission not somebody who's

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:11.990
the permission not somebody who's
 

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.710
the permission not somebody who's
calling for remote process the second

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720
calling for remote process the second
 

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.259
calling for remote process the second
API is to request the permission as you

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:17.269
API is to request the permission as you
 

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:19.210
API is to request the permission as you
can see we have this API from activity

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:19.220
can see we have this API from activity
 

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.730
can see we have this API from activity
summon fragments once you request the

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:21.740
summon fragments once you request the
 

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.170
summon fragments once you request the
permission you need an API because

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.180
permission you need an API because
 

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.509
permission you need an API because
permission request is asynchronous but

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519
permission request is asynchronous but
 

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.069
permission request is asynchronous but
this brings the UI the user has to

00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079
this brings the UI the user has to
 

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:28.870
this brings the UI the user has to
decide what to do so this way you have

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880
decide what to do so this way you have
 

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.569
decide what to do so this way you have
this callback own permission result

00:14:31.569 --> 00:14:31.579
this callback own permission result
 

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.699
this callback own permission result
request on a request permissions result

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:33.709
request on a request permissions result
 

00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:35.860
request on a request permissions result
where you need to handle the result of

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:35.870
where you need to handle the result of
 

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.129
where you need to handle the result of
what the user decided to do the last two

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:39.139
what the user decided to do the last two
 

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:41.439
what the user decided to do the last two
api's our little non-obvious what they

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:41.449
api's our little non-obvious what they
 

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:44.259
api's our little non-obvious what they
do the should show permission rationale

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:44.269
do the should show permission rationale
 

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:47.559
do the should show permission rationale
so this is this API is it has very

00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:47.569
so this is this API is it has very
 

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:50.439
so this is this API is it has very
targeted use and it's intended for so

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:50.449
targeted use and it's intended for so
 

00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:52.569
targeted use and it's intended for so
this returns true if and only if the

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:52.579
this returns true if and only if the
 

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:54.189
this returns true if and only if the
user already declined the permission

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199
user already declined the permission
 

00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:55.809
user already declined the permission
once so the users you requested a

00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:55.819
once so the users you requested a
 

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:58.749
once so the users you requested a
permission the user so the UI and said

00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759
permission the user so the UI and said
 

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:02.319
permission the user so the UI and said
no and now if now you can use this API

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:02.329
no and now if now you can use this API
 

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:07.299
no and now if now you can use this API
that as a hint whether maybe maybe the

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:07.309
that as a hint whether maybe maybe the
 

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:08.829
that as a hint whether maybe maybe the
user did not have enough context when

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839
user did not have enough context when
 

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:10.120
user did not have enough context when
they requested permission the previous

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.130
they requested permission the previous
 

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.639
they requested permission the previous
time when you request to the permission

00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:12.649
time when you request to the permission
 

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:14.499
time when you request to the permission
the previous time so you can help the

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:14.509
the previous time so you can help the
 

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:16.660
the previous time so you can help the
user and show this additional education

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:16.670
user and show this additional education
 

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.490
user and show this additional education
additional screen to explain why you

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:18.500
additional screen to explain why you
 

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.350
additional screen to explain why you
need the permission but again this is

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360
need the permission but again this is
 

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.569
need the permission but again this is
very optional and this is only if you

00:15:22.569 --> 00:15:22.579
very optional and this is only if you
 

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:24.069
very optional and this is only if you
feel that the user doesn't have enough

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079
feel that the user doesn't have enough
 

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:28.059
feel that the user doesn't have enough
context context we really think that

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:28.069
context context we really think that
 

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:29.290
context context we really think that
most of the time this shouldn't be

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
most of the time this shouldn't be
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.799
most of the time this shouldn't be
needed but in case you do is there there

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:32.809
needed but in case you do is there there
 

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:34.240
needed but in case you do is there there
is another case where you

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.250
is another case where you
 

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.850
is another case where you
have device policy that says no this

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:36.860
have device policy that says no this
 

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.580
have device policy that says no this
apps this application does not have this

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:39.590
apps this application does not have this
 

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.120
apps this application does not have this
permission and it cannot get it so the

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.130
permission and it cannot get it so the
 

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.950
permission and it cannot get it so the
way to read this API is permission

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:44.960
way to read this API is permission
 

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.860
way to read this API is permission
revoked by policy yes does the user have

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:47.870
revoked by policy yes does the user have
 

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.890
revoked by policy yes does the user have
the power to give me the permission so

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:50.900
the power to give me the permission so
 

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.360
the power to give me the permission so
if the user doesn't have the power to

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.370
if the user doesn't have the power to
 

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.880
if the user doesn't have the power to
give you the permission you may not even

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:54.890
give you the permission you may not even
 

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.180
give you the permission you may not even
expose the feature because or or you can

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:58.190
expose the feature because or or you can
 

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.160
expose the feature because or or you can
explain to the user that the the feature

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.170
explain to the user that the the feature
 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.590
explain to the user that the the feature
is not available because the policy

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600
is not available because the policy
 

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.100
is not available because the policy
doesn't allow this permission now that

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.110
doesn't allow this permission now that
 

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.890
doesn't allow this permission now that
we have all the building blocks here is

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:08.900
we have all the building blocks here is
 

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.670
we have all the building blocks here is
how we put them together it's really

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680
how we put them together it's really
 

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.650
how we put them together it's really
important the very first time the very

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:14.660
important the very first time the very
 

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.030
important the very first time the very
first thing you need to do when you call

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040
first thing you need to do when you call
 

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.040
first thing you need to do when you call
an permission protected EAP I always

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.050
an permission protected EAP I always
 

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.780
an permission protected EAP I always
always first check whether you have the

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:19.790
always first check whether you have the
 

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.900
always first check whether you have the
permission so if you don't if you have

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:22.910
permission so if you don't if you have
 

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.400
permission so if you don't if you have
the permission just go ahead into the

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.410
the permission just go ahead into the
 

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.150
the permission just go ahead into the
work if you don't have the permission

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160
work if you don't have the permission
 

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
work if you don't have the permission
now you can optionally check should I

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.170
now you can optionally check should I
 

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.140
now you can optionally check should I
show rationales so should I help the

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.150
show rationales so should I help the
 

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.170
show rationales so should I help the
user better understand why I need this

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:35.180
user better understand why I need this
 

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.850
user better understand why I need this
permission because these already if the

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:36.860
permission because these already if the
 

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.120
permission because these already if the
user already declined the permission and

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.130
user already declined the permission and
 

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.200
user already declined the permission and
otherwise you just go ahead and request

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.210
otherwise you just go ahead and request
 

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.020
otherwise you just go ahead and request
the permission once request the

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.030
the permission once request the
 

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.730
the permission once request the
permission you need to handle the result

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:45.740
permission you need to handle the result
 

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.280
permission you need to handle the result
based on what the user decided so this

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.290
based on what the user decided so this
 

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.990
based on what the user decided so this
is how permission result handling looks

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000
is how permission result handling looks
 

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.940
is how permission result handling looks
like so the first thing you need to

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:54.950
like so the first thing you need to
 

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.550
like so the first thing you need to
check is is this the request I made like

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560
check is is this the request I made like
 

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.640
check is is this the request I made like
is this the answer I'm waiting for if it

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:00.650
is this the answer I'm waiting for if it
 

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.340
is this the answer I'm waiting for if it
does the case the next check is is there

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:03.350
does the case the next check is is there
 

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.439
does the case the next check is is there
information in the answer so are this

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:05.449
information in the answer so are this
 

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:07.720
information in the answer so are this
arrays with permissions and results

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.730
arrays with permissions and results
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.370
arrays with permissions and results
empty so if they're they're usually

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.380
empty so if they're they're usually
 

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.120
empty so if they're they're usually
empty if there is a cancellation and the

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.130
empty if there is a cancellation and the
 

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.679
empty if there is a cancellation and the
next thing you check is did I get the

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:14.689
next thing you check is did I get the
 

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:16.030
next thing you check is did I get the
permission if you get the permission go

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.040
permission if you get the permission go
 

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.150
permission if you get the permission go
do the work so it's so great how do you

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160
do the work so it's so great how do you
 

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.650
do the work so it's so great how do you
get on the boat like how do you get on

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:23.660
get on the boat like how do you get on
 

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.939
get on the boat like how do you get on
the train how do you opt-in to the new

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:24.949
the train how do you opt-in to the new
 

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:27.130
the train how do you opt-in to the new
permission model it's based on the

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.140
permission model it's based on the
 

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.910
permission model it's based on the
target SDK so what you need to do is

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:29.920
target SDK so what you need to do is
 

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.530
target SDK so what you need to do is
change your target SDK to 23 and

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:32.540
change your target SDK to 23 and
 

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.720
change your target SDK to 23 and
magically use the new API and you're in

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:34.730
magically use the new API and you're in
 

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.270
magically use the new API and you're in
the new permission model it's important

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280
the new permission model it's important
 

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.520
the new permission model it's important
to note that there is no way out once

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:39.530
to note that there is no way out once
 

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.370
to note that there is no way out once
you get in there is no you cannot go

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:42.380
you get in there is no you cannot go
 

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.940
you get in there is no you cannot go
back to target SDK say 22 and this is

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:45.950
back to target SDK say 22 and this is
 

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.430
back to target SDK say 22 and this is
the main reason for that is we want to

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440
the main reason for that is we want to
 

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.960
the main reason for that is we want to
we really believe that runtime

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:49.970
we really believe that runtime
 

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.310
we really believe that runtime
permissions are really good for the user

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320
permissions are really good for the user
 

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.230
permissions are really good for the user
they're really good for developers

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240
they're really good for developers
 

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.750
they're really good for developers
they're good for the ecosystem and we

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760
they're good for the ecosystem and we
 

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.000
they're good for the ecosystem and we
really want to incentivize everybody to

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.010
really want to incentivize everybody to
 

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.900
really want to incentivize everybody to
use this new permission ball we have

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:01.910
use this new permission ball we have
 

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.640
use this new permission ball we have
this very special cases which I want to

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:03.650
this very special cases which I want to
 

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.610
this very special cases which I want to
point out a very very useful API one of

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:06.620
point out a very very useful API one of
 

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.799
point out a very very useful API one of
them is say you have a new feature that

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:08.809
them is say you have a new feature that
 

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:11.410
them is say you have a new feature that
you want to use so you want to add

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:11.420
you want to use so you want to add
 

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.380
you want to use so you want to add
camera feature only for M devices and

camera feature only for M devices and
 

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.260
camera feature only for M devices and
app you don't want to request the camera

adoption on all the platforms so what

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:21.530
adoption on all the platforms so what
 

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.260
adoption on all the platforms so what
you can do is hey I want to use this

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:23.270
you can do is hey I want to use this
 

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.180
you can do is hey I want to use this
permission but only on platforms that

corresponding API so in the support v4
library so you can use permissions from

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:45.890
library so you can use permissions from
 

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.190
library so you can use permissions from
the support library we also have API so

the support library we also have API so
 

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.310
the support library we also have API so
in the support library v13 if you want

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320
in the support library v13 if you want

and this is kind of an edge case which

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.110
and this is kind of an edge case which
 

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.680

again very edge case usually this

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299
again very edge case usually this
 

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:05.779
again very edge case usually this
happens when say I have an app that has

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:05.789
happens when say I have an app that has
 

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:09.590
happens when say I have an app that has
access to contacts and I decorate

access to contacts and I decorate
 

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.419
access to contacts and I decorate
contacts so for every contact I'm adding

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:11.429
contacts so for every contact I'm adding
 

00:20:11.429 --> 00:20:16.039

a smiley face for example and so when an
 

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.109
a smiley face for example and so when an
app is asking me so I have the contacts

00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:18.119

library to do this because it checks not
 

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:38.930
library to do this because it checks not
only the permission but should also

we disable the api's so the permission
 

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:49.609
we disable the api's so the permission
checker knows how to check the

checker knows how to check the
 

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:51.320
checker knows how to check the
permission and whether the API is

from the command line and I don't think
that's very useful for free developers

that's very useful for free developers
is you want to install the application

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:16.889
is you want to install the application
 

00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:19.460
is you want to install the application
with all permissions granted you use the

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.470
with all permissions granted you use the
 

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.159

all the via all those other details so

00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:18.389
all the via all those other details so
 

00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:20.389
all the via all those other details so
let's dig into the details for that

00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399
let's dig into the details for that
 

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:22.580
let's dig into the details for that
first example there's a handful of AP is

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:22.590
first example there's a handful of AP is
 

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.440
first example there's a handful of AP is
that were introduced in KitKat on

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:24.450
that were introduced in KitKat on
 

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.850
that were introduced in KitKat on
context called

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860
context called
 

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.060
context called

ders and when you call these the paths

00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799
ders and when you call these the paths
 

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:34.340
ders and when you call these the paths
that are returned they exist on the SD

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:34.350
that are returned they exist on the SD
 

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.499
that are returned they exist on the SD
card but they have your package name

00:26:36.499 --> 00:26:36.509
card but they have your package name
 

00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:37.820

burned into them

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:37.830
burned into them
 

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.259
burned into them
so if you look at the bottom you can see

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:39.269
so if you look at the bottom you can see
 

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:41.149
so if you look at the bottom you can see
the example of what those returned paths

00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159
the example of what those returned paths
 

00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:43.460
the example of what those returned paths
look like so notice it would be under

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.470
look like so notice it would be under
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.629
look like so notice it would be under
the SD card / Android / data /

00:26:46.629 --> 00:26:46.639
the SD card / Android / data /
 

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:48.619
the SD card / Android / data /
and there's a couple reasons for that

00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:48.629
and there's a couple reasons for that
 

00:26:48.629 --> 00:26:50.600
and there's a couple reasons for that
first of all that's how the system

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:50.610
first of all that's how the system
 

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.470
first of all that's how the system
recognizes who that data belongs to so

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480
recognizes who that data belongs to so
 

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.299
recognizes who that data belongs to so
that it can give you access to that data

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:56.309
that it can give you access to that data
 

00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:58.249
that it can give you access to that data
so the paths that are returned from

00:26:58.249 --> 00:26:58.259
so the paths that are returned from
 

00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:01.100
so the paths that are returned from
these api's your application always has

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.110
these api's your application always has
 

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.350
these api's your application always has
read and write access to any contents

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360
read and write access to any contents
 

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.180
read and write access to any contents
under those directories you're free to

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:05.190
under those directories you're free to
 

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.399
under those directories you're free to
create new directories new files at any

00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:07.409
create new directories new files at any
 

00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:09.320
create new directories new files at any
time and there are no permissions

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:09.330
time and there are no permissions
 

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.869
time and there are no permissions
required to do that you don't need to

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:11.879
required to do that you don't need to
 

00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:13.549
required to do that you don't need to
read you don't need to request those

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559
read you don't need to request those
 

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:15.979
read you don't need to request those
read or write permissions on it they

00:27:15.979 --> 00:27:15.989
read or write permissions on it they
 

00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:17.330
read or write permissions on it they
still will work even if you have those

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340
still will work even if you have those
 

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.560
still will work even if you have those
permissions but you don't need to

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:18.570
permissions but you don't need to
 

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.899
permissions but you don't need to
request them the other benefit here is

00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:20.909
request them the other benefit here is
 

00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:22.789
request them the other benefit here is
that there's better accountability on

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799
that there's better accountability on
 

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.190
that there's better accountability on
the user as they if they go to uninstall

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200
the user as they if they go to uninstall
 

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.509
the user as they if they go to uninstall
your application the system will

00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:26.519
your application the system will
 

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:28.580
your application the system will
automatically clean up any files that

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:28.590
automatically clean up any files that
 

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.779
automatically clean up any files that
you've chosen to store in those

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:29.789
you've chosen to store in those
 

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:32.450
you've chosen to store in those
locations in addition if the user goes

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460
locations in addition if the user goes
 

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.519
locations in addition if the user goes
into settings to see where their disk

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:34.529
into settings to see where their disk
 

00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:35.690
into settings to see where their disk
space is being used

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700
space is being used
 

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.159
space is being used
it'll be accounted against your

00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:37.169
it'll be accounted against your
 

00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:39.019
it'll be accounted against your
application correctly so it's better for

00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:39.029
application correctly so it's better for
 

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:40.779
application correctly so it's better for
a lot of different reasons

00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:40.789
a lot of different reasons
 

00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:43.039
a lot of different reasons
the next example that we talked about

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:43.049
the next example that we talked about
 

00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:45.590
the next example that we talked about
was just looking to pick an individual

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600
was just looking to pick an individual
 

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.899
was just looking to pick an individual
file or work with a handful of files and

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:47.909
file or work with a handful of files and
 

00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:49.700
file or work with a handful of files and
this is where I'd like to take a second

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:49.710
this is where I'd like to take a second
 

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.840
this is where I'd like to take a second
to talk about the storage access

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:50.850
to talk about the storage access
 

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.060
to talk about the storage access
framework this is something that we

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.070
framework this is something that we
 

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.099
framework this is something that we
built in KitKat and it's really an

00:27:55.099 --> 00:27:55.109
built in KitKat and it's really an
 

00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:57.320
built in KitKat and it's really an
abstraction layer between apps that

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.330
abstraction layer between apps that
 

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.680
abstraction layer between apps that
offer to store files or data say like an

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:00.690
offer to store files or data say like an
 

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.259
offer to store files or data say like an
SD card or Google Drive in the cloud and

00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:03.269
SD card or Google Drive in the cloud and
 

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:05.779
SD card or Google Drive in the cloud and
apps that offer to work with content or

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:05.789
apps that offer to work with content or
 

00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:08.810
apps that offer to work with content or
files say like a document editor or a

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820
files say like a document editor or a
 

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.989
files say like a document editor or a
photo editor so in this case instead of

00:28:11.989 --> 00:28:11.999
photo editor so in this case instead of
 

00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:13.399
photo editor so in this case instead of
asking the user for those broad

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:13.409
asking the user for those broad
 

00:28:13.409 --> 00:28:15.739
asking the user for those broad
permissions asking for all of the files

00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:15.749
permissions asking for all of the files
 

00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:17.989
permissions asking for all of the files
on their SD card or all of the contents

00:28:17.989 --> 00:28:17.999
on their SD card or all of the contents
 

00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:19.849

handful of common intents that go into

00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399
handful of common intents that go into
 

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:25.460
handful of common intents that go into
the storage access framework and ask the

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:25.470
the storage access framework and ask the
 

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.009

and it gives users more freedom and

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:24.510
and it gives users more freedom and
 

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.990
and it gives users more freedom and
flexibility so then you might ask the

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000
flexibility so then you might ask the
 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.970
flexibility so then you might ask the

actually we'll take a look at just some

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480
actually we'll take a look at just some
 

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.540
actually we'll take a look at just some
of that UI around that experience so

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:32.550
of that UI around that experience so
 

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.280
of that UI around that experience so

with how to navigate and use to navigate
and pick the files that they're

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:08.490
and pick the files that they're
 

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.340
and pick the files that they're
interested in and this is beneficial for

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.350
interested in and this is beneficial for
 

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.170
interested in and this is beneficial for
the user because they can get the tasks

that they want to do they can get that
 

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.800
that they want to do they can get that
done faster they understand they

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:15.810
done faster they understand they

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520
understand how to interact with this
 

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.540
understand how to interact with this
framework so now let's dig a little bit

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:20.550
framework so now let's dig a little bit
 

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.520
framework so now let's dig a little bit
deeper under the hood how does storage

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:22.530
deeper under the hood how does storage
 

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.500
deeper under the hood how does storage
access framework actually work and I'll

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:24.510
access framework actually work and I'll
 

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.630
access framework actually work and I'll
talk a little bit about URI permission

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640
talk a little bit about URI permission
 

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.570
talk a little bit about URI permission
grants so all the stuff we talked about

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580
grants so all the stuff we talked about
 

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.070
grants so all the stuff we talked about
earlier today are focusing in on

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080
earlier today are focusing in on
 

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.350
earlier today are focusing in on
traditional Android permissions which

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360
traditional Android permissions which
 

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.750
traditional Android permissions which
are a string like Android permission

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760
are a string like Android permission
 

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.790
are a string like Android permission
read external storage and that's

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:37.800
read external storage and that's
 

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.470
read external storage and that's
something that your app requests in your

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480
something that your app requests in your
 

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.300
something that your app requests in your
manifest and when the user grants that

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.310
manifest and when the user grants that
 

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.610
manifest and when the user grants that
access you're granted that for the rest

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620
access you're granted that for the rest
 

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.990
access you're granted that for the rest
of the the lifetime of your app either

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000
of the the lifetime of your app either
 

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.090
of the the lifetime of your app either
until the user uninstalls you or until

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100
until the user uninstalls you or until
 

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.890
until the user uninstalls you or until
the user goes into settings and revokes

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:48.900
the user goes into settings and revokes
 

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.890
the user goes into settings and revokes
that permission URI permission grants

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:51.900
that permission URI permission grants
 

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.480
that permission URI permission grants
are slightly different and the fact

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:53.490
are slightly different and the fact
 

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.010
are slightly different and the fact
they're centered around content

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020
they're centered around content
 

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.960
they're centered around content
providers so a content provider it

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:56.970
providers so a content provider it
 

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.670
providers so a content provider it
surfaces its content on the system

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:58.680
surfaces its content on the system
 

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.560
surfaces its content on the system
through a URI a content

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:00.570
through a URI a content
 

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.529
through a URI a content
: / / an authority and then a path name

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539
: / / an authority and then a path name
 

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:06.110
: / / an authority and then a path name
and the power here with with Uri

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120
and the power here with with Uri
 

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.539
and the power here with with Uri
permissions is that we can grant access

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:08.549
permissions is that we can grant access
 

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:11.180
permissions is that we can grant access
to a very specific path inside of a

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.190
to a very specific path inside of a
 

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.220
to a very specific path inside of a
content provider for a limited amount of

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.230
content provider for a limited amount of
 

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.799
content provider for a limited amount of
time so for example if I just took a

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:15.809
time so for example if I just took a
 

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:17.659
time so for example if I just took a
photo in my app and I want to share it

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:17.669
photo in my app and I want to share it
 

00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:20.149
photo in my app and I want to share it
with someone else I don't I can extend

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159
with someone else I don't I can extend
 

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:22.370
with someone else I don't I can extend
access to just that photo that I just

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380
access to just that photo that I just
 

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.810
access to just that photo that I just
took to the receiving app at the other

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820
took to the receiving app at the other
 

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.840
took to the receiving app at the other
end temporarily and the lifetime of that

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:26.850
end temporarily and the lifetime of that
 

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.180
end temporarily and the lifetime of that
permission is until that activity stack

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.190
permission is until that activity stack
 

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.519
permission is until that activity stack
finishes so I extend them access maybe

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:31.529
finishes so I extend them access maybe
 

00:31:31.529 --> 00:31:32.840
finishes so I extend them access maybe

so you might be asking the question how

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:46.830
so you might be asking the question how

so you might be asking the question how
do I wire this up inside of my app and

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:49.379
do I wire this up inside of my app and
 

00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:51.499
do I wire this up inside of my app and
one of the easiest ways to do that is

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:51.509
one of the easiest ways to do that is
 

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.269
one of the easiest ways to do that is
using the class called file provider in

a file on disk you can convert it into
 

00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:02.180
a file on disk you can convert it into
one of these content URIs that then you

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.190
one of these content URIs that then you
 

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.340
one of these content URIs that then you
can stick into just a traditional intent

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:04.350
can stick into just a traditional intent

camera permission and build your own UI
 

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.950
camera permission and build your own UI
and then you need to represent advanced

and functionality you're probably gonna
do that in a different way using

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.190
do that in a different way using
 

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.190
do that in a different way using
different UI then the user is used to

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.360
these intents and that's something we
don't want to encourage if you need the

if you don't need the full camera
permission just use one of these intents

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:46.990
permission just use one of these intents
 

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.140
permission just use one of these intents
and the reality is if you ask for the

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.150
and the reality is if you ask for the
 

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.970
and the reality is if you ask for the
camera permission and the user denies

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:50.980
camera permission and the user denies
 

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.710
camera permission and the user denies
you and then if you try using one of

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720
you and then if you try using one of
 

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.570
you and then if you try using one of
these intents the system will throw a

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:54.580
these intents the system will throw a
 

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.490
these intents the system will throw a
security exception at you so this is

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:56.500
security exception at you so this is
 

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.140
security exception at you so this is
purposely we want to have me focus on

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.150
purposely we want to have me focus on
 

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.400
purposely we want to have me focus on
either one path or the other contacts

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.410
either one path or the other contacts
 

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.750
either one path or the other contacts
permission let's talk about those

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760
permission let's talk about those
 

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.700
permission let's talk about those
redirect contacts and again this is

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:05.710
redirect contacts and again this is
 

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.590
redirect contacts and again this is
accessing all the users contacts all the

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:07.600
accessing all the users contacts all the
 

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.540
accessing all the users contacts all the

when in reality you may only be

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:11.290
when in reality you may only be
 

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.160
when in reality you may only be
interested in just reading one contact

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.170
interested in just reading one contact
 

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.480
interested in just reading one contact
you want to share something with one

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:15.490
you want to share something with one
 

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.070
you want to share something with one
person or maybe you just want to add a

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.080
person or maybe you just want to add a
 

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.750
person or maybe you just want to add a
little bit of additional detail to an

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760
little bit of additional detail to an
 

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.220
little bit of additional detail to an
existing contact maybe a new email

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.230
existing contact maybe a new email
 

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.900
existing contact maybe a new email
address so we'll dig into two quick

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:21.910
address so we'll dig into two quick
 

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.960
address so we'll dig into two quick
examples related to those first there's

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:24.970
examples related to those first there's
 

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.850
examples related to those first there's
action pic you can launch that action

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:26.860
action pic you can launch that action
 

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.410
action pic you can launch that action
pic intent and ask the user picked me a

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:28.420
pic intent and ask the user picked me a
 

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.110
pic intent and ask the user picked me a
contact and return access back um and

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.120
contact and return access back um and
 

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.820
contact and return access back um and
this under the hood is using those same

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:32.830
this under the hood is using those same
 

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.440
this under the hood is using those same
URI permission grants that we talked

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:34.450
URI permission grants that we talked
 

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.240
URI permission grants that we talked
about a few moments ago when you launch

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.250
about a few moments ago when you launch
 

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.560
about a few moments ago when you launch
towards the system asking the user to

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:37.570

to see any of the other contacts but
 

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.140
to see any of the other contacts but
just the one that user selected so

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.150
just the one that user selected so
 

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.610
just the one that user selected so
here's that that quick example and

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:50.620
here's that that quick example and
 

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.620
here's that that quick example and
there's more details if you go to the

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:52.630
there's more details if you go to the

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:22.630
this from it for you for those
 

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.780
this from it for you for those
permissions and consider using some of

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:24.790
permissions and consider using some of
 

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.040
permissions and consider using some of
these strategies that we just talked

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.050
these strategies that we just talked
 

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.320
these strategies that we just talked
about to build your apps without having

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:28.330
about to build your apps without having
 

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.850
about to build your apps without having
to ask for those permissions in the

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:29.860
to ask for those permissions in the
 

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.450
to ask for those permissions in the
first place

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:30.460
first place
 

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.950
first place
in a way that you can still accomplish

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960
in a way that you can still accomplish
 

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.480
in a way that you can still accomplish
the goals build the app that you want to

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:33.490
the goals build the app that you want to
 

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.620
the goals build the app that you want to
build with the functionality that you

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:34.630
build with the functionality that you
 

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.750
build with the functionality that you
need but without asking for those those

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760
need but without asking for those those
 

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.030
need but without asking for those those
broad permissions and finally we talked

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040
broad permissions and finally we talked
 

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.820
broad permissions and finally we talked
about those intent patterns so the

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:41.830
about those intent patterns so the
 

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.680
about those intent patterns so the
intents where the user is given common

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:43.690
intents where the user is given common
 

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.690
intents where the user is given common
familiar UI I saw there have a

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:45.700
familiar UI I saw there have a
 

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.890
familiar UI I saw there have a
consistent experience and they're able

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:46.900
consistent experience and they're able
 

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.180
consistent experience and they're able
to accomplish whatever they're trying to

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:48.190
to accomplish whatever they're trying to
 

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.820
to accomplish whatever they're trying to
do faster so hopefully you have a big

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:50.830
do faster so hopefully you have a big
 

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.310
do faster so hopefully you have a big
better picture of marshmallow and how

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:53.320
better picture of marshmallow and how
 

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.470
better picture of marshmallow and how
the permissions have evolved and so

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480
the permissions have evolved and so
 

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.180
the permissions have evolved and so
spent and I will be available we're

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:57.190
spent and I will be available we're
 

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.730
spent and I will be available we're
running out of time will be available at

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740
running out of time will be available at
 

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.720
running out of time will be available at
office hours later this evening if you

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:00.730
office hours later this evening if you
 

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.210
office hours later this evening if you
have questions for either of us but with

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.220
