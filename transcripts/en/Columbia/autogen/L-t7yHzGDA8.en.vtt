alright let's see it was make it big

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720
 
 

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.090
 
maybe i just had not been looking in the

maybe i just had not been looking in the
 

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.070
maybe i just had not been looking in the
right directions maybe i didn't see the

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080
right directions maybe i didn't see the
 

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.110
right directions maybe i didn't see the
potential that i had maybe other people

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120
potential that i had maybe other people
 

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.650
potential that i had maybe other people
weren't seeing the potential that i had

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.660
weren't seeing the potential that i had
 

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.050
weren't seeing the potential that i had
but it looked like i was stuck in the

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:06.060
but it looked like i was stuck in the
 

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.230
but it looked like i was stuck in the
same track probably from now till when

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240

giving it up given an opportunity to
reinvent myself and this program was

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:18.300
reinvent myself and this program was
 

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.060
reinvent myself and this program was
sort of the spark that got the whole

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.070
sort of the spark that got the whole
 

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.690
sort of the spark that got the whole
thing going

intentionally cultivate in our libraries
 

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.110
intentionally cultivate in our libraries
and i'll talk a little bit about why but

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.450
speak up they are disengaged in their
pissed and they spread it around so this

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460
pissed and they spread it around so this
 

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.520
pissed and they spread it around so this
is this is like this is the scary thing

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:10.530
is this is like this is the scary thing
 

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.740
is this is like this is the scary thing
I mean it's sad to be not engaged in

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:12.750
I mean it's sad to be not engaged in
 

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.720
I mean it's sad to be not engaged in
your work but to be actively disengaged

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:14.730
your work but to be actively disengaged
 

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.420
your work but to be actively disengaged
is worse and then this little bit

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:17.430
is worse and then this little bit
 

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.590
is worse and then this little bit
smoother you can hardly see is two

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:18.600
smoother you can hardly see is two
 

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.570
smoother you can hardly see is two
percent guess guess who the two

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:20.580
percent guess guess who the two
 

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.200
percent guess guess who the two
percenters are ya the ones that were

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.210
percenters are ya the ones that were
 

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.160
percenters are ya the ones that were
engaged so congratulations if you made

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.170
engaged so congratulations if you made
 

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.230
engaged so congratulations if you made
it to the two percent it probably means

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240
it to the two percent it probably means
 

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.090
it to the two percent it probably means
you are very dedicated and you're very

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:32.100

would our slice would be a little bit

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:42.500
would our slice would be a little bit
 

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.780
would our slice would be a little bit
bigger because we are so outward focused

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:45.790
bigger because we are so outward focused
 

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.070
bigger because we are so outward focused
so those are three really good reasons

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.080
so those are three really good reasons
 

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.510
so those are three really good reasons
why we're very very interested in

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520
why we're very very interested in
 

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.880

leadership development the first thing

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:51.890
leadership development the first thing
 

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.710
leadership development the first thing
is that we are spawning a ton of

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720
is that we are spawning a ton of
 

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.960
is that we are spawning a ton of
initiatives with programs connected to

initiatives with programs connected to
 

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.090
initiatives with programs connected to
them that need leadership we are doing

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:58.100
them that need leadership we are doing
 

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.980
them that need leadership we are doing
more and more of our work in projects

00:38:59.980 --> 00:38:59.990
more and more of our work in projects
 

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.280
more and more of our work in projects
and committees and the third is that we

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.290
and committees and the third is that we
 

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.610
and committees and the third is that we
really care about the pipeline we don't

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:06.620
really care about the pipeline we don't
 

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.320
really care about the pipeline we don't
want to plug up the pipeline an

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:08.330

not everything is going to work for your
 

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.880
not everything is going to work for your
library but some pieces might or some

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:00.890
library but some pieces might or some
 

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.460

ways to adapt these programs might work

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.470
ways to adapt these programs might work
 

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.900

i'm going to talk about how much it
 

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.920
i'm going to talk about how much it
costs okay so the first program i want

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:23.930
costs okay so the first program i want
 

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.180
costs okay so the first program i want
it i want to introduce by way of this

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.190
it i want to introduce by way of this
 

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.830

00:45:22.439 --> 00:45:22.449
was she talked to me about it she was
 

00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:24.029
was she talked to me about it she was
thinking this was not the right decision

00:45:24.029 --> 00:45:24.039
thinking this was not the right decision
 

00:45:24.039 --> 00:45:26.009
thinking this was not the right decision
for her she felt like she couldn't bring

00:45:26.009 --> 00:45:26.019
for her she felt like she couldn't bring
 

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:28.559

her full personality her full self to
 

00:45:28.569 --> 00:45:31.019
her full personality her full self to
the job and this program helped her

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:31.029
the job and this program helped her
 

00:45:31.029 --> 00:45:32.519
the job and this program helped her
figure out ways to deal with that

00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:32.529
figure out ways to deal with that
 

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:35.189
figure out ways to deal with that
address it and I'd really step out step

00:45:35.189 --> 00:45:35.199
address it and I'd really step out step
 

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:39.299
address it and I'd really step out step
into her own leadership I also asked the

00:45:39.299 --> 00:45:39.309
into her own leadership I also asked the
 

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:40.739
into her own leadership I also asked the
supervisors of the people in the program

00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:40.749
supervisors of the people in the program
 

00:45:40.749 --> 00:45:43.019
supervisors of the people in the program
what they think and I have to say that

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:43.029
what they think and I have to say that
 

00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:47.339
what they think and I have to say that
over overall confidence comes out at the

mean people it's sometimes they just

00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:52.569
mean people it's sometimes they just
 

00:45:52.569 --> 00:45:54.630
mean people it's sometimes they just
need a little cultivating and a little

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640
need a little cultivating and a little
 

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.509
need a little cultivating and a little
support to step fully into that identity

00:45:57.509 --> 00:45:57.519
support to step fully into that identity
 

00:45:57.519 --> 00:46:02.670
support to step fully into that identity
as a leader so this is a this is one of

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680
as a leader so this is a this is one of
 

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.099
as a leader so this is a this is one of
one quote from one of the supervisors

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:07.109
 
 

00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:11.999
 
here's another these are real problems

00:46:11.999 --> 00:46:12.009
here's another these are real problems
 

00:46:12.009 --> 00:46:13.559
here's another these are real problems
that people were having that the

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:13.569
that people were having that the
 

00:46:13.569 --> 00:46:15.439
that people were having that the
supervisors neces couldn't necessarily

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:15.449
supervisors neces couldn't necessarily
 

00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:18.509
supervisors neces couldn't necessarily
fix they couldn't address it they didn't

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:18.519
fix they couldn't address it they didn't
 

00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:27.739
fix they couldn't address it they didn't
know how to do that so some really nice

00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:27.749
know how to do that so some really nice
 

00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:30.029
know how to do that so some really nice
benefit so I hope that you're thinking

00:46:30.029 --> 00:46:30.039
benefit so I hope that you're thinking
 

00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:31.769
benefit so I hope that you're thinking
in your head cost-benefit analysis cost

cost benefit analysis as you're looking
at these all right so let me look at the

00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:37.569
at these all right so let me look at the
 

00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:39.900
at these all right so let me look at the
concerns the biggest concern from the

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:39.910
concerns the biggest concern from the
 

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.900
concerns the biggest concern from the
supervisors is not knowing what calls

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:42.910
supervisors is not knowing what calls
 

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.269
supervisors is not knowing what calls
what there's no causation here it's not

what there's no causation here it's not
 

00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:46.769
what there's no causation here it's not
like you put a person through this

00:46:46.769 --> 00:46:46.779
like you put a person through this
 

00:46:46.779 --> 00:46:49.229
like you put a person through this
program and you can say ha here's what

00:46:49.229 --> 00:46:49.239
program and you can say ha here's what
 

00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.789

yeah they have concerns about it because
 

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.070
yeah they have concerns about it because
they don't really know what the program

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:38.080
they don't really know what the program
 

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.720
they don't really know what the program
is actually doing what the impact is

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:39.730
is actually doing what the impact is
 

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.570
is actually doing what the impact is
having on impact that every time I ask

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:42.580

ettinger have driven a program to run
 

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.950
ettinger have driven a program to run
for three years and we're expanding the

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960
for three years and we're expanding the
 

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.210
for three years and we're expanding the
program next year and I'll talk a little

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:57.220
program next year and I'll talk a little
 

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.390
program next year and I'll talk a little
bit about that so what's what's it worth

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400
bit about that so what's what's it worth
 

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.680
bit about that so what's what's it worth
to people that's really where the rubber

somebody in this program how much would

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:05.560
somebody in this program how much would

you pay out of your operations budget

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.060
you pay out of your operations budget
 

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.790
you pay out of your operations budget
your discretionary budget to put

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800
your discretionary budget to put
 

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.870
your discretionary budget to put
somebody through a program like this

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880
somebody through a program like this
 

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.870
somebody through a program like this
that's really where I think it we learn

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880
that's really where I think it we learn
 

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.850
that's really where I think it we learn
about the value and so here's what we

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:14.860
about the value and so here's what we
 

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.180
about the value and so here's what we
heard sixty-six percent of the

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:18.190
heard sixty-six percent of the
 

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.980
heard sixty-six percent of the
