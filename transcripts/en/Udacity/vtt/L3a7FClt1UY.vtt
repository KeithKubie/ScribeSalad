00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.810
Okay, so here's a probability distribution I'm going to define

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.830
for you Michael. You'll notice that it's a probability over

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.640
our Xs. And it's parameterized by theta. So theta is

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.310
going to turn out to stand for threshold. Okay? Got it?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.350
&gt;&gt; Mmhm.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's a probability distribution. It is 1 over z sub theta. For

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.410
all values of x such that the fitness

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.810
function is greater than or equal to theta.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.840
&gt;&gt; And it's 0 otherwise. So do you understand that?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.200
&gt;&gt; I think so. So I assume that Z sub

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.430
theta here is, is going to be some kind of normalization factor that

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.080
accounts for the probability of landing or choosing an x

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.970
in that space. In the space of high-scoring individuals above threshold.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.400
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So another way of saying this is that the this

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.710
probability is uniform over all values of x whose

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.026
fitness are above some threshold.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah so, I'm, I'm, the image I have in my

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.700
hand is kind of like a mountain range and if you

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.980
put a slice through it then everything that's kind of above

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.840
that slice, if we are going to sample uniformly from that, that collection.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.470
&gt;&gt; That's right. And everything below it, we will simply ignore.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.990
&gt;&gt; Doesn't happen, it doesn't get sampled form.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Okay so because you demanded it Michael, here's a quiz.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Alright.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.890
&gt;&gt; So,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.160
two questions in this quiz. The first question

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.066
is, theta's some threshold and so let's imagine the

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.920
fitness function has to have some minimum value

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.060
and some maximum value. Okay? And let's call those

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.870
theta submin and theta submax respectively. And so I want you to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.010
describe in one or two words P sup data

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.364
min of x. That is the probability distribution whether threshold is its minimum

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:46.630
value, and P sup data max of x. That is, the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.680
distribution where theta is at it's maximum value. You got it?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.080
&gt;&gt; So, just to, just to be clear,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.190
sort of the maximum meaningful and minimum meaningful values

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.280
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.930
&gt;&gt; Because I can imagine them, you know, if it's just sort of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.520
way outside the range of the fitness

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.660
function then it's kind of trivial, I guess.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.820
&gt;&gt; Right, well, let's, it is, but let's assume that theta min is the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.660
lowest value that the fitness function can take on and theta max is the largest

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.580
value of the fitness function.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, okay, that's how I was imagining it.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, I'm good to go.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. So go!
