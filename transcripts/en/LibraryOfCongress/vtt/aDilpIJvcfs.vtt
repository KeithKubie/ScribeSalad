&gt;&gt; From the library of
congress, in Washington DC.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; So next up here at the National
Book festival we'll be hearing a

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.970
portion of LOBA by
Verónica Murguía.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.780
Verónica is a Mexican born, fantasy
writer who has won multiple prizes

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.190
for her children's
literature and novels.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:34.030 position:56%
In 2005 her book AULIYA, A-U-L-I-Y-A
was name one of the books

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.670
of the year by Banca del
Libro of Venezuela as well

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.950
as being translated in German,
Italian, and Portuguese.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.770
That's three more languages
than I know, because I know two.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.850
Her fantasy novel, which we'll hear

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.110
from today LOBA was awarded the
Grand Angular prize in 2013,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.620
from Spain, and we cannot
wait to hear some of it today.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.440
After the talk, you can have
Miss Murguía Sign a book for you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.700
at the book signing area which is
down, all the way down the hallway

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.090
in the book signing area from
3 o'clock to 4 o'clock today.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.150 position:56%
I'm so excited to hear from this
book, it just sounds like it's going

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.060
to be so interesting, and so
to welcome us to the stage is,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.510
if you could please
welcome Verónica Murguía.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:42.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.550
&gt;&gt; Verónica Murguía: Hi guys,
you have to be patient with me

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.970
because Loba has not been
translated into English, so,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.360
and it's a really thick
and big book,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.910
so I thought maybe I could
talk to you about my books.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.570
The most recent books that I
wrote that are for little children

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.030
and maybe I could talk to you
about what does a writer do,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.240
because most people think
that writers are very inspired

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.750
and they just come up with the
stories, but I'm not like that,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.140
I have to work a lot at it because
I'm not very smart, but I try,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
and the book I'm going to talk to
you about is a book that I really

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.350 position:56%
like because is a book for children.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.830
The name is "Rani", that
the name of an elephant.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.800
"Timbo", that's the name of my cat.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.580
My cat's real name is Timo, but
I put Timbo, I don't know why,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.440
maybe to preserve his privacy,
and "La hija de Tláloc",

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.400
that means "The daughter
of Tláloc".

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.360
Tláloc is the God of rain in
ancient pre-Hispanic mythology.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.520
And I decided to write
this story because I go

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.920
around the zoo in Mexico City.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.950 position:56%
The zoo is in the middle of a
forest that is called "Chapultepec".

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.540
It's like Central Park, you
know Central Park in New York?

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.440
You do. Well is like kind of
like Central Park but it's older,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.320
and since before the Spanish
people came to Mexico,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.750
it was there, and it
had a zoo there.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.050
It was kind of not a very nice
zoo because it had animals,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.320
but also had people in it,
because the ancient emperors

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.160
of Mexico wanted people in their
zoo, they were not very nice.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.800
And I don't know if you know

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.870
but Mexico has a very dramatic
story-- History, and story also.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.240
When the Spanish people came they
found the ancient Aztec empire,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.190
they clashed, and the built a
city on top of another city.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.680
So my city is very old.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.810
The first persons that
lived in that city,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.000
lived in it about 2000 years
ago, so it's a really old city,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.630
and it was built on top of a
lake, and when the Spanish came

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.160
to live there, they drained the
lake and we don't have water.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.380
But that's just one of the things
that I wanted to write about,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.060
because in the same place where the
pre-Hispanic emperor had his zoo,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.240
the modern people of Mexico
built another zoo with animals.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.240 position:56%
And in there, there lived three
elephants that I used to go and look

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.880 position:56%
at them, and I liked them very much.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.050
But I think the space they
had them in, it was too small

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.650
because the elephants use to move
like this, the three of them,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.790
very close so each other
and they were kind of sad,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.810
they didn't like being there, so
I imagined the talks they had.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.500
What would the tell each other?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.290
Their story about being
an elephant in a zoo.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.520
And I imagined that one of them
would not like being there,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.430
the young one, born in captivity.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.840
I'm talking about real animals,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.560
I just imagined the
dialogues between them.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.180 position:56%
The younger one was born in the zoo,
but the other ones were in a circus,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.990
and a very poor circus
that went around the county

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.300
and they were badly mistreated,
and they were rescued by the people

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.520
in the zoo and put there in the
cage, but they weren't happy either

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.050
because I think they wanted
to live in a wider place.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.070
But I imagine the dialogues
like something

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.870
like the aunts telling the small
one - It's better to be born here

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.130
than being in the circus, because
in the circus you have to work

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.790
for your food, and in the zoo you
just have to move your trunk around

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.670 position:56%
and just say hello to the kids and
that's the way you earn your living.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.680
And I invented that my cat
would live in the street

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.790
and then go into the zoo at night.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.040
He would creep into the zoo
and talk to the animals.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.120
And one day the cat got
into the hyenas' cage

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.470
and the hyenas were very happy to
see him but they got carried away

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.390
and bit his ear off
and the elephants heard

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.640
and they were very
angry and they said --

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.720
If you ever, ever touch this cat
again we will break down our cage

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.240 position:56%
and go and slap you with our trunks.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.330
And the hyenas were really scared

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.400
and they promised never
to touch the cat again.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.740
And the cat would go and
live with the elephants.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.990
And the cat would go out during the
day time to see what was happening

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.390
around the zoo and he saw a little
Indian girl, and this part is true,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.980
a little Indian girl who
didn't have a place to live

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.990
that was selling candy in
a corner, and he would see

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.490
that little Indian every day,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.730
and the girl was there
selling her candy.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.760
In front of the place
where this girl used

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.180
to sell her candy it's
a very big museum

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.440
where the big gods of
the Aztecs are kept.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.200
There is a huge, enormous,
gigantic statue

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.150
of a god whose name is Tláloc
and he was the god of rain.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:55.860
And the god Tláloc in my story
is the father of that little girl

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.610
because that little girl
in disguise is a goddess.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.940
And one day she was selling her
candy and one man tried not to pay

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.390
and to slap her and the little cat
got really angry and bit the man.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.710
And the goddess was thankful to
the cat and gave him a candy.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.490
A candy that would give
him all he wished for,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.860
just once, not eternally.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.570
But the cat was so
happy living in the --

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.790
around the zoo with his friends

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.300
that he didn't have any
wish for anything special.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.900
Cats don't drive cars, they don't
need houses, they don't need us,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.970
they just need food
and just have fun.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:46.500
He is a fast cat who made fun of
dogs, he would bite a dog's tail

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.500
and go running, so he didn't need
anything and he hid his candy.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.580 position:56%
But one day when the youngest of
the elephants was really, really sad

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:04.740
and bored being there in a cage,
the aunts told her - don't be sad,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.660
because we elephants, we
have a story a nice story.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.750
We used to have princes on our
backs and carry them around.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.490
In India, princes used
to go on top of us.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.840
And this that I'm about to tell
you is true, the absolute true.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.120
Harun al-Rashid, this
guy that appears in the -

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.250
"1001 Knight" you call it?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.070
No, "Arabian Knights", that the way
you call the book in English right?

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.610
Well, that guy Charlemagne,
the emperor of France,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.440
gave him an elephant as a gift,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.330
and this elephant was very
brave and he died in battle.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.880
He and this elephant was the first
elephant to ever be in France,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.940
and the people were really
in awe of this elephant

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.680
because it was very smart too.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.030
So the aunts tell the little
elephant the story and she wants

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.180
to carry a prince in her back.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.650
So what she does is that the,
she tells the little cat,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.560
the cat gives her the candy and she
goes to a statue that is in Mexico,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.310
is a statue that is
between two very big avenues

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.010
and there's a prince there.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.190
A prince that when he was 17
years old, he defended the city

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.050
against the Spanish and he was
very brave, and the elephant,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.570 position:56%
because of the magic of the goddess,
could carry him around for a night

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.370
because the statue came to life.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.930
That's the story I wrote and I
will tell you why I wrote it.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.730
I wrote it because one of the
things that makes me very angry

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.830
in my country is to see
children working in the streets,

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.210
and there are many children
working in the streets,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.310
and they have to earn money
to eat and I don't like that.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.360
Because children should be
the way you are right now.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.110
Listening to people tell
stories, playing, reading,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.730
waiting for your parents to buy
you a book, going to school.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.190
That's what children
should do, not work,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.760
but there are many children
working in the streets of my city

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.910
and I get really angry at that.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:37.450
So I wrote this story so the child
in the story would have power

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.200
and be important and
do whatever she wanted.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.730
And I also wrote the story because
I like animals and I like the zoo

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.740
but I'm always questioning myself,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.330
if zoos are a good
option for animals.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.430
I really don't know.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.400
Any of you know?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.090
What would you like if you
were an elephant to live

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.830 position:56%
in the jungle or to live in the zoo?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.730
You tell me.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.930
The jungle yeah!

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.410
I think they would -- all of them
would like to be in the jungle.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.270
Who else has an opinion?

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.770
You? The jungle.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.480
You? Yeah!

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.760
You? The jungle.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.660
Think. Would you rather
be in the jungle even

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.980
if you didn't have any kids waving
at you and giving you candy?

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.700
Yeah, well that's what I think.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.920
And now I ask you --
You like the zoo?

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.290
You like it?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.380
Yeah! That's a very tough
thing to answer because I

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.360
like to go watch the animals but
maybe they don't like being there,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.770 position:56%
so I don't know what to do, that's
why I wrote the book so I could talk

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.870
to children and children
would tell me what they think.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.170
What do you think?

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.930

don't know how to answer it.

maybe what you're saying can be

more Orcas in Sea World,

no matter if they are beautiful.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.980
They are too big to
be kept in a pool.

Don't you think that?

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:08.220
So, we have to make animals
happy, we all agree on that.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:14.400
And we have to make all children
happy too, don't you think so?

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.240
El fuego ardía quedamente
en la habitación de Soledad.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.420 position:56%
Ala Gris el halcón de la joven
miraba desde su percha la cama donde

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.950
dormían su dueña y
Edurne la vieja nodriza.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.920
Soledad había comprado el
halcón, un neblí todavía pollo,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.790
a un mercader que trataba
con aves de cetrería.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.470
El mercader, un árabe elegante y
taciturno que parecía conocer el

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:21.280 position:56%
idioma de las aves, las transportaba
en nau de infieles desde Aljaviva.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.500
Elegisteis bien señora,
es un macho,

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.200
pero sabrá ser tan
audaz como las hembras.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.240
Cuando termine de crecer tendrá la
alas más cortas que los halcones

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.250
noruegos que tanto le
gustan a vuestro padre,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.350
pero os aseguro que será
más rápido que ellos.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.340
Yo mismo lo robé del nido,

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.860
aunque no tenía casi plumas
quiso volar y herirme.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.960
El árabe sonrió y sus dientes
brillaron en la cara morena y

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.440
curtida por el sol
y el aire del mar.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.930
Tened paciencia con él, dijo
antes de recoger su paga.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.850
Soledad miró el vuelto
tibio que piaba en sus manos,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:03.060
a pesar de su ligereza y su
pequeñez el pollo estiraba las

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.150
patas y buscaba asirle
lo dedos con las garras.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.700
Traía los parpados cosidos.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.680
Soledad pasó casi toda la noche
con el halcón sobre el regazo

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.700
arrullándolo y cantándole en voz
baja Luego lo metió en una jaula

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.290
preparada con un nido de trapos
lavados y lo alimentó con papillas

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.090
de carne de tórtola.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.310
Lo primero que Ala Gris vió en
el mundo fue el rostro de Soledad

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.160
cuando ésta cortó los hilos
que le cerraban los ojos.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.310
Para el halcón no habría nunca
un sol más brillante que esa cara

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.840 position:56%
huesuda y esa mirada verde y atenta.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.210
Thank you very much.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.640
