00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.800
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.960
And we've done some review.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.130
Something else.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, symmetry,
review principal axes ideas.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.420
What else?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.140
I think we spent
quite a bit of time

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.825
on generalized forces and
ways for computing them.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.920
All right.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.069
And I'm trying to begin
to summarize what we've

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.610
done up to this
point because we have

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730
a quiz coming next Tuesday.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.830
So some of yesterday's
lecture was

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.690
intended to kind of
start pulling together,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.060
comparing direct versus
Lagrange, advantages,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.900
disadvantages.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.360
And on Tuesday next,
we'll do more examples.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.550
OK, so the problem you're
going to work on today--

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.090
and you really are
going to work in groups.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.298
And how many do we have here?

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:13.380
We've got four-- about enough
for three groups, let's say.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.170
We have a double pendulum.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.440
It's made out of two-- now
I have two pieces of chalk.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.110
It's two slender rods, but
an approximation-- this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.110
is a double pendulum.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.100
They have many-- that one and
this one have a lot in common.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.755
Takes how many coordinates to
completely describe the motion?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.450
One for each rod, right?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.360
And the coordinates up there
that are drawn in that diagram

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.640
is the angle of the first
one with the vertical

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640
and the angle of the
second one with a vertical.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.570
And with that,
you can completely

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.190
describe any allowable
motion of the system.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.755
So a double pendulum
has a property

00:02:56.755 --> 00:03:01.100
that it's got two natural
frequencies and two mode

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.600
shapes.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.160
That's the shape
of the first mode.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.260
Both masses go in
the same direction.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.990
And the second mode
looks like that.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.080
The two masses go in
opposite directions.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.532
Not with equal amplitudes,
but opposite directions.

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:18.990
And it's a different
frequency too.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.030
It's higher.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.670
So it has two natural
frequencies, two mode shapes.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.400
And if you had-- in
this case it shows

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.610
a force acting on the
system, pushing this thing

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.960
back and forth.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.800
And we're interested in
the generalized forces,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.140
or thinking in terms
of the work done

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.880
by the non-conservative forces.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.750
So the exercise to do in
groups-- like four or five

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.970
of you are a group.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.270
You five are a group.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.840
And you two, four,
five are a group there.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.080
Work this out.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.650
Find this vector.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.400
This is the position
vector to the point

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.370
of application of the force.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.520
And we want you to do that.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.170
Actually, I did
something last time,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.780
and I'm almost
forgetting to do it.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.880
I want to remind
you of something.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.600
Professor Gossard, each
week for the recitations--

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.430
he teaches Thursday ones-- does
a write-up of the recitation.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.660
And they're posted.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.990
So this week the solution
to this problem is posted.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.510
But also, a little quick
review of the important stuff.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.980
So this would be posted.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.850
And basically I've redrawn
it up here on the board.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.820
So this is this kinematic
method for obtaining

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.430
generalized forces.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.120
So a body with N forces on it.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.480
Here is the ith one.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.590
At each point of
application of the force,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.850
there is a total
virtual displacement

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.820
that basically
comes from the sum

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.240
of all the individual
generalized

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.480
coordinate virtual motions.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.100
You sum them up,
you get the total.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.960
And so therefore, at the point
of application of each force,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.270
there is a total amount of
virtual work that's done.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.780
So the total
non-conservative work

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.870
is the sum of the
virtual work done

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.710
at the point of application
of every force summed over

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.880
all the forces.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.820
And remember, inside of
here, the total displacement

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.450
at every location is a summation
over of all the generalized

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.300
coordinates.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.030
So it really ends up as a
double sum, this dot product,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.960
the forces times delta ri.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.440
It's a double summation
over the forces

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.410
that are applied and over
the generalized coordinates.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.850
But at the end of the day,
what you end up doing,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.450
the calculation
you want to do, is

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.630
you need to know the generalized
force-- the force associated

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.970
with each generalized
coordinate.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.240
And that's the summation
of the contribution

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.080
of the virtual work caused by
that coordinate's motion dotted

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.540
into the force at
every location.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.730
So at every location,
there's a little contribution

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.500
to the total work done.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.190
And therefore, the total
generalized force is this sum.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:40.570
So today's problem is easy
in the sense that i is 1.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.140
You only have to
deal with one force.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.980
But this is a little
messier problem

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.660
in that in order to
do this, you need

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.840
to be able-- this is the
r sub i in this case.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.010
Here's point P. I want you
to first, just in groups,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.180
work out what this vector is,
rP, in the system as drawn.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.530
Here's the inertial
system xy, generalized

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.610
coordinates theta 1, theta 2.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.840
And this bar is L1 long,
and this bar is L2 long.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.280
And come up with an answer in
a form like this, something

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.181
in the i hat direction
plus something in the j hat

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:18.680
direction.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.810
And then as your group
finishes-- this is group

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.830
one here-- come
put your answer up.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.390
Second group, put
your answer up.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.730
Third group, put your answer up.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.820
And we'll move on.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.628
This will go pretty fast.

00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:31.083
All right, looks
like everybody's

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:31.550
pretty much in agreement.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.508
Not much to talk about.

00:07:32.508 --> 00:07:33.900
So let's do the next piece.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.310
So the next part is to
compute your variations,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.270
this part of the calculation,
for each of the coordinates.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:53.500
So do rP with respect to theta
1 and rP with respect to theta 2

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.280
and write down your answers.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.375
So the last step here is
get q theta 1 q theta 2.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.530
So move on to getting the
two generalized forces now.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.506
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.595
PROFESSOR: You could.

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.840
And then if you
did, then this would

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.419
have to be a summation
over two components.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.780
Remember, this is a sum.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.690
It just happens in
this example, we only

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.171
have i goes from 1 to 1.

00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:42.400
But if there were two forces,
then you would do this twice.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.480
You'd have an r1 with respect to
theta 1 and an r2 with respect

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.460
to theta 1.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.520
And you'd do this product twice,
add the two pieces together,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.220
to get the total-- the
total generalized force is

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.950
the sum of the bits
that come from all

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.368
of the individual forces.

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:05.813
AUDIENCE: So if [INAUDIBLE]
just doing theta 1,

00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:08.747
but [INAUDIBLE] two forces,
you just do one force,

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:10.710
and then you do
[INAUDIBLE] force--

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so now here let's

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.550
have a B. We'll call
it just B force.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.760
And it has to Bx components
and By components.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.172
You would now also have to
compute what would be rB.

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:29.350
You would find it.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.980
Then you'd have rB would
be this vector, which

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.910
is just that piece
plus this piece, right?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.250
So you'd have just those--
rB would be this plus this,

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.370
and then you would do
the derivative of rB

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.830
with respect to theta 1.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.930
And you'd get something.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.152
And derivative of rB
with respect to theta 2.

00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:54.232
AUDIENCE: So then you'd just
do the rB equals [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:58.224
for one force, and then
you do the rPe [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:58.224 --> 00:09:58.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.650
So you have two-- so
this thing would end up

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.870
being the summation of
two contributions, right?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:16.710
This would look like an FB
dot rB with respect to--

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.400
and this is just for
just one of them.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.250
So we'll do the theta 1.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:27.165
With respect to
theta 1 plus F-- I'm

00:10:27.165 --> 00:10:35.350
just calling this one F-- dot
derivative rP with respect

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.780
to theta 1.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.920
So you get two contributions
from the two forces

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.110
give you the total q.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.070
This would be q theta 1.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.920
And then you'd do it
again for the theta 2.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.715
And you'd have two
possible pieces.

00:10:58.882 --> 00:11:02.900
AUDIENCE: So you try to find
r's for every force [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.420
PROFESSOR: At every point
of application of a force,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.820
you define an r.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.875
You eventually need to do this
summation for every force.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.820
All right.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.230
Everybody's got
the same answers.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.790
So now I'm going
to try to-- this

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.670
is an indirect way of
answering your question.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.910
I'm now going to try to
convince you that you're wrong.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.172
And I want you to tell me
why my logic is flawed.

00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:36.120
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.750
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:44.520
So I look at these
answers here, and so this

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.940
says that if-- this line
right here, if I caused

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:57.190
a little delta theta 1
here, that swings this arm

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.360
through that amount.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.540
And it moves a distance in the
x direction, L1 cosine theta

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.470
delta theta 1.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.110
And it moves over that
little bit right here, right?

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.730
OK.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.560
And you're telling me
that this point over here

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.900
moves that amount.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.030
The point of application
of this force

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:27.980
due to delta x, delta theta
1, is this delta theta 1.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.770
There's no L2 involved.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:37.600
So to me, it seems like
here's this pendulum.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.150
And if I move this first piece
by a little bit, delta theta 1,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.280
this piece also moves.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.370
And so if you just think
of a straight piece,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.200
delta theta 1 times
L1 moves a little bit.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.050
But down here it moves
like twice as much.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.390
So I think that when you
move this little delta theta

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.880
one, that you ought to get
even more motion down here.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.330
And yet your answers say
that that's not true.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.096
Tell me why-- what's
flawed in my reasoning?

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:15.576
AUDIENCE: So when
you-- I'll try.

00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:19.874
When you [INAUDIBLE]
theta 2, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:19.874 --> 00:13:21.770
And now when you
move by theta 1,

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.090
[INAUDIBLE] all points
move the same theta.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.232
So even though [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.790
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.220
So you're saying that
we argue that when

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.890
you have one virtual
displacement, or in this case

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:46.630
a rotation delta theta 1, we
freeze all other generalized

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.530
coordinates.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.970
That means we freeze delta
theta 2 and don't let it change.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.420
Delta theta 2 is measured with
respect to the vertical, right?

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.090
So if that moves
over delta theta 1,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.500
this whole thing
would-- this angle here

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.980
we go from delta theta 2 to
delta theta 2 plus delta theta

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.630
1 if my argument's correct.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.160
But for my argument
to be correct,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.730
that would have to swing
by delta theta 1 over here

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.530
as well.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.990
But the fact that we
freeze theta 2, in fact,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.720
the angle between these
two things has to change.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.340
This has to open
up a little bit.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.740
So when this is
moving over, this

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.670
is dropping down so that
this point, this whole body

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.620
only translates.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.890
So that whoever described
it as just pure translation

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.310
of the second body, that's
another way of saying it.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.570
So you've got to
remember what it means,

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.940
freezing all the other
generalized coordinates

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.920
and only allowing the
one you picked to move.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.000
Good.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.660
All right.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.520
Nice work.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.190
We've got some time left.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.370
So do you have any
questions from problem

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.950
sets, lectures, just--

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.575
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:02.950
AUDIENCE: When
you're calculating

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.450
kinetic energy of
a rotating body,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.890
there's an omega [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.750
In the homework,
the last homework,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.690
I didn't know which
omega could take,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.200
whether to take it from
the wheel or from the axis.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.417
PROFESSOR: Oh, this is the
rotating thing with the--

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.000
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.700
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.158
AUDIENCE: There's
two omegas there,

00:15:21.158 --> 00:15:23.870
and I didn't know which
omega [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.890
PROFESSOR: So should we just
talk about that problem?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.830
Are other people-- this is the
one where you had basically

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.120
the rod, and on
the end of the rod

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.350
was the wheel,
which was rotating.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.940
So this was going around at
some omega 1 in the z, right?

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.750
And this was
rotating, and I think

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:55.550
this was like z, maybe x and y.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.800
So it was rotating about that.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.632
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it had a negative.

00:15:58.632 --> 00:16:00.010
It was a negative [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.301
PROFESSOR: Oh, it was a-- yeah.

00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:06.350
Actually, I think I have it here
with its correct definition.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.440
So rather than try to--

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.821
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because there
was the positive [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:13.742
and then there's
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:14.658
PROFESSOR: Here it is.

00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.860
Let's get the picture right.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:37.930
And there was an
x, a y, and a z.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.205
And this was cap omega.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.670
And this was omega 1.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.210
And that's minus,
in minus direction,

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.000
for this system, right?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.560
OK.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:05.670
So then we're trying to
compute T for this system.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.829
1/2, and what'd we call
for the masses here?

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.710
This was m1, and
this was m2, I guess.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.140
Yeah.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:25.280
So this T for 2-- T1 you don't
have a problem with, right?

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.820
T1 is just a shaft, just a rod.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.100
It's pivoting about its
end 1/2i about-- if this

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.930
is-- I call it o.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.510
1/2i, i with respect
to o, mL squared

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.760
over 3 times that squared.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.370
You're done.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.200
That's the energy of this part.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.310
This is the
problematic one, right?

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.320
The piece of it.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.830
So 1/2, I would say mass 2.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.150
And this does have a point.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.110
They called this point B here.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.410
Velocity of B dot velocity of B.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.600
So that's the 1/2mv
squared piece of it.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:21.240
Plus 1/2 omega dot
h with respect to G

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.270
for-- this is mass 2.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.460
So you have a contribution
to the kinetic energy

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.700
of this that comes from its
center of gravity translating,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.320
and a contribution from the
rotor rotating with respect

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.260
to its center of
mass here, G here.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.170
And that'd be the
expression you use.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:56.420
And then the problem is, what
omega is the trick here, right?

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.050
OK.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.000
This is the one that had the
concept question I talked

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.730
about in class
because it came up,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.630
and I hadn't thought
about this, about the body

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.660
coordinates attached to this
are actually rotating with this.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.326
And that gets messy
trying to figure out

00:19:15.326 --> 00:19:16.700
what are the--
how do you break--

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.810
you're supposed to
express the angular

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.800
rotation in the
body coordinates.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.960
But this angular
rotation, this one

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.960
actually is lined
up with this axis.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.250
And you could have body
coordinates on here.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:45.420
You could have a--
if this is a y,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:55.310
you could have a body coordinate
x and z that rotate with it.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:02.450
But this Component would just
be still along this axis, right?

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:10.170
So the concept
question [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.700
was basically, are these
body coordinates, x, y, z,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.770
attached to the rod?

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.040
Principal axes for this body.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.650
And the complication here is
that this body is rotating.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:34.570
And so this x and this z
don't rotate with that body.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.620
And so they're not body fixed
coordinates for that body.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.980
But in fact, they're still
principal coordinates

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.070
for that body.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.350
Why is that true?

00:20:48.284 --> 00:20:51.710
AUDIENCE: Because
you have [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.601
And you can take whatever
you want for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:56.600
PROFESSOR: You're close.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.930
This body is axially symmetric.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.330
And so at any
instant in time, you

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.900
could say that--
you could define

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.640
a principal coordinate
on this body that

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.240
is lined up with these.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.484
So for axially symmetric
bodies, you could do that.

00:21:19.484 --> 00:21:20.150
You can do that.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.858
You can just say, at
an incident in time,

00:21:21.858 --> 00:21:24.620
let's compute the
kinetic energy.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.140
And we have the
rotation of that body

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.970
defined in the instantaneous
principal coordinates

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.290
of the body.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:43.540
So now omega for
the second body is

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:58.050
this in the k minus omega 1
in the j of the x, y, z system

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.680
rotating with the rod.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.870
And then to complete
this, what's H?

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:30.650
So H with respect to G
is Ixx Iyy Izz times--

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:38.570
and now this one's rotation is
0 minus omega 1 and cap omega.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.610
And I multiply that times
this with the definition

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.640
that the first one gives
me the I, second one J.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.990
And so I end up with two pieces.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.730
The first one is zero.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.150
I get an Iyy.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.240
And remember, these are
defined with respect

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.130
to center of mass of the disk.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:17.200
Iyy minus Iyy omega 1
j plus Izz cap omega k.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.340
And that'd be the angular
momentum for the disk.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.890
Right?

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:34.400
And then the kinetic
energy, the 1/2 omega dot H,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:41.110
you now just have another omega
1/2, and you have a vector,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:49.530
0 minus omega 1 J
cap omega k dotted

00:23:49.530 --> 00:24:06.080
with the H vector, which
is your 0 Iyy omega 1

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.540
j and Izz cap omega k.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.359
AUDIENCE: I have a
question. [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:14.025
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:18.610
And if that one's
negative, then it'll

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.826
happily fix this
one because it ought

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.300
to come out looking like
omega squareds, right?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:32.500
And so out of this, you get Iyy
omega 1 squared plus Izz cap

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.425
omega squared.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:54.440
And that's the second piece,
and you add it to this piece.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.860
AUDIENCE: So is there ever a
time where the omega's inside

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:37.820
PROFESSOR: So let me-- we
have a total-- so let's just

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:48.846
talk-- we have H
with respect to G.

00:25:48.846 --> 00:25:50.990
Or a slightly simpler example.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.490
So H for this system with
respect to the center

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:39.720
is H with respect to
G plus rG with respect

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.740
to the center cross PG, right?

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.720
I can write the angular
momentum that way.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.950
And first piece we know.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:27:01.060
The second piece, rG, is in a
r hat direction, if you will.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:06.300
The P is going
around the circle.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.630
And so the cross
product of those two

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.280
gives me a component, what's
the direction of the result.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:21.110
So this is r cross theta hat.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.850
You get a k.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.150
This ends up being-- this
gives you a k component.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:31.590
And this one we write out.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:48.350
So this is minus Iyy omega
1 j plus Izz cap omega k

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:54.080
plus some stuff that's in the k.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.400
Agreed?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.680
And I want to know the
torques required to make

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.750
this system do what it's doing.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.770
How do I get the
torques required

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.620
to make the system go around?

00:28:15.412 --> 00:28:16.644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:16.644 --> 00:28:17.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:24.760
Sum of the external
torques equals dH.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.540
Now, with respect-- remember, we
would ordinarily usually write

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.130
that as an A. We'll call
it H with respect to O dt

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.910
plus velocity-- usually we
call it A-- with respect to O,

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.800
cross P. Right?

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.590
In this system,
what's the velocity

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.140
of this piece, this term?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.640
Zero.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.690
So we don't have
to worry about it.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.740
So the sum of the
external torques

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.320
should just be the time
derivative of this angular

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.500
momentum vector.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.400
Right?

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:12.810
And dH then O dt is equal to the
partial derivative with respect

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.705
to t of H. And I'll
write it like this.

00:29:16.705 --> 00:29:18.365
This is in the rotating frame.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.040
So this is the piece from
inside the frame plus,

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.900
this is just the derivative
of a rotating vector.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:40.060
Omega cross H. And the issue
here is, what's the omega?

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.040
That's really what this
question comes down to.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.450
When we did this
problem, we found

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:01.250
that H came from taking
the omega, the vector,

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.950
multiplying it by this, and
we got these two pieces.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.930
And so it started off with
components in the j and k

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.920
direction, and it came out
with components in the j and k

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.510
because this was diagonal.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.260
So we have principal axes.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.860
We came out with
these two pieces.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.360
So the angular momentum has a
j component and a k component.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.350
What is actually--
now, this vector,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.740
this angular momentum
vector, the reason

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.480
we have this second term
is because of the change

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.610
of direction of a vector.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.270
This piece comes from taking
the time derivatives of the unit

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.880
vectors in the problem.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.190
The time derivatives of the
other stuff in the problem

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.110
has been taken care of by this.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.880
So this only deals with the
time derivatives of the unit

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.150
vectors.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:31:00.190
So what is the
actual rotation rate

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:05.070
in this problem, the
rate at which things

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.650
are changing direction?

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.240
Which one's changing direction?

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.406
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:13.155
PROFESSOR: Is this one
changing direction?

00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:13.580
No.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.450
So actually, it doesn't give
you any derivative, right?

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.810
Is this one changing direction?

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.310
Yeah.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:33.410
And at what rotation rate
is it changing direction?

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.549
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:36.590
PROFESSOR: Capital omega.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:44.810
But why not-- but it's not
changing little omega, is it?

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:49.180
The math, the vectors
works that all out for you.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.920
Because this is in the
j direction, and this

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.030
is the same.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:59.540
You just use the same
total rotation vector here.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.440
And this will have
in it the zero,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:09.430
the omega minus omega 1
j, the plus cap omega k.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.450
And the parts that
you don't care-- this

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.290
crossed with itself
goes to zero.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:21.390
So even though you're just going
ahead and leaving this in here,

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:26.400
it doesn't result in anything
because the cross product

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.940
would-- cross product with
itself gives you nothing.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.100
So the only piece that
actually contributes nonzero

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.510
contribution to this
answer is this crossed

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.490
with the pieces in here.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:43.940
So when you're
taking derivatives

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.640
of rotating vectors, remember
the original formula.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.290
And the original formula
is the derivative

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.330
of the vector in
the rotating frame--

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.090
is this magnitude
getting more or less--

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.869
plus just the
rotation rate crossed

00:33:00.869 --> 00:33:01.910
with the original vector.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.670
And the pieces that are
common just fall out.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.600
The piece of this that is
due to its own rotation

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.780
doesn't enter into it.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.840
This rotation doesn't
contribute to that d

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.205
by dt of the rotation.

00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:22.750
Just works out for you.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.290
Yeah.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.194
AUDIENCE: What would happen
if that just [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:26.194 --> 00:33:29.098
rotates like this, but also
rotates on its own axis

00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:31.520
as it does it?

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.092
PROFESSOR: You mean if
this one is going in the k?

00:33:34.092 --> 00:33:35.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.682
PROFESSOR: Then--

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:42.056
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
didn't have the big omega term

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:45.570
because the actual thing isn't--
the big omega would be taken

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:50.380
into account when looking at the
first term of kinetic energy.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:55.720
PROFESSOR: If this one also
had some k rotation in addition

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:02.500
relative to here, we'll call
it omega 2 in the k direction,

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.840
then what's the total
rotation rate in the k

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.422
direction for the disk?

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:09.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.440
PROFESSOR: You add
cap omega, 2 omega 2,

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.489
and you'd have its total k
directed rotation, right?

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.350
And if you did that,
you'd end up in here

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:26.330
with an omega plus omega--
cap omega plus omega 2 k.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:36.550
But when you came over to
do the time derivative,

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.917
you just leave all
those things in there.

00:34:38.917 --> 00:34:40.500
And the ones that
you don't care about

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.110
will just cancel
out because they're

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.498
cross products with themselves.

00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:49.929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] omega
also appears [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.900
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.800
Well, the cap omega
appears in this piece.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.060
But this goes to k.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.784
We did a particular problem.

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:03.450
I'm not trying to
prove this in general,

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.241
although there's probably
a way to do that.

00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:10.110
This problem, this term
is in the k direction.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:15.270
And therefore, k hat does not
change direction with time.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.980
Therefore, the dH dt of
this piece goes to zero.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.370
So we only had to
deal with this part

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.080
in taking the time
derivative that dealt

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.300
with changes in direction.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.830
It's only the
changes in direction

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.140
that the omega cross
something matters, right?

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.700
Good question.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.630
Something else?

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:41.435
Recent problems.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.466
Somebody in the last
class asked about,

00:35:51.466 --> 00:35:55.275
had a question about this thing.

00:35:55.275 --> 00:35:57.830
That bring anything to memory?

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.780
PROFESSOR: I see some grimaces.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.230
What troubled you
about that problem?

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.460
What troubled the last group
about that problem was the

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.210
posted solution.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.300
They didn't understand
the posted solution.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.390
So I ran through-- I
showed why the posted

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.390
solution works the way it does.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.890
AUDIENCE: Well, one
confusion that I

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:26.043
had had doing this problem was
that the spring for the wheel

00:36:26.043 --> 00:36:31.610
mass, when that exerts
displacements, Newton's

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.120
third being what it
is, should it also

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.165
exert some force on
the large base mass

00:36:36.165 --> 00:36:38.680
as well, so you should
take that into account

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.910
for the total displacemenet
caused by springs

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.452
for big mass, the big--

00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:46.660
PROFESSOR: Are you talking
about not computing-- just

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.215
giving equations of motion, or
computing generalized forces,

00:36:49.215 --> 00:36:50.470
or what's the context?

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:51.605
AUDIENCE: Yes, when
you're computing

00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:52.670
your equations of
motion, you have

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.390
to take into account
from the larger

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.200
mass of the displacements
in the spring,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.040
it's attached to the
wall, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.286
PROFESSOR: As well
as the-- yeah.

00:37:00.286 --> 00:37:04.040
So if you're doing this
by the direct method,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.820
you have to figure that out.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.370
So here's a way of doing it.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.050
This is a way that I think
the-- the way the student

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:12.830
just read off his paper.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:17.440
So I said, let's talk about
the forces in the x direction

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.690
on the main mass.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.410
Well, that's mass 1
times its acceleration

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.940
must be equal to all
the external forces.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.663
This is minus kx minus bx dot.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:34.590
This is minus the x
component of the spring force

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.840
minus the x component
of the friction

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.500
force from the wheel minus the
x component of any normal force

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.620
from the wheel.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.895
And I do the same thing
for the second mass, M2.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.490
The total forces on it
must be equal to its mass

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.640
times its acceleration.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.390
Well, its acceleration
I'm doing this just

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.990
to get in the x direction.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.480
Its acceleration in the x is
the main mass, x double dot,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.750
which it's sitting on.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:12.420
And the x component of
the relative coordinate

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.605
x1 double dot.

00:38:13.605 --> 00:38:16.320
This is the total acceleration
in the x direction

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.030
of the second mass.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.440
And the total forces
on that second mass

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.450
are-- signs are changed.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.460
Internal force, internal
force, internal force,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.820
plus the force that was applied.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.520
Actually, here it
is written out.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.910
Here is that external force
that was applied to that wheel.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.690
If you take these two equations,
you just add them together.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.920
All of the internal
forces drop out.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.480
Plus fx minus fx.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.610
All of those drop out.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.750
And you end up with an
expression that says,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.620
this is a system.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.330
The total external forces on
the system in the x direction

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:03.710
must be equal to the
total mass of the system

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.620
times the acceleration
of its center of mass.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.120
Right?

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.050
That's what Newton said.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.290
Well, the acceleration
of the center of mass

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.030
is the sum of the
individual pieces

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.040
times their individual
accelerations.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.790
The sum of the total mass
times the acceleration

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.960
of the center of mass
is equal to the sum

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.430
of the individual masses times
their individual accelerations.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.700
Mass one, its acceleration.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.090
Mass two, its acceleration
due to its local coordinate

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.540
plus its acceleration due to
the main mass acceleration.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.060
And all of that's got to be
equal to the external forces,

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:53.100
which are now only minus kx,
minus bx dot, and plus F.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.820
And this term here,
this stuff, all that,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.260
including this, these
three M X double dot terms,

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.820
all added together
as the same thing

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.020
is the total mass times the
acceleration of the center

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.250
of mass, which is somewhere.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.510
But that's a completely
legitimate equation

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.750
for this system.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:17.470
And it involves both
masses, both coordinates.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.670
So this one here would just
be some x1 double dot times

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.754
a cosine phi or a sine phi
or something like that.

00:40:25.754 --> 00:40:27.378
AUDIENCE: So for this
problem, is there

00:40:27.378 --> 00:40:28.652
only one equation of motion?

00:40:28.652 --> 00:40:29.360
PROFESSOR: Oh no.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.670
There still has to be two.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:35.900
But I've just shown you a
way of getting at one of them

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.730
without ever solving
for the internal forces.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.370
By just realizing that
if I separate them,

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.190
that Newton's third law,
all the internal ones

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.007
will cancel when I add
the two pieces together.

00:40:50.007 --> 00:40:51.590
I still have to get
a second equation.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.548
Where would you get it?

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.496
AUDIENCE: Sum of
the forces in x1?

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.470
AUDIENCE: They're
rotating [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
want to do something

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.306
where you don't have to
solve-- you don't want

00:41:10.306 --> 00:41:13.170
to have to solve for any
of these internal forces

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.060
that you don't know, right?

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.040
So the spring force
you can know because it

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.420
is a minus k times the
coordinate that you

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.630
have to use, minus kx1.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.330
So I would go in
here, and I'd say

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.280
maybe the-- what's the sum of
the torques about that point,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.325
perhaps.

00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:34.700
AUDIENCE: There's
no slip, right?

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.658
PROFESSOR: And no slip.

00:41:35.658 --> 00:41:37.340
So these things--
that avoids having

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.490
to deal with any
of these forces.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.550
The real force acting
on it, real force,

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.720
you have to deal with that.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.760
And the minus kx1
force you need.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.810
It comes into your
equation of motion.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.370
If you do that
particular approach,

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:57.640
it has one problematic--
it's not terrible

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.890
but you have to remember
to deal with it--

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:06.250
is that the sum of the x torques
about that point we'll call A

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:19.100
is d HA dt plus
vAo cross P, right?

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.370
Or I gave you an
equation yesterday.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:23.500
This is easier to
do usually if you

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:39.940
do d HG dt plus rG with
respect to A cross the mass

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:45.270
times the acceleration
of g with respect to o.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:49.810
This would be the
second mass, M2.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.540
You can derive.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.200
It's about three lines.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.390
You can prove that this
statement's the same as that.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:02.280
This one, turns out
this one's less work.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.850
And the reason that this one's
more work is this term always

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.520
cancels out.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.310
Cancels out with a
piece of it is generated

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.815
when you do this calculation.

00:43:11.815 --> 00:43:13.440
But you know how
messy this stuff gets.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.000
You've got all these unit
vectors running around

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.590
and cosine thetas
and sine thetas.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.050
It's a lot of work
to get this piece.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.340
And it's twice the
work because you

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.794
have to go in and find the
piece that cancels it in here.

00:43:24.794 --> 00:43:27.210
So if you actually-- I sat
down about a week ago and said,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.970
there's got to be a way
to get rid of this thing.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.160
And there is, and it
comes out like this.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.940
Now there's no
pieces that cancel.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.030
You cancelled out in the proof,
and get this piece to go away.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.650
And you're left with this.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.750
So this is the distance
from your point

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.160
to the center of mass.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.794
In this case, it's just r.

00:43:48.794 --> 00:43:50.460
And the only thing
you have to calculate

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.080
is the acceleration
of the center

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.750
of mass, which is capital X
double dot plus X1 double dot.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.480
You know that.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.342
So this is vastly easier to do.

00:44:02.342 --> 00:44:04.772
AUDIENCE: So I understand
how to use that if I'm

00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:06.230
using different [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.604 --> 00:44:13.034
PROFESSOR: Center of mass,
I didn't get the last bit.

00:44:13.034 --> 00:44:13.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:18.224 --> 00:44:19.390
PROFESSOR: That's the other.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.889
Because you're doing
it around point

00:44:20.889 --> 00:44:23.260
A is what gets you
into this mess.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.830
If you're doing it-- as soon
as you work with respect--

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.520
if you're working with
G, the center of mass,

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.200
then this is vG cross
vG, which is always zero.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.800
This has a vG in it.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.320
So that's the reason we like to
work around center of the mass,

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.260
but we don't do
centers of mass when

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.490
it causes us to have a whole
bunch of external things

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.280
we don't know.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.840
Thanks.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.440
Yes.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
