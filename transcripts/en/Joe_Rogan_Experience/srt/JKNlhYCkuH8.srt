1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,220
Yeah, I'm tired of fucking windy
twice. Worry recording that.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,320
I'm glad. I'm glad I peppered in with.
That's right. That's right. I kept going.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,900
That's right. Gives Zero folks
your right though. Joe Rogan.

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,900
Good experience. But we do have
sponsors and we appreciate our sponsors.

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,030
We try to give you
sponsors that we would use.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,180
We tried to give you sponsors is I
would buy that. This makes sense.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,700
One of them's carbonite.
Carbonates. Way To backup your shit.

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,210
Did you know that about
12,000 laptops are lost?

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,710
Every God damn week at us
airports. 12 Zen. Seriously?

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,810
Yes. 12,000 it's insane.
12,000 with carbonite.

11
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,820
Carbonite to sweet set up.
You can you back up all your shit.

12
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,610
It does it automatically. It does.
You don't even have to think about it.

13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,300
You don't just leave your computer on
it backs it up for you and if you leave

14
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,600
your computer at the airport and they
steal it or someone takes it and doesn't

15
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,850
turn it in,
you just get another computer if you can,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,170
and you download all the information
and it's like you got the same goddamn

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,480
computer. It's, it's a beautiful
thing and it's very important.

18
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,780
If you're a traveling person or if you
have important data that you don't want

19
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,180
to lose the loss of one person's laptop,

20
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,200
that it glues essential business files
could leave to disastrous consequences

21
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:14,210
for the entire company and the earth.
The Earth,

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,910
right? My clan just save the earth.
Exactly like my clean engine design.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,940
The engine that runs on water,

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,770
professor x and you had all the
information and you left your shit at the

25
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:27,950
airport. Every I think about how
many movies are based on that.

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,970
We've got to get the briefcase.
The files are in that computer and I now,

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,040
now they're in the cloud baby.
Everything's in the cloud.

28
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,840
It's going to be really
hard to write a shitty plot.

29

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,120
Abuse it, enjoy it. Reply it terrible.

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,990
Have you have the worst rapper ever?
I'd be the worst freestyle rapper.

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,150
I don't believe they're really freestyle
and I think they're saying some shit

37
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:12,530
they already wrote. How about that? I said
he said it. I said it. Hip Hop exposed.

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,600
You don't have to go to the most office
if you don't have to stand behind the

47
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:46,580

guy in front of you? A lot? All the time.

48
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,680
I was at the post office and hey dash

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,790
Francisco and there was a sign,

50
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:57,791
please don't put wet items on the counter
and you know there wouldn't be a sign

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,620
unless you know there a problem.

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,260
People are bringing in like wet thing.
I mean like that stamp machine is like,

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,770

If you don't have to go find some loser,

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,310
I got this wet baby seal, I have to
send it to, you know, I might be auto.

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,830
Where's reporting against the wall moist.

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,730

how they help your body absorb
the nutrients in your food.

67
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
All of it is explained on on at.com with
out me a beating the science down with

68
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,030
my shitty vocabulary and poor,
poor actual knowledge,

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,480
but it's a very fascinating
a digestive supplement.

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,180
We sell all kinds of different
supplements, new mood,

71
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,720
which is a five HTP supplement,

72
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,190
which is actually helps your brain boost
serotonin and makes you feel happy.

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,090
It's one of the things that people
tell you to not take if you are on SSR.

74
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,140
I's however they don't want you having
too much serotonin and Brian calendar

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,430
cause it's not good for the dome.

76
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,000
Apparently he could overflow and think
that life is like way groovier than yeah,

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,280
I do anyway.
Pure happiness.

78
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,230
Good for you or one way or another.
But with that, if you're not on them,

79
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,950
it's fantastic stuff and it's
actually a natural, simple,

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,240
very easy to describe.

81
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,840
There's science to it on [inaudible] dot
com and there's also a hundred percent

82
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,400
money back guarantee on the first
order of 30 pills within 90 days.

83
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,650
Like try it. You don't like it. You
don't have to return your money.

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,750
No one's trying to sell you anything.
That's bunk.

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,330
It's all good stuff that we use.

86
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,350
It's called the best shit we
can buy for human optimization.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,460
And with that said,

88
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,630
this is episode four 20 of the
Joe Rogan experience podcast.

89
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:08,830
My little buddy red band is out rocking
the house in San Francisco tonight, sir,

90
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,831
it is Brian Callan and Tom rose are here
to bring in the most retarded hothead,

91
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,783
holidays.

92
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,950
This is our day.
All Day.

93
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm Kinda tired of four 20 I'm already
tired of it. I'm tired of the name.

94
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,210
I'm tired of that number. I'm talking
to people before 20 dudes floor,

95
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,790
20 years. People have, people have it need

96
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,660
to belong to some kind of a tribe.
They, even if it's a pot tribe,

97
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,090
like it's so funny how human
beings cluster in groups.

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,510
They just get nationalistic over any
cause. Well, in all fairness though,

99
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,500
the pot tribe and the psychedelic tribes
are very different because they know

100
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,630
some shit that other people don't know.
Like if you're dealing with their pots,

101
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,470
going to rot your brain. Yeah.
All right dude. Right. Good.

102
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,730
Good luck with that thinking.

103
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,710
Know potheads unite in that you know
that we know like this is a good thing,

104
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,120
right? This is a good, this is
a good supplement. Supplements.

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,980
He lives in the heart hurting anybody.
This is not bad for you. You know,

106
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,910
you know a woman, bad law. My friend
threw a party and he had a pot,

107
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,880
cookies and crackers and a pregnant woman.
She was five months,

108
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,190
six months pregnant.
She had a bunch of them by accident,

109
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,400
so they rushed to the hospital
and she got, she was all bunched.

110
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,990
I mean really high.
She didn't realize,

111
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,810
I mean really high and you know
what the doctor said, doctor said,

112
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,700
don't worry about it.
It won't transfer to the fetus.

113
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,670
It's fine if you drink alcohol way worse.
And by the way,

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,510
alcohol is even worse for a baby.
Then cocaine by far. And I was amazed,

115
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,770
but he said it was actually no worry
at all that she'd eaten those popcorn.

116
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,800
That's not it. I'm not advocating
pregnant women eat hot on it.

117
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:41,840
Might be writing poetry a lot earlier,
but I was very surprised to hear that.

118
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:46,390
Yeah, you might be, you might be,
um, very mellow when it comes out of,

119
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,310
he might not be crying. He might be going,
dude, when he comes out of your, well,

120
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,810
it's interesting what the fetus
is protected from by the mother,

121
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,010
by the body.
You know,

122
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,040
it's interesting what gets through and
then what animals gets through because

123
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,100
like with chickens, you know, I'm
still, I've started to raise chickens.

124
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,690
You can feed them food.

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,070
That's kind of a little bad because
their body just processed it.

126
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,820
I didn't want effect the eggs at all.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,630
Well you don't want to give him like
rotten moldy fucking worm covered food,

128
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,790
but you can give them some
food that you would need. Sure.

129
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,000
And they'll eat the shit out of it.
Give them some rotten fruit.

130
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,500
They'll go fucking crazy that they eat.

131
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,360
If you want the shelves to be a
certain way, they feed them. Um,

132
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,100
I think and for the calcium, they'll feed
them stones. A certain type of a pebble.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,990
It's actually feed them shells,
shells,

134
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,080
their own egg shells and
smash them up in their food.

135
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,900
[inaudible] you don't want to,
you want to disguise it though,

136
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,811
because if you don't have to,

137
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:37,520
sky's it than the chicken will know that
eggs like eggshells tastes delicious.

138
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,940
So fuck up their own eggs.
And when they start eating their own eggs,

139
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,170
he got to [inaudible]
babies to make the soup.

140
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,270
Don't pick that baby. Otherwise it'll
just be eaten eggs all the time.

141
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,260
And you just go into the chicken house.
That just massive fucking cannibalism.

142
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,760
There's just something people feed
chickens, chickens to regular basis.

143
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,270
Well that was the, that was, they
were doing that for awhile. You know,

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,280
big chicken farms would grind up the
beaks and the feet and things like that.

145
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,860
They had nothing to do with them back
and feed them right back to them.

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,940
That became more more respect for
such a delicious little creature.

147
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,960
They were asked and how mad cow disease
started mad cow disease is the same

148
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:22,250
disease that cannibals in New Guinea get.
They get a brain disease.

149
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,010
I think it's the nature, the
pronunciation, I'm probably
going to butcher this,

150
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:28,070
but I think it's like Jane Jacobs,
crux Feld disease,

151
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,280
and it's essentially the
same disease as this uh,

152
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,020
cannibalism disease that the cows get
mad cow disease comes from feeding cows,

153
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,840
cows that's really feeding
and typically a feeding cows.

154
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,640
The central nervous system,
another cow.

155
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,710
So they take the spinal cord and things
they couldn't really sell or use and

156
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,200
they grind it up and they would feed
in that. They'd put it back in the,

157
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:51,890
in the feed as protein. Yeah. House.
Which by the way, complete herbivores.

158
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,030
They're not supposed to be eating.

159
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,920
I mean they would eat the occasional
bug accidentally in their body,

160
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,650
can process it,
but they're not eating animals.

161
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,050
If the account stumbles
across a carcass of a horse,

162
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,350
it doesn't just start challenged at,
oh man, they eat grass, the grass.

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,740
So it's so fucked up that they mix this
in unbeknown list in their feed. Yeah.

164
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,930
And it's, it's so, so evil that
nature made it so that you know,

165
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:16,440
their whole bodies breakdown when they
do that and they get this horrible

166
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,600
central nervous system sold by weight.

167
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,370
So what they'll do is like the
last three months or whatever, uh,

168
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,870
and maybe a marker of there before
they get slaughtered, they put a,

169
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,850
an estrogen pump behind their ear and
the estrogen will actually add weight to

170
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,510
their bodies. Oh yeah. It's good stuff.

171
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,130
We'll do the weird thing
is these priorities. Yeah.

172
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,130
Pre Hounds are [inaudible] how do you say

173
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,390
[inaudible] [inaudible] you can boil
a prion and it will not die. Yeah.

174
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:46,400
And that's what causes this mad
cow disease. Yeah. They can like,

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,360
they can withstand like a
thousand degrees. The teams.
Yeah. Crazy. They do not die.

176
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,141
They don't die.

177
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,280
It's not like you can boil mad cow
disease meet and be fine if you're,

178
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,390
if you eat it,
if it's you,

179
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,380
it was usually an hotdogs or hamburgers
because they were gay or blending the

180
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:05,610
central nervous. You guys make me want
to go on a full fish diet. The sweat,

181
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:09,650
then the fishing should fishing plastic
people and everything. Right? Everything.

182
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,430
Yeah. Mercury is bad. Yeah. I had
um, arsenic in my body from sardines.

183
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,630
Yep. I was eating Kansas. Sorry. I used
to love, sorry. Do you really need two,

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,710
three cans a date? I'm like the fish
on the cartoon because Joe fucking eat.

185
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:25,680
Of course Joe being the extremist,
it's never just one hand.

186
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,310
I like sardines. Time to
eat a thousand. I'm a whale.

187
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,390
I just used to love eating them and uh,

188
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,010
I went to the doctor to get my
blood work done and he goes,

189
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,940
you've helped arsenic in your system. Wow.
And I'm like, how much? And he's like,

190
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,220
very little. Like you don't have
to worry about being poisoned,

191
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:44,640
but we need to find out how it's
getting in there. And I was like, what?

192
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,110
Like if someone poisoned, but
no, it's just eating sardines.

193
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,260
I cut it out. All went away. I was like,
wow. He goes, it's very common. He's like,

194
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,830
especially with sardines,
apparently because they're bottom feeders.

195
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:59,190
They're always at the bottom that were
the heavy metals accumulate. Well,

196
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,770
you told me that.
I remember and I stopped eating sardines.

197
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,570
We broke the ocean. You to
Kansas, sardines at their foods.

198
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,730
If you eat too much of it,
you're getting arsenic in your body.

199
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,970
Don't eat bluefin tuna either
and don't now. How about now?

200
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,600
How about don't eat it now because all
the shit that's pouring into the ocean,

201
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,010
they're finding there's a 3% jump in the,
uh,

202
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,570
amount of radioactive activity that
there's some detecting and tuna.

203
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,300
That's just now. You mean that's, that's
from you're talking about from the, uh,

204
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,730
from [inaudible]. Yeah. I mean, the,

205
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,250
these tune are traveling all over
the fucking ocean. They're like,

206
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,590
they're on a jetliner
liner is schools of them.

207
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,770
They're getting caught up in the
water that's coming from Japan.

208
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,410
A lot of water coming from
Japan that's radioactive.

209
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,840
And who knows what's
going to actually happen.

210
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,190
We've never had this happen before.

211
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:45,180
It's total speculation as to what's
going to happen with Fukushima.

212
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,170
They have not resolved it.
We don't know the consequences.

213
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:52,830
We don't know how bad it's going to get.
It's basically on the edge.

214
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,190
If they get hit again,

215
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,590
like they got hit there before.
Yeah,

216
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,730
you're talking a monstrous disaster
because they can't shut those things down.

217
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,730
It's abundantly clear that
all the evidence is in place.

218
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,930
They can't shut them down.

219
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,650
So then it's about storing wastes and
keeping it cool and it's just a big

220
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,880
fucking hole,
a big stinky nuclear hole in the ground.

221
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,160
It's water's getting into it. You can't
get near ass. Russian can't even get near.

222
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,510
You can get near for like a minute or
30 seconds and your Dick will probably

223
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:23,560
break off, but you might live.
Yeah, no thanks. We're so weird.

224
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,610
We're so weird that we've done this
and in such a short period of time,

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,810
people don't realize what a short
period of time it is to ruin two spots

226
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,470
forever. The three, the four mile, three
mile island, whatever the fuck it is,

227
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,240
that spots probably fucked,

228
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,810
but not as fucked as Chernobyl and
definitely not as fucked as Fukushima.

229
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,310
Those places are foe a
duct to places in the,

230
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,520
what was it, 70 years of
using nuclear power, right.

231
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,080
Seven years of understanding it.
We've already fucked two spots up forever.

232
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,150
Like for way longer than
there's been history. Yeah.

233
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,200
Probably longer than we even looked
like this when Enrico fair man,

234
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,020
there's guys developed the first
nuclear reaction at the university,

235
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,260
I think of Chicago.
Uh,

236
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,300
they were literally in the gym and I are
in an area right there and it started

237
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,420
to click and there's a great
story that I'm going to butcher,

238
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:16,570
but it's a great story about these,
these brilliant scientists.

239
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,030
Enrico Fermi was this guy from
Italy comes along and says,

240
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,190
they create the first nuclear reaction.

241
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,050
They realize we have a
nuclear reaction here.

242
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,670
Problem is not sure if we
can shut it down. Uh, and,

243
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:30,490
and so they had a guy with
buckets of water and, uh,

244
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,410
and he had some other thing, like there
was a hatchet to, to hit a cut a rope,

245
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,900
so something would fall on top of it.
There was the snow.

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,720
They really just didn't know for sure
that they were going to be able to shut

247
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,670
the thing off.
And they were able to though,

248
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,100
and I'm sorry about butchering that story,
but I just,

249
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,140
I just heard it about Oppenheimer speech
when they detonated the first nuclear

250
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,110
bomb. Oh yeah. What was it? He quoted
like something from hamlet or something,

251
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,300
right? Bhagavad Gita.
Yeah. Oh, well, yeah.

252
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,350
I am become death destroyer
of worlds. Wow. Yeah, Dude.

253
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,960
I mean, you want to talk about the
perfect shit to say after you just

254
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,720
blew up a nuclear bomb, right,
right. He was interested in guy.

255
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,430
Did you see that Oliver Stone?
Uh, untold history of America,

256
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,670
but I heard it was amazing. I just watched
the entire thing. How many hours is it?

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,760
I don't know. It's like a, I'm gonna order
it right now. It's fantastic. And, uh, I,

258
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,880
I was very impressed. Uh, and, and it,
it covers Oppenheimer and you know, the,

259
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,570
you know,

260
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,840
there's a big communist scare in the
United States and all this witch hunt.

261
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,890
And apparently Oppenheimer
was like a liberal and a,

262
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:35,780
it's a belongs to every capacity.
Doesn't belong to every Communist Party,

263
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,480
but they let they let him slide,
uh,

264
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,390
because he had the knowledge
to give them the bum.

265
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,510
Yeah. And I believe at the end of
his life, he was very vocal about,

266
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:47,570
he was very anti nuclear bomb at
the end of his life, you know?

267
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,350
Wow. Right. Well, the guy that invented
the AK 47, I wish I would have invented a,

268
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,620
yeah.

269
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,340
Lauren and I like say Kalashnikov. I
think his name is. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

270
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,990
There is a, there's the quote, watch
Oppenheimer say this, this is even here.

271
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,520
Not Be the same.

272
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,980
People look at him saying, man, cried.

273
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,470
You see him up and people were silent.

274
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,040
I remember flying from the Hindu
scripture of the Bhagavad Gita.

275
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,180
Vishnu,
trying to persuade

276
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,410
you shouldn't do his duty.
Twain impresses him,

277
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,660
takes on multi armed form who says,

278
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,070
now I am becoming death. The
destroyer of worlds. Wow.

279
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,710
I suppose we all thought
that one way or another.

280
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,800
Wow.

281
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,420
He's haunted, isn't it? Yeah.
That's a hard to that story.

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,430
Wow. That's hardcore. Not Be,

283
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:03,360
could you imagine what it's like
to have no nuclear bomb ever.

284
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,400
And then all the sudden the nuclear
bombs here and it's coming from your

285
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,310
imagined that Jeanie,

286
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,210
you know, uh, that, that untold
history of America, you'll love it.

287
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:15,600
And there's a great thing in there about
the Cuban missile crisis and how close

288
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:20,070
we actually came to nuclear annihilation
in this country and in the world.

289
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,360
It's right. And apparently there
was like one, uh, Admiral Guy,

290
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,820
submarine Russian submarine,

291
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,210
a nuclear sub guy who stopped it all
because they had lost communication with

292
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,430
Moscow and their orders were
if they lost communication,

293
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,430
that means they've been attacked and
that they should launch the things.

294
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,520
So like they were totally about to attack
and it was this one guy's decision not

295
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,380
to do it. God, that would
have jam denialist it half

296
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,910
God,
there wasn't some fucking,

297
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,850
what was the guy who used to be the
attorney general? John Ashcroft.

298
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,150
We got to sing that Eagle Song,
that Christian, he goes song. Yeah,

299
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,660
the Christian Eagle Shoreham he wrote
a song, he wrote his own song. Yeah,

300
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,170
he was the attorney general
at one point in time. I mean,

301
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,460
that's a big position of power.

302
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,850
Could you imagine if a guy like that
was the guy who got to make the call?

303
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,740
At the end of the day, it is the admirals
and those guys who have to actually,

304
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,800
you know, make that call on the
submarine, but people have made it,

305
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,750
obviously they dropped
one of the Enola Gay,

306
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:18,040
they dropped the other one on Nagasaki.
What was the plane that dropped? Did that,

307
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,890
there was another plane. They know a
game. There was one other plane. Right.

308
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,730
Did I ever tell you Larry Small? I
don't, I'm sorry. I didn't know the name.

309
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm changing subjects now again. What
was the question? I'm sorry about that.

310
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,430
I said there was the Enola gay,

311
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:34,870
but it was another plane that drops
him on Nagasaki. That's trivia.

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,640
A little boy with a bombs,
right?

313
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,510
Yeah, I've seen it. It's at the,
uh, Air Force Museum and date.

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,850
It's, yeah. I would watch that stupid
movie, Wolverine, the, the new one,

315
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,070
and he's a part of the,
uh, the Nagasaki now

316
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,960
one of them. And you know, the, the,

317
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:55,380
there's a nuclear blast and he gets
fucked up on the nuclear power, but he,

318
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,440
you know, turns back into
Wolverine again. Boxcar,

319
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,810
that's the box car.
There's another guy,

320
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,270
great guy I know who is the president
of the Smithsonian Museum and he used to

321
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:12,120
keep a name dropper. I
know, I know. I know.

322
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,790
And even intellectual named
John [inaudible] name dropper.

323
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,800
Sonya. Exactly what I must say, that
she was having tea with Oppenheimer.

324
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,360
I should be speaking this way.
Of course,

325
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,260
you get away with a great Taylor Michael,
of course, when you speak this way,

326
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:32,090
to get away with a great deal of
Joseph. I could pull in Jamaica, but my,

327
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,320
he used to keep a,

328
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,010
and a model of the Enola gay on
his desk and around his desk.

329
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,240
He had a red bonnet.
And when people would come in.

330
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,250
And this one person said to him,
you know,

331
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,690
I find your plane very offensive because
it dropped the bomb and killed 100,000

332
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:52,500
people. And he said, I agree
it's a terrible, um, symbol,

333
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,320
but I have also a red
bonnet around here. And, uh,

334
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,350
the bonnet belongs to my wife was a,
uh,

335
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,560
was in fact at a prisoner of war in
a Japanese in a concentration camp.

336
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,510
And she was, she had rickets
cause they wouldn't give her,

337
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,870
they weren't giving her enough
food or anything for that matter.

338
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:14,160
And when the bomb was dropped,
the Japanese surrender to my, my,

339
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,600
this little girl was liberated two days
later and ended up being my wife and

340
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,090
giving birth to my children.
So I actually liked the Enola gay.

341
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,310
It was kind of a
controversial thing to say,

342
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,660
but I remember there was something that,
yeah,

343
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,680
pilots said they, it was interviewed
about it or we talked about when they,

344
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,630
when he dropped that bomb,
uh,

345
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,430
that the plane felt like someone was
beating it with a telephone pole that like

346
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:39,510
the after blast. Oh my God. That
explosion. And, you know, they were,

347
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,070
they dropped it and they're, you know,
they're moving as far as philosophy.

348
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,080
And he said, even enough, not enough
that it still hold plane was just right

349
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,000
rocket. Yeah. That must
somebody fucked them up. I
mean, of course had to be, well,

350
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:57,470
I just think more than anything what
it does to your imagination and how you

351
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:59,380
must've felt the fear he misspelled at,

352
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,290
at the power human beings have to destroy.

353
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,360
It takes so long to build something.

354
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,900
Think about how long it would take to
build a city and then think how quickly

355
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,680
you can destroy a city or how long it
takes to build a human being and how easy

356
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,240
it is to destroy that human being.

357
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,740
That's always been the thing
about life that has kept me, uh,

358
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,910
I think in some ways motivated in that.
I don't know how much time I have,

359
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:21,830
but we were talking about it.

360
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,420
Stay positive and keep trying
to accomplish stuff cause
there's not a whole lot

361
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:30,210
of time to waste in a way to have my fun
before the whole Shit House goes up in

362
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,453
Jim Morrison.

363
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,860
Uh, and on that, on that, that,
that series was fantastic. Uh,

364
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:42,050
Gorbachev was totally wanted
to denuclearize know Russia
before the Soviet Union

365
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:47,630
collapsed. Uh, he realized that
it, you know, it was, phew, feudal,

366
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,200
they've spent all this money
and did a lot of that money,

367
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:55,120
could be educating and feeding really
poor Russian people. But Reagan, you know,

368
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:59,080
they were set on spending all this
money on the star wars program,

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,220
which all this money had been earmarked
for it, which is totally unnecessary.

370
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,580
And the Russians were totally,
you know,

371
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,790
doing whatever we wanted for these
treaties. And Reagan was just, you know,

372
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:14,620
big Dick Actor guy, you know,
playing hardball for, uh, you know,

373
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,620
the, the money war machine
of this country. But,

374
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,560
and that's actually what
they said, that, you know,

375
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:25,220
led to Gorbachev's demise and why the
Soviet Union ultimately collapsed. Well,

376
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,040
it was really interesting.
That was a super job,

377
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,880
actually was like this really
visionary, you know, smart.

378
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,360
He was like an agricultural leader.
He was like a farmer.

379
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,200
That's how he came to power in
Russia. But it had, you know,

380
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,170
that Reagan and then he totally,
you know, we wanted to do away with,

381
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:45,190
with all nuclear weapons and be friends
with the United States and rig and just,

382
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,500
you know, was the cowboy actor. But

383
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,110
before that, the Reagan doctrine
there, there was a very,

384
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:55,111
there was a systematic like decision
among many people in the United States

385
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:59,320
state, look, let's force the Soviets
into an arms race because they're,

386
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,290
our economy cannot support.
That's exactly what happened.

387
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,580
And so what we'll do is we'll literally,
that was the, the idea behind star wars,

388
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:08,320
the idea behind the STI and, and, and,

389
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,130
and just really pushing that arms
race on the Soviets, not just

390
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,360
nuclear, but also a
conventionally, you know,

391
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,880
we developed planes that flew way better
than those migs because we had an a

392
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,940
metal alloy that burned hotter
that could withstand more heat.

393
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,430
So our planes were faster and flew higher.

394
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,650
And that was a huge
advantage over the mix.

395
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,890
So the Soviets very quickly realized that
they were not going to able to compete

396
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:37,330
technologically with us. And, um,
that was, that's exactly right. Peep.

397
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:41,050
And lot of people say that the Soviet
first of all comments system was a failed

398
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,220
experiment for the most part.

399
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:45,550
But a lot of people say that so
much of it had to do with, you know,

400
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:49,630
I went there when I was 17 and 1985 and
one of the things that struck me was

401
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:53,860
seeing bread lines, people waiting
in line for bread in the morning.

402
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,310
And the other thing that really struck
me about being there at 17 years old,

403
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:01,420
and I'm not kidding about this,
no one smiles, no one smiles.

404
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,390
And I had grown up over the all over
the world and seeing different people.

405
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:07,480
Usually the people that I was around
look a little bit differently than I did.

406
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,430
Um, they were, uh, Pakistani or were
Indian or they were, they were a Lebanese.

407
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,790
When I went to Russia,
what was striking was that they looked,

408
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,380
they were Caucasian.

409
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,290
That somehow I saw all these
people that looked American and,

410
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,360
and they weren't smiling
and the food was terrible.

411
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,450
And there was this really in the way
they would clap when we would go to, um,

412
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,710
we went and saw these shows. They don't
clap like this, like the way we do,

413
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,530
they clap like this, all of them
at the same time. Like, uh, ah,

414
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,700
I like that.

415
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,701
That's how they clown the uniformity in
that society that was forced on them was

416
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,300
men. It was mind blowing. Um, I went
to Saint Petersburg about 10 years ago.

417
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,130
It was a it, yeah. I
see what you're saying.

418
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,050
Pretty bleak. But I mean, I
was here. There's a little
bit different though. Yeah.

419
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:56,590
I mean, I didn't want to,
I think a lot has changed.

420
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,950
I think things were way bleaker
when you were there, but I,

421
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:02,990
I see they weren't as happy
blamed the Mongols, but it wasn't,

422
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,270
it was a pretty cool time.

423
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,750
It was conquered those motherfuckers for
hundreds of years. Yeah. The Concord,

424
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:11,320
everybody. Yeah. The Mongols came
through Moscow in the winter.

425
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,341
They came through the,

426
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:16,090
through the fucking attacked Russia in
the winter because nobody else would do

427
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:18,100
it that way. And they didn't
need, they didn't see it coming.

428
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,390
Did I tell you how they, why they were
so hard to follow into the desert. Who?

429
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,090
The Mongols, you didn't have to
tell me. I know a lot about them,

430
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:26,130
but go ahead if you want to.

431
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, just when you were fucking
educated. No, because did I tell you,

432
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,570
cause they were like, we
got some societies would get
their arms together. Have I,

433
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,530
have I briefed you? Have I briefed
you on the phone? Goes my friend.

434
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,290
I'm glad you, I'm glad
you asked. Uh, they,

435
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,340
they would get these arms together and
go into the Gobi desert after them cause

436
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,770
they'd be so fed up with their fucking
rates and stuff and everything else.

437
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,840
Problem was you can get about six days
in and [inaudible] that's when your water

438
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,720
starts to run out and then you have to
turn back around because you've got to

439
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,420
feed all your horses. Everybody
water, it's really dry.

440
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,750
You can maybe get six days in,
here's what the Mongols would be doing.

441
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,940
They'd be drinking their horses blood.
They'd be tapping a vein and just,

442
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,480
and just hang into of reach.
And then when you turn around all parched,

443
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,080
they'd wait until you were about a
day from home. They'd be like, oh,

444
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:15,140
they're really thirsty.
Here we come boys.

445
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,700
And they just close in
on you and district.

446
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,710
They did a lot of ruthless shit.
They were,

447
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:21,270
there were the most ruthless
motherfuckers of all time. Yeah.

448
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,230
And and gangs con ran into a huge problem
because he was doing these raids with

449
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:26,620
his,
his boys and you know,

450
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:29,850
like they would bring the young kids along
to teach them how to do these things.

451
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,840
And they also had a philosophy that if
you are a human being from another tribe,

452
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:38,250
whatever, you're basically
chattel. You're, you're on
the same level as a goat.

453
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,084
And stuff like that.

454
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,110
Problem was that these boys were
growing up seeing this horrific shit,

455
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,180
rape and stealing and looting and killing.

456
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,640
They started doing that
to their own women.

457
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,080
They started doing that to their own
people because these young warriors came

458
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:55,020
back to, you know, when they'd be
at the village and they would go,

459
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,390
I'm taking that. I want to rape
that girl. I'm taking this end.

460
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,600
Gangs can realized there was going to be
a breakdown from within kind of a snake

461
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,670
eating its own tail. And he had, uh, he,

462
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:07,671
he then had to really instill
the idea of the things that,

463
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,660
that glue is society together.
Not only do you,

464
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,470
you can't just tell
warriors how to behave,

465
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,720
you have to tell them why they have
to behave that way if you don't have a

466
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:20,520
philosophy. And it was a real crisis
for him and for his empire. Um,

467
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,560
which is the demise of the Mongol people.
Uh,

468
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,430
the demise of the uncle people apparently
was when they would come in and they

469
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,090
sacked most of what we know as
the Middle East. For example. Um,

470
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,970
the Middle East had its own renaissance
and it was destroyed by the Mongols.

471
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:34,320
They were huge shit heads.

472
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:38,760
But I think what happens to any
invading army is you start marrying,

473
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,580
you start there.
Not Everybody's an asshole.

474
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,390
You start ideas of win the day

475
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,610
or are you like, well, how much
is can we destroy until, you know,

476
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,250
there was a bunch of
issues with the Mongols.

477
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,600
One of them was the Gingiss Kahn died.

478
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,810
And his sons inherited his empire and
the son's never had to go through what he

479
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,520
went through.
So they were never the same man he was.

480
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,420
They didn't have the character
that he had that didn't,

481
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,880
they weren't brilliant
military strategists like he
was Dan Carlin's five part

482
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:03,301
series.

483
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,630
If anybody is interested in it and you
want to like learn about the Mongols

484
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,470
without actually having to read a book,
it's actually,

485
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:11,580
it's difficult and annoying.
Um, hardcore history.

486
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,550
It's called wrath of the con and it's an
amazing five part series in the Mongols

487
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:21,090
will freak you out man. Like there was a,
they were headed into Gin, China, these,

488
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,080
uh,
Arab dudes,

489
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,020
they were trying to check out China and
to see if maybe they should go in there

490
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:28,920
and kick some ass and take some, take some
riches or they had heard great things.

491
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,990
They got there and they
saw it in the distance.

492
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,850
What they thought was
a snow capped mountain.

493
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,190
It turned out to be a mountain of bones,

494
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,840
just a pile of bones because the
Mongols had killed a million people.

495
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,450
They killed every one.

496
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,400
They killed everyone in these cities
where they had 40 foot high clay walls and

497
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,220
they'd get there and there'd
be no one there. And the,

498
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:53,850
the choirs mean Shah's troops had to
turn around because the ground had become

499
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,090
decayed from rotting flesh.
It was just mud everywhere.

500
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,900
And the smell was so thick in the
air that his troops were dying.

501
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,900
They were dying from the fucking,

502
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,460
the odors of the dead bodies are so
many dead bodies. The roads were gone.

503
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,550
There was no roads.
It was just mud from decaying flesh.

504
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,090
I asked us historian on my podcast if
they were really that bad and he's spent

505
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:18,330
his life studying the Mongols I snow.
They really that bad. And he said, yeah,

506
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,493
they were really

507
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,140
well. Uh, there were Great Wall of China.

508
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,710
The Great Wall of China was built to
keep the Mongols out. Yeah. And uh,

509
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:28,680
if you go there now, I was just, I
just got back from China on Monday.

510
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,510
I went to the Great
Wall like two weeks ago,

511
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,770
but the first time I went to the Great
Wall was about 12 years ago. And, uh,

512
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,860
there's Mongolian people
hang out on the top,

513
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,730
just a few of them that are like selling
things like woman's selling postcards

514
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:46,110
and cheap stuff. And, uh, I bought
some postcards. It was like a dollar.

515
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:50,340
I gave the woman a 10. She wouldn't
give me the change. Uh, so, you know,

516
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,850
they change. They might, uh,
be rotten people historically,

517
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:58,410
but I also want to remind you that they'll
cheat yet the Great Wall, Tom. Tom,

518
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:02,340
that's outrageous. The Great Wall.
She wouldn't give you change.

519
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:07,200
How did that go down? Uh, you know,
good friends, good friends. You know,

520
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:11,640
it was just to keep the money. That was
awkward. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

521
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,340
Good friends, good
friends, good friends. Uh,

522
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:18,450
I would just set the Great Wall and again,
did you get your money? Uh, I didn't.

523
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,730
They, they, there was a few.

524
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,510
They're selling like cokes and some
different trinkets. I didn't, uh,

525
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,220
I didn't fall for it this
time. It's crazy. The wall $10.

526
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,770
I never got it back. No. Wow.
No, no, no. A detailed question.

527
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,700
Now at the Great Wall, I know it
is a TMC, Cancun. He had my friend,

528
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:43,150
my good friend, I've got, I've got
it. I've got a video on Youtube, uh,

529
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,160
Beijing, Tom Rhodes, Beijing, and it's
on there. I had my camera running. Oh,

530
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,700
you could see the woman,
the woman.

531
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:52,210
And she's not giving me the
change in my little Beijing video.

532
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:56,380
And what's all the video title again? It's
Tom Rhodes. Beijing. Okay. Uh, and what,

533
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:59,110
and what's in that video
also is the greatest thing.

534
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,760
As great as the Great Wall is,

535
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,860
there is a Toboggan slide
that you go down as a little,

536
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,310
you get it sit on like a little loose
plastic thing and you got to stick between

537
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:12,970
your legs and you push it forward to
go fast and pull it back to slow down.

538
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,990
And it's windy and it's got some
huge drops in it. And I went there.

539
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:18,520
I don't remember that.
Damn. There's three,

540
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,150
there's three sections that tourists
can go to the Great Wall. Yeah.

541
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,770
And there's only the one section that
has this fantastic, magnificent slide.

542
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,420
Right. And it's thrilling. And then you,

543
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,940
you get down to the bottom and there
a big, it's on that Beijing video.

544
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:34,060
I've filmed it while I did it,
but I just,

545
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,440
I just did it again a few weeks ago
and at the bottom, uh, are there,

546
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:42,740
it is exactly. Uh, is there, there's
some, there's some Chinese, a soldier,

547
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,570
communist guys would like military
jackets on down at the bottom on these big

548
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,670
turns going slow down,
slow down. You're moving.

549
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:52,690
Because obviously they've had a few
people like fly off lip off the corners.

550
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,230
Oh my God. Whoa. How are you slowing down?

551
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,230
How do you slow it down and what you just,
you pull this stick towards you.

552
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,700
Oh my God. And I did it. I wouldn't see
that was in winter when I first went,

553
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,920
but I just did it again, man. It's, it's,
I wanted to go right back up at the top.

554
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,900
Is that as great as the Great Wall is?

555
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,000
I think that slide is even cooler and
that's so avoid the Mongols at the top.

556
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,590
I want to see the Mongo footage.

557
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,160
I want to see that broader is
the only manmade structure.

558
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,740
From what I understand that you can see.
Apparently that's horse shit.

559
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,250
I said that too. It sounds
like it is. Here it is.

560
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:33,040
Oh yeah. Yeah. There's the Mongolia
[inaudible]. Cool. You look at and go, oh,

561
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,890
winter with the snow on it.
Okay. 10 cars this go. Oh.

562
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,630
Oh. [inaudible] never chip. All right.

563
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,430
How much is, yeah,

564
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,760

Will you do that a one?

565
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:54,940
Yeah. Yeah. Where's my chain?
Let's go have a little, no, no.

566
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:59,941
10 10 [inaudible] James [inaudible].

567
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,750
No, one 10 12 times here. I'm
[inaudible] the Great Wall.

568
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,560
Give me one of them. Okay. And
then we're either, okay. All right.

569
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,420
It sounds to me like you asked her a 10
I gave her a 10 it was a dollar for the

570
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:17,710
postcards. Right? But she was
saying, yeah, 10 Oh, okay. Very good.

571
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,340
Have you go back? I think it
was a miscommunication. No, she,

572
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:23,560
she thought you were paying
10 bucks. That's what it
sounded like to me. 10 cars.

573
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,370
The woman knew fully what was happening.
Oh listen,

574
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:32,280
I trust you $1 and get it. All
right. How much is he guys? 10. 10?

575
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,760
Yeah. 10. 10 yeah, like
change, change, change. Okay.

576
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,250
What you do that like 10 times?
He seems like the Taller,

577
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,130
okay, so she and change. She
did say change. I change.

578
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,600
What can we all love?

579
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,340
She's pushed you to look at her.
She's kind of like,

580
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,440
she slapped you with your knuckle.
Her knuckles.

581
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,420
She's every bit as wide
as you are by the way.

582
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,840
And then where are you should probably
eat you. Yeah, like no one's around.

583
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,600
I just saw, I just spent three weeks
in China and she probably would

584
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,750
eat you by drink. My horses will give
you that too. Is that the compensation?

585
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:09,320
That was it. Yeah. That's actually not bad
deal. That wasn't a bad cold metal dude.

586
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,390
You won. You won the bronze. Ah, I just
got back from China on Monday and it's,

587
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,480
I have to say, the nice thing about
our country is the prices. The price.

588
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,770
You don't have to, how much is this a
200 are you kidding me? That you know,

589
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,460
they'll give you like the highest price.

590
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,320
You want to buy something and you know
it's only a couple of dollars and they'll

591
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,010
say, how much is that? $80 he was like,

592
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,870
no way that that can be $80 and then
you get them down. You're like halfway.

593
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,860
Why don't you just tell me what you need?
But some telling me the price you need.

594
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:42,620
[inaudible] oh yeah,
part, it's partnering.

595
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,310
But don't we have that here with car
sales and certain why's it gotta be like

596
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:48,770
that? Why can't you just give me
the price? I don't understand it.

597
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,970
I heard it's my charge.

598
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:53,620
What you need on the little extra over
and just tell me what to say. That's,

599
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,490
I literally,
that's how I do it.

600
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,620
Cry, go. Listen. I know you
want to make some money on this.

601
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,710
I'm not going to kill you. I'm not,
I don't have any energy to haggle.

602
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,810
If you want to take a little
bit advantage of me, it's fine.

603
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,420
Just give me a price I can live with.
I don't want to hear that.

604
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:09,370
I got completely destroyed and it's a
hundred bucks extra, whatever. Yeah,

605
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,700
like whatever. I don't want to do that.
But some people love it. They don't,

606
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,640
they don't want to buy anything unless
they can haggle. They like, come on z,

607
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,440
you gotta help me out here.
Give me something, give me
a little something like it.

608
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,880
Yeah. It's like there's a thrill
involved in the negotiation.

609
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:27,140
You can walk away knowing that
they saved $5 or whatever.

610
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,490
If you think about it though, that's
kind of exactly how Wall Street works.

611
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,140
I mean you,

612
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,880
you think something's worth something
and the other person thinks it's worse to

613
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:37,340
this. I mean with this take
derivatives are that way.

614
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm betting on the company going up.

615
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,630
You're betting on the company going down
and he's betting on the company staying

616
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,700
where it is. So let's look, there's,

617
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,390
there's a financial instrument
that reflects that. I'll buy,

618
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,380
I'll short it or I'll go long on
it. That's exactly how, you know,

619
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,050
huge sums of money are
made and lost and every day

620
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,610
you're absolutely right. I was
just, when I was in Hong Kong,

621
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:01,050
I got to go on Bloomberg
financial television. Whoa.

622
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,250
And I was interviewed by like their four
main host and Bloomberg financial news

623
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,640
goes all over the world.
And uh,

624
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,310
for some reason this guy
that the guy that, uh,

625
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,750
coordinated the shows had a link with
Bloomberg and I'm on there and it's there

626
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,990
for Maine worldwide hosts
and they're all like,

627
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,590
all these questions kept and they had to,
they're asking me about the markets,

628
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,751
you know,
you know,

629
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:27,950
that's a sure sign of the apocalypse
when I'm on Bloomberg television and

630
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,250
they're asking,
they're just throwing all these financial

631
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,940
questions at me. Like I asked you
what did I think of, uh, Ben Bernanke?

632
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:38,040
He retiring and I said,
I think now he has to turn in

633
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,750
his skin suit and go back to lizard form.
And the guy goes,

634
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:47,340
reptilian. And I go, yeah, there's like,
I mean, they were like such serious,

635
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,950
I mean there was a,
there was a Steven Seagal

636
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,400
is Asian will not stop.

637
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:56,870
He does not know way better than Steven
Seagal looks like. And I hate tie.

638
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,100
He looked like an athletic Steven Seagal
Cowen. How dare you? A little bit there.

639
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,090
He looks fantastic. He's a good looking
at me. He's a good looking guys call.

640
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,490
How dare you,
how dare you to Steven Seagal.

641
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,440
You look like a good little Steven Seagal.
I hate being called Steven Seagal.

642
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,840
Sorry. Yeah. Okay man.

643
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,030
And the podcast goes down hate
if those skills were necessary.

644
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,040
Knock, knock, knock, knock. Who's
there? Steven Seagal. Steven Seagal.

645
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,540
Who at Showbiz.

646
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,690
Oh God showed the Showbiz joke.
Anyway,

647
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,550
I'm on this financial thing and
they're throwing these questions at me.

648
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:33,890
It was uh, it was ridiculous. And the,

649
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,490
the attractive Asian woman
tried to get all philosophical.

650
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,290
Let me hear that with me.

651
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,300
A lot to say about how many
killer before this. Yeah,

652
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:47,060
it's actually something I thought
of the last time I was on your show.

653
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:51,080
I said this thing about pockets
started all our financial problems.

654
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,663
And so,

655
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,000
um,
um,

656
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,730
let me buy you a drink and I haven't
been to groundwater for the Douche bag.

657
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,280
Please.
There we go.

658
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,100
The guy pushed it is, he goes, he
goes, what's up, what's up? They all,

659
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:11,250
they're all calling. Ooh. All right.

660
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,300
Probably the last time you're going
to have a Canadian. Others, right.

661
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,680
But see what that guy did there.
He goes,

662
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:18,740
what's the worst pump comeback Glen
you have for a heckler? And I said,

663
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:22,430
it's too filthy to say on television.
And he says, what's your second best one?

664
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,700
So I mean he, the dude should
have left it alone. And this is,

665
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:30,701
I'm on live television and I'm trying to
be clever and quick in this barrage of

666
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:35,020
questioning that guy and that.
And then they all get like, Whoa,

667
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,700
we're concentrating on
were abandoned for markets.

668
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,600
Well you fucked up then son.
Oh, I could get over is a,

669
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:46,040
in this video is how weird are dresses
that girls, both of their vaginas,

670
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,160
that is a [inaudible] mind,
right?

671
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:54,440
This strange dresses she's got on,

672
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,790
she's got this little thing. It's
draped over the opening of the vagina.

673
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,990
Just so clever.

674
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:05,000
Like the parts that we're going to show
is right up to the gateway of the vagina.

675
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,960
And then from there there's nothing
but a breeze. Nothing but a breeze.

676
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,750
And to cross legs and this tiny,

677
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,870
the thinnest possible type of cloth we
can make the thinnest lightest most times

678
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:18,950
see through.

679
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:22,220
You could see pubic hair right through
the fucking thing that's there. Hey man,

680
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,740
you're getting a little too detailed
and it's just weird. It's just weird.

681
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,720
Our women are allowed to do that.
It's so rude.

682
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,380
No wonder why alimony laws are
in the position they're in, in.

683
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,940
We're at a severe disadvantage.
Disadvantages by their
attire. They're there.

684
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,310
They're there. They're fucking dangling.
A carrot there dangling the carrot.

685
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,210
It's rude. I never realized that it's
total dangle. There isn't a move.

686
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:40,811
I don't want that.

687
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,930
How about the fact they've got shoes on
that make their ass do something that it

688
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,280
never does in real life.

689
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,700
You're leaning forward is if you just
begging for someone to fuck the doggy

690
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,150
style, like all day long, you're
just accentuating your ass.

691
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:54,460
You're leaning forward like you're just,

692
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,900
you're giving step one to a five step
process of doggy style and you're already

693
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,490
at step one everywhere
you go. Genius. Why?

694
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:03,480
Why isn't the man who invented high heels?

695
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,850
Why isn't that a household name
that that's the most genius thing?

696
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:11,590
Because you can get guys will spend,
I put myself in debt buying girls dinner.

697
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:15,430
Who looked that good and high heels and
the heels come off in their back of your

698
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,530
house and everything else
changed and you're like, aw man.

699
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,680
That's just somehow that's
a huge difference. I mean,

700
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,730
I'm totally different.
That doesn't do a damn thing to me.

701
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,530
Really doesn't do anything to me.
I don't get it at all. I mean,

702
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,100
if a woman has beautiful legs,

703
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,780
the legs are beautiful and like
if she's barefoot just as hot.

704
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,970
Well, when [inaudible] walked
with confidence and heels,

705
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:44,840
not like those big stripper fuck stiletto
things, but like, like Nice, nice,

706
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,150
nice high heels.

707
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,630
We see a woman who was like
walks confidently and know
what I'm saying is like

708
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,990
it. Yeah, it is definitely
a debilitating, yeah.

709
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,100
It's like a man who's really crappy.
Caveman drew up.

710
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,240
It's like a man is really
good at the trapeze

711
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,450
with skill he's acquired.
Oh.

712
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:07,710
What I'm saying is that a woman can
have not such a great ass when and they,

713
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,310
the right heels. You can get very
fooled where you, oh, I see. Wow. Yeah.

714
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,920
It definitely accentuates. Things
come off and you're like, oh,

715
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,420
well that wasn't exactly what I did. Like
lingerie does do shit for me. I mean,

716
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:23,470
I guess it does. If it looks good, it
looks good. I mean, but if like, you know,

717
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,670
is it necessary? No. No. I noticed
when a woman dresses well and cool,

718
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,220
like some girls dress really
cool in an effortless way.

719
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,810
I find that very attractive.
You're a weird motherfucker.

720
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,730
That's why you're into fashion. Yes,
I am turned to the left fashion.

721
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,060
What if a girl showed up at your house
with velcro shoes on and a fanny pack,

722
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:43,240
but she had a banging ass banger.
Yeah, it wouldn't really bother you.

723
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,540
Bother me at all when you're talking
about a girl computer, burlap sack.

724
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,930
I don't give a shit. Forget that. In
moments when she was naked and it's like,

725
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,590
guys, I've always been the kind
of guy like my friends back. Nah,

726
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,340
I would have did it, but I couldn't get
past her feet. Shut the fuck up you baby.

727
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,600
There are some feet. They're really
will fuck you up. She could have holes.

728
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,643
All right.

729
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,900
She's got to go back and ask if there's
an evolutionary thing for that though.

730
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,310
Someone's got some crazy fucked
up feet. You're like, Hey,

731
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,550
am I going to have to carry you?
That's what I'm looking for. Food.

732
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:14,740
It's going to be a certain point in time
where you're not going to be able to

733
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,270
make it. Are you going? I wonder if that's
true. It's 100% what it is. Cause I do.

734
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:22,660
I also did be feet. How can we
not weirded out about her elbows?

735
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,760
I like petite arched feet that I
think are an arched foot is very sexy.

736
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:31,750
A petite foot. Really? That's
so weird. Yeah. Yeah. That's
not good. I liked the arch.

737
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:35,300
A a flat foot on a,
I like the foot of a woman who

738
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,620
I can go hiking. A woman who's
got some sturdiness to her. Yeah,

739
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
you have to have a little tiny fee.
Fucking Weirdo.

740
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,740
He wants these checks to be
like barely able to talk. Okay,

741
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,130
brow. Excuse me sir. You just led me into,

742
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,600
I can't give you chances to high.
Can you do food?

743
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,580
I'm going to happen. They have to
have a German accent on in her life

744
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,090
and he's the cow. We're married.
What's the ideal way? Right, right.

745
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,670
He'll wait for me. Another dimension. If
you weren't married, what's the ideal way?

746
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,523
About 80 pounds?

747
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,210
No, no, no, no. It's a breeding thing
I need, I need about one 15 is good.

748
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,330
One 15 one 2015 but athletic. I like
athletic. I like broad shoulders,

749
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,670
small waist and a and
high insertion calves.

750
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,750
It's funny, man. The
the skirt thing, it's a,

751
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,180
it's a very weird thing when you see them
walking down the street and especially

752
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:25,800
in Hollywood,
like on Melrose,

753
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,610
you'll see people walking on the street
where their skirt and these are not

754
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,060
sluts. I shouldn't even use that
word. We shouldn't slut shame.

755
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,790
It's really not nice. Yeah, and women
who want to have sex with people,

756
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,650
they don't slots.
No.

757
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,940
Mary Helen just enjoying their life.
Lord,

758
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,690
I hate myself for using their angel from
the Lord. What I should say, these are,

759
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,050
these are not prostitutes.

760
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,260
These are just girls like to dress in
style and sexy and they're wearing these

761
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:55,630
shorts that are just, there's just
a little canopy over your vagina.

762
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,520
I mean it's dangling,
right?

763
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:02,780
I mean right there you're talking about
maybe three in chart to get work done,

764
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:07,870
maybe three inches and they have a skirt
that like the lower part of their ass.

765
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,900
It's a normal thing to see the lower
part of a girl's ass and a skirt in

766
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:16,100
Hollywood. It's a normal thing.
Exactly. It's ridiculous. It's,

767
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,590
it fucks the whole game up. It
completely ruins distracting. It's,

768
00:43:20,591 --> 00:43:25,591
it completely ruins our ability to form
rational thoughts and figure out if we

769
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:28,780
were at before the podcast you were
talking about how important it is to keep

770
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:32,410
your mind on the right things. Yeah.
In a way some societies are like,

771
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:32,890
you know what?

772
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,280
All women are going to be completely
covered cause nobody's getting any fucking

773
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,390
work done. Maybe that's where the
burger came from. Burger King,

774
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,260
we need to build a fucking pyramid,
goddammit.

775
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,080
We don't need to be staring at my
ass all day cover these veterans.

776
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,010
We've got work to do, cover them. Cover
covering lab. We got to build pyramids.

777
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,780
We gonna push rocks. Nobody
wanted to push push rods. Yeah.

778
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,870
They just want to stare at chicks and
ministers. We'll hook up eventually.

779
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:56,050
If you have enough attracted people and
the of the opposite sex in the same room

780
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,210
for long enough things are going.

781
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,100
Yeah. Even if you're not in the same
room, it's exactly, they smell each other.

782
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:03,940
We're fucking Weirdos.
Um,

783
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,070
it's interesting because everybody will
remember when you were in high school,

784
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:11,220
when you were learning about Rome and
the collapse of the empire and it was

785
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:13,680
always about the,
the excesses.

786
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:16,530
It was always Caligula and the vomitorium,

787
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,600
which apparently allegedly weren't real.

788
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,490
Apparently there's no real evidence that
there was vomitorium that they really

789
00:44:23,491 --> 00:44:26,520
like stick a fat down there
there. Oh yeah. Tour. Let me,

790
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:30,090
let me make sure that's true
because, uh, I believe I read that,

791
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:32,520
but it could have been another of those,
I've read articles,

792
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,480
that's one of the problems with
fucking the internet as you'll read,

793
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,140
like really convincing articles and
then you start like saying it like it's

794
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:43,100
Gospel truth. And then you read an
article that's totally contradict,

795
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,370
contrary to that, totally the opposite
conclusion. And that's very convincing to,

796
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:49,280
and you're like, God,
that's why books are.

797
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,790
That's why historians who do a lot of
primary research and really work on their

798
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,410
source material though,
that's why,

799
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:58,360
that's where you should get the bulk of
your information. Professors and and,

800
00:44:58,361 --> 00:44:58,960
and history.

801
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,830
Oh this is interesting.

802
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,720
Vomitorium is actually a passage situated
below or behind a tier of seeds in an

803
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:09,721
amphitheater or stadium through which
big crowds can exit rapidly at the end of

804
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,624
the performance.

805
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:15,630
So it's actually the idea is like the
idea of a vomitorium like that's I it

806
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,260
sounds like it was ignorance. It sounds
like a, whoever was talking about,

807
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:24,220
I didn't understand that that was a,
from a Latin word,

808
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:30,130
which means to spew forth meaning how
to get crowds in and out of places.

809
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,760
Well,
so like we like decided that it was,

810
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,500
there was a room that they
would go after dinner and vomit,

811
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,230
but for sure someone's done that
right. For someone, for sure.

812
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:41,710
If someone stuck a feather than it
throats that they could keep eating.

813
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,400
Sure why not if everything's happened
that's happened. I had a really cool,

814
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,111
this,

815
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,640
this professor at Oxford Philosophy press
professor was talking about the rise

816
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:56,070
of Christianity and why it took hold.
And one of the things he said is in,

817
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,350
during Rome, Rome was, you know, had,

818
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,290
had conquered so much of the world,
um,

819
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,410
and Rome was kind of bursting at the
scenes with Greek philosophy with their,

820
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:09,580
their, their, their elite were
taught by Greek, uh, tutors and,

821
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,100
and their documents officially
were written in Greek.

822
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,540
And so Socrates and Aristotle,

823
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,990
all the great philosophers had a
profound effect on the Roman empire,

824
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:20,500
their justice system. They're there,
their property, right laws and things.

825
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,800
And at the end of the day,
regardless,

826
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,640
the Roman empire was
crumbling from the inside out.

827
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,180
It was to came from the inside out.
And along comes this radical rabbi, uh,

828
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,310
Jesus Christ,

829
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:38,311
Christ Jesus of Nazareth who comes
along and with this radical idea and his

830
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,850
apostles, you know, later on took
these ideas into the Roman empire.

831
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,280
But it took hold basically,
you know,

832
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:49,630
the theory was because people
were looking for something more.

833
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,660
The idea that it's not just about reason,
it's about faith.

834
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,920
There's two articles that are hilarious.
Back to back,

835
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:58,550
just to prove what we were just
talking about. One of them was Jesus,

836
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:00,820
a Roman invention and the,

837
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:05,810
there's an article on Huffington Post
that there's a guy who, uh, is a,

838
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:09,170
a biblical scholar,
allegedly who is a,

839
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,580
has these revelations threatening to undo
Christianity and that he believes that

840
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:18,550
he's got proof that they're, that
the, the, the idea of Christian was a,

841
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:23,180
a creation with the idea of Jesus Christ
was a creation by the Romans. Well,

842
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:26,300
it lasted, that's for sure. Yeah, but
I mean it's possible there could be,

843
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:30,430
but it's fascinating. There's that
and, but if you further, by the way,

844
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,760
Huffington post has one of those weird
things where tries to get you to not back

845
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:38,080
click, wow, those are so gross. Why
would we try to scroll backwards?

846
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:41,400
It just resets the page. Scroll
backwards or hate that shades. It only,

847
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,730
it happens only on the,

848
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,340
when you use the swipe thing on a
laptop to go backwards. But it doesn't,

849
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,930
if you actually use the Arrow, but you've
got to go out there and use the arrow.

850
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,790
But you go to a Catholic answers and
then the title of the article is, no,

851
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,250
the Romans did not invent Jesus.

852
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,370
So it's like you could find
whatever you want to find.

853
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,650
You could find the Romans invented Jesus.

854
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,560
You could find that Jesus
was a real historical guy.

855
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,070
Well, if it, yeah.
Christianity filled in the, uh,

856
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,440
power vacuum after the collapse of
the Roman Empire. Constantinople,

857
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,660
his wife was a Christian
Constantine. Yeah. Uh, and uh,

858
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,820
some reason that what caused that,
why they decided to submit it.

859
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,070
Yeah.
Christianity is not in Italy,

860
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,660
decided to accept the idea that Christ
was Lord, you know, cry that, that he was,

861
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,410
he was more than just flesh.
But do you ever see the God who was there,

862
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,690
um, God who wasn't there was a
documentary [inaudible] 2005, disproving?

863
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,570
Well, uh, apparently, uh, according
to the documentary, disproving the,

864
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:47,470
uh, the, the actual birth
and life of Jesus Christ.

865
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,000
The saying that it was just a myth.

866
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,360
Well,
well either way,

867
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,870
what I think is actually interesting and
kind of radical about the idea of was

868
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,330
in Rome, the entire ethos and Credo of
the, of the country was, might makes,

869
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:01,520
right. I mean, there's
statues were muscular,

870
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,810
it was all about domination and there was
the week and there were the strong and

871
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,270
they had a whole pantheon of gods that,
you know,

872
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:11,690
kind of supported something of
that and, and, and their gods also,

873
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:14,810
we're kind of gods that were a little
bit out of reach if you didn't,

874
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,880
don't pray to them too much
cause you might anchor them.

875
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,240
They were always a little bit out of
reach, you know? Yeah. I mean, they were,

876
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:21,560
they were, they were their own. Yeah.

877
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:25,250
They were their own kind of entity
that you could sort of sometimes have

878
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:25,881
communion with,

879
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:28,040
but you had to be very careful because
they were jealous and they would do

880
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,950
things to you. The idea that you and
your wife, right, sure. They would do.

881
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,440
That's what Zeus did. Write a song
to leave it. But, but what, um,

882
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,220
what Christianity came along and said was,
which is interesting and I'm, I'm just,

883
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:45,130
I'm not, I've never been very religious
but love, love, love thy enemy. Uh,

884
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,880
um, and the idea of forgiveness,
um, and the idea of love in general,

885
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,390
those are very,
it's interesting how powerful and soft,

886
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:58,391
but how powerful and resonant those
ideas are and how they stayed powerful,

887
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,420
uh, help the needy, help the weak.

888
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,840
The meek shall inherit the earth.
Those I talking like a preacher,

889
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:12,380
they're very enduring ideas in the
beauty Birtle era when that it's put on.

890
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:12,810
That was,

891
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,480
that was a radical yet even the example
of whether it's true and I love of him

892
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,900
being Sacral, you know,
crucified and torture and stuff.

893
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:25,160
Those ideas are all like ideas that
everyone has. If you're a moral person,

894
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:27,610
if you love your friends
and neighbors, if you, you,

895
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:31,910
you realize after life and years of
experience what's good and what's bad,

896
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:33,320
you know, when it works out,
it seems to work. I want,

897
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:37,490
I'm nice to people write that shit down.
I mean this, they say that that was,

898
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:39,990
you know, there was anything
other than that. Well,

899
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,510
it did though have an effect on history
and it did change things. No one knows.

900
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,950
No one knows where the
fuck of it came from.

901
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,170
No one knows where any of these
obvious tampon. And not only that,

902
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,430
by the time you are getting them the,
the,

903
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:55,100
the way they'd been broken down from
ancient Hebrew to Latin, to Greek,

904
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,520
ancient Hebrew,
there's still struggling with most of it.

905
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,970
It's like three quarters of the words in
ancient Hebrews like some debate about,

906
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,850
because they had numbers
and numbers were letters,

907
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:07,280
the letters or numbers and the
numerical value to the words.

908
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,230
So anybody saying that it means anything.
It's like, boy, you sure that's a,

909
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,710
you need a lot of fucking scholars to
sit down and break that shit down for you

910
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:19,760
to be confident about what you've read in
English. But what the Bible says, stop.

911
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,310
I believe in God, but I think, uh,

912
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,840
all the evidence took the fucking air out
of the room. All the evidence, uh, uh,

913
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,300
points that God's in
asshole it'd be exist.

914
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,750
Why would he put the three major
religions capital in the same spot?

915
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,490
And then I've traveled all over the world.

916
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,070
Why couldn't he have put like
the Jews capitol in Hawaii,

917
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,830
like the Christians in
the Caribbean where,

918
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,510
why would he have more
than one where everybody,

919
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,520
everyone would be happy to visit the
other person's place. Christianity,

920
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:46,520
Christianity,

921
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,180
Islam come from the, I mean the Old
Testament is recognized in both,

922
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,810
in both religions. Right.
As, as the first book.

923
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,170
Do you know all over stone's son converted
to Islam? No, I didn't do he really,

924
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,520
that's what you know, you
raised your kid, right?

925
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,890
Awesome. Yeah. You knocked
it out of the park.

926
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,900
That is the old white American Dad.
Super fucking storm.

927
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,590
I think I'm going to convert to,
there's only one way.

928
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,950
See the writing on the wall. Don't ask
you what this fucking breeze is going.

929
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,813
Yeah.

930
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,890
I'm joining that team.
Hello? Uh, well, um, uh,

931
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,220
Cat Stevens decided,

932
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:23,290
I guess he got really Christian then he
decided to be a Muslim. Yeah. I mean he,

933
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:27,370
he went deep and he basically
stopped recording. I know for years.

934
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:30,470
Didn't he do a new album recently?
Yeah, we did a couple of years ago.

935
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:32,390
That's a strange cat man.
Who knows man,

936
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,630
more than one guy has done it more than
one guy, smarter than me. He's converted.

937
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,240
I don't to all sorts of things,
man.

938
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,590
I've met brilliant people that converted
to Mormonism. I'm like, Huh? I mean,

939
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:45,080
I don't know what it is. I don't know
what's going on. I don't even want to ask.

940
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:48,020
I don't. I'm too slow. But
it's the, it's the, it's,

941
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,380
it's the ideas that I was talking about
where those go simple ideas that seem

942
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,230
like they're, like you said, I
don't know where they came from,

943
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:57,230
but the fact that they lasted and,
and maybe they,

944
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:59,590
I think they always existed with
human beings. Like it's, you know,

945
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,410
it's things that people learn. Everyone
learns. If you're in a tribal situation,

946
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,660
everyone learns comradery.
You all learned that.

947
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:08,120
You don't want your family
members get eaten by a lion.

948
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,630
We all learn how to keep each other
together and we all feel the rush of

949
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:14,660
survival. We all love each other.
There's a little bit of a difference.

950
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,200
The differences this, and
this was, this was the,

951
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,940
the essentially what the
Christians, I believe, uh,

952
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,370
the idea at the example of Christianity
contributed was idea that yes,

953
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,390
tribes will say that about each other,
the mangoes and everybody else.

954
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,620
The difference was that along comes this,
this guy, whether you know he was God,

955
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,010
he existed. The idea was all of
us are of the same moral worth.

956
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,660
We all come from the same father.
No matter what your skillset,

957
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,550
no matter what your skin color,

958
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:52,320
no matter what your background
and that idea it has lasted.

959
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:55,320
And that idea is the cornerstone of
our justice system and everything else.

960
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:56,310
That that is the contract.

961
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,510
That's what every hippie
figures out when they get high,

962
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,810
what happens is every hippie
figures that out when they get high,

963
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:07,400
we're all the same man. We are all
the same dude. You eat a pot Brownie,

964
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:10,280
that's exactly what you'll figure out.
Figure out where all exactly the same.

965
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,630
So it's like,
you know,

966
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:16,430
the idea that this was some mass magical
thing to figure out, like come on.

967
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,880
Well, everybody figures out that it was
given forum, like the Bible gave it forms,

968
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,780
sort of,
you know,

969
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:24,980
it also just was wrapped up by a bunch
of bishops and content team to try to

970
00:54:24,981 --> 00:54:28,310
control people. But you still need symbols
I guess to, you know, to fall back.

971
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,650
I couldn't do the pagans
were too hard to pin down.

972
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:33,900
These motherfuckers are worshiping
the moon and shit and like stop there,

973
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,630
there to make too much sense.
You know,

974
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:38,510
they would celebrate during the summer
solstice and the winter solstice.

975
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,820
They all these celebrations
they would not budge from.

976
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:43,940
So Christianity had to say,
ah, let's see, listen to this.

977
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,100
What a fucking coincidence.
Odd Jog.

978
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Fucking God was born in the same day as
you went and sold to one of the odds.

979
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,400
You guys gotta join us, join up with us.
Come on. We up the fucking same thing.

980
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:58,790
We call it Christmas. We said
we'll put a tree out, you know,

981
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,600
and they started like incorporating
pagan aspects into their,

982
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:05,780
where are we running naked this April?
Jesus was supposed to be born in April.

983
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:08,860
He wasn't born in July was kind of
December, you know, it's pretty wild.

984
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,620
I always forget about like one of the
enduring qualities of at least Catholicism

985
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,580
is the idea of confession.
That is a very strong,

986
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:21,820
strong thing to be able to go to a priest
once a week or every day and confess

987
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:22,730
your sins,
right.

988
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,450
And be absolved of them. Wow.
And it's totally anonymous.

989
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:31,250
Talk about the first therapy.
There is clearly that that was bullshit.

990
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,960
Biggest things. People wasn't the
first. There you are crazy that that we,

991
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:41,050
that was invented purely to control
rebellion to figure out who's doing what.

992
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:45,050
Wrong. To figure out who's or trying
to overthrow the Catholic church. Oh,

993
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,520
a hundred percent dude.
You weren't even allowed to do you mean?

994
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:49,470
You mean like being
able to confess fashion?

995
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:52,550
They want to know what the fuck you did.
They want to keep tracks on everybody.

996
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:55,220
Tell us what you did or you're
going to fucking fry in hell.

997
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,400
But now you don't have to fry in hell.
Congratulations. Go see a few of these.

998
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,170
And we got all the
information we need from you.

999
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,360
So if you were hanging out with
Martin Luther, the Anabaptist,

1000
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,260
you were thinking about taking over
the Catholic church because the fucking

1001
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:09,410
Catholic Church wouldn't let you print
the Bible out in a phonetic form.

1002
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:10,700
No one could read the Bible.

1003
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:14,130
You had to rely on priests until
Martin Luther came along and so they,

1004
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,080
they were fucking flight and
people on fire for that man to him.

1005
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:23,050
Martin Luther was branded a heretic
and he had to leave wherever. Germany,

1006
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,040
Germany, yeah, I know Germany,

1007
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,240
but I can't,
I'm trying to think of the town.

1008
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,550
Good way to fucking find out what
people are looking, but I like, oh,

1009
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:34,420
it's the real, it's really what it
was invented for. It's, it's a total,

1010
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:37,600
a hundred percent position of power
and control. That's all it is.

1011
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,810
You mean this guy is either way,
either way.

1012
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:44,620
It worked and it kept people very loyal
to the church and continues to be to

1013
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,270
keeps people scared.
You know,

1014
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,850
there are priests that are out there
that are listening to you and not telling

1015
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:49,360
people things.

1016
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,830
I liked it. Lenny Bruce, he had a,

1017
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,850
he had a priest outfit and he would
go around Miami and like he would take

1018
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:57,700
confessions and talk to people. He
just, there was a little period,

1019
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,070
I don't know where you bought it
or had it made, but it's hilarious.

1020
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,670
One of Lenny Bruce Biographies.
So he's just, you know,

1021
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,220
Jewish guy and he's dressed up like
a priest, want to people's houses,

1022
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,360
listening to their confessions.

1023
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,770
They just, the idea of it, you know,
you get absolved. You not only that,

1024
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:14,680
you could absolve people and get
a free pass through purgatory,

1025
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,530
have to do some bad shit if you donate
money to the church. That's right.

1026
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:18,730
There was selling free pass.

1027
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,940
Uh, I was in, um, uh,
Naples, uh, in September,

1028
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,890
Italian city dropper and
there was a church there. Oh,

1029
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:32,150
really? Corrupt. I saw a guy, uh, uh,

1030
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,160
trying to snatch and an iPad out of some
older Australian couples backpack and

1031
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:42,150
the wife saw him again away from there and
to do, just shrugged, like, uh, you know,

1032
00:57:42,151 --> 00:57:45,390
I guess I've lost money touch. You know
why? Like I'm a thief, that's what I do.

1033
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,381
But in Naples,

1034
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:51,381
there was a church of a souls in
purgatory and there was all these like,

1035
00:57:51,841 --> 00:57:52,980
uh,
you know,

1036
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:56,130
skulls in front of it and whenever it
was made in the 13 hundreds or whatever,

1037
00:57:56,131 --> 00:57:59,580
but these like rich Catholics there,

1038
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,820
they were concerned about
the soul stuck in purgatory.

1039
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,170
So they spent all this money and made
this, uh, this church for them. Well,

1040
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:11,520
purgatory was even invented to try
to convert pagans because they were,

1041
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,310
the Irish believed in the land of fe.
They live,

1042
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:18,510
but they believed in this land
where like fairies and elves lived,

1043
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,320
that it was like just over there, you
know, probably because of mushrooms,

1044
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:23,970
they're probably eating mushrooms.
I mean,

1045
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:28,170
it's most likely if you tried to figure
out like why you would think that ELLs

1046
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,660
were in some like nearby
dimension that you could reach.

1047
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,870
And so the Catholics had convinced
him, oh Nah, that's purgatory. Yeah,

1048
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:36,150
we know about that. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's when you go,

1049
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:37,000
when you're not a good guy.

1050
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:39,840
I've got to stay there for a little bottle
and a half in so you don't have to go

1051
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:40,860
all the way to hell.
Well,

1052
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:45,690
I'd also like family can buy you off that.
Yeah.

1053
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:50,220
The penalty box for Dante is divine.

1054
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,990
The divine comedy was all about
purgatory, right? That was the great work.

1055
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,320
The divine comedy. It's amazing
what people wouldn't fan to control.

1056
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:01,850
People like the stupid shit that
they [inaudible] ology story.

1057
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,230
Well that kind of stuff. I
mean, when you got to direct,

1058
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,460
when you know there's a direct
path between the Christians
trying to incorporate

1059
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,230
the Pagans, the pagans, not wanting
to be altering of the timelines of it,

1060
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:14,730
you know, like, Oh, our celebration,
same as your celebration.

1061
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,650
Let's figure out how to make this happen.
I'm less cynical about,

1062
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:22,100
I'm actually a little bit more of a fan
of the idea that I, that those ideas

1063
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,910
carried, uh, carry forth and have
lasted so long because there is,

1064
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,630
there is truth to them. The
idea that we're all the same
moral worth. For example,

1065
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,420
uh,
the idea of [inaudible] fucking lecture.

1066
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,940
That was the interesting thing about gets
intellectually interesting, so smooth.

1067
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,580
That was the interesting thing about
China was am I lagers chrome belief system

1068
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:44,110
is so different that they are like their,
their holidays are different.

1069
00:59:44,111 --> 00:59:48,700
Their whole mindset and like all these
things that we just accepted our reality.

1070
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:53,130
There's a whole different mental
world going on in the channel

1071
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,470
Dow, right? Confucius, that's the idea of
being balanced, balanced as huge harmony,

1072
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:00,230
being in harmony with everything
around you. Do you ever hear that,

1073
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:03,260
that they did this great study where
they had Chinese people look at that fish

1074
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:06,800
tank and Americans look at a fish tank?
No. When they asked them to describe it,

1075
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,730
they, Americans described the
fish and the Chinese didn't net.

1076
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,800
The fish were just a part of,

1077
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,930
they described the relationship
between the seaweed, the stones, uh,

1078
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,580
the fish,
how much water was in the tank.

1079
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,580
They were looking at the whole thing
and how it all related to each other.

1080
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,300
The fish were just a part. There
were no more important. For example,

1081
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:27,410
then the stones,

1082
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:31,040
when they asked Americans to describe
how many stones or what kind of seaweed

1083
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:34,070
the Americans had no idea because
they were just looking at the fish.

1084
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,900
This is the way they came up with a
December 25th date for Jesus. They, uh,

1085
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,230
that the, the, the world was created.

1086
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,860
This is awesome. Laughing. Um,
the, they tried to figure out,

1087
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,400
um,

1088
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,400
when from the idea of when he was
conceived and to go from there.

1089
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:58,100
That's, that's where it was a, that's
where they started it out from.

1090
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,430
It came from the point of
conception, which was, um,

1091
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,770
and didn't the Pagan
holiday involve a tree. So,

1092
01:01:04,771 --> 01:01:07,350
and we just incorporated that tree.

1093
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:12,440
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. I'm
trying, I'm trying to find this thing.

1094
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,863
Shit.

1095
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,100
Well, again, the Internet again.
Sorry. I'm Brian [inaudible].

1096
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:25,110
You can't talk about Chinese people and
fish without a me telling this story.

1097
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,820
Uh, Joe, are you ready for this?

1098
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You
got the information? Yeah.
No, I don't. It's, um, it's,

1099
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,200
it's kind of ambiguous.
There's a lot of debate on this.

1100
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:38,920
This is not something that like
anybody really assure of when this, uh,

1101
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,300
this dude was actually born,

1102
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,780
the church leaders decided that they
needed a Christian alternative to rival

1103
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:45,940
popular solstice celebrations.

1104
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:49,510
They chose December 25th as the date
of Christ's birth and held the first

1105
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:52,360
recorded feast of activity in Rome.
Um,

1106
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:57,600
so the idea was they reckon the world was
created in the spring equinox and four

1107
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:03,211
days later on March 25th light was created
since the existence of Jesus signaled

1108
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:06,580
the beginning of the new
era or a new creation,

1109
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,420
the biblical chronographs [inaudible]
assume that Jesus has conception would

1110
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:15,130
have also fallen on March 25th placing
his birth in December nine months later

1111
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:20,040
seems logical. I mean, they created
the earth and then four days later

1112
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,390
light Duh Duh. What? Okay.

1113
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:25,860
It seems like a good day or a
problem with that very historic,

1114
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,630
keep in mind that it is the Internet.

1115
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,760
So we're not sure if it's a
hundred percent true. Yeah,

1116
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:32,820
this is all I want to hear. Tom
Rhodes. I tell the story please.

1117
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,010
So I was just in Hong Kong
a few weeks ago and uh,

1118
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,540
I remembered this story of something
that happened to me the very first time I

1119
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,310
went to Hong Kong was like 12 years ago.

1120
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,820
And I'd never been to Hong Kong and China
and I was really excited and wanted to

1121
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:50,850
see it.
I was staying at the Shangri la hotel,

1122
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,310
the most opulent, fancy, luxurious
hotel I've ever been in my life.

1123
01:02:56,311 --> 01:03:00,210
I mean above, beyond
Fivestars, just swink.

1124
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:05,460
And so the first day I just walked and
walked and I wanted to soak a as much of

1125
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:08,970
Hong Kong and my eyeballs. I could just
see the city and I'm walking around.

1126
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,690
And when I got back to my hotel
room at the end of the day,

1127
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:18,380
they had put a goldfish in a little
goldfish bowl on my desk and it had a note

1128
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,200
and it said,
traveling is sacred,

1129
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,900
but no one deserves to be alone.

1130
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,920
That's why we've provided the goldfish.

1131
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,210
It's awesome to be your friend and
keep you company during your stay here.

1132
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,360
Thank you.
So two nights later,

1133
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,960
Fatboy slim is doing a concert on
the Calhoun side of the harbor.

1134
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:47,280
I love Fatboy slim. I'd never seen
him. I had a, you know, somehow

1135
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:52,190
got some ecstasy or whatever it was.
And uh,

1136
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,100
it was,
it was such a great night.

1137
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,850
These Chinese people were just
so stylish and fashionable.

1138
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:01,340
They looked like he had fallen
out of fashion magazines.

1139
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:06,050
I just had such a great time dancing in
the middle and a Fatboy slim was just

1140
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:11,030
electrifying that night. And I drank tons
and I got really, really drunk, you know,

1141
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,360
life of a car. Uh, that night

1142
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:19,870
when I'm sleeping back in my hotel room,
I shit the bed.

1143
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,760
I'm like,
Huh,

1144
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,450
awake, you know, that kind of a wet or
drunk sleep. And I thought it was a Fart,

1145
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,150
you know,
and I looked,

1146
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:31,490
I blow it out and it's like wet
ass p goes all over the bed.

1147
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,400
And I had never,
I'd never should've been before.

1148
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,740
I'd never should've been
in my welcome to the team.

1149
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:40,640
I just absolutely say I have
absolutely ashamed that it happened.

1150
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,200
I felt the title. So the next day I
went and I walked all over the city.

1151
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,750
And you know, uh, when I
came back to my hotel room,

1152
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,110
they had taken my golden.

1153
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,560
You didn't even bother. Nobody
deserves to be alone except for you.

1154
01:04:56,561 --> 01:05:01,120
You been shitting Hickory.
Bad Shit and x freak.

1155
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,540
That's the problem. Actually.
See sexy until you shit though.

1156
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:08,110
It's such a lovely thing.
They put a little goldfish
in my room. That's nice man.

1157
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,340
Beautiful. So Nice. Hey, someone makes a
really good point on this message board.

1158
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:15,130
How the fuck did Christianity, uh, sure.

1159
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:17,950
Everyone being equal
and yet still slavery?

1160
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:23,600
That was exactly the debate.
The Abraham had slaves. Uh,

1161
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,220
so the, the, the slaveholders would cite
the Old Testament, but you're right.

1162
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,680
I mean, that was in fact, right?

1163
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:35,860
It's also what Martin Luther King and
a lot of a lot of abolitionists used to

1164
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:40,220
as, as fuel to fight the
slave trade, which was what?

1165
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:44,760
That we are all have the same
father. Am I not a man? The,

1166
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,780
the abolitionists always
reciting those kinds of things.

1167
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,310
But why would they, uh, going if
they're going by the Old Testament,

1168
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:52,810
the old testament's the real deal,

1169
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,650
the new testament is the one that's got
clear fuckery attached to it, right? Well,

1170
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,620
so if you're going to go by the word of
God, then oldest shit, you can get less.

1171
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,930
I don't know the fuck.
The fundamental difference was this,

1172
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,880
the young Ted seat that Christ said,

1173
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,090
the good news is all of us can be
essentially, uh, Jews are okay, are, are,

1174
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,770
are children of have the same father.
So it's not,

1175
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:16,230
the Old Testament was very
much for the, you know, in,

1176
01:06:16,231 --> 01:06:19,720
in taught in the temple and ms for this
small group of people called the Jews.

1177
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,550
But along comes Christ who says,
you know, you can't tell people,

1178
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:27,760
talk how people read the book of
Leviticus about it, how to quarter a calf.

1179
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:30,160
It just, you know, there's
just all not to eat off spray.

1180
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,630
None of this shit is relevant.

1181
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:36,310
What monitors matters is that you do
want to others as you'd have them do unto

1182
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,470
that Christ guy. That's the
idea. That would be the idea. Oh,

1183
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:44,471
let's just all allegedly Joe
Rogan's going to hell because Jesus,

1184
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,490
it's individualized

1185
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,140
mating.

1186
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:51,120
Fascinating thing that in 2013 just this
conversation is very dangerous to some

1187
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:53,420
people. This is a dangerous topic. Yeah.

1188
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:58,200
People get angry at you for discussing
whether or not a Zombie existed,

1189
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,760
whether or not a guy died and three days
later came back to life because he was

1190
01:07:03,871 --> 01:07:04,200
mad.

1191
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,380
I'm not making that argument,
man. I'm not having any,

1192
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:09,110
I'm not all I'm talking about.
Yeah, no, I know. Historical figure,

1193
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,120
but it's talking about that.
I'm just talking about what was,

1194
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:13,380
what Christianity's tenants are.
That's all me up

1195
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:17,620
and thinking about how many people
are going full bore for the, you know,

1196
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,450
historical,
Biblical version.

1197
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:24,250
There's the Gallup poll most recent that
they did in like the late two thousands

1198
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:29,410
about someone. They asked him, dude,
how old do you believe the earth is?

1199
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:32,200
Do you believe in the Biblical
version of creationism?

1200
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,240
And like 46% said they thought the
earth was less than 10,000 years old as

1201
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:41,500
stated in the Bible. Well, that's more
proof that if that statistic is right,

1202
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:45,070
that's scary. It's not, I'm sure, because
it's, first of all, it's a statistic,

1203
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:47,920
which means that the only people
that answer idiots, right? So you're,

1204
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:51,940
you're getting idiots that answer these
fucking, these, these questionnaires,

1205
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:56,470
nobody, nobody will though life or a job
or time you always hit no thanks. Yeah.

1206
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,970
Nobody does that.
So it's,

1207
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,750
but out of those people that are
dumb enough to answer that form,

1208
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,800
46% think the earth, 10,000
years old. That's amazing.

1209
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:10,210
I've had debates with people
who, you know, who I thought
were fairly intelligent,

1210
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:14,200
fair minded people who just insist that
what they read in the Bible is literally

1211
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:16,320
true. Yeah. There's a
lot of people like that.

1212
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,850
I liked him, met people in Australia
who called Easter Flying Zombie Day.

1213
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:25,560
That's a good name for it. I went super
bunny day two, giant fucking evil bunny.

1214
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,280
I like the idea. I like the idea
of trying to give you candy.

1215
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,810
If you leave on symbolism and
beats something, then okay.
Yeah. It's, well, you know,

1216
01:08:33,811 --> 01:08:36,780
and it's also a unique way for
people to turn their life around.

1217
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:41,120
You believe in this one guy's teachings
and this one guy's teachings really

1218
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:45,810
still, you know, the way
they're translated in sort
of an employee, you know,

1219
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,440
sort of use today in the
best aspects of Christianity.

1220
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:53,190
Very beneficial for a lot of people.
And so having something like that,

1221
01:08:53,191 --> 01:08:56,130
whether it's based on a real person
or whether it's based on an idea,

1222
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,240
it's very beneficial to alcoholics,
you know, like 12 step programs.

1223
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,360
How many fighters do you think of?
The guy was right.

1224
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,620
Jesus was just like a brilliant
comedian and just very misunderstood.

1225
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:09,350
It's right that like plank in
the eye line. I mean that's,

1226
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:12,050
I had to have been a joke.
I don't think that was totally a joke.

1227
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:16,130
One good minute turning wine
into water snacks was dog shit.

1228
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,020
I think it was just a really preachy guy.

1229
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,040
Constantly telling everybody how to live
their life. Like to where the jokes,

1230
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:26,170
where's the jokes bro? What am I,
how many fighters strong opens,

1231
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,260
strongest spiders.

1232
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,340
There's this, what'd you say Joe? A large
percentage. Yeah, probably more than, um,

1233
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,960
like the average person,
if you took the, uh,

1234
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,780
they say that atheism is on the
rise in America and uh, you know,

1235
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:42,980
some guy wrote an article about a by 20,
41 or something like that.

1236
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:46,220
There being no more religion.
I think that's a big fucking leap.

1237
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:51,440
But the idea is that atheism is
on the rise. Um, I don't think,

1238
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,820
I think in with fighters though, you're
dealing with a lot of them of course,

1239
01:09:55,850 --> 01:10:00,410
almost more so in boxing than an MMA.
But in,

1240
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,710
even in MMA, a lot of them are
coming from poor backgrounds.

1241
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,490
A lot of them are coming from uh,
places where people were, you know,

1242
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:11,780
the strong religious footholds. Right.
You know, Iowa and shit like that.

1243
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:13,970
Like wrestlers, a lot of
Christians, you know. Yeah.

1244
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:17,540
I saw that Tyson documentary last week.
And uh,

1245
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,700
I love at the beginning when custom
Mata takes him under his wing and he's

1246
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:24,930
teaching him and he told him that he had
to convince him cause he had low self

1247
01:10:24,931 --> 01:10:26,520
esteem coming from the
street and everything.

1248
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,130
But he is one of the main
factors that he's telling me.

1249
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:34,131
If you don't have the warrior spirit,

1250
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:39,060
you'll never going to be a winner. He,
I have to believe in yourself as the,

1251
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,070
you know,
the mythical warrior.

1252
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:43,760
Yeah. Champion. In a way that's may work.

1253
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,290
A lot of boxers find solace in the idea
that there's something bigger than, than,

1254
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,220
than,
than fighting for it.

1255
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:52,350
I've heard many fighters say they're
doing the Lord's work. It's fascinating.

1256
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,150
Yeah. I'm doing God's work.
I'm, there's not just one guy,

1257
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,710
many guys saying I'm doing God's work.
[inaudible] no, I don't believe he is.

1258
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,480
I mean, he might be a little bit, but, uh,

1259
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:05,200
I don't think for the most
part it is period tires
personally. Um, you know what,

1260
01:11:05,201 --> 01:11:07,960
I've said that and people give me
a hard time about that. I mean,

1261
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,920
only GSP knows what he
should or shouldn't do. Um,

1262
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:15,870
I think the guy is just an amazing
representative of martial arts.

1263
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:20,871
He's like such a true martial artist and
such a great champion for a long time.

1264
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:25,740
I mean, he was at the top of the sport
in an incredibly talented stack division.

1265
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,050
And he dominated that
division for a long time.

1266
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:33,710
But I think every fighter has got
a life time inside the octagon.

1267
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,950
There's a amount of time
that you can spend in there.

1268
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,630
George has fought more minutes inside the
five and a half hours than any fighter

1269
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,480
ever.
That's a,

1270
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,420
that's a long time and he's taken 50%
of all the blows he's ever taken his

1271
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:51,000
entire career in the last three fights.
Wow.

1272
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,630
875 the shots I believe too as well.

1273
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,020
The one of the things I was talking about
was how in the lead up to this fight

1274
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:00,600
was how difficult he is to hit.
And Johnny Hendricks hits really hard,

1275
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:05,490
but he's difficult to hit,
which was fairly true. Once
he got loose on the feet.

1276
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,570
Um, like say I would say in certain
rounds, like in the third round,

1277
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:11,400
it was hard for Johnny hit
him in the fifth round,

1278
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:13,500
was hard for trying to hit him.
George got loose,

1279
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:18,501
but Johnny still like when they got close
was able to land some horrible shots

1280
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:21,870
on him while George is
going for the take down.

1281
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:26,871
Johnny hit them with three
or four absolutely brutal
elbows to the head and then

1282
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,290
a couple really hard uppercuts as is
trying to hold onto his leg and take them

1283
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:36,291
down and Johnny blasted them with like
it leased to flush upper cuts on the chin

1284
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,360
with in the kitty.
It's hard.

1285
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,970
Anybody who thought that George won
that first round, I'm like, well,

1286
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:44,940
I don't know what you judge
a fight on. You know, look,

1287
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:49,420
Johnny blasted his leg over and over
again with these from the college look so

1288
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:52,890
hard. Knees and people try to pretend
that those don't count or something.

1289
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,950
I don't know why you're not scoring
that like those are debilitating.

1290
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:58,770
That's a smart move.
It's damaged, it's real.

1291
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,940
It's happening right
in front of your face.

1292
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,970
But because it's such an easy thing to do,
just need someone in the leg.

1293
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,230
People don't think it's a big deal.
It's almost as good as a leg kick.

1294
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:10,030
It's almost as good as electric depending
on how good it looks. So painful. Yeah.

1295
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:12,540
And the way Hendricks throws him,
it might be as good as a leg kick.

1296
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:15,870
He fucking really leans into those knees.
So He's hit him.

1297
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,740
He hit him with horrible fucking elbows
when he was trying to take them down,

1298
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,170
he hit him with a horrible uppercut.
We was holding onto a single,

1299
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,780
at least one or two horrible uppercuts
and then blasted his knee. And you know,

1300
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,980
I mean, and took them down
once. I mean, it's just like,

1301
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:31,590
I don't know what people are
looking at. I mean, I dunno.

1302
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,070
I know you people love towards CPA. Look
at his face. At the end of that fight,

1303
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:38,870
George gets busted up in a lot of fights
and still dominates them. You know, he,

1304
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:43,200
he has that kind of skin. So some people
just don't like Bj. Penn never gets cut.

1305
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:46,920
He's just got this incredible skin. Yeah,
he's got, he's got a lot of scar tissue.

1306
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:47,754
So I played.
Yes.

1307
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,730
But I think that there's gonna come a
time when George is going to have to

1308
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,410
retire.
So when is that time going to be?

1309
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:57,650
When a guide to me starts talking about
retiring and thinking about getting out,

1310
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,290
that's when he should get out. I agree.
And when a guy does a post fight thing,

1311
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,850
it says, look, I gotta I gotta stop.

1312
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:07,020
And it could just be the
pressure of forget about all
the shots that he's taken,

1313
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:08,850
all the brutal five round
fights that he's been in.

1314
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,770
Just the pressure of being at the top.

1315
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,690
I guess your while you don't want to
fucking deal with that shit anymore.

1316
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,660
He's made a ton of money and
even if he's not going to retire,

1317
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,090
the idea of stepping back
and chilling out for a bit,

1318
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:22,750
like he said in the post fight press
conference, it's probably a good idea. My,

1319
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:27,640
my feeling also is that, you know, if
he's be, if he's blurry in one eye,

1320
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:30,250
if his,
if he's having trouble remembering,

1321
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:34,510
I don't want to see a human being that
beautiful have a problem with his brain

1322
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,720
and a problem with his eyes.
And what is your brain and your eye worth?

1323
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,360
It's not worth $12 million.
It was worth a lot more than that.

1324
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:45,010
And I want to see a guy like George saint
walk away while he still can not carry

1325
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:46,450
down on a shield.
You know,

1326
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:50,410
fighting is a young man's sport and
there's a certain amount of years.

1327
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,610
Dana White's at GSP versus Hendricks
rematches on track, you know,

1328
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:57,760
and also it turns out that George
is getting sued by his ex manager.

1329
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,210
He's got a lot of shit going on, which
can really fuck with your head. You know,

1330
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:03,890
there's some million dollar lawsuit
hovering over his head. Yeah,

1331
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,040
I think George is a great guy and I
think he's an amazing example of what's

1332
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:13,660
possible with hard work and discipline.
And he's a real champion, a true champion.

1333
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:17,440
I like to see a true champion go out on
top and there's just not many of ever

1334
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,410
done it. He's the only one that I
couldn't remember his Marvin Hagler.

1335
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:23,350
Marvin Hagler is the only
fighter that never came back,

1336
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:28,240
went out in a fight that
most people believe he won.
He fought sugar ray Leonard.

1337
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:31,060
And a lot of people believe
that he won that decision.

1338
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,330
It was if it was a close enough fight
that it wasn't the worst robbery in

1339
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:34,960
history,

1340
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,470
but a lot of people believe that haggle
should've won and Hagler stepped out and

1341
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,304
that was it.

1342
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:43,090
That was such a great period in boxing,
man. There was so many great fights.

1343
01:15:43,091 --> 01:15:46,540
You know, I always think that
like Pacquiao and Mayweather, not,

1344
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,800
I think they deprived us of like
two great fights and rematches.

1345
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:55,750
I mean there was so many haggler
Thomas Hitman, Hearns uh, the uh,

1346
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,130
what was the Cuban guy?
Smart man, sugary load,

1347
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:03,400
the Roberta [inaudible] epic fights.

1348
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:05,900
Then Duran Duran vs packet
would have been an amazing

1349
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:12,160
say, similar style, touching
their belly like fucking beer.

1350
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:15,790
They had similar bearded man.
That would've been a war.
Duran had more of a beard,

1351
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:19,180
you know, but pack yet with that goatee
looks very devil like you see Duran,

1352
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:23,080
like those old pictures of him and his
eyes. If you're at a game, bread pit bull,

1353
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:24,590
you know,
let's talk to the pin through that though.

1354
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,680
He had that same literally the same
eyes, like just, just ferocity.

1355
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,810
He was a bad motherfucker.
Dude. Everybody. I've talked
to him as a real boxer.

1356
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,920
They always say my favorite bag.
I was like, boom, boom, man.

1357
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:37,840
Seeing his favorite fighter.
Roberto Duran.

1358
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:42,310
So many boxers who are real great boxers.
We'll, we'll talk about Duran. Like,

1359
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,920
you know, there's a lot of people
that people forget like Aaron Pryor.

1360
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:49,030
I remember when your car got cocaine
in the corner before the 13th round.

1361
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:53,100
I don't remember that. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Panama Lewis, the
guy was eventually, uh, he,

1362
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,550
he got kicked,

1363
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,790
kicked out of boxing for
a, another fight where, uh,

1364
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:02,560
I think it was a Billy resto and uh,
I forget the guy's name,

1365
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,940
but um, he took, took the
padding out of someone's gloves.

1366
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:12,290
And so there's this young up and
coming kid who, uh, fought this, this,

1367
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,340
you know,
experienced veteran.

1368
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:17,120
The news is expected to beat and
instead he got busted up really bad.

1369
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:21,050
Like I said, both eyes swollen lots
vision is, I had to retire from boxing,

1370
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,071
but after the fight,

1371
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:25,370
they grabbed the guy's hands and they
could feel there was no padding on his

1372
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:28,340
knuckles. Oh my God. It
was just taped up knuckles.

1373
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:31,040
That's all he had and he
just fuck this guy up.

1374
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:34,650
And for people who don't know a boxing
glove, it's fairly thick. Yeah, it's,

1375
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,280
it's still dangerous.
You could certainly get knocked out,

1376
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:40,250
but there's a lot of padding like
when a knuckle hits you like,

1377
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:42,230
especially when it goes over your eye,

1378
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:47,500
whereas a raw knuckle goes right into
your eye and he's just getting smashed.

1379
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,201
Man.

1380
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:52,280
He got smashed and after the fight it
turned out that Panama Lewis had done this

1381
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,400
and Panama Lewis was the same
guy that gave the, the, this,

1382
01:17:55,700 --> 01:18:00,320
this bottle that Aaron Pryor was like
a serious cocaine addicts and the Aaron

1383
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,620
Pryor, like I said, uh, you know,

1384
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,910
it was like leading into one of the
later rounds and panel. I said, no,

1385
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:07,930
not that battle. The one on one
I made and he brings a body,

1386
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:11,150
gives it to Aaron Pryor and Aaron probably
just goes out there like a fucking

1387
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:15,950
man possessed and destroys Alexis are
grail and knocks him out in the next

1388
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:19,600
round. That was fights were sick and the
word on the street was always that, not,

1389
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:20,990
not that I was on the
street when I got the word,

1390
01:18:20,991 --> 01:18:24,050
but the word in the boxing gym where I
trained at was that everybody always knew

1391
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:28,190
that it was cocaine. Panama, Louis
literally gave him cocaine, God.

1392
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,680
And he went out there coked up.
If you haven't seen,

1393
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,980
if you haven't seen Aaron Pryor and
Alexis Arguello fight youtube that shit

1394
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:34,420
because

1395
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,310
I love that so many fights are on youtube.

1396
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,900
I don't know if we
talked about this before.

1397
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:40,080
I read this brilliant book
last year called [inaudible].

1398
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:44,260
It was a flame of pure fire about
Jack Dempsey and the roaring twenties.

1399
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,070
And he was such an interesting character,
but it's great as,

1400
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,100
as I was reading this book, you can go
back and look up the fights on youtube.

1401
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:56,260
So I'm reading about this, you know,
these fights and like the 19 teens and uh,

1402
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:58,330
you know, even before him, the, uh,

1403
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:02,740
Jack Johnson fight in Havana where
this French Guy Colten [inaudible] or

1404
01:19:02,741 --> 01:19:06,940
whatever his name was, it was,
uh, knocks him out and you get,

1405
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:10,480
Jack Johnson is on the floor and he like,
he, he lifts his glove up cause it was,

1406
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:14,100
he wanted to block that sun from his eyes
while the guy's like counting him out.

1407
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:19,300
The idea was that he took a
dive, right. And then, but
uh, like a Dempsey and Furpa,

1408
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:23,320
this Argentinian guy, the first
round, you watch it on youtube,

1409
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:28,380
there's like a football gets knocked down
five times in the first round or maybe

1410
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:29,830
it's like seven.
Damn.

1411
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,520
She's clobbering him and then he comes
back over over and then allowed to get up

1412
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:37,600
for po knocked. That was so many
rules were made after this fight for,

1413
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,700
for apoe knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

1414
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,750
He landed on the sports writers table
and the sportswriters helped him get back

1415
01:19:43,751 --> 01:19:45,910
up. You know, he was so beloved
and get back in the ring.

1416
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,090
So from that fight it a
fighter could never, uh,

1417
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,570
he has to get back into the ring on
his own ability. You can't be helped.

1418
01:19:52,571 --> 01:19:54,190
And then also in that fight,

1419
01:19:54,191 --> 01:19:57,610
he's knocking for bow down
and he's standing over him
and as he's trying to get

1420
01:19:57,611 --> 01:20:01,180
up, he just plowed him every time he's
chatting. And it was also that fight.

1421
01:20:01,181 --> 01:20:04,020
They made the role. When a guy gets
knocked down, you have to, you know,

1422
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,280
back away and go to a neutral corner
cause back then you could stand over a guy

1423
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,840
and as he's trying to get up,
you can just keep on. Yeah.

1424
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:13,710
That's most of the old fights.
If you watch most of those old fights,

1425
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:18,000
they would stand over you as
a county [inaudible] tutto
fights, which by the way,

1426
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:21,090
makes more sense. Yeah, it really
does make more sense. I mean,

1427
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:24,180
if a guy fucking knocks you down,
why, why do you let him get up again?

1428
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:27,120
Why can't you stand over him? You, you're,
you're the one who knocked him down.

1429
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,810
Pull up Dempsey FERPA. That the first like
minute and a half is just, it's insane.

1430
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,970
[inaudible] murderous puncher to man.
God Damn, those guys were tough as shit.

1431
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:40,500
You know how he started in like a, he
was born in Colorado and he lived in the,

1432
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,760
uh, like mining camps in
Utah and he would go to, uh,

1433
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:49,110
like bars and mining camps and say,
who's the toughest guy here?

1434
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,360
And that's how he,
like as a teenager,

1435
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,110
he just walking into a mining camp and
people would all bet on it and he'd make

1436
01:20:55,111 --> 01:20:58,470
a little money, but like,
he was just pure bad ass.

1437
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:03,520
Wow. That's a hard way to make a
living, hone into the mining kid.

1438
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:08,380
Who's the toughest guy here? Mind Jimmy's
Jimmy Burke's uncle already Burke.

1439
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:11,770
He used to do that. He, when they were,
where he worked on the railroad tracks,

1440
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,970
when they would lay the railroad and
uh, those, those camps, he was 16,

1441
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,700
but he grew up with a father, was a
pro boxer, uh, fought for the title.

1442
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,740
So he would fight grown men.

1443
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,150
And that's how we learned how to fight
boxing back then was a real Spec,

1444
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:27,550
a very popular sport. It's the way
it wasn't in Mexico. If you're,

1445
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:30,840
if you're a great boxer, you're
a national hero. I mean they,

1446
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:34,120
they show up for those fights. That's
what it's going to be like in America.

1447
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:37,750
But America, nobody even knows who the
heavyweight title holder is. I know.

1448
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:40,450
If you looked at, have you seen who
that best American heavyweight is? Well,

1449
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:43,510
let me just, no one knows who the
Klitschkos are. They don't know.

1450
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:46,630
The average person doesn't know it's a
fight. Fans might know. It's amazing.

1451
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:50,560
The average person has no
idea that heavyweight champ.
It's so corrupt. Well no,

1452
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:54,610
because he's boring as fuck. If he was
exciting, like if he, if he was, you know,

1453
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,710
like a Manny Pacquiao, everybody knows
who Manny Pacquiao, Manny Pacquiao,

1454
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:59,890
always 145 pounds.
Everybody knows who he is.

1455
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,110
Why doesn't everybody know who
the heavyweight title holder is?

1456
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:05,320
Cause he jabs and hangs
on to grabs and hangs on.

1457
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,940
He's a jab and hold Goliath fights or
more exciting. Well he's boring. Yeah.

1458
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,460
Mike Tyson was a heavy fighter.
Fights. We're super excited. Yeah.

1459
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:15,730
It's just a matter of the style of the
fighter and Klitschkos have this very

1460
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:19,480
intelligent, safe style. And
it's very hard to beat them.

1461
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,450
They just jabbed the shit out of you.
And they're tall as fuck.

1462
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,430
They use their reach
advantage and never get close.

1463
01:22:24,431 --> 01:22:28,240
They don't get stupid and start winging
punches with you. Right. You know, there,

1464
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:31,140
especially in iron man. Yeah,
I mean in the way Mayweather,

1465
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,810
what I noticed is that he stands on
the outside and he takes one shot.

1466
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,610
It's really like one left watch.

1467
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,490
It's not like flurries and combinations
cause that's always dangerous.

1468
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:42,990
If you watch him step back,
he's not staying in a phone
booth. He's moving movies,

1469
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,580
stepping back, Bang, come
in, Bang. And he might,

1470
01:22:45,581 --> 01:22:49,210
he might hit you with two sometimes. Like,
like he'll, he'll lead with like that,

1471
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:51,520
that, that upper, that, that upper hook,

1472
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:56,500
that up hook or whatever app or punch
a particular, what do you call it?

1473
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,190
Upper cut. Sorry. He'll, he'll upper cut
and then maybe come over to the right.

1474
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:01,630
But that's it.
And then he pulls back.

1475
01:23:01,631 --> 01:23:04,930
But for the most part he stands back and
take pot shots. He's really good at it.

1476
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:08,380
Did you see that Mayweather fight?
Uh, there was some Mexican guy,

1477
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,260
Canelo Alvarez and the Mexican guys.

1478
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:14,890
Dad gets up at the pre fight
press conference. No, no, none.

1479
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,490
He keeps going in a different guy
and he's calling, keeps calling me.

1480
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:19,840
Whether like a

1481
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,300
talking about that fighter
is a front runner. He's the
front runner and all that.

1482
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,360
He's a different guy.
You're talking about a Garcia.

1483
01:23:27,361 --> 01:23:30,630
Danny Garcia who's a dad is like,
it's really colorful character.

1484
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,890
What was that with Mayweather.

1485
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:36,650
He was saying then it's no dude who's like
Mayweather, like a similar, he's black.

1486
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,450
I always like him or never let your
dad is very temporary towers Connor.

1487
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:44,920
He actually fought. They fought.
They fought. He fought Mayweather.

1488
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,540
Yeah. Subdued is really
good. Yeah. Mayweather's just
smarter than all of them.

1489
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,790
That's what he is.
He's the smartest one of all of them.

1490
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:55,440
He knows how to not get hit. He knows how
to just pot shot you hit you with jabs,

1491
01:23:55,441 --> 01:23:58,920
uses reflex, uses smart boxing
and you, he doesn't get hit.

1492
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,580
You get hit and he doesn't
get that amazing. Sorry.

1493
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,433
He's won the game.

1494
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:05,820
That's what a lot of boxes that come
from boxing fighter fighter families. Um,

1495
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:09,720
they, their, their fathers and uncles
have learned, you know, there's no upside,

1496
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:12,780
there's no upside of eating out of a
straw when you're 35 cause your head,

1497
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,420
you've got Pluto pugilistic dementia,
at least start with not getting it.

1498
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:19,780
He's got his trainer, he's trained or
Rogers is fucking cousin or his uncle,

1499
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:24,030
his uncle and his trainer Rogers. He
was a good fighter. Black Mamba. Yeah.

1500
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,720
Roger May where there was
a bad mother fucker. Yep.

1501
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,930
But he's got problems from fighting.
They all do. Look at Freddy Roach.

1502
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,200
She's like one of the greatest trainers
ever who used to be a really tough

1503
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:36,820
fighter. He's got problems too. He's got
Parkinson's trauma related Parkinson's.

1504
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,690
Everybody pays man.
There's no free rides.

1505
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,480
And my thoughts on the guy
like George Saint Pierre, ours,

1506
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:46,630
it would be beautiful to see a guy
like him go out on top. I agree.

1507
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:51,220
But if he feels like he didn't put forth
his best effort and he wants to go one

1508
01:24:51,221 --> 01:24:54,060
more against Johny Hendricks and show
what he could really do, you know,

1509
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,800
but somewhere down the line we're going
to have to have this conversation.

1510
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:59,400
Whether it's this fight, whether it's
the next fight, whether it's two,

1511
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:02,680
three fights from now, it's going to be
a certain point in time where George,

1512
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,400
who has more minutes inside the
octagon that any fighter ever,

1513
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,040
that's one statistic that you
looked at five and a half hours.

1514
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,220
And then you also look at the one that
he's taking 50% of the shots in the last

1515
01:25:12,221 --> 01:25:17,120
three fights. Those are two,
this disturbing statistics.
Not Disturbing, but I,

1516
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,650
here's the best way to describe it.
There are two things you should look at.

1517
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,830
You should look at those two things.

1518
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:27,310
And that's the reality of
this sport we live in. And
the best that we, that we, uh,

1519
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:29,500
that we watch.
But the best way to,

1520
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:33,370
to make sure that this doesn't happen
is to discuss it. That's the only way.

1521
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:36,760
If we keep this shit in the dark and
no one talks about it and no one ever

1522
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:37,990
brings up the fact that hey,
you know,

1523
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:39,820
you're not gonna be able to
take shots like that forever.

1524
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,050
There has to be a point in time.

1525
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:44,680
You could safely do it for a certain
amount of time, as long as you're careful,

1526
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,020
as long as they have good defense, as
long as you're smart with your training.

1527
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,880
But there's gonna come a point in time,
you probably shouldn't.

1528
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:50,440
I was kind of shocked that the,

1529
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,900
that they counted the number
of times he's taken a blow.

1530
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:55,630
It's 875 times in the past, in, in,

1531
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:57,610
in the five and a half hours
he's been in the octagon.

1532
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:01,780
That does not count the number of times
he's gotten hit in the head in training

1533
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:04,040
camp and training camp. You know, I've

1534
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,740
talked to enough fighters where you're,
you walk, you walk away with a headache,

1535
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:08,960
man. Of course. You know, of
course you do. You're not,

1536
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:12,230
you're getting hit in the face. Look
at his face. Wow. Yeah, dude, trust me.

1537
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,020
There's something going on.
You gotta be careful, you know,

1538
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:17,750
and he was talking up to the
fight about losing memory.

1539
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:20,870
He lost memory during the fight. It's
not cool. Yeah, I don't like seeing that.

1540
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,740
And He'd also told me on
this podcast that he, um,

1541
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:28,880
hit me and he wonders what it is
that he like misses time sometimes.

1542
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:32,960
And he actually was wondering like, you
know, not saying that it was aliens,

1543
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:34,760
but it could be possible that,
you know,

1544
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,910
when people talk about missing time from
abductions, that that happens to him.

1545
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:42,200
You know, this is something that he's
had from the time he was young. I'm like,

1546
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:46,640
man, I don't know. I mean, maybe it's
possible. It's possible. It's aliens,

1547
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:47,420
but it's also,

1548
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,150
there's other things to think about when
you start talking about like missing

1549
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:53,120
time. When you start talking
about there's, there's,

1550
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,990
there's a real issue
with cognitive function.

1551
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:00,830
If you're talking about like
periods of your life that disappear.

1552
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,250
I don't think anything's worth
that, I don't think. Yeah. I mean,

1553
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:07,790
I don't know what it is. It might be
nothing. It might be a nutrition thing.

1554
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,700
And I'm not, obviously not a
neurologist. I'm not a doctor.

1555
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,950
I don't know what the fuck
he's actually experiencing.

1556
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,440
I don't know if maybe
it's just a Deja Vu thing.

1557
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,880
I don't know what the fuck it is,

1558
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:20,870
but when someone starts talking about
things like that and also talking about

1559
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:23,060
possibly retiring,
all those things,

1560
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:26,330
she'd be taken into consideration and
it should be approached very carefully.

1561
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:31,160
We also know that continued head trauma
for football and boxing and things does

1562
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:35,030
cause problems. There's no way
around it. I mean there's no way,

1563
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,170
it seems like everybody who does
it for a certain amount of time,

1564
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,000
there's a certain number
of times you can get hit.

1565
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:43,940
There's just where you start feeling
that you have damn like chocolate.

1566
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:48,140
Dal is the perfect example. Chocolate
Dell used to have a fucking iron jaw.

1567
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:51,890
It was one of the things that was so
scary about him is that he could knock you

1568
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:54,890
out and it was really hard
to get him out of there.

1569
01:27:55,130 --> 01:28:00,130
He has so much fucking heart and so
such an intense high drive to finish the

1570
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:07,070
fight and he took tremendous shots
like right on the button got rocked and

1571
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:10,280
plastic. You write back and knocked
you out happened all the time.

1572
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:14,180
He would just scare the fuck out of guys
cause he would just charge you and he

1573
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:19,181
was just throwing bombs your way and
taking everything you throw at him and

1574
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:22,910
spitting it out. Hit hard. Huh? Like
what he did to Tito. Like watch,

1575
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:27,140
watch this thing. What? He stops
Tito. He just fucking attacks him.

1576
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,640
I mean he was a man.
He was tall dude.

1577
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:34,010
He was a Berzerker Lucas,
look at this.

1578
01:28:34,011 --> 01:28:36,590
This is a ferocious attack.

1579
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:41,620
God put put up Chuck Liddell
versus Bob Ballou put that one on.

1580
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,300
You want to see another one like that?

1581
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,440
Chuck Liddell was one of
the scariest champions ever.

1582
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:52,250
He was one of the scariest guys ever cause
he beat guys even that were like more

1583
01:28:52,251 --> 01:28:53,420
skilled in him.

1584
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:57,960
He beat guys that like he probably
shouldn't have beaten. He just,

1585
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:01,500
he beat everybody.
You know along the way learning,

1586
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:04,500
you know how to become the champion.
He was just smashing people.

1587
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:07,610
He could just uncork that right.
He's been on rice has me. I mean,

1588
01:29:07,611 --> 01:29:11,370
of course it got towards the later end
of his career where he just couldn't take

1589
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:13,500
shots anymore.
You just couldn't take them anymore.

1590
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,640
And essentially what he described it as,
his brain knows what's coming.

1591
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,450
He's almost like he's too tough for his
own good and his brain knows what kind

1592
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:24,480
of punishment that he's going to get
because it's happened so many times before

1593
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:27,510
because he would just bite down as a
mouth piece and just fucking deal with it

1594
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,910
and get to you and blast you out.
You know?

1595
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,800
And his brain just wouldn't
let him do it anymore.

1596
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,610
So He'd get hit and his brain
would go like check please.
Wow. Yeah. That's, that's,

1597
01:29:35,611 --> 01:29:39,120
that makes a lot of sense. Cause they,
the same thing with, um, Vandelay Silva.

1598
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:43,500
Like he, he just, he goes
right out now, you know, when
he gets hit, uh, not as bad.

1599
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:47,610
I think vandelays Chin is probably a
little more durables. And Chuck was,

1600
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:52,030
trucks was at the end, you know,
chuck at the end. Uh, he just,

1601
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,980
he was really in good shape. He's still
at heart, you know you still get hit hard.

1602
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,480
Still have the desire,
just couldn't take the shots anymore.

1603
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,020
There's also the idea that if these guys
are learning and they're working with

1604
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,900
boxers as they learn how to punch
the way Johnny Hendricks says,

1605
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,640
I don't care how strong your jaws,

1606
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,740
you're not taking a shot
from Johnny Hendricks.

1607
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:11,960
He puts people to sleep cause he hits so
hard and if he connects, see you later.

1608
01:30:11,961 --> 01:30:13,140
If he connects flush.
Yeah.

1609
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:16,140
That's the key is like how hard
is he actually hitting you?

1610
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:19,230
Is he ever hitting you like dead on the
Monday? If you watch this past weekend,

1611
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:22,770
Tyron Woodley knocked out Josh Koscheck.
He hit him with a right hand.

1612
01:30:22,771 --> 01:30:27,771
That was as as hard a punch as a human
can throw like as hard upon body.

1613
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:32,070
By the way, built like a super hero. It
doesn't even look real. I mean come on.

1614
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:35,010
We've talked about three podcasts in the
roads. Clear. We're in love with them.

1615
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,200
Let's keep talking about,
I'm never get tired of that.

1616
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,860
He hits so fucking hard that
like if he hits you flush, man,

1617
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,020
very few people are going
to be able to absorb that.

1618
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,380
But every now and then you
say that there's some Mark
Hunt type dude that could

1619
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:51,180
just take it one. Let's just start
there. That's a whole different thing.

1620
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:54,160
Those are, those are some
tough motherfucker got friends
who played pro football.

1621
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,700
I said Samoan somehow it's
just a whole different thing.

1622
01:30:56,940 --> 01:31:00,690
You have like thicker bones.
Oh my God. They're like
bigger people. Plus they have,

1623
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:05,690
they come from a whole long line of
Warriors, Polynesian people, you know,

1624
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,720
some molens come from a
New Zealanders to come

1625
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:10,460
long, long, some bad mother fuckers.

1626
01:31:10,461 --> 01:31:14,270
Apparently Galleries Tanga barely
smos are not to be fucked with. I,

1627
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:17,510
years ago I lived in San Francisco
and there were these guys that, uh,

1628
01:31:17,511 --> 01:31:20,450
these Samoan guys that worked at
this garage where I got my car fixed,

1629
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,130
but there was this one guy who I though
it was this really gentle, wonderful guy.

1630
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:29,540
He was the one that I, you know, kind of
considered like my friend, you know. Um,

1631
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,540
and I took my car there one day and he
wasn't there and I'm like, you know,

1632
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:37,280
wherever, so you know, whatever his name
was. And uh, his friend goes, oh yeah,

1633
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:39,230
he's in jail.
He gotten to,

1634
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:43,850
he was playing pool and somebody pissed
him off in a bar and he beat the guy to

1635
01:31:43,851 --> 01:31:47,630
death with the, with the,
the pool, the ball Samoan.

1636
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,990
You just grabbed a ball off the,

1637
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:55,310
off the billiards table and be the guy
who does with it and they seem like the

1638
01:31:55,311 --> 01:31:56,144
nicest gym.

1639
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,060
This guy,
oh my God,

1640
01:31:58,061 --> 01:32:01,500
guys aren't until you got pissed off
and they've got a pool ball in there.

1641
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:05,680
Imagine that type of thing.
Look at that little don't reach,

1642
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:10,750
look at the way he used to just, Oh
my God. Yeah. He was a murderer dude.

1643
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,200
He was a murderer.
Um,

1644
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,860
chuck at his best is one of the scary
John Macarthur looking at reach.

1645
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,760
And so that was Larry landless.
Yeah, chuck was fucking,

1646
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:26,050
it's got a wide head man.
Chuck was brutal. Yeah.

1647
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:30,160
But every guy gets to a time like,
look,

1648
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:34,740
if you could repair the human body, if
you could get chuck Liddell back to the,

1649
01:32:34,741 --> 01:32:37,840
the, the, the ability to absorb
punishment that he had when he was 20,

1650
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:41,350
he would be dominating again today.
He'd be smashing people.

1651
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,720
He would be smashing Pete.
He was, yeah, he was,

1652
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,010
I mean it was guys who could beat him.

1653
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,640
I'm saying it's boxing rampage beat it
in pride and he went into that fight,

1654
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:52,960
injured, but when rampage beat
him in the UFC, he was probably,

1655
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:56,050
chuck was probably already
starting to show signs of wear.

1656
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:58,520
Rampage knocked him out and then,
uh,

1657
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:02,500
Rashad Evans knocked him out bad with
one punch and then rich Franklin knocked

1658
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:06,310
him out. So there was a lot going on
with chuck Keech. Our Dean dropped him.

1659
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:07,360
There was a lot going on,

1660
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,690
which he had clearly gotten to a
point where he's taken to me shots.

1661
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:14,050
But if you can get them back to when he
was like in his early twenties and his

1662
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:14,950
first fight in the UFC,

1663
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,430
he would be a top contender or
the champion [inaudible] guys.

1664
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:22,210
They're boxing now as much better than
it was then, isn't it? He didn't care.

1665
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:25,510
He would, first of all, his boxing
wasn't that bad. He had good counters.

1666
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:28,420
It's just his attack was so ruthless.

1667
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:31,870
I mean he was chocolate dough was
trained by John Hackleman is a,

1668
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:35,980
a very knowledgeable trainer and
Chuck's capable of being as technical as

1669
01:33:35,981 --> 01:33:37,960
anybody,
but he doesn't,

1670
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:41,680
he hits you and he knows you're hurt
and the swarm has come and bitch.

1671
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:45,550
It's locus over the hills. It's lightning
and thunder to fucking earthquake.

1672
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:49,510
He can't stand up for and knuckles
are flying towards your fucking face.

1673
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:51,880
What do you like it or not? There's
not a lot of technique involved in,

1674
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,060
I mean there's technique, but there's
not a lot of strategies. I should,

1675
01:33:55,061 --> 01:34:00,010
what I should say, he's just uncorking
power shot after power shot. And if you,

1676
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:04,420
you know, 10 if you connect to his
chin somewhere along the line, yeah,

1677
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:08,860
good luck stopping him. Good luck. He
could take a fucking tremendous shot, man.

1678
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,350
God, look at him knocking out random
and is that an annulment? Yeah,

1679
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:15,750
that was randomly not Olympian.
That's Mike Tyson's. Better
looking brother, right.

1680
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,590
Not Random and out with a
leaping left hook. Yeah. He, he,

1681
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:22,570
he was a fucking monster man.
He was a murderer.

1682
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:25,840
Spent a lot of times he wasn't
dude's out when he was at the peak,

1683
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:29,080
when he was the best.
He was a fucking ferocious fighter.

1684
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:33,430
He's one of the main reasons why the UFC
became so successful because watching

1685
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:37,510
him fight was like watching a fucking war.

1686
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:38,620
You would watch,

1687
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:42,340
it was like you two are going to
stand in the middle of the cage,

1688
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:46,510
is going to impose his will on you
and just put knuckles to your face.

1689
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:49,510
Shins. Yeah, that's him and Vandelay.

1690
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:53,530
This was already after chuck
had had probably, you know,

1691
01:34:53,531 --> 01:34:57,170
he was probably in the twilight of his
career when him and Vandelay went at it.

1692
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:01,430
He just didn't quite have as
much pep to his step as he did,

1693
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,840
but it was still a fucking amazing
fight. What a fight. I got that fight.

1694
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:10,980
So tough. Look at Vandelay that's on the
wall. This is fight a big picture of it.

1695
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,850
It's like, like when the, they made
the, um, that Jim and my back, my, uh,

1696
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,220
garage, look at them
taking those shots. Man.

1697
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,560
They took photos from classic fights and
to me this was like one of the all time

1698
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:25,010
who won this fight. Chuck wanted
decision was a great fight though,

1699
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:25,731
but it was like,

1700
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:29,210
to me it was like such a classic because
this was the fight that we always

1701
01:35:29,211 --> 01:35:33,200
wanted to see. When Vandelay was in
pride and chuck was running the UFC,

1702
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:36,270
everybody wanted to see chuck
versus Vandelay, you know,

1703
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:40,910
so much faster than you think to like
he can knock you out by moving backward.

1704
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,650
Like look at the Randy coture knockouts.

1705
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:45,290
He knocked out Randy while
he's moving backward.

1706
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,660
Like if you slide that
video back a little bit,

1707
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:51,590
the one when he knocked out Randy, he
not, yeah, it was right after this.

1708
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:52,970
He knocked out Randy,

1709
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:58,030
like Randy was charged at him and he
would slide back and uncork these punches.

1710
01:35:58,641 --> 01:36:02,300
There wasn't a lot of wind up in the
shot that he knocked Randy out with.

1711
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:07,010
He was just loose. He was
loose. He just was a wild man.

1712
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:10,400
Like here it goes. Watch. This is the
one, this is when he fought. Look at this,

1713
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:13,070
how he knocks out. Randy
backs up, boom, boom.

1714
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,840
As he's backing up Randy's charging and
as he's backing up he clips him with

1715
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:18,290
like,

1716
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:23,160
you know a 100 millisecond right hand
that takes your fucking face ages.

1717
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:24,890
He was awesome.
Awesome man.

1718
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,890
He's one of the reasons why the UFC
became so successful because watching his

1719
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:30,560
fights, you were guaranteed.
You're going to see fury,

1720
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,600
you're going to see primal fury.

1721
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,740
You're going to see one of the
wildest men alive. I like that.

1722
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:38,780
You described him one time
with the greatest way you went.

1723
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,930
You said he's a wolf and somebody said,
what do you mean?

1724
01:36:41,931 --> 01:36:44,000
He said he's the Kinda guy
jumping a fire and say,

1725
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:47,690
let's see who burns first bitch. It's
the craziest way to describe that. Yeah,

1726
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:52,070
he would take you into DC is going to
burn first and for the longest time he was

1727
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:54,590
successful doing that because
he could take a tremendous shot.

1728
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:59,830
But ultimately his wild reckless nature
led to him taking quite a few shots and

1729
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:05,720
you know, he look, the UFC took care of
him. You know, he wanted one last fight.

1730
01:37:05,721 --> 01:37:08,630
He got it with Franklin and then he
decided that's it and now he has a job.

1731
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:10,460
He like,
he's like an ambassador for the sport.

1732
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:14,990
It goes all over the country tours
basis towards gyms. Right. You know, he,

1733
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:19,400
he's got like a great gig in the UFC now.
They take care of them.

1734
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:22,970
And I love the fact that they told him
like this is, you know, enough is enough.

1735
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:24,650
He got to a point where,
you know,

1736
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:29,150
chucking and Dana had a long standing
relationship and before chuck was in the

1737
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:31,430
UFC or before Dana ran the UFC,

1738
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:36,320
chuck was a being managed by Dana as
was Tito. Danny used to manage them.

1739
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,500
And you know, when we started
writing, you know that, yeah, on my,

1740
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,350
I did a podcast with Brendan Schaub,

1741
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,610
that fighter and the kid
with Dana in his office.

1742
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:48,170
And he talked about how he had already
boxed Tito and it didn't go well for Tito

1743
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:52,590
cause well Tito wasn't a
boxer, a wrestler, he would
take guys down and he says,

1744
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:56,010
he said that in an MMA fight,
Tito would pull his head with a spine and

1745
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,843
everything. But he said, yeah,

1746
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:00,720
but he challenged him to a
boxing match and you know,
and it was, it was funny, he,

1747
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,250
Dana's still gets create like the fact
that I said to him, what keeps your edge?

1748
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:07,920
Like what drives you? He goes, I want
this to be the biggest sport in the world.

1749
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:09,600
And I said,
you're the most bristly dude.

1750
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,770
He answers his tweets and fights with
people on Twitter. And somebody was like,

1751
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,360
why do you do that? And he goes,
because it's fucking fun. That's why.

1752
01:38:18,730 --> 01:38:22,560
And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the fighter and
the kid, cause I'm on Fox, they bleep out.

1753
01:38:22,561 --> 01:38:24,720
Fuck. They believed that every, you know,

1754
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,890
he's literally like every other word
is fuck. But um, he's got such an edge.

1755
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:31,110
That guy, he bleep it
out. It's so annoying.

1756
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:33,570
You need to stop doing
podcasts on somebody else's

1757
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,820
when you don't need a wing.
You don't need anybody that ever beeps.

1758
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:43,440
You stop your stupid nonsense. It's
so dumb. It chose me. That's so dumb.

1759
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,650
And you know what? Not on my podcast
and on the Brock Callen show,

1760
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,800
it's gonna make people avoid that goes
against the reason of having a podcast.

1761
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,900
Yeah. I didn't know these
people, man. It annoys people.

1762
01:38:51,901 --> 01:38:53,910
I get a lot of mail about
it. I'm sorry. I always,

1763
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:57,300
I'm always having to apologize
for it. Yeah, it's gross, man.

1764
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:01,170
The idea that someone could fucking tell
you what you can or can't say. Yeah.

1765
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,230
It's a, it's against
podcasting. Exactly. Exactly.

1766
01:39:04,231 --> 01:39:07,040
The whole point of this is that
we can do what we want. How? Yeah.

1767
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,940
Why'd you let a corporation do that?
I don't.

1768
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:11,560
I didn't know they were going to
do it. Bail on that. My mistake.

1769
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:16,260
Do you have a contract? Yeah. One year.
You son of a bitch. Yeah. After it's over.

1770
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,920
Tell them the only way you're
doing it. Again, as if,
let's say it's a podcast Fox,

1771
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:22,920
let's do this, right? Maybe I'll come
over to your network. I'll make a network.

1772
01:39:22,970 --> 01:39:24,610
All right, I'll make one. There we go.

1773
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:26,850
I'll get the prime accounts
show and your network. Yeah.

1774
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,610
Just so you can use my office. You
can use this. I'm moving out here.

1775
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
I'm going to be your neighbors soon.
Good. You know that's happening.

1776
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,740
I use the studio. Listen, man, you
gotta be on your own. This is this.

1777
01:39:35,741 --> 01:39:36,900
This doesn't make any sense,

1778
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,830
but everybody thinks they have
to do it with somebody else.

1779
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:41,850
Everybody thinks like, oh, I gotta.
If I was in the Fox, more people,

1780
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:45,180
more eyes going to the way you get eyes
on you as the Goddamn Internet man.

1781
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:48,500
It's the people that enjoy it and they
tell people they enjoy it spreads,

1782
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:50,730
and that's a job. That's
it. That's all you gotta do.

1783
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:54,020
Make something that people like.
Boom. Right. It's that easy.

1784
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,470
Don't need Fox or HBO or showtime or why
would you meet them if you're going to

1785
01:39:58,471 --> 01:40:01,450
do a podcast, if you want to do a show,
yeah, you need Fox. Yeah. You know,

1786
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,330
if you want to do a drama
or a sitcom or a talk show,

1787
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:05,700
look and look at one hour specials.

1788
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:09,480
Now nowadays you can start doing almost
your own thing. Yeah. Yet, I mean, look,

1789
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:11,190
yeah, you definitely can. You
can release some on the Internet.

1790
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:12,024
A lot of people have done it,

1791
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:17,410
but the bottom line is anybody that's
telling you to not swear my name,

1792
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,640
what kind of game we plan. Exactly.
What a silly game. Really plan.

1793
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:24,780
I lost my bad wolf. Lost my mind. By the
way. It's not TV. You don't have to work.

1794
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:28,950
It's not the FCC. The FCC is not
involved. So if the FCC is not involved,

1795
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:33,660
why in the world? I'm loving my podcast
and I, you know, I do it real small.

1796
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:35,820
I don't have any commercials. I don't
want anybody telling me what to do.

1797
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,450
And I'm like talking to people around
the world. This guy does bishop,

1798
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,870
you ever heard of him? I have, but
listen, man, you don't need to have,

1799
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:44,350
just because you have commercials,

1800
01:40:44,351 --> 01:40:47,580
it doesn't mean anybody can tell you what
to do. Nobody can tell you what to do.

1801
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:50,430
I have a lot of commercials.
Nobody gets to tell me what to do.

1802
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,070
You don't allow it. It's
real simple. The idea,

1803
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,470
someone would allow it or that
you need to your language,

1804
01:40:56,620 --> 01:41:00,160
but it's not necessary and there's this
thing in your head where, you know,

1805
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:02,560
I don't have anybody telling me what
to do so I don't have commercials.

1806
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,590
You can have commercials too. You just
don't let them tell you what to do.

1807
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:10,060
It's like they don't have to be mutually
exclusive. Yeah, the, we're brainwashed.

1808
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:13,270
I stand corrected, but it's a silly
thing. It's a silly thing like,

1809
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:16,000
do you think that corporations wouldn't
want to have anything to do with you

1810
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:20,320
because you're swearing
the corporate.

1811
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:22,510
Every time I do a corporate GIG,
they're like, don't use the f word.

1812
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:26,260
They fucking love it. I'm just going to
talk to you like a normal human being.

1813
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:30,610
Guess what they say? Fuck too. Oh my
God and shit and things like that.

1814
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,120
It's even more cause it's suppressed.
These people were all buttoned down.

1815
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:36,280
They're not allowed to talk about this
shit and all of a sudden you're talking

1816
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:38,250
about sucking your own Dick.
You're talking about,

1817
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:39,970
you know where I'm going
to be swearing by the way.

1818
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:45,270
November 29th and 30th
and wise guys in Utah,

1819
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:47,550
Salt Lake City. I'll just tell
you what, she now love it.

1820
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:49,120
There you have you done that club?
No.

1821
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:52,120
I hear great things though and I hear
Salt Lake City like one of the best places

1822
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:56,680
to perform because people are so fired
up for anybody to come into town and just

1823
01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:59,710
start talking some shit. That's what
I'll be doing. So much buttoned down,

1824
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:03,040
you know, thinking there is so much, you
know, really strong, which by the way,

1825
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:06,430
Mormons or if you're going to give me
a cult that's going to be my neighbor.

1826
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:09,690
I'll take more men all day.
Some of the nicest fucking great.

1827
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,330
We help you and everything.
They have a great sense of community.

1828
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:17,470
I mean they believe some wacky shit, but
they're nice. Absolutely that Wacky Shit,

1829
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:21,220
whatever it is with them, it seems
to work a little bit. They are.

1830
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:25,220
They do a lot of help for non Mormons.
Whenever there's disaster,

1831
01:42:25,221 --> 01:42:30,221
so I'll be in Salt Lake City November
29th November 30th I'm at the state

1832
01:42:30,251 --> 01:42:31,600
theater in Austin,
Texas.

1833
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,590
November 30th Austin tells is going
to tell you this guy, Dez bishop,

1834
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:38,530
it really interesting guy. He's American
plug you and you can tell I'm sorry.

1835
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:42,040
Please, please plug away Tom Rhodes and
fucking hilarious comedian Austin, Texas.

1836
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:44,140
If the people in Austin,
especially,

1837
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:47,980
I know what kind of comedy you freaks
like and Tom Rhodes is your man. He's,

1838
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:51,220
you're an old school road dog dude.
You and I had been friends for fucking,

1839
01:42:51,221 --> 01:42:54,760
God knows how long we met each
other when we were on NBC together.

1840
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:58,870
We had the Tom road show back when it
was long Herod days. That's right. Yeah.

1841
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:02,530
We hung out together and one
of those functions, it was
a, it was, I think it was,

1842
01:43:02,531 --> 01:43:03,460
it was in New York City.

1843
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:07,510
They had this big announcement of the
season at the Lincoln Center and all the

1844
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:11,530
people like stars from the show, from
each show would come across the stage.

1845
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:14,470
Let me, let me give you a calm.
We inhibit an after party,

1846
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:17,080
a big swanky affair and uh,

1847
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,660
thank God you were there because it
was all like acthar people and stuff.

1848
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,470
Thank God you are that you and I like
we're, yeah, we have steel. We were like,

1849
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:24,610
we're hanging out. We, you know,

1850
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:26,740
you've got to go to these things
and you drank any hob nominees.

1851
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:29,410
There are nice people for the most part,
but they're all actors.

1852
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:33,550
And then I was like, Tom
Rhodes. Yeah. He's like Joe
Rogan. Like oh fellow comedian.

1853
01:43:33,551 --> 01:43:37,360
Give me a hug. 1818 years ago,
17 years ago. Tom Rhodes was,

1854
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,480
I've always thought of you
because I told you this already,

1855
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:43,300
but I worked really hard at my stand up.
I was a new comic.

1856
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:46,660
I got up and I did an okay job in
front of people with some stuff.

1857
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:50,170
And you looked at me and you were such
an established comic and you literally

1858
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:52,160
looked at him at me and you,
you went,

1859
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:55,280
you went, you're a screen
bro, you're a screen.

1860
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:57,950
And that was a seminal moment
for me because I went, if I,

1861
01:43:57,951 --> 01:44:00,890
if Tom Rhodes said that and I
know you meant it, I was like,

1862
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,990
I'm doing something right.
I'm in the right direction.

1863
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:04,540
That's pretty cool for you know,
and you,

1864
01:44:04,541 --> 01:44:06,830
you didn't have to say that you just went
out of your way. You don't remember it.

1865
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,940
Cause you obviously,
you know,

1866
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:10,100
close. We had a good
comedy man. I'm, you know,

1867
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:12,200
and I'm not afraid to tell
a young guy that, you know,

1868
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,550
I think he's got a good future.

1869
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,820
You are, you've always been like that.
And I love that. I love guys like that.

1870
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:20,350
You and Stan hopes like that.
I'm like

1871
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:22,620
the warrior spirit man.
You gotta, you know,

1872
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:26,010
every warrior needs to eventually
move onto Wiseman and you know,

1873
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:29,550
you gotta when you see a young
warrior and you know the guys,

1874
01:44:29,551 --> 01:44:33,480
you know these approaching standup from
like a pure place and you know it's,

1875
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:34,770
I think it's good to encourage people.

1876
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:37,350
I think it is as well,
but it's so I love it just because I,

1877
01:44:37,351 --> 01:44:40,410
the older guys did it to me, you
know? Yeah. They did to me as well.

1878
01:44:40,411 --> 01:44:43,020
I don't look at it in terms of like
an old warrior, a young warrior.

1879
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:46,800
I look at it terms of I love standup
and when someone's doing good standup,

1880
01:44:46,801 --> 01:44:50,760
I enjoy it. I like it as a, as a person
in the audience. Right. I enjoy it.

1881
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:54,450
I'll never, I'll never stopped.
I've met people that did, I met,

1882
01:44:54,451 --> 01:44:56,390
I've met a lot of people
that really love standup,

1883
01:44:56,410 --> 01:44:59,490
then became a standup and then didn't
love it anymore. Right. Terrible.

1884
01:44:59,491 --> 01:45:00,324
When you see the light.

1885
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:02,890
I did a Gig,

1886
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:06,160
I went to the Friar's club in La and
I get in there and with my friends,

1887
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:08,100
I'll tell you why because
somebody asked me to do,

1888
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,740
I get there and it's literally
like scattering of people
in suits and I can hear

1889
01:45:11,741 --> 01:45:15,190
them eating and I look at my buddies
and I go like this. I say, dude,

1890
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:19,090
I'm just telling you I'm going
to do 40 minutes just on birds.

1891
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:23,650
I'm doing 40 minutes on bird humor only.
I get up there.

1892
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:27,580
My friends are howling crickets, everybody
else's like, what's this guy doing?

1893
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:30,640
My friends are dying. Right. You
decided to tank it on purpose.

1894
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:33,940
I was just being esoteric
and fun and crazy.

1895
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:38,500
I get someone over to a table and a
guy says to me, an older man says,

1896
01:45:38,501 --> 01:45:41,260
you got a lot of guts and
a lot of imagination kid,

1897
01:45:41,261 --> 01:45:45,670
you're going to go a long way and it
was red buttons. Wow. Pretty cool.

1898
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:46,743
He's nice.

1899
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:49,060
I've been better if somebody else told
us store instead of you telling them

1900
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:49,894
about yourself.

1901
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:53,230
Well I, I wanted to tell you about
that. This guy does. Bishop man,

1902
01:45:53,231 --> 01:45:57,310
he's really interesting dude. Uh, he's
originally from New York. He's his,

1903
01:45:57,311 --> 01:46:01,600
his parents. Uh, he's got
deep family ties in Ireland,

1904
01:46:01,601 --> 01:46:04,030
so he went to school there.
That's where he started being a comedian.

1905
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,440
He's gone on to have a, a brilliant
television career in Ireland. Uh,

1906
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:12,790
he's living in Beijing now for the past
year cause he wants to learn mandarin

1907
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:16,450
Chinese and do stand up
comedy and Chinese. Wow.

1908
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:19,570
So like I did shows in Beijing with him
at this really cool place called the

1909
01:46:19,571 --> 01:46:20,650
bookworm.
It was a,

1910
01:46:20,651 --> 01:46:24,460
it's a bookstore where like a full
service bar in the center and it was,

1911
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:28,060
it was really great. See plays
that held like a hundred, you know,

1912
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,470
the weekends were sold out. It
was really cool. Multiethnic,

1913
01:46:32,471 --> 01:46:35,230
multinational people.
But his story is amazing.

1914
01:46:35,231 --> 01:46:39,380
I arrived there the first night
and I went to this Chinese, uh,

1915
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:41,800
language, local open mic night, did he?

1916
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:46,840
He puts on and hosts and here's
this guy that I know and he, he's,

1917
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:50,060
he's doing comedy in Mandarin,
Chinese now.

1918
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,580
How many room full of Chinese people?
How many Chinese comedians are there?

1919
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:58,220
It's brand new. They're brand
new, brand new, there's illegal,

1920
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:02,970
there's a guy named Joe
Wong who apparently he was
a comic in Boston and he did

1921
01:47:02,971 --> 01:47:07,790
Letterman and now he's moved back
there. Whoa. Uh, and he's like the,

1922
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:12,210
he's there like, you know, whatever
spiritual leader of comedy steel,

1923
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:14,260
the shit out of people's hands.

1924
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:19,080
[inaudible] Chris rock stuff.
That's hilarious.

1925
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:23,850
You did that in Holland who did it with
Bill Hicks material didn't Dutch. Wow.

1926
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,050
Yeah.
And uh,

1927
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:29,280
he was becoming really popular but
then it got out what he had done.

1928
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:33,390
Well it was actually like doing all Bill
Hicks is act and other buddy. He's like,

1929
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:36,780
this young man is kind of really a
lot of interesting things to say.

1930
01:47:36,781 --> 01:47:39,060
He's got a very bright mind and people
are like, wait a minute, I heard

1931
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:43,390
that shit before. Show path ideas,
man. It's amazing. He's, you know,

1932
01:47:43,391 --> 01:47:46,240
and after he told him eat, we're
talking afterwards and he's like, yeah,

1933
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:48,520
I'm kind of like, yeah, I feel like
I'm back at open mic night level.

1934
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:52,990
The guy's been a comedian for almost
20 years and he's like, yeah, you know,

1935
01:47:52,991 --> 01:47:56,410
I wish my Chinese is better.
He's like being a typical comedian,

1936
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,770
not giving himself enough credit.
And I'm like, I'm like, dude,

1937
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,270
I just watched you do 10 fucking
minutes and China and get laughs.

1938
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:08,560
That's incredible. Don't, don't be coming
off going, I still got some work to do.

1939
01:48:08,561 --> 01:48:12,970
I mean, he did all your
books. What are you, Tom,

1940
01:48:12,971 --> 01:48:16,440
has standup change to topped it
all this year, these years? Like,

1941
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:20,590
or do you still look at it
in the same way? And I, you
know, I mean, it's a, I mean,

1942
01:48:20,591 --> 01:48:23,770
you know, you have tough times in your
life when you're up and down, but I mean,

1943
01:48:23,771 --> 01:48:28,150
I've, I've always loved it. I think
as far as contemporary comedy,

1944
01:48:28,151 --> 01:48:32,170
I think it's way better than it used
to be. Uh, like back when I started,

1945
01:48:32,171 --> 01:48:37,171
I think there's way more originality
and edginess and a dark humor.

1946
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:42,280
I think like back in the, in like
the late eighties, uh, there was,

1947
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:43,990
there was a lot of like,
conformity.

1948
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:46,770
It felt like a lot of guys were trying
to be Jerry Seinfeld and get on telling

1949
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:51,930
me to where there wasn't
a lot of ferocious voices.
And I think that's why like,

1950
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,300
you know, Bill Hicks stood out so
much in the era and that, you know,

1951
01:48:55,301 --> 01:48:59,860
like a prior was just speaking pure truth,
you know,

1952
01:48:59,861 --> 01:49:03,520
that kind of thing. I think now
there's, there's way more dangerous,

1953
01:49:03,521 --> 01:49:07,990
interesting stuff happening in comedy.
So I mean, as a, as a comedy lover,

1954
01:49:07,991 --> 01:49:08,640
I love it.

1955
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,630
The only thing that's
missing right now is clubs.

1956
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:14,710
There's not as many clubs as they used
to be, but I think as far as like ideas,

1957
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:18,040
there's more information now that are,
let's get into the comedians.

1958
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,830
There's more stories.
There's more to the audience,

1959
01:49:20,831 --> 01:49:22,960
more things that you could
read. There's more, I mean,

1960
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,770
you're getting crazy stories you could
talk about on stage all day long on

1961
01:49:26,771 --> 01:49:27,131
Twitter.

1962
01:49:27,131 --> 01:49:31,190
Every fucking day your Facebook is
filled with some one nutty story after

1963
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:33,730
another Nadine's story that can
ultimately be turned into a bit.

1964
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:36,310
If you have the time and the
resources you can get on stage,

1965
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:40,420
you can kind of craft an act today.
Um, you know, it's the fucking,

1966
01:49:40,421 --> 01:49:43,150
there's a wealth of information
that's coming at ya,

1967
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:45,700
but it's just harder to find
clubs and a lot of places.

1968
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:48,010
I don't know. I think,
uh, don't you think a

1969
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,210
lot of clubs are opening and in some
places and I think the worldwide comedy

1970
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,660
scene definitely theZ is exploding right
now. What if you're in like Saint Louis,

1971
01:49:55,690 --> 01:50:00,160
what do you got? You gotta like is an
Improv, their funny bone is a funny bone.

1972
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,630
I mean if you want to like start out,
they have an open mic night.

1973
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,690
What's the scene like? They do, you know,

1974
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:08,590
is it more than one club mean ideally
you want several clubs cause most likely

1975
01:50:08,591 --> 01:50:10,720
gonna burn one of those
bridges. Yeah, because you're,

1976
01:50:10,721 --> 01:50:14,290
if you're a comedian you probably would
like temperamental. You're impulsive,

1977
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:19,090
stupid shit you drink. People still
don't really come to comedy as much.

1978
01:50:19,091 --> 01:50:22,540
I mean like I was talking about bill
burr about this. Like, you know,

1979
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:25,690
I was watching him the other day and
that show we did and, and I, and I said,

1980
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:29,710
you know, you now of course bill does
theaters and stuff, but for the most part,

1981
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:32,110
for a long time, I always say
that there are people out there,

1982
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:35,200
they'll make you laugh way harder
than any movie you've ever seen yet.

1983
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:39,640
They still can't sell out on a Friday.
[inaudible]

1984
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,900
few weeks ago. And he said, he goes,

1985
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:44,800
I call that period killing in obscurity
when you're just like killing and you

1986
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:49,280
haven't, you're not selling
tickets. Right. And you're
uh, we all go through that.

1987
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:52,690
Y'all go through that moment before
anything really hits for you where you're

1988
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:55,390
like, God damn like this, this
stuff. It sounded pretty good.

1989
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:57,520
I'm getting into a groove here,
you know,

1990
01:50:57,521 --> 01:50:59,660
I feel like I'm actually
like a legit headline.

1991
01:50:59,661 --> 01:51:02,350
I wouldn't mind telling someone
to come see me. You know,

1992
01:51:02,351 --> 01:51:04,420
it takes like 10 years
before you feel that.

1993
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:07,780
But once you do feel like no one knows
who the fuck you are. Like, you know,

1994
01:51:07,781 --> 01:51:10,330
you could be,
you're in a hotel somewhere and as yeah,

1995
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:14,410
you can be as good or even better maybe
than some people that are on television,

1996
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:18,120
but nobody knows. Like Diaz is a perfect
example of that. For the longest time,

1997
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,460
Joey Diaz was absolutely
murdering it and no one knew.

1998
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:24,610
I think you're a good
example how funny you are.

1999
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,340
A lot of people don't know and
they think of you as an actor.

2000
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:30,730
They don't know how funny you are as a
standup. Yeah, you're fucking hilarious.

2001
01:51:30,731 --> 01:51:35,560
Dude. I've tooken my friend Justin
is, he uh, came to see us in Vegas.

2002
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:39,100
He was raving about how funny you were.
He was crying.

2003
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:42,730
He kept repeating your lines and shit.
That's one of those things where like,

2004
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:47,170
people know you now more I think even
because of the Internet than they knew you

2005
01:51:47,171 --> 01:51:48,310
from TV shows.

2006
01:51:48,311 --> 01:51:53,311
You did lab mad TV or this podcast
actually has been a hugely instrumental in

2007
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:56,440
getting people,
at least to my shows and stuff.

2008
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:58,720
But to think about crazy it is
all the movies that you've done,

2009
01:51:58,721 --> 01:51:59,890
all the different things that you'd done.

2010
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:02,190
And there's still a lot of people
that didn't hear about. Yeah,

2011
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,600
but then you will not mention any names,

2012
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,290
but we all know certain people who sell
a lot of tickets and then you, you know,

2013
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:10,840
your friends go back and come
back from seeing them. And I go,

2014
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:15,700
what the fuck did I just
watch? Right? Like, oh my God,
that's terrible. And you go,

2015
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:19,570
well, you know it's different when you're
on a show. You've got writers and like,

2016
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:21,910
sorry,
you know,

2017
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:26,920
but there's a lot of people that are like
killing on stage to 50 people a night.

2018
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,740
That's right.
The owner's mad at them.

2019
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,390
Can't figure out that you got to do
fucking everything. Pressed morning,

2020
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:36,220
you're going to do every
radio shows on the Friday,

2021
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,460
three radio shows in the morning, two in
the afternoon, still have full, no one's,

2022
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:43,120
hey man, it is about, it is about the
Internet. I've learned that from you.

2023
01:52:43,121 --> 01:52:46,280
Like now that I've been tweeting and
stuff. It is, you get people to your shows

2024
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,650
a lot easier. Well, that's a nice thing.

2025
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:52,010
But you know what's really
about the Internet? You're
entertaining people. Yeah.

2026
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,690
You're giving these
people for entertainment.

2027
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,550
The reason why you have
this connection with them,

2028
01:52:55,551 --> 01:52:59,030
they're coming to see you with a co in
the clubs is you've already entertain

2029
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:02,270
them. They enjoy your,
your work, they enjoy you.

2030
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,990
Whatever you put out they've taken in.
And it's true. If it makes them feel,

2031
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,050
it's more personal that

2032
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:10,510
come up to me in London after shows
and they've heard me on your show and

2033
01:53:10,511 --> 01:53:13,540
they've, you know, they've
heard my podcast and it's
like, they know you. Yeah.

2034
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:17,020
It's not just like a little
seven minute TV spot.

2035
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:20,260
These people know like serious
details about your life. Yeah.

2036
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:21,730
Philosophy in the way you,

2037
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:25,040
he would never be able to get this sort
of a connection with people if you just

2038
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:27,760
did Letterman a hundred times. Right. You
wouldn't, they would never get you. Yeah.

2039
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,820
We're also at an age now, the three
of us were, uh, and I've noticed this,

2040
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:33,650
a lot of guys are,

2041
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:37,430
they don't have guidance and they don't
have a responsible older male to teach

2042
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:41,580
them certain things. And we're the
age that their father would be. And I,

2043
01:53:41,581 --> 01:53:44,840
I noticed and I start, I'm starting to
take it very seriously. Like, you know,

2044
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:48,770
when people listen to me on this
podcast or on my podcast or whatever,

2045
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:52,170
they're really listening and they're,
then they're paying attention and,

2046
01:53:52,171 --> 01:53:56,090
and in a way you feel responsible.
You feel like, you know,

2047
01:53:56,091 --> 01:53:57,890
I'm way more careful with what I say.

2048
01:53:57,891 --> 01:53:59,990
I'm way more careful with
the information I give out.

2049
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:03,610
I've got to make sure I know
it. Remember Joe are now, right?

2050
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:07,220
We used to start this pocket. I
just be spewing shit. I'd be like,

2051
01:54:07,221 --> 01:54:11,630
add another then research truth.
People would give them so mad at me.

2052
01:54:11,631 --> 01:54:15,300
They would send me the
fucking text messages. Michael
County spreading decipher,

2053
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,940
right. It's just called talking
shit, talking shit. Yeah,

2054
01:54:19,941 --> 01:54:22,130
we've heard something but you
heard it wrong or whatever.

2055
01:54:22,131 --> 01:54:24,230
And you start talking and
then people realized, oh,

2056
01:54:24,231 --> 01:54:25,610
8 million people are listening to you.

2057
01:54:25,611 --> 01:54:29,440
It's like I'm to fucking start paying
attention what I say here because uh,

2058
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:32,300
well that's the thing with technology
now everybody can call you on your shit

2059
01:54:32,301 --> 01:54:33,700
instantly change.

2060
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:39,770
Like the iPhones are totally
little answering machine
and they, oh, by the way,

2061
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,900
oh by the way.
Oh and by the way,

2062
01:54:41,901 --> 01:54:44,600
my shirt open and my person I told
you that story about at the time,

2063
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:47,080
uh, I was with my wife and we're, well,

2064
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:49,530
we're like talking about Guantanamo
Bay and I'm like, what are,

2065
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:54,040
I wonder what the top 10 torture songs
where they top songs that we talked with

2066
01:54:54,041 --> 01:54:56,320
these people with.
She whips it up on the phone.

2067
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,410
Two seconds later we got the list.

2068
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:03,280
Like number one was a song
called fuck your God by d a seed

2069
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:08,200
biocide did some death metal things.
That's totally appropriate,

2070
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:12,250
but like the rest, the rest of the songs
made absolutely no sense whatsoever.

2071
01:55:12,251 --> 01:55:13,990
It was like, um, queen,

2072
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:17,770
we will rock you was one of them
will have that Brian May guitar riff.

2073
01:55:17,771 --> 01:55:21,760
I could listen to that over and over.
Don Mclean's uh,

2074
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:25,630
American American pie was more God
is that this is it. Fuck your God.

2075
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,950
Tyree meow mix TV. Commercial. Yeah.

2076
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:33,310
Yeah. Me, I'm Yam. Yam, Yam, Yam,
Yam, Yam. Yeah. Oh, that's great.

2077
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:38,710
Enter Sandman by Metallica.
I can listen to that over and over.

2078
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:43,040
I can't think of Metallica and not think
of Jim Barney the dinosaur that grower.

2079
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:45,730
Why gymbaroo loves
Metallica. Yeah, Zee. Yeah.

2080
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:48,510
Well I remember that first for
them all to, yeah. Yeah. Now he is.

2081
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,670
When I first met Breuer,
he would fucking,

2082
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:55,090
it would just be like rocking
out to himself. He was
singing Metallica solvency.

2083
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:57,920
What happened? I got the roses.
You know about this. Well,

2084
01:55:57,921 --> 01:55:59,970
what happened to axel rose?
Did you just go crazy?

2085
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,010
I think everybody goes crazy
when you get that famous.

2086
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:05,670
I think that's what's happening to Kanye
West. That's what happens to lady Gaga.

2087
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:07,890
That's what happens to everybody there.
They're too famous.

2088
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:11,640
It's almost unmanageable. That's what
happened to Madonna and I think, look,

2089
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:15,390
they hang onto it better than probably
any of us would, but they still crazy.

2090
01:56:15,650 --> 01:56:19,890
You go crazy, you go crazy. How could
you not go crazy? Everybody goes crazy.

2091
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:24,260
Imagine being lady Gaga. Can you imagine
like what is that like? I know of

2092
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,790
a woman who dated a very famous celebrity.
I won't mention, she was saying,

2093
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:32,900
she was telling me that he got to a
point where he just couldn't really,

2094
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:33,860
he was just like,

2095
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:38,860
you get so famous that he would have
like these sex parties and he would just,

2096
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:44,060
she ended up getting sucked into that for
text and she's banging his friends and

2097
01:56:44,061 --> 01:56:48,290
he'd be sitting on the couch like Nero
watching this shit just got crazier and

2098
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:50,990
crazier and it got crazier and
crazier and then he couldn't,

2099
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:55,400
he couldn't come unless he was like,
unless it was, she was doing crazy shit.

2100
01:56:55,401 --> 01:56:59,320
Like hang her tongue on another guy.
Really feel bad for that guy.

2101
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:04,010
I know she kept having an amp it up.
He would really hit an exterior.

2102
01:57:04,011 --> 01:57:05,720
He was really conservative,
like people thought,

2103
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:10,580
but when they'd get together it
was just fucking on and he just,

2104
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:14,450
then she had to finally break up with them
because finally she was in a rotation.

2105
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:16,360
Hold on a second. When you say,
when you say he's conservative,

2106
01:57:16,361 --> 01:57:20,500
like his appearance or his public
persona was very accomplished. Famous,

2107
01:57:20,501 --> 01:57:23,260
famous guy. Okay, so you remember that
Bob Crane guy from Hogan's heroes?

2108
01:57:23,261 --> 01:57:26,260
He liked it. He was banging chicks, all
of that. Buddy didn't want to give it up.

2109
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:30,250
That's why he was getting tired of off
the rails when he was murdered by his

2110
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:32,920
buddy who he was banging girls with you.

2111
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,110
I don't know if anybody was
ever convicted to that. It was,

2112
01:57:35,111 --> 01:57:38,550
I don't believe that was a fun movie.
It's a really good moment. You're still,

2113
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:42,220
what's it called, Greg Kinnear?
Autofocus. Yeah, I think so. Really?

2114
01:57:42,221 --> 01:57:44,560
It's about a lot of fun really.
And speaking of Lady Gaga,

2115
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,720
did you know Bradley Manning who took
all those military secrets and gave him

2116
01:57:49,721 --> 01:57:54,721
the Wiki leaks and endangered the lives
of American service men and women all

2117
01:57:54,851 --> 01:57:58,570
over the world? Uh, when he would,
he had these disks on his desk.

2118
01:57:58,571 --> 01:57:59,850
A statement or question is,

2119
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:02,680
none of that is he had these
disks on his desk and when,

2120
01:58:02,681 --> 01:58:04,570
so when like sensitive
information will pop up,

2121
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:07,200
he would pop the distant and
download all this information. Right.

2122
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,260
So he labeled the discs. Lady Gaga. Yeah.

2123
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,770
And so like people walk by his desk and
it was fucking guys listen to lady Gaga

2124
01:58:13,771 --> 01:58:17,290
that way. No. I think that lady Gaga
should also be implicated for treason.

2125
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:18,191
That's all I'm saying.

2126
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:20,370
I'm just want to make a case
for you that we'll look stream.

2127
01:58:20,371 --> 01:58:24,210
So I want to make a case for that right
now. She should be implicated. Yeah,

2128
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:28,890
I think she's, she's treasonous
little bit. A little bit, man.

2129
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:32,920
Treasonous yourself. Radley. Many
wants to get a sex change. Chelsea,

2130
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,010
Chelsea manning. He's a cutie.
He's a little cutie pie.
How dare you write petite.

2131
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,170
I know you're going to do all that.

2132
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,530
Then what the to that want the
government to pay for yours?

2133
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:42,160
That's what he wanted.

2134
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:46,900
Yeah. Well maybe, I don't know. Who
knows how long he's wanted that,

2135
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:50,890
but I couldn't imagine what it would
be like just to be in the position that

2136
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:52,330
that guys in,
you know,

2137
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:55,060
just to be in the position to have this
information that you think needs to get

2138
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:59,800
out. So you release it and then they keep
you in solitary naked for like years.

2139
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:04,510
For years. They're like, guy
was, I mean he was going crazy.

2140
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:08,280
Is that what I did too? Yeah.
Psychological torture. Yeah. Yeah.

2141
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,880
They did some and they kept them.
They keep you in solitary for them.

2142
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:14,400
Nothing to joke about when you're
really thinking about it. Yeah. Torture.

2143
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:16,240
For years,
they kept him in solitary.

2144
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:20,410
They kept in solitary Froedtert
own time and you know,

2145
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,600
now who knows?
I mean,

2146
01:59:22,601 --> 01:59:25,090
they might not even be true that
he wants to have a sex change.

2147
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:28,270
They might've just released that. Who the
fuck knows? Right, right, right. Yeah.

2148
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:30,100
Who knows. I mean, it
might just be like, check,

2149
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:32,470
check out what we're going to put
about you in the news. You know, look,

2150
01:59:32,471 --> 01:59:35,380
you want to have a sexual
[inaudible] character. Yeah.

2151
01:59:35,381 --> 01:59:37,450
Maybe this is working for
the government just did.

2152
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:42,220
Did he have the chance to actually give
a a speech? I think that his trial,

2153
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:46,450
he mentioned the fact that he was
wanting to have a gender change,

2154
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:47,351
that his trial,

2155
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:50,340
I'm saying did he give a speech
about why he did it or I don't know.

2156
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:52,360
The whole thing is really strange,
man,

2157
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:56,800
because it's changed our whole idea
of what the government is between the

2158
01:59:56,801 --> 01:59:59,620
Bradley Manning wikileaks thing
and the Edward Snowden thing.

2159
01:59:59,621 --> 02:00:03,340
It's essentially changed our entire
idea of what the government is like.

2160
02:00:03,341 --> 02:00:07,090
In one fell swoop.
It all became this giant spy network,

2161
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,770
which we never would have imagined.

2162
02:00:09,070 --> 02:00:11,290
We never would have imagined
that his reach and all that.

2163
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:14,260
Now it's amazing how things have changed.

2164
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:18,700
People don't realize what a big impact
that really has had on the confidence of

2165
02:00:18,701 --> 02:00:22,900
the American people because now all
the people that were like borderline

2166
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:26,290
believing and Alex Jones and wondering
what the fuck is really going on with the

2167
02:00:26,291 --> 02:00:30,990
new world order now it's all
like on paper, like the gut,

2168
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:32,410
the Obama,

2169
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:36,250
they're only collecting better data
and that turns out to be bullshit and

2170
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:39,280
everybody could. Apollo press person
has some sense. It's ridiculous.

2171
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:40,150
It's like there's so,

2172
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:44,890
it's so obvious now that there's this
giant spy network and everyone's sucked

2173
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:47,770
into it. The whole world is
literally connected to this,

2174
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:52,390
these chords and no one wants to admit
it and tapping in on Angela Merkel,

2175
02:00:52,391 --> 02:00:56,800
the PRI, everybody, every world leader,
their personal cell phones. Yeah.

2176
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:57,940
We knew everybody's,

2177
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:02,620
we've also have known forever that both
sides were always spying on each other.

2178
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:04,120
That's why the president
goes into his tent,

2179
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:06,460
which it scrambles all
kinds of information.

2180
02:01:06,461 --> 02:01:10,620
Mike Swick told me that he was working
at the embassy in Russia. Mike WIC, um,

2181
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:14,620
before he was at Mike's spoke MMA
fighter before he was an MMA fighter.

2182
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:18,970
He did security at this embassy and he
said that they used to find things that

2183
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:23,971
the Russians had put in the buildings
that were powered by the motion of the

2184
02:01:24,191 --> 02:01:24,671
building.

2185
02:01:24,671 --> 02:01:29,671
The subtle sway of the building was what
powered these devices that they use.

2186
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:32,590
He said it was so far
beyond anything they had.

2187
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,750
And you know what's really interesting,

2188
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:38,050
a lot of the shit that they got that
the Russians got a lot of shit that the

2189
02:01:38,051 --> 02:01:41,630
Americans got during the
space race was from the Nazis.

2190
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:43,340
It was operation paperclip.

2191
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:48,370
We took all the best Nazi scientists
from Germany and just knock a [inaudible]

2192
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:53,180
and changed the last names. Old Bit,
well, bit fiddled around, little bit,

2193
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:56,660
exonerated them, gave them positions
of power, like the head of NASA.

2194
02:01:56,810 --> 02:02:01,190
Wernher von Braun was unknown Nazi who?
The Simon Thall weasel way.

2195
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:04,360
Was it Simon Wiesenthal
Center Center for uh, uh,

2196
02:02:05,690 --> 02:02:08,330
they said that they would punish
him for crimes against humanity.

2197
02:02:08,331 --> 02:02:10,460
They said they would try
him if he was alive today,

2198
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:13,610
they would try Wernher von Braun
for crimes against humanity.

2199
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:19,430
That's what there's the head of NASA.
The head of NASA was a Goddamn Nazi,

2200
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:20,810
like a real Nazi.
There's,

2201
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:24,650
there was a documentary on these people
that had been through the camps and were

2202
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:28,490
describing where if I'm was like an expo,
say on were winter von Braun,

2203
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:32,780
and they were talking about how they
would see him while they were looking at

2204
02:02:32,781 --> 02:02:33,800
people hung,

2205
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:38,210
they would hang the five slow as Jews
outside of this Berlin rocket factory

2206
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:40,760
every day to make sure that
everybody worked hardest.

2207
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:45,050
And they would see von Braun walk past
the bodies like to say that he wasn't a

2208
02:02:45,051 --> 02:02:49,160
Nazi. They're like, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. He was a Nazi.

2209
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:54,170
He was there while all this was going on.
He was a part of all this and this guy,

2210
02:02:54,171 --> 02:02:54,411
you know,

2211
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:57,260
he had the tattoos and everything and
he was describing this and it was really

2212
02:02:57,261 --> 02:03:00,320
intense. It was really intense
to think that, you know,

2213
02:03:00,321 --> 02:03:04,160
just because someone is like really good
at something, we'll take them over here,

2214
02:03:04,161 --> 02:03:08,730
put them on TV, Polish them up, give
them a haircut, smile. Wernher von Braun,

2215
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:13,310
the head of NASA says we can be
on the moon inside 24 months.

2216
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:16,640
We got along,
we got a lot of German physicists led,

2217
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:21,350
including I believe Albert
Einstein because of the
antisemitism that was arising

2218
02:03:21,351 --> 02:03:25,590
in the early thirties already.
And they came over and it wasn't,

2219
02:03:25,591 --> 02:03:28,490
it really just because they were
awesome. I mean, we had to control them.

2220
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:33,530
They would, they, the Nazis had
created some incredible devices. BMW,

2221
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:36,860
they were creating incredible
fucking engines for, for jets.

2222
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:40,970
I mean they had some amazing engineering
and machine gun I think was wasn't Nazi

2223
02:03:40,971 --> 02:03:45,590
invention. So there was a German
invention operation paperclip. Um, they,

2224
02:03:45,591 --> 02:03:48,860
they took a gang of scientists,

2225
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:53,870
it was in 1945 and they brought them
all over here and put them to work in a

2226
02:03:55,611 --> 02:03:59,570
bunch of different segments of our,
a military industrial complex.

2227
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:03,230
But also in NASA. They designed
missiles. They designed everything.

2228
02:04:03,231 --> 02:04:07,760
They did all kinds of shit over here,
but the, the space race was greatly,

2229
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:11,450
greatly aided by these people. Like we
literally didn't have a program until we,

2230
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:15,800
until we brought Wernher von Braun
over here. Huh. That's amazing, man.

2231
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:20,840
That's some amazing shit. That's just
how they did things. They say, Hey, yeah,

2232
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:23,570
either bad guys, but look, they
know a lot of shit about rockets.

2233
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,730
It was also a race for world domination.
I mean,

2234
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,460
there were I the conflicting ideologies,
man,

2235
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:31,720
and it was winner take all and a
lot of ways. Oh yeah. Well you have,

2236
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:36,680
it was a scary time. Everybody's
rushing to make the nuke. I mean,

2237
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:41,220
if they, they make the new first, they
win. Yeah. We got, you know, if we all,

2238
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,700
we all die a fire.
If it wasn't for that Bhagavad Gita quote,

2239
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:47,310
motherfucker that was crying earlier.
If it wasn't for him,

2240
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:50,520
somebody else would've got it.
Probably would have been the Nazis.

2241
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:53,370
They probably would have figured it out.
No question. They were on their way.

2242
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,770
That was,
that was the whole thing.

2243
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:58,530
The Manhattan project was basically a
race to get the bomb before they did.

2244
02:04:59,590 --> 02:05:02,310
She apparently though historians
say that they were further,

2245
02:05:02,311 --> 02:05:06,120
they were actually given up on trying or
they were further away than we thought

2246
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:09,450
it allegedly. Yeah. American propaganda.

2247
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:14,600
We got 1,800 technicians and scientists
along with 3,700 family members.

2248
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:19,050
Those with special skills or knowledge
or taken to detention and interrogation

2249
02:05:19,051 --> 02:05:19,860
centers,

2250
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:24,540
such as one code named dust bin to be
held and interrogated and in some cases

2251
02:05:24,541 --> 02:05:25,374
for months.

2252
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,160
And then they took these motherfuckers
and slowly brought them out and started

2253
02:05:29,161 --> 02:05:33,730
reintroducing them. A
lot of brainpower. Wow.

2254
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:37,260
A lot of brainpower. That's amazing.
They're still catching those guys, man.

2255
02:05:37,261 --> 02:05:40,210
They're every now and then the fine
second, Argentina and places like that.

2256
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:43,200
A lot of them went down there. A lot
of them went to South America actually.

2257
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:48,180
They flee. I mean, you gotta
think and they've chased down
a lot of them. Man. They,

2258
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:49,010
they're,
they've been,

2259
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:51,040
and they found out into the
field a lot of, they, they, uh,

2260
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:53,270
I mean there's a lot of
Germans that live in Argentina.

2261
02:05:53,271 --> 02:05:56,650
My mother's from Buenos Aires.
I've been to Argentina to citing Spanish.

2262
02:05:56,720 --> 02:06:01,000
There's so many. Uh, I do not.
Um, what's your background? Uh,

2263
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:05,460
ethnicity? Uh, I'm actually, um,

2264
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:08,780
are you a Nazi, your Army Nazi, blah?

2265
02:06:08,781 --> 02:06:12,920
I'm Italian and Irish on my mother's side
and English and French on my father's

2266
02:06:12,921 --> 02:06:16,760
side it, and it's, most of the immigrants
down there are Italian or Germany,

2267
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:19,340
German and there's,
they still have like German language,

2268
02:06:19,341 --> 02:06:24,080
newspapers and some areas really vast,
large German popular.

2269
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:28,700
Yeah. That's where a lot of people went
and hid out and then were hunted down

2270
02:06:28,701 --> 02:06:32,360
eventually. Jesus Christ,
it's quite a scary thing.

2271
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:37,361
They just move to these towns and just
repopulated a bunch of fucking sociopath,

2272
02:06:37,521 --> 02:06:40,810
psychos do the tango until
just how many catches on.

2273
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:44,250
All of them are not a bad place to go
down to two and not a bad place today.

2274
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:48,190
Well, women are stunning.
It's a great steaks.

2275
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,440
I had a friend who just got back from
Columbia. I was like, oh my goodness.

2276
02:06:51,441 --> 02:06:51,681
He goes,

2277
02:06:51,681 --> 02:06:54,890
it's like 10 to one women to men that
women are beautiful women in the world.

2278
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:58,970
He said they have these incredible bodies
and they're dying to meet American men.

2279
02:06:59,290 --> 02:07:02,090
You said it's the most ridiculous thing
ever. He goes, every American man,

2280
02:07:02,091 --> 02:07:04,880
she'd just go to Columbia.
Well I'm a, I can't do that.

2281
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,780
Well you're married but a single.
But someone who is not happy.

2282
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:11,050
So what I'm saying, someone who doesn't
live the perfect life like Bryan County,

2283
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:15,680
they're having, they're having
problems. They hear get this.

2284
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:20,390
So Columbia has a lot of those video
chat things and guys will spend a lot of

2285
02:07:20,391 --> 02:07:22,760
money on this video chat things.
Here's the problem.

2286
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:25,220
Guys are flying down there
to meet their girlfriends,

2287
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:28,980
their cyber girlfriends and hanging
out there and getting all hung up and

2288
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:31,940
marriages it getting ruined.
Everything else. Oh, I'm like,

2289
02:07:31,941 --> 02:07:35,350
so there's been a lot of problems.
Yeah.

2290
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:40,180
Careful of the cyber chat
cloud. The webcam there.
Sirens, man. They are sirens.

2291
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:43,030
They will, they will. You listen
to, how are we not even men?

2292
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:44,200
I mean they're probably not even women.

2293
02:07:44,201 --> 02:07:46,420
They're probably men for the most
part with fucking fake pictures.

2294
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:51,670
I'll use the gross you video chat with
like think about, well the Nigerians,

2295
02:07:51,671 --> 02:07:55,540
how much the money they pulled out of
lonely men. They've done an amazing job.

2296
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:59,380
It's an amazing thing they've done. Like
what, what do they scamming old men.

2297
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,930
There's this one show,
uh,

2298
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:04,660
that was exposing this guy that got
sucked into this Nigerian scam and I think

2299
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:07,600
he gave off $250,000,

2300
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:11,500
which was like all the money he had saved
his entire life and he couldn't meet

2301
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:15,300
this girl tried to meet her.
He flew all the way to Europe and uh,

2302
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:16,960
she ducked him,
you know,

2303
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:20,050
like they had an email exchange and
they were supposed to meet at a certain

2304
02:08:20,051 --> 02:08:22,810
place. She doesn't meet him. Of course,
the only, she only speaks through email.

2305
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,700
She sends pictures and
only speaks through email.

2306
02:08:24,701 --> 02:08:26,110
He's never actually spoke
to her on the phone.

2307
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:29,860
So it's poor fucking guy flies all the
way to Europe and she gives them some

2308
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:34,070
kind of hootenanny excuse,
you know, oh, this happened,
my family. And this was like,

2309
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:37,120
it's very hard for me right now.
I don't know where I'd be without you.

2310
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:39,820
Thank you for understanding. And
then, you know, he just keeps,

2311
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:42,730
sends money since he's more money
Dominique. Oh, he's dumb as fuck.

2312
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:45,610
But he's also just sad and old
and lonely and uh, you know,

2313
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:49,120
he was an older man and she was young
and beautiful and in the pictures.

2314
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:54,250
So he flew back again. The guy flew to
Europe twice. God, twice. Nothing older.

2315
02:08:54,251 --> 02:08:57,460
People shouldn't be allowed on the
Internet. There should be guidelines.

2316
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,460
Know somebody should keep an eye on
older people. You know, I get these,

2317
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:05,560
I get those emails. Like I'm, the tears
are coming from my eyes. I have no money.

2318
02:09:06,610 --> 02:09:08,230
My grandfather got,
um,

2319
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:12,730
he got addicted to buying things
out of catalogs before he died,

2320
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:17,230
before he died. Um, he, he
went through a real bad period.

2321
02:09:17,231 --> 02:09:19,780
He only lived for a year
after my grandmother died.

2322
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:23,380
Took care of my grandmother for 12
years and my grandmother had a stroke.

2323
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:26,650
She had to like take care of her day in,
day out for 12 years.

2324
02:09:26,651 --> 02:09:28,690
And then when she died,
he was dead in a year.

2325
02:09:28,990 --> 02:09:32,230
And in that one year period
he went off the rails.

2326
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:36,060
And one of the things that he did was
he would buy things off of catalogs who

2327
02:09:36,061 --> 02:09:39,970
would just call and just
to talk to anybody just to
talk to people on the phone.

2328
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:42,270
He was like really lonely,
sad man.

2329
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:45,220
Well he was used to having his wife
with him like all day every day.

2330
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:50,080
And his family lived like an hour
outside of town, you know, they lived in,

2331
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:51,250
it was a substantial drive.

2332
02:09:51,251 --> 02:09:53,500
So they would come to visit him on
the weekends or when they could,

2333
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:56,470
but they couldn't be with them all the
time and he didn't want to leave his

2334
02:09:56,471 --> 02:09:57,860
house.
He wanted to stay in his house.

2335
02:09:57,861 --> 02:10:00,860
So it was this crazy situation where
the only way this is going to work with

2336
02:10:00,861 --> 02:10:04,900
these guys going to be happy and to be
living with somebody who doesn't want to

2337
02:10:04,901 --> 02:10:08,660
leave his house and he was getting
dementia and but category we have,

2338
02:10:08,661 --> 02:10:11,320
they have to take catalogs from him cause
he was just constantly ordering things

2339
02:10:11,321 --> 02:10:15,370
on catalog. Yeah. It was sad
shit man. People do that.

2340
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:19,330
They say people go to funerals like
that just so they can be around people.

2341
02:10:19,450 --> 02:10:24,250
Wow. So when people go and they don't
have any friends anymore, you know,

2342
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:27,640
like get to a certain age and where's
your friends are all gone. Yeah.

2343
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:31,660
That I think about that a lot.
That's I that that just must be so hard.

2344
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:33,980
I blocked my, I remember my, you

2345
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,710
know, he's married to the
guy for 55 years, 60 years,

2346
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:40,340
and then he was gone and I walked into
the, to the casket and that was it, man.

2347
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:40,731
That was it.

2348
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:44,240
That was somebody she had been with for
55 60 years and they were just gone.

2349
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:47,660
You know? And that adjustment
is, is a weird thing, man.

2350
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:51,300
Yeah. And also the reality that you're
going to go to, I mean, you know it,

2351
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:52,400
I know what we all know,

2352
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:56,310
but it seems almost abstract until you
see it in front of you and then you go,

2353
02:10:56,311 --> 02:10:59,460
oh, this is what's going to happen one
day. It's just going to not be here.

2354
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:03,150
I'm going to just be gone. You're going
to be gone. She's going to be gone.

2355
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:04,970
Everybody's finite.
We just,

2356
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:09,930
it's just so hard to recognize that while
it's all happening while you're living

2357
02:11:09,931 --> 02:11:12,090
your life,
it's so hard to appreciate it.

2358
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:15,470
All right. Well until people start
like my father, uh, you know,

2359
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:20,500
died in 2009 and my sister
died in 2011 hardcore.

2360
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:23,320
Two of the people I love the most in
the world is at 10. So I mean you never,

2361
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:25,540
life just seems like some endless thread.

2362
02:11:25,930 --> 02:11:29,260
It's just going to keep going on and on
and until you get punched in the heart

2363
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:32,740
and have somebody very dear to
you who you love and you know,

2364
02:11:32,741 --> 02:11:35,290
taken away from you that
doesn't don't on you.

2365
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,740
Is your sister younger or older
than you? Younger. Yeah, she was 37.

2366
02:11:38,830 --> 02:11:39,663
Got Breast Cancer.

2367
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:41,120
Oh No.

2368
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:45,040
Yeah. Where's that at? My father was
killed by a drunk driver. Nano. No. Yeah.

2369
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:46,011
So I mean,
you know,

2370
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:50,180
one you can understand and the other
one is senseless and both of them are

2371
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:53,150
senseless. What is causing
breast cancer? Bryan County,

2372
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:57,650
you've probably known this gotta be there.
The food or a mass produced food.

2373
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:00,920
You know, like in Europe, my wife is from
Holland and she always points it out.

2374
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:01,311
Like there's,

2375
02:12:01,311 --> 02:12:05,570
there's a lot of foods that were
sold in America that had just a day.

2376
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:08,930
The governments in Europe don't
allow on the, on the grocery shelves,

2377
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,940
just certain ingredients and shit.

2378
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:15,300
The, the incidence of breast cancer
and in Japan was very, very low.

2379
02:12:15,301 --> 02:12:19,530
And when they started changing into
more of a western diet, it did rise. Uh,

2380
02:12:19,531 --> 02:12:22,380
so that, that would suggest
that diet plays a large,

2381
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:25,930
it's got to have something to do. Fish
oil and stuff like that. Pollution.

2382
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:29,680
This is probably a fucking slew
of factors. Nutrition, pollutions,

2383
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,160
brass water. Tim Ferriss went to, uh,
to where they live the longest in,

2384
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:36,570
in Okinawa. And, uh,

2385
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:39,300
what he was actually looking
at is what they don't eat.

2386
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:43,140
And one of the things about those,
Oh, can I add this up? No Pussy.

2387
02:12:43,170 --> 02:12:47,350
But there they have, um, like they talk
about they have a very, very diet, um,

2388
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,790
and all this stuff, but the,
the blue potatoes, not rice,

2389
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:51,690
and there's all these theories,

2390
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:56,610
but a huge part of it is their sense
of community. Um, they find that,

2391
02:12:56,660 --> 02:13:01,110
that people who have a purpose and
never retire, and a sense of community,

2392
02:13:01,111 --> 02:13:03,930
like when they're really a tight
community, they live longer.

2393
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:07,650
And so when most health
professionals are looking at health,

2394
02:13:07,651 --> 02:13:11,610
they're talking about graphs and while
they eat this and this pro, no, in fact,

2395
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,950
human connection when,
when you,

2396
02:13:13,951 --> 02:13:16,480
when people feel supported
emotionally and connected.

2397
02:13:16,481 --> 02:13:18,390
And I'm not saying this was
the case with your sister,

2398
02:13:18,391 --> 02:13:19,890
I'm not saying that cancer,
I'm not sure.

2399
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:20,301
Oh,
I,

2400
02:13:20,301 --> 02:13:24,310
I that never even crossed my mind that
you would be in playing totally agreeing

2401
02:13:24,311 --> 02:13:26,300
with what you're saying. Because
like, when people retire,

2402
02:13:26,350 --> 02:13:29,320
let you see a lot of people retire
or their wife dies or whatever,

2403
02:13:29,321 --> 02:13:32,160
like they die a few years later.
Think your theory

2404
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,420
makes perfect sense.

2405
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:36,590
The outliers with a mountain Gladwell's,
yeah, it's been a little while.

2406
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:39,830
He talks about this town Rosetta,
which is Italian town.

2407
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:42,760
There's an Italian town called
that they were marble. Uh, they,

2408
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:44,600
there was a marble query and next nearby.

2409
02:13:44,601 --> 02:13:48,240
And when the mobile query in Rosetta
in Italy was no longer had any marble,

2410
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:51,440
they moved to a part of Pennsylvania
where they had a query nearby.

2411
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:54,890
They formed their own town.
And in the 50s,

2412
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:58,280
a heart disease was an absolute
epidemic epidemic in this country.

2413
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:02,660
One of the things they found was in,
in, um, Rosetta people were just as fat.

2414
02:14:02,661 --> 02:14:06,380
They cooked with Lard, not even with
olive oil. They were dying of old age.

2415
02:14:06,650 --> 02:14:09,590
And they said maybe they come from an
hardy stock from this town Rosetta.

2416
02:14:09,591 --> 02:14:12,290
So they looked at people who had emigrated
from other towns in the United States,

2417
02:14:12,291 --> 02:14:14,210
from Rosetta. No, they were
dying of heart disease too.

2418
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:16,460
Why weren't people dying of
heart disease and Rosetta,

2419
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:18,680
why were they dying of old age?
Even though they were fat,

2420
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,290
even though they didn't eat
very healthy necessarily,

2421
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:23,660
or they ate a lot of sugar and pastries?
Well,

2422
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:28,950
the conclusion was probably that
they had such strong community,

2423
02:14:28,951 --> 02:14:29,784
such a bond.

2424
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:34,100
Even if you were a guy who is a
nerd or a guy who is whatever was,

2425
02:14:34,190 --> 02:14:38,630
wasn't winning and things, there was
such a support system for people. Um,

2426
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:41,620
there were parks and people
would talk to each other, uh,

2427
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:45,170
going to and from work and there were
community things that they would do and it

2428
02:14:45,171 --> 02:14:48,140
was such a strong community.
They look forward to hanging out,

2429
02:14:48,170 --> 02:14:51,200
they look forward to hanging out.
And that plays a factor in jail.

2430
02:14:51,290 --> 02:14:54,500
Enjoying your life, enjoying
your life. It's everything. Yeah.

2431
02:14:54,990 --> 02:14:57,000
It's everything. Enjoying what
you're doing, having a good time,

2432
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:00,310
but then also having that sense of
purpose and not, you know, like yeah.

2433
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:02,460
Boy or something.
And then you retire and then you have,

2434
02:15:02,570 --> 02:15:05,250
you have nothing to do
in your mind is occupied.

2435
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,430
Well, I think with stand up, like,
you know, I talked to guys like you,

2436
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,010
like I'm never quitting.
I've never,

2437
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:12,230
that's always been my,
my thought as well.

2438
02:15:12,231 --> 02:15:16,490
It never even crossed my mind to
not do it. Yeah. Carlin never quit.

2439
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:21,410
No. You know, I mean, even Richard Prior,
when he was on his deathbed, came back,

2440
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:25,670
did more stand up. It was just
on stage. He couldn't even walk,

2441
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:30,420
can barely talk. I've worked with them.
I did like five weeks with them. Really?

2442
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:34,550
Yeah. The comedy store when he was, when
he made his comeback before he died,

2443
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:37,490
I saw him on to,
I think it was his 50th birthday.

2444
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,550
My father is the reason I'm a comedian
and my dad loved comedy and he had

2445
02:15:40,551 --> 02:15:44,700
Richard Pryor albums. And so like, I
used to listen to them. Uh, like in my,

2446
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:48,140
my dad was such a fan. He had
cassettes and drove around in the car.

2447
02:15:48,141 --> 02:15:51,770
And by listening to prior as
a kid with my dad, so, uh,

2448
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:55,050
my dad was living in La and prior was,

2449
02:15:55,190 --> 02:15:58,430
it was after he got sick and he,
you know, he was in a wheelchair.

2450
02:15:58,430 --> 02:16:01,250
Two guys had to lift him up
in the wheelchair and put
him on stage at the comedy

2451
02:16:01,251 --> 02:16:01,491
store.

2452
02:16:01,491 --> 02:16:06,230
But it was still such a thrill to be in
the same room with this guy who is like,

2453
02:16:06,231 --> 02:16:08,030
the reason I'm a comedian and like this,

2454
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:12,260
this ultimate loving bond I had
with my dad. And like, you know,

2455
02:16:12,650 --> 02:16:17,600
love of dirty jokes and comedy and
laughter and humor. And I think,

2456
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:21,290
and in prior could barely keep his
head up. And you know, he was so, uh,

2457
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:25,670
Bill [inaudible] and uh, but he did do
a 20 minute Hong Kong and licking pussy.

2458
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:30,070
I would get my dad to pay attention to me.
He was busy and so

2459
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,560
under so much pressure.
And the way I would get them to,

2460
02:16:32,561 --> 02:16:37,380
I remember as a kid is I would recite
movies and comics. That's, and,

2461
02:16:37,381 --> 02:16:40,540
and cause I knew I could recite them
and he would laugh. And that was a,

2462
02:16:40,541 --> 02:16:44,530
I knew it would kind of relieve the
pressure of his crazy fucking job.

2463
02:16:44,531 --> 02:16:49,480
And what was his job? He was a banker, you
know, and uh, I think he did other stuff,

2464
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:52,930
you know, for the government. I don't
know, but he was gone a lot. You know,

2465
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:57,040
he had this, he had to solve
all the problems, I think.
And I always felt that way.

2466
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:59,950
But, um, he just, I could always
see the stress on his face.

2467
02:16:59,951 --> 02:17:03,240
I could always see that the, the insanity
that he was going through. And I,

2468
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:07,870
and I remember one time he would relax
is when he would laugh at me. So I would,

2469
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:12,700
I would quote Monty python or I, yeah,
I've got really good at memorizing. So,

2470
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,830
you know, whatever man. What a joy.

2471
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,870
I hope I have a son who
entertains the shit out of me.

2472
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,160
[inaudible] I got a video I'll show you.
My son doesn't, he's two and a half.

2473
02:17:21,161 --> 02:17:21,600
He will,

2474
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:25,600
he sits at the drums for one hour at
a time and he doesn't want to get off.

2475
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:29,280
You guys call those loads and there now
Tom Rhodes. Yeah, I'm getting up there.

2476
02:17:29,310 --> 02:17:31,200
Get up there. Yeah, because by the way,

2477
02:17:31,201 --> 02:17:34,530
it comes a point in time when he sperms
no good. No more. You'll be a good dad,

2478
02:17:34,531 --> 02:17:39,330
Tom. Yeah, I can't wait. My wife wants
to wait. Uh, you know, I'm ready to go.

2479
02:17:39,570 --> 02:17:43,500
She wants to wait for what? She's just
enjoying this, traveling the world,

2480
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:47,130
doing cool gigs all over the world and
you don't even have a place to stay.

2481
02:17:47,131 --> 02:17:51,660
Right. You're still down in the hotel
thing. She's constantly booked Europe,

2482
02:17:51,661 --> 02:17:53,010
Asia, you know. Great.

2483
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:56,640
And I may in New Zealand
at the New Zealand comedy
festival and then I did like

2484
02:17:56,641 --> 02:18:00,230
a best of the fest tour. Like, oh my God,
who doesn't want to go to New Zealand?

2485
02:18:00,231 --> 02:18:04,510
It's great. And your wife loves it. My
wife loves it. She loves comedy. She's,

2486
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:08,610
you know, on the planet. One woman
on this planet has to travel,

2487
02:18:08,611 --> 02:18:11,750
loves to hang out and
like a drink and you know,

2488
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:16,080
laugh with comedians cause that's what
I've, you know. Wow, that's cool man. She,

2489
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:18,510
she's, that's great too.
That's a very rare thing.

2490
02:18:18,511 --> 02:18:21,930
I don't know of any other guy that's
doing that. I don't hear it bro.

2491
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:23,670
Especially a high level guy,

2492
02:18:23,671 --> 02:18:26,340
like maybe the guys that are in the
beginning when they're just starting out.

2493
02:18:26,341 --> 02:18:28,650
But like, you could do it in the
beginning because you're not,

2494
02:18:28,830 --> 02:18:30,360
unless you're independently wealthy,

2495
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:33,210
your family or money living on
the fucking couch and the couch,

2496
02:18:33,211 --> 02:18:35,510
the couch and people's,
you know,

2497
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:39,270
all those friends couch that
first 10 years of, you know,

2498
02:18:39,271 --> 02:18:42,480
taking buses and hitchhiking to gigs
and sleeping on people's couches.

2499
02:18:42,481 --> 02:18:47,040
It's like now where it's come in, life
is, it's sweet. It's great. You know,

2500
02:18:47,041 --> 02:18:48,930
I got gigs in while going back to London,

2501
02:18:48,931 --> 02:18:53,160
I'm doing the Soho Theater and like
February I got a Gig in Barcelona,

2502
02:18:53,170 --> 02:18:56,700
I'm doing a tour of Holland at the end
of January. It's just like, it's awesome.

2503
02:18:57,710 --> 02:19:00,970
And then they're just like arguing
so much work in the states. I mean I,

2504
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:05,340
I can only, uh, you know why pay
rent on a place I'm never at.

2505
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:10,350
Yeah. So you work more in Europe than you
do in America? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2506
02:19:10,351 --> 02:19:13,110
It's about, no, it's 50, 50,
50. You know what I mean?

2507
02:19:13,111 --> 02:19:17,840
Like I'm in the states 50% of the time
and then 50% of the time outside or a

2508
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:19,170
high tech nomad brother,

2509
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:21,780
you'd probably go international
more than anybody I know.

2510
02:19:21,781 --> 02:19:24,000
Then if that's the case,
if you're like 50 50,

2511
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:27,650
who else do you know that does like 50%
of their stuff internationally? Hello?

2512
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:30,320
I've been doing it for a long
time. No. Yeah, you have stand up.

2513
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:33,380
Does a bit international, but
not that much. Eight cities,

2514
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:38,150
like I stayed up absolutely kills me
when he talks about like, you know,

2515
02:19:38,151 --> 02:19:39,410
I'll be like, you know, cause he's,

2516
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:42,520
he's pretty adored in England and he's
doing these nice, you know, you know,

2517
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:45,980
theaters and, you know, selling
some nice tickets. And, uh,

2518
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:47,870
he talked to him about it and he's,
he's like,

2519
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:50,120
he thinks everywhere is like Mexico.
He's just like,

2520
02:19:50,121 --> 02:19:53,870
you just complaining about things.
It's horrendous.

2521
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:58,100
He just, he thinks so little of a,
some of the places that he goes,

2522
02:19:58,101 --> 02:20:00,830
it just kills me. I'm like,
didn't you enjoy the food?

2523
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:04,250
He might not be being theatrical.
I think he is. I think stand up.

2524
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:08,300
He loves to be a contrarian and um,
you know,

2525
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:12,350
cause I mean there's certain aspects of
travel that I just, I, you know, like, uh,

2526
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:17,240
it depends where I'm at in the
world with time off. Uh, and we'll,

2527
02:20:17,241 --> 02:20:20,180
we'll go somewhere and we'll rent
an apartment somewhere exotic.

2528
02:20:20,181 --> 02:20:25,181
Like last November I did the Jakarta
comedy festival and my wife and I went to

2529
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:29,780
Bali for two months. That's Indonesia for
anybody who doesn't know. And then, uh,

2530
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:32,210
like in June we went to key
west for a couple of weeks.

2531
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:35,630
In September we had rented an
apartment in Rome. We've done,

2532
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:40,450
we've done that the last few years. What
is your favorite place to, uh, uh, I,

2533
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:44,240
you know, I uh, San Francisco, Sydney,

2534
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:47,330
Amsterdam.
But if you were to retire somewhere,

2535
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:50,180
do you think there's a country you would
go to if you didn't live in the states?

2536
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:55,220
Ah, I uh, I mean I always liked Paris,

2537
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:57,440
my wife, her favorite cities, Rome.

2538
02:20:57,770 --> 02:21:00,530
And she's really been the
last three years in a row.

2539
02:21:00,531 --> 02:21:04,520
We've gone to Rome to the first two years.
Like seeing monuments and all these,

2540
02:21:04,521 --> 02:21:08,540
uh, you know, paintings and
things. I wanted to see this
last time we went there.

2541
02:21:08,541 --> 02:21:09,260
It was great.

2542
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:12,860
I just pretended like I lived there for
like a week or just like going to nice

2543
02:21:12,861 --> 02:21:16,970
restaurants. And when you're
pranking roam, where do you perform?

2544
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,970
I haven't performed there.
I'll just go on their own on trips.

2545
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:23,740
I should set up a Gig there cause
I've been, I love going there. Yeah.

2546
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:27,290
You don't ever have the desire to
like have a place where you know,

2547
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:30,500
like this is where you put your family
photo and this is where you put your

2548
02:21:30,501 --> 02:21:32,190
underwear. You know what
I did that I, you know,

2549
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:34,460
I threw everything in the storage
when I moved to Amsterdam.

2550
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:38,390
So I had everything in storage for five
years. And then you look for five year,

2551
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:43,310
five years. Wow. Yeah. And I had a, I
was on television for three. I had uh,

2552
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:48,340
my own late night talk show for two years
on Dutch television in English and it

2553
02:21:48,651 --> 02:21:52,700
was subtitled in Dutch. And uh, and then
when that finished the same network,

2554
02:21:52,701 --> 02:21:56,180
let me do one year as a
presenter on a travel program.

2555
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,390
So I had a wonderful life there,

2556
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:03,740
but when it finished and I love
making television and I moved back,

2557
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:04,461
I moved to La,

2558
02:22:04,461 --> 02:22:07,730
got everything out of storage and I
looked at my shit and I'm like, this is,

2559
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:12,620
what am I, my empire of $20
purchases? I mean, everything.

2560
02:22:12,621 --> 02:22:15,460
Was there anything that meant anything
to me? It was like a book or a CD,

2561
02:22:15,461 --> 02:22:20,240
you know? All those are like 20 bucks.
He is my empire, $20 purchase it.

2562
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:23,840
The things that did matter are the
family photos and then like, you know,

2563
02:22:23,841 --> 02:22:27,210
things from your life, family
and little, your comedy career,

2564
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:32,130
a little memorabilia and stuff. So like
when I threw everything back in storage,

2565
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:32,941
uh,

2566
02:22:32,941 --> 02:22:37,500
I got rid of like most of
like the furniture and shit
like that and just got it

2567
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:41,550
even smaller to like what
was really important to me,

2568
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:44,460
like my book collection and
different, uh, you know,

2569
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:49,380
archives of videos and photo years
ago you had a place in Korea town.

2570
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:53,700
That's what, that's when I got came
back. Uh, that place was great.

2571
02:22:53,701 --> 02:22:55,950
And you came over that one night.
We had a great night.

2572
02:22:55,951 --> 02:23:00,720
There was this girl who I went to high
school with WHO's an old friend of mine.

2573
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:04,290
You and her got into like
this insane argument.

2574
02:23:04,291 --> 02:23:08,710
I don't know what she
said about she's a, I, I,

2575
02:23:08,990 --> 02:23:10,440
I,
I forget what it was.

2576
02:23:10,441 --> 02:23:15,030
But you like schooled her on something
that she was misinformed about and you

2577
02:23:15,031 --> 02:23:18,770
guys, uh, I don't remember.
You don't remember that too
much? I remember there was,

2578
02:23:18,771 --> 02:23:21,630
we got really high. There
was one I read, I saw you.

2579
02:23:21,631 --> 02:23:25,550
I like the comedy store or somewhere.
There was one crazy girl that had some PR.

2580
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:29,120
I don't remember what the idea was,
but it was so wrong on in like,

2581
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:31,230
and she was like saying
it as if it was fact.

2582
02:23:31,231 --> 02:23:33,680
I don't remember what it was though.
It was something like that. Yeah,

2583
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:34,650
I forgot what the thing was,

2584
02:23:34,651 --> 02:23:38,220
but it was something that
was [inaudible] we're having,

2585
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:41,850
there's this great party at
my house. I had this, uh,

2586
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:44,640
I had very little furniture.
My friend,

2587
02:23:44,910 --> 02:23:47,640
really good friend Charles
Esl who lived in the building.

2588
02:23:47,641 --> 02:23:52,641
He was in a band and he was like a
character comedian did a little stand up,

2589
02:23:52,891 --> 02:23:57,010
but he also had a band. So I
let him set up his, uh, his,

2590
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:58,910
his band stuff in my living room.
So I,

2591
02:23:58,911 --> 02:24:02,940
there was a drum kit and a instruments
there and I just let these guys,

2592
02:24:02,941 --> 02:24:04,770
I'd left him.
The key is one of my best friends.

2593
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:08,730
So when I'd be out of town half the time
and he could go in there and I had this

2594
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:12,410
massive CD collection and stuff and he
would just beat on the drums. No, no,

2595
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:14,720
he has abandoned would go practice.
They'd go pri,

2596
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:18,390
they get an apartment and my apartment
in Korea town and that's where you came

2597
02:24:18,391 --> 02:24:22,800
over. And I had this great, like,
it's empty living room quick,

2598
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:25,800
just like a musical instrument.
We're having a really nice party.

2599
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:28,650
And then you and this girl got a,
you know,

2600
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:32,940
one inch from each other's noses
and I don't remember it confronting,

2601
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:36,990
I don't remember it. Right. I think the
girls had said something that was, um,

2602
02:24:37,530 --> 02:24:42,060
it was, uh, just not true,
not even close to being true.

2603
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:44,760
I remember her just being a
little crazy and thinking, man,

2604
02:24:44,761 --> 02:24:49,110
Tom Hangs out with crazy people,
but maybe I made a crazy,

2605
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,140
I'm still good friends with, uh, uh,
I'm still good friends with a, uh,

2606
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:57,460
a good portion of people I went to
high school with. Wow. That was a, a,

2607
02:24:57,470 --> 02:25:00,930
it was from a small little
town, uh, Oviedo Florida.

2608
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:05,460
There was a lot of really good people.
I mean, some of them are, you know, uh,

2609
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:08,280
or you know, have different beliefs
and different ideas about things.

2610
02:25:08,281 --> 02:25:11,820
But so the little goofy is
that we transfer. No, no, no,
no, no, no. Not all of them.

2611
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:15,660
No, no, no. I'm saying there's
a couple that are goofy. Um,

2612
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:18,920
that girl was one of the hottest
girls in my eyes. Fall out.

2613
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:22,440
Well that's the problem. That's also
the problem. When you're really hot,

2614
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:24,420
you'll get away,
get away the same right across.

2615
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:28,210
And I think that she had probably gotten
away with saying whatever she wanted

2616
02:25:28,211 --> 02:25:31,620
for a long time. You were one of the
first people do, um, you know. Yeah.

2617
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:36,550
It seemed like it was, it was just, you
know, I remember were high at the time,

2618
02:25:36,551 --> 02:25:41,350
which really destroys bullshit.
Nothing destroys bullshit like marijuana.

2619
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:44,800
And when someone's bullshit in
your high like, oh, come on man.

2620
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:49,840
Tony would say that right? To Stop.
Like it's so obvious. This is not true.

2621
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:53,480
This is not a true thing. You lay
man, is that, Oh God, it's everywhere.

2622
02:25:53,490 --> 02:25:57,550
There's honorary missing. Telling
me two plus two is 18. I'm like,

2623
02:25:57,551 --> 02:26:02,551
what the fuck are you stop making all
this noise Scientologists in about people

2624
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:05,890
in la that are aren't used to
being told no, you're wrong.

2625
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:09,530
What you're saying is just absolute
horseshit called on it. Right. You know,

2626
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:14,350
or how about this, you're lying. Stop
lying is a little bit of that going on.

2627
02:26:14,410 --> 02:26:17,140
Oh my God, it's unbelievable. You know,

2628
02:26:17,141 --> 02:26:19,350
one of the things I was saying to
a friend we were talking about, uh,

2629
02:26:19,430 --> 02:26:22,450
the one thing that I don't like
about people that are struggling,

2630
02:26:22,570 --> 02:26:24,070
especially struggling his actors,

2631
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:26,770
it's the arena that they're
forced to compete in the arena.

2632
02:26:26,771 --> 02:26:29,650
They're forced to compete is an arena
where they're constantly going to

2633
02:26:29,651 --> 02:26:33,580
auditions where there's this weird
social thing going on where there's one

2634
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:34,570
person who's in control,

2635
02:26:34,571 --> 02:26:38,770
the casting director and
there's a director who's
observing you and your whole

2636
02:26:38,771 --> 02:26:42,880
thing is about getting these people to
like you quickly in a brief amount of

2637
02:26:42,881 --> 02:26:43,510
time.

2638
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:48,510
And so they adopt like really obvious
democratic left wing sort of tendencies

2639
02:26:48,791 --> 02:26:51,520
and things to say. And
they adopt, you know,

2640
02:26:51,521 --> 02:26:54,730
a very left wing mindset because that's
the majority of the people in Hollywood

2641
02:26:54,731 --> 02:26:59,410
are fairly left wing and
they start spewing out shit
that they think people want

2642
02:26:59,411 --> 02:27:03,550
to hear as opposed to having a real
thoughtful opinion on something that's,

2643
02:27:03,590 --> 02:27:04,630
that's a very good point.

2644
02:27:04,630 --> 02:27:08,920
Very few people have the luxury of
having a real thoughtful opinion.

2645
02:27:08,921 --> 02:27:10,870
It's all about getting
someone to like you.

2646
02:27:10,871 --> 02:27:15,010
It's all about getting into the
door at is so, so, so true man.

2647
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,980
Terrible way to thinking about that
the other day. That is so true.

2648
02:27:17,981 --> 02:27:21,280
That becomes this, this way
of you have to, you have,

2649
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:24,160
you're bullied into speaking a
certain way. Cause if you don't,

2650
02:27:24,161 --> 02:27:28,150
you're going to be considered a shithead
or you know, not on the team man.

2651
02:27:28,151 --> 02:27:30,940
You're not on a ton of team
and you see it all the time.

2652
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:35,230
Well the left wing aspect of it is
very strong kills ideas. Schubert,

2653
02:27:35,231 --> 02:27:38,080
I forget what he calls her love.
She calls herself a, you know,

2654
02:27:38,081 --> 02:27:42,380
a liberal conservative or whatever
because he wants to work in shows like,

2655
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:44,880
you know,
he's sure he cracks,

2656
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:47,590
never go to an audition with
a Mitt Romney shirt on there.

2657
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:49,690
Not a single fucking
person would ever hire you.

2658
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:53,320
And that's something that they would
really, it would prejudge you for sure.

2659
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:56,200
I'm going to go get this Guy Outta here.
That is a hard game though. Acting man.

2660
02:27:56,201 --> 02:27:58,690
I know there was a, when I lived
in that building and Korea town,

2661
02:27:58,691 --> 02:28:02,380
there was a actor guy that lived
in my building, uh, you know,

2662
02:28:02,530 --> 02:28:05,350
it's starting to get up there
in age for an actor or whatever.

2663
02:28:05,351 --> 02:28:09,020
And I guess his was work kind of dried up.
And uh,

2664
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:11,200
for some reason when I would see this guy,

2665
02:28:11,201 --> 02:28:14,740
he would tell me everything about his
life. For some reason he thought we were,

2666
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:18,070
you know, whatever. Great friends.
I told the guy very little about me.

2667
02:28:18,610 --> 02:28:21,710
He just would always just spew
all this information himself.

2668
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,600
And I remember him telling me,

2669
02:28:23,601 --> 02:28:27,020
cause it was a bar downstairs in that
building and him telling me one night the,

2670
02:28:27,021 --> 02:28:30,290
uh, I'm getting out of show
business story, I love the,

2671
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:33,680
like you and I were talking about never
even considered stopping doing this.

2672
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:36,650
But like, so I, it kills
me when somebody gives the,

2673
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:41,260
I'm getting out of show business
speech, I've given my all, I've done

2674
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:47,930
thickness and then the phone
is he the guy he, you know,

2675
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:51,110
cause nothing had gone on for him.
He hadn't worked in a couple of years.

2676
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:55,340
And then he got this little
roll on, um, a deadwood,

2677
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:58,340
like say I don't,
maybe one line or you know,

2678
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:02,030
he was on a horse or something and
then like a, and that, you know,

2679
02:29:02,031 --> 02:29:03,530
that rejuvenated his spirit.

2680
02:29:03,531 --> 02:29:07,760
But I remember the guy telling me sometime
after that that this girl had dumped

2681
02:29:07,761 --> 02:29:11,930
him and he's just, he's just incredulous.
He can't believe it happened.

2682
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:17,270
And he just keeps saying to me,
but I was on deadwood, man. Whoa.

2683
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:20,510
Like, who, who could dump me, God,

2684
02:29:22,030 --> 02:29:25,250
I was on this town, allows you to
reinvent yourself and reinvent,

2685
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:27,160
invent your own reality,
man.

2686
02:29:28,110 --> 02:29:32,960
Do we not want to be involved in life
with someone who that people do that?

2687
02:29:32,961 --> 02:29:35,710
All of them, but thing
to say. Yeah. Yeah. Dumb.

2688
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:39,500
It was another time where there was a
little cafe on the corner and he was a,

2689
02:29:39,501 --> 02:29:41,240
it was like a sunny Sunday or something.

2690
02:29:41,241 --> 02:29:44,390
He was sitting in front of their reading
the Big Sunday newspaper and he had the

2691
02:29:44,391 --> 02:29:49,080
homes section. He's looking through and
I'm just being a smart ass tonight. Um,

2692
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:52,700
you know, I walk up to him and I go, hi,
your career must be doing really well.

2693
02:29:52,701 --> 02:29:53,750
Now if you're looking at the,

2694
02:29:54,050 --> 02:29:57,500
at the home section and he looks up
from his paper and he just goes, no,

2695
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:01,580
just day dreaming and you know what I'm
going to do one day when I can afford a

2696
02:30:01,581 --> 02:30:02,250
house,

2697
02:30:02,250 --> 02:30:06,350
I'm going to build walls so high to
keep the shit in this city away from me.

2698
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:11,010
Oh. It was like was just like the most
venomous guy. God, that anger. Like,

2699
02:30:11,050 --> 02:30:14,850
it's a sunny Sunday. Loosen up your
tongue so hard. I got to get him. No,

2700
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:17,410
I've got a great story.
I had this is to build a wall

2701
02:30:17,610 --> 02:30:19,740
separate all this come from,
I knew a guy,

2702
02:30:19,741 --> 02:30:23,250
I'm acting class and you know how
long I was an acting class years.

2703
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:25,950
I loved it by the way,
for a lot of reasons.

2704
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:28,830
Mainly because it was
just fun to be in a just,

2705
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:32,570
there's a lot of greatness and
Joe would always make fun of me,

2706
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:37,470
but there was a guy, really good guy,
normal guy. So I thought, and he was,

2707
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:42,510
and he, I hired him to shoot
me to shoot this audition.

2708
02:30:42,511 --> 02:30:46,260
So I go to his house and he's got this
great camera and on his wall is a dream

2709
02:30:46,261 --> 02:30:49,140
board and on his wall is

2710
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:52,940
his, no, no, no, no. He's put his face,

2711
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:58,360
he's put pictures on his face on the
cover of vanity fair and those magazines.

2712
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:02,600
And he's got slogan's saying,
you're the guy,

2713
02:31:02,601 --> 02:31:06,950
you're the one and it's a dream
board. And it was big. It was good.

2714
02:31:06,951 --> 02:31:10,400
Covered his whole wall man. And
he's a good guy. And he's like,

2715
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:14,300
he's a normal guy in a lot of ways.
He's just been told the wrong things.

2716
02:31:14,301 --> 02:31:18,480
Jay Davis. No, it is not. I love that.
It's almost like, like, you know,

2717
02:31:18,490 --> 02:31:21,180
go to a girl's and she's got too
many stuffed animals on the bed.

2718
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:23,520
That's like the male equivalent though.
This guy,

2719
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:27,660
he thought it's show business so much
that even know he was trying to visualize

2720
02:31:27,661 --> 02:31:32,160
his future and it never, I remember
going, oh, it's never gonna happen,

2721
02:31:32,161 --> 02:31:34,080
Bro.
No matter what.

2722
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:37,960
Davis Jay Dad was very nice. He's a
great guy. He's a good dad, like sweets.

2723
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:39,230
You know,

2724
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:44,010
the reason he did is j so
enthusiastic like Jason Bourne. Yeah.

2725
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:48,210
Is just an enthusiastic guy who's
just loves everybody. But, but uh,

2726
02:31:48,270 --> 02:31:51,810
this guy handsome, tall, you know,

2727
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:55,800
suave and just, I was
like, you're a Dork, bro.

2728
02:31:55,801 --> 02:31:59,280
I gotta help you take that down.
Write down his picture,

2729
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:04,380
his face over celebrities faces on
Vanity Fair and people magazine.

2730
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:08,700
I'm not kidding. That's how he, he
can visualize himself doing that.

2731
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:14,230
Well, I don't know, Joe, stop bringing me.

2732
02:32:14,330 --> 02:32:17,770
Say you're going to run into that guy
and he's not going to have made it and

2733
02:32:17,771 --> 02:32:19,330
he's going to go,
you're the reason.

2734
02:32:19,331 --> 02:32:22,540
I'm not saying I wouldn't
be taken down by secret

2735
02:32:23,150 --> 02:32:26,990
guy and I want, I want the best for him.
I love the guy actually. He's a great guy.

2736
02:32:26,991 --> 02:32:27,824
It's just nuts.

2737
02:32:27,890 --> 02:32:32,890
He was told what happens sometimes is
people are told something enough times and

2738
02:32:33,081 --> 02:32:36,320
they forget to stop and think.

2739
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:38,360
It's exactly what you're talking
about with the Fox thing. It's like,

2740
02:32:38,390 --> 02:32:40,830
who says you can't swear and why
are you doing with somebody? Why is,

2741
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:43,640
why are you doing with the court?
You forgot the idea of a podcast.

2742
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:47,900
You have to keep thinking because you'll
make choices sometimes because you're

2743
02:32:47,901 --> 02:32:50,900
told that this works.
Who said it works?

2744
02:32:50,901 --> 02:32:54,860
I can't visualize running pumps back
in the NFL are fighting in the octagon.

2745
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,520
Don't have it. No matter what
I do, ain't gonna happen.

2746
02:32:58,550 --> 02:33:02,480
I'm getting fucking knocked out because
my bone structure for a thousand reasons,

2747
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:07,190
I don't have it. Okay, tried,
didn't work. So you know,

2748
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:09,800
you've got to you,
yes you should dream big,

2749
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:13,040
but you should also be
realistic with who you are.

2750
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:17,670
So when you're saying someone told him
that all you have to do is use the power

2751
02:33:17,671 --> 02:33:19,350
of positive thing.
Correct.

2752
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:23,790
Use the ID wage thinking
Rosie the law of attraction,

2753
02:33:23,870 --> 02:33:24,830
all that shit.

2754
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:27,860
And what happens when you read enough
books about it and it's written enough.

2755
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:32,600
You seen enough books written, you start
to go, this must be this, this is a truth.

2756
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:35,090
There was a girl who came to
the pod to the comedy store.

2757
02:33:35,091 --> 02:33:39,200
She was friends with Kelly, Kirsten.
Very nice girl. And uh, one day, uh,

2758
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:40,550
the day I met her,

2759
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:43,260
she was in the back hanging out
with Kelly and all the comedians.

2760
02:33:43,270 --> 02:33:46,670
I was just joking around. And, uh, it
was like right around the time that,

2761
02:33:46,671 --> 02:33:50,210
what the bleep did they know, oh
boy, that's on, in the movies.

2762
02:33:50,211 --> 02:33:54,020
And people just had decided that they
were going to visualize their life.

2763
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:56,960
And she was talking about it.
And I hadn't seen the movie yet,

2764
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,840
but she had just told me, um, that she,

2765
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:03,140
she was following the secret and her
life was going to be from here on out a

2766
02:34:03,141 --> 02:34:07,140
masterpiece because she was falling the
secret. And she was very nice. And I,

2767
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:07,491
you know,

2768
02:34:07,491 --> 02:34:10,850
I didn't want to argue with her and I
wouldn't argue with someone about that

2769
02:34:10,851 --> 02:34:11,684
because I don't even,

2770
02:34:11,750 --> 02:34:15,800
I'm not sure what I believe when it comes
to the power of positive thinking and

2771
02:34:16,010 --> 02:34:17,950
I don't know how much of reality,

2772
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:20,980
just because you can touch things
and bang on them with a hammer.

2773
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:24,730
I'm not exactly sure how much your
intent has to do. I'll give it to,

2774
02:34:24,731 --> 02:34:25,900
I'll give you,
let me just break it down.

2775
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:29,710
Nothing wrong with pots of thinking at
all until it gets in the way of critical

2776
02:34:29,810 --> 02:34:32,650
thing, right? So, so make sure,
if you want to be positive,

2777
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:34,650
we should all be positive.
We were just talking about this button.

2778
02:34:34,651 --> 02:34:39,651
Make sure you don't lose sight of critical
thinking to be able to decipher the

2779
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:41,770
meaningful difference between things.

2780
02:34:41,771 --> 02:34:45,450
It takes some thought and
experience and practice. This role.

2781
02:34:45,490 --> 02:34:50,440
I ran into her a year or so later, maybe
a year and a half later at the the, uh,

2782
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:55,120
UCB and I was like, how's it going?
How's everything? She's like,

2783
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:59,500
you know, I've been using the secret,
but it just doesn't work. She's like,

2784
02:34:59,501 --> 02:35:03,020
my life is just as much of a message
as ever before. And she was just,

2785
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:07,390
it was really weird because she was a
real confused and she wanted to ask me

2786
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:10,660
about it because we had had
this conversation about it
and there was essentially

2787
02:35:10,661 --> 02:35:14,830
the last time I'd seen her, you know,
and then she was like, it's just not,

2788
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:18,370
everything is a mess.
I keep having these bad people in my life.

2789
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:20,810
I keep dating the wrong guys.
I keep my,

2790
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:23,440
my dad's sick was like all
these things that are going on,

2791
02:35:23,441 --> 02:35:27,340
but I never would have created if I
wanted to secret as you keep making bad

2792
02:35:27,341 --> 02:35:30,670
choices twice sports and stand up and
things are so important because if you

2793
02:35:30,671 --> 02:35:33,340
come up against objective
reality, yeah, there's that.

2794
02:35:33,370 --> 02:35:36,130
You can tell a joke and if you're not
funny, they're not going to laugh.

2795
02:35:36,310 --> 02:35:38,980
You can study Kung Fu on a mountain.

2796
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:42,640
If you try to punch somebody hitting a
face who's been boxing and doing Moitai,

2797
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:45,370
you're going to get cracked in the mouth
and you're going to feel the difference.

2798
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:48,400
There is a place in in life,
we're objective.

2799
02:35:48,401 --> 02:35:53,170
Reality must be embraced and if you live
in La long enough and you start reading

2800
02:35:53,171 --> 02:35:55,960
books like that and you don't surround
yourself with people who tell you the

2801
02:35:55,961 --> 02:35:58,770
truth, people who have friends
who tell you the truth,

2802
02:35:58,771 --> 02:36:00,940
it's definitely that you'll
create your own reality.

2803
02:36:00,941 --> 02:36:03,490
You also need something that shows you
the truth and that's where like something

2804
02:36:03,491 --> 02:36:07,420
like a martial art or even like playing
chess or anything where it's like it is

2805
02:36:07,421 --> 02:36:09,940
a, there's a win lose situation
here. There's a reality.

2806
02:36:09,941 --> 02:36:11,830
You're as good as you showed to be good.

2807
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:14,830
You can decide that your poetry
is the most amazing poetry ever.

2808
02:36:15,010 --> 02:36:16,880
If you can get three
other idiots to agree,

2809
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:20,440
you could believe your own hype easily,
really quickly, not hard at all,

2810
02:36:20,770 --> 02:36:24,520
but you can't. If you go and play
basketball and you can't score a ball,

2811
02:36:24,521 --> 02:36:26,920
you can never think you're a
great basketball player. You like,

2812
02:36:26,921 --> 02:36:30,340
that ball is not going in here. This is
not happening. I've keep throwing it.

2813
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:34,330
I keep missing the hall, so
get a good code, 30 to nothing,

2814
02:36:34,331 --> 02:36:37,360
three fucking games in a row.
This is bullshit. You know,

2815
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:40,510
no matter what my mom says about that
being a good athlete, these guys are me.

2816
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:44,440
Yeah, that's, that's an objective
reality. And refining your approach.

2817
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:47,280
The whole point is you fail.
Figure out what you're doing wrong.

2818
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:50,530
Get somebody to teach you the difference
and then refine it and go back,

2819
02:36:50,531 --> 02:36:51,280
go back it.

2820
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:56,280
There is some aspect that requires a
positive approach and confidence and

2821
02:36:56,921 --> 02:36:59,810
thinking and almost hubris.
It all.

2822
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:02,890
There's a part of that that's real
and that's where it gets really weird.

2823
02:37:02,891 --> 02:37:05,620
It's like it's not an either or situation.

2824
02:37:05,621 --> 02:37:10,210
There's a bunch of elements to success
in life and one of the elements seems to

2825
02:37:10,211 --> 02:37:13,710
be like a belief in yourself and a
belief that positive things are going to

2826
02:37:13,711 --> 02:37:15,620
happen.
And a belief in you know,

2827
02:37:15,621 --> 02:37:20,360
hard work and a belief in like even if
you're proven wrong sometimes and you see

2828
02:37:20,361 --> 02:37:21,200
what went wrong,

2829
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:23,660
you've got to believe that you can
recover from that and keep going.

2830
02:37:23,990 --> 02:37:27,400
When you go on stage, like every time
you go on stage, you've done it before,

2831
02:37:27,401 --> 02:37:30,200
you've done it many times before
so you know that you can go do it.

2832
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:33,740
And the crowd, you know Roars Brian
Cowen and you get on that stage.

2833
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,270
But there's one point in time in your
life where you didn't fucking know this,

2834
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:41,480
know whether it was the first time or
it might've been like deepen your first

2835
02:37:41,481 --> 02:37:45,290
year. You know, this is like a, a
year in, I was like, what am I doing?

2836
02:37:45,830 --> 02:37:48,410
It's a fucking guy. I'm still
terrible. Like this is brutal.

2837
02:37:48,411 --> 02:37:51,260
It's a brutal fucking occupation.
Hit or miss. Not only that,

2838
02:37:51,261 --> 02:37:56,261
it requires so much self examination
that you never want to do as a young man.

2839
02:37:56,390 --> 02:37:57,440
Right, right, right, right.

2840
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:01,970
One of the most amazing conversations
I've had in a long time was with an author

2841
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:04,640
named Dan Coyle,
who wrote a book called the talent code.

2842
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:09,260
And he went and I had them all of the
podcasts and trop and bitch and I thought

2843
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:14,220
he was going to [inaudible] a
guy named Dan Quayle oil. Well,

2844
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:18,760
no, Dan Quayle wrote a book called the
[inaudible] oil. It was called potato,

2845
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:22,000
it's called.
He's,

2846
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:26,270
it's an amazing book called the talent
code where he went and studied all the

2847
02:38:26,271 --> 02:38:30,380
hotbeds of talent, like the schools
that put out the most world champions.

2848
02:38:30,470 --> 02:38:35,160
And he and he kept meeting the same
coach over and over again. Uh, yeah.

2849
02:38:35,161 --> 02:38:38,060
It was never a guy who gave
big speeches or anything.

2850
02:38:38,061 --> 02:38:41,480
He was just a guy obsessed
with information on what
he called deep practice.

2851
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:45,920
The idea of practice, what you're bad
at, practice just beyond your reach and,

2852
02:38:45,921 --> 02:38:47,690
and practice very hard.

2853
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:51,950
Well that's that Malcolm Gladwell thing
about the 10,000 hours thing. I mean,

2854
02:38:51,951 --> 02:38:54,380
which, you know, comedians
all hit that. Yeah.

2855
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:57,830
Well Dan Quayle it takes it to another,
like there's a woman who's 77 in Russia.

2856
02:38:57,860 --> 02:39:00,800
She owns one court,
teaches in group classes,

2857
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:06,030
put out more champion, more tennis
champions than anybody else in.

2858
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:10,100
And it's because, and she's really
starts all steroids. Yeah, no,

2859
02:39:10,101 --> 02:39:13,060
it's just the way she
disseminates information. Um, the,

2860
02:39:13,130 --> 02:39:16,700
and there are music people would teach
you that there's this cello player in San

2861
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:19,940
Francisco who puts out more worldclass
cellists because he just has a way of

2862
02:39:19,941 --> 02:39:24,500
communicating what Prac, how you should
practice. Yeah. That's a big thing, man.

2863
02:39:24,501 --> 02:39:28,370
Learning how to learn things. It's big
and a lot of people don't ever do it.

2864
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:30,080
And learning how to teach kids things.

2865
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:32,120
Like one of the things that
I'm realizing when a, I,

2866
02:39:32,121 --> 02:39:36,860
I'm a volunteer with my kid's class and
I watch like how little children were

2867
02:39:36,861 --> 02:39:40,490
talking about like five-year-old's absorb
information and how some of them just

2868
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:43,550
don't get it. They just
don't get it. And guess what?

2869
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:47,000
They don't get any extra help to ones.
The ones who don't get it.

2870
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:48,800
There's 30 fucking kids in this class.

2871
02:39:48,801 --> 02:39:51,440
There's one lady who's teaching these
kids and if the kid doesn't get it,

2872
02:39:51,441 --> 02:39:54,140
he just doesn't get it. I didn't
get it. And when kids don't get it,

2873
02:39:54,141 --> 02:39:58,010
they get into this spiral of they're
behind because they didn't get the first

2874
02:39:58,011 --> 02:39:59,480
thing.
The second thing comes along.

2875
02:39:59,481 --> 02:40:01,580
They don't get that either cause
that's based in the first thing.

2876
02:40:01,650 --> 02:40:05,960
They're standing there like staring. It
creates shame. Creates, creates a stupid,

2877
02:40:05,961 --> 02:40:07,640
that's a terrible way to teach people.

2878
02:40:07,641 --> 02:40:12,380
Like kids need to be talked to
like individually, like one on one.

2879
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:14,940
They need to learn things.
They definitely need some group time,

2880
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:18,300
but they need to learn things and it
needs to be broken down differently for

2881
02:40:18,301 --> 02:40:22,980
different people. And we don't do it. We
don't, we don't teach people how to learn.

2882
02:40:23,010 --> 02:40:24,570
We don't teach people how
to get good at things.

2883
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:28,560
We don't teach people how to discipline
themselves and we make it so that people

2884
02:40:28,561 --> 02:40:31,440
could just sort of skate by on life.
Well also what happens,

2885
02:40:31,441 --> 02:40:35,850
which is a very damaging idea, is the
idea that Oh, some people are born smart,

2886
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:38,310
others aren't because you didn't get it.
And that,

2887
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:41,430
that what happens is then you get gifted
programs and these kids are separated

2888
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:44,590
over here and these kids over
here are the dummies. And My,

2889
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:47,160
my very good friend of mine,
Hunter Motto wrote this book,

2890
02:40:47,161 --> 02:40:50,850
The straight a conspiracy motherfuckers
friends with all these authors. I'm very,

2891
02:40:50,851 --> 02:40:54,500
very smart. I'm brutal. Wait Til,
well, before we end, I know we have to,

2892
02:40:54,501 --> 02:40:56,340
and I want to get your take,
I'm sorry to jump in.

2893
02:40:56,340 --> 02:40:59,810
I want to get your tank if we can
on, on Robbie Lawler and, and,

2894
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:03,260
and that fight with, uh, with
uh, Rory Mcdonald. And why,

2895
02:41:03,470 --> 02:41:06,810
how did you find how you explain
Robbie Lawler's renaissance? I mean,

2896
02:41:06,811 --> 02:41:10,440
he's such a Badass discipline
maturity, you know. Uh, he's,

2897
02:41:10,441 --> 02:41:12,930
he's training with really tough
fighters on a regular basis. You know,

2898
02:41:12,931 --> 02:41:16,260
he's been working with the
same striking co Co uh,

2899
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:18,660
coach Matt [inaudible] has been
working with him for a long time,

2900
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:23,040
but now he's at, at t and t now,
uh, at and t in American top team,

2901
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:27,180
att. And um, that's a
great camp and a lot,

2902
02:41:27,181 --> 02:41:29,940
a lot of high level guys from the
trauma part, all those, so many.

2903
02:41:29,941 --> 02:41:31,830
So many guys even don't even know.

2904
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:36,120
I mean there's got slews
of them all talented people
and so he's just putting it

2905
02:41:36,121 --> 02:41:37,380
all together, you know, it's just,

2906
02:41:37,381 --> 02:41:41,730
it's just a matter of him finally being
focused and also spending a lot of time

2907
02:41:41,731 --> 02:41:45,090
at 185 pounds and I'll drop it down to
one side. Oh right. He dropped down.

2908
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:45,751
I'm telling you,
man,

2909
02:41:45,751 --> 02:41:48,540
he knocked out Josh Koscheck and the
first round and then there's Roy MacDonald

2910
02:41:48,541 --> 02:41:51,930
fight. Dude, he fucking hurt Roy
McDonald. He's one of the first,

2911
02:41:51,931 --> 02:41:55,660
I mean he heard them in the clinch to
hurt him when Rory was shooting for a take

2912
02:41:55,661 --> 02:41:58,080
down and going for the single,
he blasts him with left hands.

2913
02:41:58,290 --> 02:41:59,850
He heard him when he got on top of him.

2914
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:04,050
He hurt him really bad in this
one exchange in the third round.

2915
02:42:04,051 --> 02:42:08,880
He had them fucking rocked.
It was a bad fucking moment for Rory,

2916
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:12,810
but I'll tell you what, man, Rory
can take it. That kid is so tough.

2917
02:42:12,811 --> 02:42:17,220
He's so good and he's so technical,
but Robbie's just so God damn ferocious.

2918
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:18,480
I was so impressed with Roy,

2919
02:42:18,481 --> 02:42:22,290
especially in the first round about
how he avoided Robbie's charges.

2920
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:26,150
I watched that fight just like, like the
punches would come to his nose. Right.

2921
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:28,840
He knew just how far to get back.
I watched that fight with a,

2922
02:42:28,870 --> 02:42:32,340
with a guy who took a bronze medal in
the Olympics in boxing. Tony Jeffries,

2923
02:42:32,341 --> 02:42:35,730
who teaches Brennan shop and he was,
he was watching Rory and he said,

2924
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:39,420
he was like, he was like, that
guy's got the best footwork
I've seen. He said, as a,

2925
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:42,990
from an MMA fighter. He said, his foot
works unbelievable. He's super technical.

2926
02:42:43,050 --> 02:42:45,990
Just Lawler was just a little
too much for him that night,

2927
02:42:45,991 --> 02:42:47,430
especially in that one
round when he heard him,

2928
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:51,570
but it was still a really close fight. You
know, Roy, he's a bad motherfucker, man.

2929
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:53,610
On the phone. He's, by the way,
he's going to get even better.

2930
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:56,730
He's still young as shit. He's
24 years old. After this fight,

2931
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:00,030
he's going to come back even stronger. And
here's my, here's my next question. Uh,

2932
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:04,050
Hector Lombard fights. Johnny
Hendricks. What would happen? Oh, Jesus.

2933
02:43:04,051 --> 02:43:08,370
The world would explode and I agree.
Madness. Can you imagine that?

2934
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:10,410
Imagine powerhouses like that.
Well,

2935
02:43:10,411 --> 02:43:14,020
there's a lot of guys out there for him
now for Hector Lombard and for Johnny

2936
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:18,280
Hendricks. Say, how about
Tyron Woodley? Tyrone Woodley,
he's a fucking monster man.

2937
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:22,060
Him Versus Hector Lombard would
be the most muscular contest ever.

2938
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:27,070
Like the two most muscular man.
170, so stacked. It's crazy. Yeah.

2939
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:30,070
What's up with your friend Nate Marquardt?
Is he going to retire now?

2940
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:34,300
I don't know. I uh, I just exchanged
texts with him and, uh, I, I don't know.

2941
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:37,480
I don't want to speak for
him. Um, I, I don't know,

2942
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:40,180
I just think that at Nate's been
fighting for a very long time,

2943
02:43:40,420 --> 02:43:44,710
a very high level and, uh,
a lot of hard sparring too.

2944
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:46,930
A lot of hard sparring.
You'd sparring party,

2945
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:50,680
sparred with Shane Carwyn for
eight years. Good luck. Yeah,

2946
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:54,190
that's an interesting story. Like when
they asked GSP to with Shane Carwyn,

2947
02:43:54,191 --> 02:43:57,190
he's like, why? Why would
I spoke with them? Why?

2948
02:43:57,220 --> 02:44:00,760
Because to learn 70 fucking pounds
by Shane. Carmen hits like a,

2949
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:02,740
like a fricking mule kick.
Yeah.

2950
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:05,620
It's like getting punched by a telephone
pole at the end of a telephone pole.

2951
02:44:05,621 --> 02:44:09,160
Just Dong Dong. It's got the biggest
hand. Shane's got the biggest,

2952
02:44:09,161 --> 02:44:12,270
thickest hands I've ever seen. Big His
hands ever in the UFC. I believe it. Yeah,

2953
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,130
he had like three XL or four XL gloves.
They're ridiculous.

2954
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:20,470
They're like these giant
canned hands arms. It's a tough
guy, man. He and you know,

2955
02:44:20,471 --> 02:44:24,220
and for the longest time Nate and him were
training partners and they would spar.

2956
02:44:24,221 --> 02:44:28,360
And the idea that Nate who would fight
eventually in his best way class at 170

2957
02:44:28,361 --> 02:44:32,110
pounds to be fighting a guy who was
one of the bigger heavyweights. Crazy.

2958
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:35,650
That's how smart he was or how
good he was. Nate, Nate is when,

2959
02:44:35,651 --> 02:44:38,800
when I talked to Brendan and train with
him for eight years, and Shane the,

2960
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:41,200
when they talk about Nate and you know,
I mean,

2961
02:44:41,201 --> 02:44:45,310
and remember Nate's GSPS main
sparring partner for a long time,

2962
02:44:45,311 --> 02:44:49,420
I believe was named one of
his biggest trading partners.
Uh, you know, they, they,

2963
02:44:49,421 --> 02:44:53,770
they talk about Nate and hidden hushed
tones. He was as bad as like, I mean,

2964
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:57,220
Nate is a bad motherfucker,
man at his best.

2965
02:44:57,221 --> 02:44:59,320
If you go back and watch
like the Tyron Woodley fight,

2966
02:44:59,321 --> 02:45:01,360
when he fought with me in strike
force and knocked him out,

2967
02:45:01,361 --> 02:45:05,110
it was Nate then my one of his
finest performance. It's incredible.

2968
02:45:05,210 --> 02:45:08,130
He beat a lot of good
guys at 185 pounds to me.

2969
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:11,470
Stop Martin Kampmann and 185 pounds.
Um,

2970
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:13,930
Wilson go Veja I stopped
flying a hundred feet. Yeah.

2971
02:45:13,931 --> 02:45:16,980
Knocked Damien Maia with one punch.
Yep. Name was a bad mother fucker.

2972
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:19,270
But it goes back to the GSP thing.

2973
02:45:19,271 --> 02:45:22,490
It's like they all have a certain
amount of time in this game. Yeah.

2974
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:25,230
There's a certain amount of shots you can
take. There's a certain amount of time.

2975
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:27,130
It's chill son. And I said,
what are you going to do?

2976
02:45:27,131 --> 02:45:28,870
You've been competing since
you are nine years old.

2977
02:45:28,871 --> 02:45:33,130
Like well how do you replace the
juice of competition? And he said,

2978
02:45:33,131 --> 02:45:35,560
I have no idea.
I mean that's a huge part for,

2979
02:45:35,561 --> 02:45:40,120
I think a lot of guys who are extreme
winters, extreme athletes, you know,

2980
02:45:40,360 --> 02:45:43,120
which I consider cage
fighters to be, no doubt. Um,

2981
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:48,240
I think that substituting that all
that you get from that is very,

2982
02:45:48,341 --> 02:45:50,020
very difficult man.
Yeah.

2983
02:45:50,021 --> 02:45:53,530
Well there's also the fact that that's
how they define themselves. You know,

2984
02:45:53,531 --> 02:45:56,710
it's like, could you imagine if all
the sudden you just weren't funny? Yep.

2985
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:59,590
Like you would go on stage
and you just eat shit.

2986
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:02,710
You just weren't funny and people found
you just tasteful and they would boom,

2987
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:07,480
didn't drag me off the stage, man. Yeah.
You try to figure out like what is,

2988
02:46:07,481 --> 02:46:12,140
what went wrong here? Do you do? Yeah.
What do you do? Well with a fighter,

2989
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:13,370
that's what it's like.
It's like,

2990
02:46:13,371 --> 02:46:16,820
it comes a point in time where
your body is just, it's taken its,

2991
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:20,450
its share of blows and that's it.
You start to see it,

2992
02:46:20,451 --> 02:46:23,870
they start to have these breakdowns
started to have these injuries and knee

2993
02:46:23,871 --> 02:46:27,290
injuries, back injuries, neck injuries,
elbow injuries, shoulder surgery.

2994
02:46:27,410 --> 02:46:31,460
All this stuff starts to happen. The
weird wheels literally start falling off.

2995
02:46:31,461 --> 02:46:35,030
Yeah. You know, and until they
figure out a way to make it so that,

2996
02:46:35,031 --> 02:46:37,810
that doesn't happen, you
know, until it's always, yeah.

2997
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:39,060
Been the deal with athlete's foot,

2998
02:46:39,150 --> 02:46:41,790
great football players and great
baseball players. What, when, when,

2999
02:46:41,850 --> 02:46:45,150
when the crowd started cheering,
um, what do you do now?

3000
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:48,150
And that's always been an
issue for a lot of athletes.

3001
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:50,030
It's a deal with the
devil. You know, you, you,

3002
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:52,230
you have 10 incredible years
and then the rest of the time,

3003
02:46:52,231 --> 02:46:56,010
by the time you're 32, you're a veteran
and it's time to quit. A lot of times,

3004
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:59,970
you know, [inaudible]
you've got to, I always,

3005
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:04,200
that's why I think than a lot of ways
you've got to feed your brain at the same

3006
02:47:04,201 --> 02:47:06,480
time. Yeah. You get, definitely
got to feed your brain.

3007
02:47:06,481 --> 02:47:10,710
But I think as also like what's going to
happen if they figure out a way to fix

3008
02:47:10,711 --> 02:47:11,544
things,

3009
02:47:11,610 --> 02:47:15,930
like what's going to happen in the future
if the consequences of fighting or not

3010
02:47:15,931 --> 02:47:17,130
as extreme.
Like,

3011
02:47:17,720 --> 02:47:22,140
like if one day they get to a point where
they can regenerate neuro tissue and

3012
02:47:22,410 --> 02:47:24,030
speed up injuries,

3013
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:28,290
traumatic brain injuries just re
rehabilitate your brain to 100% probably a

3014
02:47:28,291 --> 02:47:31,260
better and better body probably get
better and better or or not. I mean,

3015
02:47:31,261 --> 02:47:34,380
one of the things that they
find with people is that, again,

3016
02:47:34,381 --> 02:47:37,980
I'm sorry to bring up Dan Coyle again,
but you know, you stop developing like a,

3017
02:47:38,010 --> 02:47:40,800
people type 80 words a minute
and they don't get any better.

3018
02:47:40,801 --> 02:47:45,510
People play golf and they stop at an 85
handicap because most people will get

3019
02:47:45,511 --> 02:47:47,650
good enough and then stop it.

3020
02:47:47,670 --> 02:47:51,780
To get that much better requires a
whole different level of practice,

3021
02:47:51,781 --> 02:47:53,220
a different kind of practice.

3022
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:56,220
You've gotta be obsessed. You've got
to get a fucking crazy person. Well,

3023
02:47:56,221 --> 02:47:57,420
you remember when you're
first starting out,

3024
02:47:57,421 --> 02:48:00,690
when you're doing comedy and there was
guys that were with you in the open mic

3025
02:48:00,690 --> 02:48:02,960
days and they just fucking
kind of dropped off and grow.

3026
02:48:02,970 --> 02:48:07,140
They didn't mess with it. Exactly. You
got to do, I love that spirit when you're,

3027
02:48:07,170 --> 02:48:09,380
when you're a young
comedian and it's like, Eh,

3028
02:48:09,510 --> 02:48:13,120
you're looking for a joke everywhere.
Yeah. What's funny about a tree? Oh man,

3029
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:16,110
we can write about a table or you know,
microphones.

3030
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:17,990
When I used to drive newspapers,
I had this,

3031
02:48:17,991 --> 02:48:21,320
a van that didn't have
any radio in it and uh,

3032
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:23,050
it was the best thing ever because this,

3033
02:48:23,051 --> 02:48:26,430
this monotonous work that I would
do and it was high on Dunkin donuts,

3034
02:48:26,431 --> 02:48:31,431
coffee and fucking Boston cream donuts
had this mad sugar rush and I was up at

3035
02:48:32,071 --> 02:48:34,950
five o'clock in the morning throwing
newspapers out the window and driving

3036
02:48:34,951 --> 02:48:37,710
around by myself. I would get all my
material. That's where I get all my,

3037
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:41,470
I don't play music in my car a lot of
times because I know, all right, if I,

3038
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:42,580
if I'm driving,
you know,

3039
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:45,940
and it's nice because at the end of the
day I feel like I accomplished something

3040
02:48:45,941 --> 02:48:49,840
when I surprise myself with an idea that
that to me is coming up with an idea

3041
02:48:49,841 --> 02:48:52,240
and surprising myself with a bit like
the other day I came up with something,

3042
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:54,850
but it just,
it's such a good feeling.

3043
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:58,120
It's better almost then performing
it in some ways, you know? Yeah.

3044
02:48:58,150 --> 02:49:01,670
Well it's a gift. It's a gift
for your time and focused. Yeah.

3045
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:04,700
You, Tom and focused gives
you this gift. You know,

3046
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:08,730
when you sit in front of a computer for
hours and hours and you just got this

3047
02:49:08,731 --> 02:49:13,200
one line, you're like, ah,
one line. That's one line.
Just that's all you need it.

3048
02:49:13,230 --> 02:49:14,730
That's all you need.
Then you take that one line,

3049
02:49:14,731 --> 02:49:18,310
you cut and paste it into your little
folder and you're like, Bam. Yeah.

3050
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:20,970
If you don't show up that thought,
that line doesn't get written.

3051
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:23,490
If you don't sit in front of that
computer, that line doesn't get written.

3052
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:27,120
I love that idea to show that what you
just said is that if you've got to show

3053
02:49:27,121 --> 02:49:29,010
up, got to show in a way,
if you keep showing up,

3054
02:49:29,011 --> 02:49:32,790
something will be revealed to you. That's
the whole point of Pressfield's work.

3055
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:36,060
You know, the war of art. That's his whole
thing, you know, showing up. So thing.

3056
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:41,050
Did you ever see the podcast? I've read
both his books. He's amazing. Oh Man.

3057
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:44,430
Really, really cool guy. Yeah, we did
a podcast together. Me, him and Aubrey.

3058
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:47,400
I think it's amazing. Is Red
is nonfiction stuff. I've read,

3059
02:49:47,460 --> 02:49:49,740
well I've read both now,
but uh,

3060
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:52,730
mostly the nonfiction stuff is
what I'd read for the nonfiction.

3061
02:49:52,770 --> 02:49:54,620
I didn't read the legend
of Bagger Vance and stuff.

3062
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:58,050
Be read his fiction stuff though about
like the Romans and the Greeks and he's

3063
02:49:58,051 --> 02:50:00,150
got a lot of really wild
shit, man. He's awesome.

3064
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:05,430
But just this whole thing is about having
that habit to just work to get it done.

3065
02:50:05,431 --> 02:50:07,380
And it applies to like anything creative,

3066
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:10,800
not just to writing but like the pre
pretty much anything you would want to do,

3067
02:50:10,801 --> 02:50:13,290
whether it's practicing music or you know,
creating a film.

3068
02:50:13,291 --> 02:50:15,000
Just fucking actually go to work.

3069
02:50:15,390 --> 02:50:19,350
And that's what a lot of people don't
going to because the world is filled with

3070
02:50:19,351 --> 02:50:23,610
weak bitches. That's how we're going
to end this. Ladies and gentlemen.

3071
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:25,620
Tell be a weak bitch.
Get it together.

3072
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:29,940
Thank you. Say November
29th and 30th guys, where,
