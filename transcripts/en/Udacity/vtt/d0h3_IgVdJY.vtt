00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.950
We're going to create two relationships.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.260
One that goes from notebook to note and

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.400
another one which goes
from note to notebook.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.160
In order for

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Core Data to work its magic, it's vital
that we always set both relationships.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.560
One way and then back.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.640
There's a big difference
between both relationships.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.130
Notebook, which we will
create here is one-to-one,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.970
which means that one note
can only be in one notebook.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.460
Notes is one-to-many, which means that
one notebook can have several notes.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.360
Let's stop for a moment and think how
these relationships will be mapped

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500
once the entity is turned into a class.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.140
A one-to-one relationship,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.390
such as a notebook,
will become a property of type notebook.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.460
So far so good.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.710
What will happen to notes?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.311
It will become a property of type set.

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:02.060
A set similar to an array but
it with a few limitations.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.459
There's no order and
no object can be repeated.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.100
Now that we have both
relationships created,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.160
let's make sure that we have both,
the direct relationship and the inverse.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.811
This is a very important step.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.536
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:23.710
And back to notebook.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:34.109
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.469
We need to make sure that the
relationship goes from note to notebook.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.858
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:40.577
And now

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:44.449
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:46.570
We have the two relationships correct.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.891
Now, move on to the next video once
you've added the relationships to your

00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:51.437
data model.
