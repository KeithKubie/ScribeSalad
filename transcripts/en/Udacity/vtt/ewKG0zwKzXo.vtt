00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.380
So today we've talking about understanding, which how agents make sense of

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.900
stories, events and other things in the world around them. We started off by

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.980
creating a more formal type of frame representation called thematic role

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.000
systems that captures verbs and tell us what to expect in certain events.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.590
We then talked about how single verbs can actually have ambiguous meanings. But

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.900
thematic role frames can help us differentiate which meaning a verb has in

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.220
a particular sentence. Finally we talked about constraints and how

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.760
certain words or frames can constrain the possible meanings of a sentence and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.270
help us figure out those ambiguous meanings. Today we've largely been talking

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.740
about how single words or phrases can have multiple possible meanings, but

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.580
next time we’ll do this in reverse. We’ll talk about how multiple words or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.340
multiple phrases or multiple sentences can actually have the same meaning.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090
We'll talk about how we can discern that sameness, and then react accordingly
