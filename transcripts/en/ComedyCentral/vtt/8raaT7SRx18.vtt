00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.688
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I DID NOT READ
IT.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.592
[LAUGHTER]
I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR THE

&gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO DIRECT IT.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.094
&gt;&gt; Jon: I WILL DIRECT IT.
&gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO DIRECT IT.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:01.595
&gt;&gt; I'D BE HAPPY TO DIRECT
IT.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.763
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU WOULD.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:03.764
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M A DIRECTOR NOW.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.333
&gt;&gt; I KNOW. YOU HAVE A VAMPIRE
MOVIE COMING OUT.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.568
&gt;&gt; Jon: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:12.172
IT'S ONE OF THEM TWEEN MOVIES.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.040
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHERE LOVE IS FOUND
UNEXPECTEDLY.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.074
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THEME OF "KILLING
PATTON."

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.342
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO IT'S NOT. HERE'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT THIS.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.777
LOOK AT THE COVER OF THERE. IT'S
JUST LIKE, PATTON'S JUST SITTING

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.614
THERE AND HITLER'S JUST GIVING
HIM THE EYEBALLS.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.715
LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT HITLER.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.749
OH, I'M GOING TO GET YOU.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:23.684
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:24.551
LISTEN TO ME.
&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:24.885
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE'S ALL I WANT FROM
YOU TODAY.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:25.786
&gt;&gt; UH HUH.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.920
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS IT.
&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:27.521
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT TO
DO IN THIS CONVERSATION.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.290
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:30.591
&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST ONE, I HAVE
ONE SIMPLE GOAL.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.825
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.796
&gt;&gt; Jon: I WANT YOU TO ADMIT THAT
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WHITE

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.231
PRIVILEGE.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.700
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.868
&gt;&gt; I KNEW YOU WERE GOING THERE.
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.705
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S ALL I WANT.
THAT'S IT. JUST A LITTLE, I JUST

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:45.472
WANT YOU TO SAY, I'M TERRIBLY
TERRIBLY WRONG ON THIS.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.807
I JUST WANT YOU TO LOOK IN --

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.543
&gt;&gt; IN YOUR CASE, THERE IS WHITE
PRIVILEGE.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.444
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:58.652
&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HERE
SITTING THERE.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.486
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T EVEN SHAVE.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.554
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.555
&gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T EVEN -- LOOK AT
YOU.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.556
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT? I SHAVE.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.757
&gt;&gt; WHAT -- THERE ISN'T -- YOU
DIDN'T SHAVE.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.161
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS GROWTH IS FROM
-- IT'S CALLED JEWISH PRIVILEGE,

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:08.962
IT HAPPENS. WE ARE A
HIRSUTE PEOPLE.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:09.563
&gt;&gt; OH.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE SAID, YOU'VE

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.731
STATED THIS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:11.565
&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE IS, I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A THING

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:11.999
CALLED WHITE PRIVILEGE.

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:13.233
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:14.801
&gt;&gt; Jon: SEE NOW, OKAY, NOW WE
HAVE A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.838
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LOOK IF THERE'S WHITE
PRIVILEGE THEN THERE HAS TO BE

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.805
ASIAN PRIVILEGE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.743
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE ASIANS MAKE MORE
MONEY THAN WHITES.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.610
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:24.912
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF
THIS, HUH?

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.847
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL NOT, NOT, WHAT KIND
OF ASIAN? YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.048
&gt;&gt; ASIAN AMERICANS. ASIAN
AMERICANS.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.983
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL NO, IT DEPENDS ON
WHERE THEY'RE FROM, IF YOU'RE

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:30.984
LOOKING AT --
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE FROM ASIA.

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.519
THEY'RE ASIAN AMERICANS.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.020
&gt;&gt; Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:34.154
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT AS A --

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:37.691
&gt;&gt; THEY MAKE MORE MONEY,
HIGHER EDUCATION, MORE AFFLUENT.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.627
SO IT'S ASIAN PRIVILEGE, NOT
WHITE PRIVILEGE.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.596
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.
AND, AND, AND THE POINT --

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.232
&gt;&gt; OH, SORRY TO CONFUSE YOU WITH
FACTS.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.568
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT, IT'S NOT
THE -- THAT'S, OKAY, HERE WE GO.

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.536
THE ASIAN EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA,
THE ASIAN IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.671
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.973
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM
THE BLACK EXPERIENCE.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:53.874
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:59.913
&gt;&gt; SO IT'S REALLY, THEY'RE NOT
EQUIVALENT.

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:03.851
AND EITHER WAY, WHITE PEOPLE,
MALES, SET THE SYSTEM, SO THAT'S

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.221
WHAT PRIVILEGE IS, IS THAT WHITE
PEOPLE SET THE SYSTEM THAT

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.190
YES, MAYBE ASIAN IMMIGRANTS ONCE
IMMIGRATION POLICIES WERE

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.694
LIBERALIZED HAVE DONE BETTER
OVER THESE PAST 30 OR 40 YEARS.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:22.803
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC,
SYSTEMIC SYSTEMATIZED

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:27.641
SUBJUGATION OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:28.642
WOULD YOU NOT AGREE WITH THAT?

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.610
&gt;&gt; SURE. I MEAN, EVERYBODY
KNOWS --

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.144
&gt;&gt; WELL THEN THAT'S IT, THAT'S
WHITE PRIVILEGE.

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:31.912
YOU JUST DID IT. YOU JUST DID
IT.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.013
THAT'S ALL, THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.716
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT HAND
SANITIZER. YOU WANT SOME?

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:36.550
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.418
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.787
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THAT WAS
THEN. THIS IS NOW.

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:41.688
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH IT'S, THERE
WAS WHITE PRIVILEGE

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.324
BUT IT NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:49.363
&gt;&gt; WAIT WAIT, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT THAT THERE IS

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.030
NO MORE SLAVERY, NO MORE JIM
CROW, ALL RIGHT?

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:50.931
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.700
&gt;&gt; AND THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN
THE WORLD.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.836
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT. OH BOY, HERE WE
GO.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:01.542
&gt;&gt; IS A BLACK AMERICAN.
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH BOY.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.209
&gt;&gt; AND THE MOST POWERFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD,

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.377
OPRAH WINFREY IS BLACK. OKAY?

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.446
&gt;&gt; Jon: BEING ABLE TO GIVE
PEOPLE A FREE CAR DOES NOT MAKE

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.414
YOU THE MOST POWERFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.549
&gt;&gt; THIS IS, THIS IS.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.550
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT LISTEN, BUT LISTEN
CLOSE -- BECAUSE I SEE --

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:10.350
&gt;&gt; DON'T MESS WITH.
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, NO. I SEE --

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:11.084
&gt;&gt; SHE'LL COME IN HERE AND SHAVE
YOU.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:12.386
&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE THE ISSUE HERE.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.856
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE
RESIDUAL EFFECT OF,

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.228
I MEAN SLAVERY AND JIM CROW ARE
DEAD BUT THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.029
OF THAT SYSTEM SUBJUGTION EXISTS
TODAY.

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:22.763
&gt;&gt; SURE. IT ABSOLUTELY EXISTS
TODAY.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:23.997
&gt;&gt; Jon: LET'S GO A DIFFERENT
WAY.

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.935
&gt;&gt; IT EXISTS FOR EVERY RACE,
NOT AT THAT EXTENT, ALL RIGHT?

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.703
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THAT'S WHITE
PRIVILEGE. OH BOY.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.306
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T PUT FORTH,
ALL RIGHT, THIS OH,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:37.644
WHITE PRIVILEGE AND IF YOU FAIL
THAT'S WHY YOU FAIL, ALL RIGHT.

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:38.812
AMERICA'S NOW A PLACE...
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:40.747
&gt;&gt; WHERE IF YOU WORK HARD AND
GET EDUCATED AND YOU'RE

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.217
AN HONEST PERSON, YOU CAN
SUCCEED.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.053
THAT WHAT SHOULD BE PUT OUT
THERE.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.921
NOT ALL THIS OTHER STUFF.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.656
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE CARRYING, YOU
ARE CARRYING, YOU ARE CARRYING

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.858
MORE OF THE BURDEN AS A BLACK
PERSON IN THIS

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.228
COUNTRY THAN A WHITE PERSON IN
THIS COUNTRY. FROM EVEN --

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:57.397
&gt;&gt; COLLECTIVELY, YES, BUT NOT --

00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:58.532
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, INDIVIDUALLY.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:04:59.800
&gt;&gt; LISTEN. INDIVIDUALLY EVERY
CIRCUMSTANCE IS DIFFERENT.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.503
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY DON'T STOP AT EVERY
AND FRISK WALL STREET BANKERS --

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:03.570
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE DONE FAR
MORE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.472
&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T STOP AND FRISK
WALL STREET BANKERS.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:10.010
&gt;&gt; WHITE PEOPLE, LISTEN TO ME.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.012
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHITE PEOPLE DO MORE DRUGS

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.747
IN THIS COUNTRY THAN BLACK
PEOPLE --

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.951
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT BLACK PEOPLE MAKE

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.019
UP A FAR HIGHER MAJORITY OF DRUG
ARRESTS.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:19.753
&gt;&gt; YOU DO KNOW WHY THAT
IS?

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:20.754
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.855
&gt;&gt; YOU DO KNOW WHY THAT IS. WHY
IS THAT?

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:22.956
&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.158
IT'S ABOUT REAL ESTATE TO SOME
EXTENT. THERE HAS BEEN A

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:30.130
SYSTEMIC SUBJUGATION THROUGH
REAL ESTATE, BLACK PEOPLE

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:35.435
ARE GHETTOIZED IN THIS COUNTRY,
AND THOSE GHETTOS --

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:36.036
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE FORCED TO LIVE
THERE, THEY HAVE TO LIVE THERE

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.374
IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.475
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH YOU'RE GETTING TO A
BAD PLACE, MY FRIEND.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.709
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS IS THE
USUAL WHITE GUILT, LIBERAL STUFF

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.711
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS NOT GUILT. THIS
IS FACT.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:45.712
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS THROW OUT --

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.447
&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON'T FEEL GUILTY.
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:48.182
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY?

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.416
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR
THIS.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.250
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH WHAT, YOU MEAN FOR
THIS. OKAY, LET'S GO BACK HERE.

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.018
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU SHOULD FEEL VERY
GUILTY.

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:51.752
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT MADE YOU
CULTURALLY?

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:52.953
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THIS IS THE USUAL
STUFF.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.757
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, WHAT MADE YOU
CULTURALLY? DO YOU THINK YOUR UP

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.257
BRINGING GAVE YOU
VALUES, ETHICS.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.091
&gt;&gt; YES. YES IT DID.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.793
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DIDN'T GROW UP RICH,
RIGHT?

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.427
&gt;&gt; NO. WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY
AT ALL.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.361
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU WORKED HARD.

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:02.196
&gt;&gt; I DID.

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.197
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. YOU WORKED HARD.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.997
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:11.004
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU LIVED WHERE.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:11.905
&gt;&gt; LEVITTOWN
&gt;&gt; Jon: LEVITTOWN.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:12.940
&gt;&gt; NEW YORK.
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO IT GAVE YOU A NICE

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:13.807
STABLE, A CHEAP HOME, THERE WERE
NO DOWN PAYMENTS.

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:14.808
THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:15.809
NO, THOSE HOUSES WERE
SUBSIDIZED.

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:16.877
&gt;&gt; OH IT WAS LAVISH.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.045
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, IT WASN'T LAVISH.
BUT IT WAS STABLE.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.213
&gt;&gt; NO, THEY WEREN'T SUBSIDIZED.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT WAS STABLE.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:20.347
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE SOLD TO GI'S AND
THE GI'S GOT A MORTGAGE THEY

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.281
COULD AFFORD. LOOK --

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.249
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:23.550
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:23.851
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. LET
ME JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:25.319
&gt;&gt; YEs.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:28.488
&gt;&gt; Jon: DID THAT UP BRINGING
LEAVE A MARK ON YOU EVEN TODAY?

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:29.656
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.559
EVERY UP BRINGING LEAVES A MARK
ON PEOPLE.

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:35.929
&gt;&gt; Jon: GREAT. GREAT. COULD
BLACK PEOPLE LIVE IN LEVITTTOWN?

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:37.731
&gt;&gt; NOT AT THAT TIME, THEY COULD
NOT.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:46.139
&gt;&gt; SO THAT MY FRIEND IS WHAT WE
CALL IN THE BUSINESS WHITE

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:46.640
PRIVILEGE.

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:47.474
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND. OKAY.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.677
[APPLAUSE]
THAT WAS IN -- NO, THAT WAS

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:50.944
IN 1950, ALL RIGHT.

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:51.345
1950.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.346
1950.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.783
&gt;&gt; WERE THERE BLACK PEOPLE
LIVING THERE IN 1960.

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:57.551
&gt;&gt; IN LEVITTTOWN?
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.118
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:58.785
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WEREN'T.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.220
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.622
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I READ UP ON IT.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:02.956
&gt;&gt; OH YOU READ UP.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.091
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.058
&gt;&gt; I COULD FIND SOMEBODY.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.094
&gt;&gt; MY POINT IS THIS, EVEN
TODAY --

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:08.128
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO LIVE THERE.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.730
IT'S A NICE PLACE, BUT IT'S NOT
A PLACE LIKE YOU,

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.698
IT'S NOT LIKE BEL AIR, COME ON.

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.567
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE THAT
BUILT VALUES.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.569
WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
IMAGINE GROWING UP --

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.870
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BLACK
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT BUILD VALUES.

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:19.439
MILLIONS OF THEM.

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:19.873
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IMAGINE GROWING UP
KNOWING THAT YOU AS AN AMERICAN.

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:23.076
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.645
&gt;&gt; AS A GI WHO FOUGHT
IN WORLD WAR II.

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:25.646
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:30.617
&gt;&gt; COULDN'T BUY INTO THAT
BECAUSE YOU WERE LESS.

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:33.053
&gt;&gt; IT WAS UNFAIR, IT WAS
UNFAIR.

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:33.887
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE RESIDUE OF THAT
CONTINUES TODAY.

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.955
&gt;&gt; THE RESIDUE.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:35.889
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT IS WHITE
PRIVILEGE.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:38.892
&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT'S WHITE
PRIVILEGE --

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:41.028
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S AN
EXCUSE. I'M SAYING IT EXISTS.

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:41.495
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHITES DIDN'T HAVE IT
AS BAD AS BLACKS. FINE.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:42.729
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S IT.

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.331
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY.

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.000
&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS.

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.168
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT.

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.837
LET ME REPEAT THIS AND I'LL DO
IT SLOWLY.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.240
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT.

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:53.774
&gt;&gt; SO EVEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
IT.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.008
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:58.412
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WORK HARD, IF YOU GET
EDUCATED, IF YOU'RE AN HONEST

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:03.851
PERSON, YOU CAN MAKE IT IN
AMERICA.

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:07.087
&gt;&gt; IF YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE PEOPLE ARE, POVERTY IS

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.921
ENDEMIC.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:08.622
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S HARDER
TO WORK HARD.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.090
IT'S HARDER TO GET AN EDUCATION.

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:16.129
&gt;&gt; IT'S HARDER -- HEY, IT WAS
HARDER FOR ME THAN THE WHITE GUY

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.130
IN GARDEN CITY.
IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:20.167
YES, IT'S HARDER IF YOU'RE A
GHETTO KID.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.734
YES.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:21.969
BUT CAN YOU DO IT? YES.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.070
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES YOU CAN.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:28.108
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALSO WIN THE HUNDRED
YARD DASH ON ONE LEG.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:28.642
&gt;&gt; OH STOP.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT'S HARDER.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.877
&gt;&gt; JUST STOP. ALRIGHT.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.177
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST -- ALL I'M ASKING
IS THIS. HERE'S ALL I'M ASKING.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.513
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:35.382
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE'S ALL I'M ASKING
BECAUSE THIS WOULD, I THINK, GO

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.651
A LONG WAY WHAT'S A HUGE RACIAL
ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.086
JUST AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT.
NO BODY'S BLAMING YOU --

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:41.288
&gt;&gt; EVERY FAIR PERSON
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, AND
I'VE SAID

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:48.161
IT MANY TIMES ON THE FACTOR, THE
HIGHEST RATED CABLE NEWS SHOW

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.029
IN THE WORLD, ALRIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH JESUS.

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:53.066
&gt;&gt; THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE
IT HARDER.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.901
&gt;&gt; Jon: SOMEBODY HASN'T SEEN
MEGYN KELLY YET.

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:55.002
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.770
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHE'S CRUSHING YOU,
DUDE. SHE'S CRUSHING YOU.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:57.905
&gt;&gt; NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE MISLEADING
THIS AUDIENCE.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:00.274
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHE'S CRUSHING YOU.

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.108
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE MISLEADING.

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:01.942
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT. ALL I'M SAYING
IS --

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:03.076
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE THE SANITIZER
AGAIN.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.011
&gt;&gt; YES. YOU ADMIT.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:04.711
SO, HERE'S MY POINT.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:05.979
SO, WE'VE COME TO AGREEMENT.

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:10.317
YOU ADMIT THAT WHITE PRIVILEGE
EXISTS AND WHILE IT'S NOT AN

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.418
EXCUSE, IT'S A REALITY.

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:15.422
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T EXIST TO ANY
EXTENT WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:19.259
KEPT BACK BECAUSE OF THEIR COLOR
OR PROMOTED BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:19.927
COLOR.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.495
LOOK YOU AND I ARE LUCKY GUYS.

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:25.199
WE MADE IT, WE WORKED HARD.

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.567
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE'RE WHITE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, WAIT. WELL --

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.269
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU THINK I'M SITTING
HERE BECAUSE I'M WHITE.

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.271
WHAT ARE YOU A MORON.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:35.008
I'M SITTING HERE BECAUSE I'M
OBNOXIOUS, NOT BECAUSE I'M

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:35.843
WHITE.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.378
&gt;&gt; NO, LISTEN TO ME. THE POINT
IS THIS.

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:43.283
WHEN YOU, WHEN YOU TRY AND
REDUCE IT TO BEING SOLELY ABOUT

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:43.817
THAT, ABSOLUTELY.

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:45.185
BUT MY POINT IS THIS.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:48.121
WOMEN FACE THIS AND MINORITIES
FACE IT.

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:53.193
THEY HAVE TO MAKE STRATEGIC
CALCULATIONS IN THEIR LIVES THAT

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.028
WHITE GUYS NEVER HAVE TO MAKE.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.097
&gt;&gt; WE NEVER HAVE TO, WE NEVER
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.867
WALKING DOWN CERTAIN STREETS
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO CAT

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.134
CALL US.

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:04.972
WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF
WHEN WE MOVE INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:05.606
WE'RE GOING TO BE ACCEPTED,
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.274
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:11.044
&gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT, I DID.

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:13.046
IF I HAD TO MOVE INTO A
NEIGHBORHOOD TO BE ACCEPTED.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.047
I WASN'T ACCEPTED ANYWHERE. LOOK
YOU'RE GENERALIZING.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:15.315
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:18.285
&gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS YOU'RE PROMOTING VICTIMHOOD.

00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:24.558
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.759
&gt;&gt; YES, YES, YES, YES, YES.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:26.994
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT. WHAT YOU CALL
VICTIMHOOD, WHAT I'M SAYING IS

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:27.561
BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT REALITY
THAT GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.428
HEALING THE RESENTMENT.

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.063
&gt;&gt; I ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORICAL
REALITY.

00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:32.266
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND JUST, AND LET'S, SO
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.235
WHY SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT?

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:38.005
WHY IS IT THAT WHITE PEOPLE GET
SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THIS?

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.407
I'M NOT SAYING THAT LIFE ISN'T
HARD.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.910
MIDDLE CLASS WHITE GUYS THAT
ARE WORKING HARD TO DO WHAT THEY

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:45.245
CAN AND LOOK AND GO I'M NOT
GETTING ANY PRIVILEGE.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.747
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.283
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.517
BROUGHT HERE.

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.887
THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO IMMIGRATE
HERE TO GET THAT BETTER LIFE.

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:58.926
AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR
COUNTRY'S HAD A PROBLEM WITH

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.027
THAT AND WE CAN MOVE --

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.997
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHO
ARE FAIR MINDED.

00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:07.367
BUT YOU DON'T THEN TAKE THAT AND
THEN CONDEMN THE MODERN SOCIETY

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:07.868
BECAUSE OF IT.
&gt;&gt; jon: NOBODY'S CONDEMNING.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:08.869
&gt;&gt; YES YOU ARE.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:11.305
IT'S WHITE PRIVILEGE THAT MAKES
YOU SUCCESSFUL.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.507
I EVEN HEARD THAT OVER HERE.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.541
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST SAID THAT'S NOT.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:15.742
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT A
WOMAN IT'S -- COME ON.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:18.812
&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL
CALL IT, I'LL CALL IT THIS AND

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:20.280
IT'S A WORD I THINK
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:20.681
A FACTOR.

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:21.381
IT'S A FACTOR.

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:22.115
&gt;&gt; A FACTOR.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:22.950
&gt;&gt; IT'S A FACTOR.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.818
&gt;&gt; I'LL GIVE YOU THE FACTOR
BUSINESS.

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:25.652
&gt;&gt; YOU DID. YOU'RE
GIVING ME THE FACTOR.

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:32.292
COMMON CAUSE. THAT'S IT. THAT'S
ALL.

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:38.599
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; SO WE'RE OKAY.

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:41.301
&gt;&gt; ARE WE ON THE AIR?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.237
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR THE

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:43.737
WHOLE TIME. LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.805
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:48.909
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS WAS, THIS WAS A
BEAUTIFUL MOMENT IN

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:55.148
HEALING BETWEEN NOT JUST BLACK
AND WHITE, JEW AND IRISH,

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:55.782
TALL AND SHORT.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:56.583
THIS WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT.

00:11:56.617 --> 00:12:00.487
&gt;&gt; YEAH. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW,
STEWART?

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.355
ARE YOU HAPPY?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.758
&gt;&gt; HAPPINESS IS NOT WHAT COMES
BEHIND ME.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.060
BUT LET ME SAY THIS.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:08.495
YOUR HUMILITY HAS MOVED ME.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:09.696
&gt;&gt; HA HA HA.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.267
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIKE POPE FRANCIS
THAT HAS TAKEN THE CATHOLIC

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.169
CHURCH INTO AN ERA OF
ACCEPTANCE AND HUMILITY.

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:16.737
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.542
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU, YOU BILL O'REILLY
CAN LEAD THE FLOCK OF THE FOX

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.242
FEARFUL TO A BETTER PLACE.

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:28.382
[LAUGHTER]
I BELIEVE YOU IN.

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:32.953
[APPLAUSE]
THE BOOK IS CALLED "KILLING

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:35.122
PATTON," AND I'M SURE YOU'VE
SOLD A LOT.

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.791
&gt;&gt; NO WHITE PRIVILEGE IN THE
BOOK.

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:39.593
&gt;&gt; Jon: BILL O'REILLY, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:40.627
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT.
