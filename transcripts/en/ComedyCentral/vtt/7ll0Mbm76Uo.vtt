00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't feel guilty
about my coffee.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.536
I don't feel guilty.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.006
It's the same thing I was
saying the other day about,

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
you know, I could for
the cup of coffee a day,

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.143
all the things you could do.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I'm like, I look forward
to that coffee so much.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.114
- Mmm-hmm.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't care that
it's a waste of money.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.386
I don't care that I
give Starbucks $4.87

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.388
at least twice a day for a drink

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.624 align:start position:0%
that costs them less than
seven cents to make. (laughing)

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
And creates garbage
for the world.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.294 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, everything about
it is just disgusting

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:32.032
and I really loath myself
when I throw that empty cup

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.333
in the trash.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.902
But when I get that cup,
it's like I get a high.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
I get so excited,
it's worth it to me.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.907
- But that's why you look
what's worth it to you.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.276
(rock music)

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.580 line:0%
- What did you learn in your
research for this book that,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.184 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
what's like a nugget that
maybe I can take into my life

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
and our listeners
can take into theirs?

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.290
Just some money advice, that's
simple and not overwhelming.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.126
- Well, ah, this is gonna
be slightly overwhelming.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.428
- Okay.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.662
That's not what I asked for,

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.663
and it's not what
I paid you for.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.497
- Yeah, sorry.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.066
Oh my god!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.900
Oh no!

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.271
I only came on here cause I'm
being financially blackmailed.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.872
(laughing)

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.908
Oh god!

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.843
So yeah,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.312
so what I did when
I was starting, was,

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.147
and I know you just said
you don't look at anything,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.916
so I'm really sorry
to stress you out.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.350
- I don't.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.786 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I printed out my bank
statements for the whole year.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.121
Printed 'em out.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then, cause
they do it by month,

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.560
and then I went through
them with a highlighter

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.797
and I highlighted stuff
that seemed insane to me.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.133 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I would be like,
well that's very high.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
Or I would be like,
wait a minute,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.370
why is my car payment so much?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.207 align:start size:84% position:16%
Or why is, you know,
this kinda thing.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.643 align:start size:97% position:3%
I realized I had two
subscriptions to something,

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.979
and I was like, well I
don't need two of those.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.581 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Right.
- So I drop one.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:55.849
One thing I noticed was

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.951
I was paying a lot
for parking, in LA.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.053
And I was like, do I really?

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.822
I would run into a store for
15 minutes, pay for four hours.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.724
It's like, no, don't do that.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.494 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I went through and then
I made a list of what,

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:11.898 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I hate this
sort of generalized
information that's like,

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start size:88% position:13%
don't buy a latte,
don't buy avocado toast,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.602
because that doesn't
apply to everyone.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.237
So I was like, you
can have a latte,

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.572 align:start size:84% position:16%
but go through your
bank statements

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:23.209
and notice what is too
much for you, personally.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.410
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.579 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'll buy coffee
every day and/or make,

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.848
You know, coffee's
important to me.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.483
But I'm gonna,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:35.054 line:0%
But I was like, parking is not
necessary in this situation.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.024
Or like, drive around
for another second,

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.926
and look for an open spot.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.895
Or like,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.565
you know, oh well I
looked and was like,

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
oh my god, my car
insurance is so high.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.968 align:start size:81% position:19%
So then I left
that car insurance

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.537
and looked for a better deal.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.871 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just things where I wouldn't
have ever looked at it.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.940
- Just seeing it in front of you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.241
I know.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.709
- There was one month, I
talk about in the book,

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.345 align:start size:94% position:6%
where I bought $600
worth of stuff on Amazon.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.313
What?!

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.981
What was that, why?

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:02.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- So I went through

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.784
and was like, oh Jesus,

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.653
I didn't need this, I didn't
need this, I didn't need this.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.755
And I was like, okay, I was,

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
whatever I was
uncomfortable with,

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.625
I could see it in front of me.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.327
- I know, that's a good point.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.396 align:start size:97% position:3%
Your spending is certainly,
- It's horrible.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.465
- based on your mood
and your thoughts and,

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.834
The other day I went shopping
and I bought like one shirt

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.370 align:start size:84% position:16%
and my mood was
instantly elevated.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.605
The person I was with was like,

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:26.873
what just happened to you?

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.141
And I was like, I
bought something.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.342
- Mmm-hmm.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:32.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And I'm trying to,
you know, do Marie Kondo

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.515
and get crap out of my life
and not have any more things.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.016
But it truly is like,

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.786
buying things makes you
feel good sometimes.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.054
- Yeah.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.488
- I'm trying to get
it out of my system.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.225 align:start size:88% position:13%
You said something about
the coffees, I get,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.061 align:start size:84% position:16%
I spend $16 on coffee
a day, everyday.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.196 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Is that for four cups?
_ I don't care.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.297
Yeah.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.565 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Right.
- It's like three.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.366
It's like maybe two
or three Starbucks,

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.068
at least two, everyday.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But if you're okay
with that, then whatever.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.404
- I'm so, it brings me joy.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.672 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Right.
- And you know what, Gaby?

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.875
I often say to myself,
what if I die tomorrow?

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like what are we saving for?
- Yeeah.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I don't think the world
is going that great,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.816
and I don't trust
that even my money

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.384
is gonna be in the
banks when I want it,

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
so I'm kind of like,
let me just spend it up.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.788 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh you're me--
- There's a part of me

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.691 align:start size:97% position:3%
that vacillates between
spend it all, or save it all,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.227
and so I can pay for my,

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.895
- You're me in season one.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.163
- Really?

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.698
- Yeah, that's what
I came into it with.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.933
- God.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:27.867
- And my dad, my
parents are like,

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.068
can't take it with you, man,

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.803
cause they're like
baby boomer, hippies.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:31.838
- That's what my dad says.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.072
- Yeah.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.007
- And then the next
day it'll be like,

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.074
well we are broke, Nikki,

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.009 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I'm just like,
- Yes.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.044
- Pick a lane, mom and dad.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.545
What are we?

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:43.416
- My mom says often, oh, well
you're our retirement plan.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.351 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah.
- Which is a nightmare.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.853
- Oh I say that to my
parents all the time,

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.488
and I hold it over their head.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.390
It's kinda nice to be,

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.395
like I'm making enough money
now that I feel like have,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.197
I'm buying my, I often,

00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.932
oh this sounds so bad.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.167
- What?

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.602
- But the fact that I
can help my parents out

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:03.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
if they're in a financial
situation right now,

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.872
feels so good to me.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.407
- Yeah.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:09.676
- And not because they're
gonna be happy and secure,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.644
but like, I told you.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.545
- Yes!

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:13.780
Yes!

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.447
I feel that too.
- That's not nice.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.248
- I told you so.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.683
And then I'm the parent.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.718
- Oh you wanted me
to be a teacher?

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.253
Did ya?
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.522
- Is that what you, that was
your big sight for me, mom?

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.257
Was to be an English professor?

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.025 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Well guess who wouldn't
be going out to,

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:29.762 line:0%
not that mom demands
these things from me,

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:31.164
and wants me to buy her stuff.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.999 align:start size:97% position:3%
My mom would be happy shopping
and eating at Goodwill

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.833
the rest of her life.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:34.667
Yes I said eating.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:35.501
(laughing)

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.203
But,

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.671
But,

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.573
I do feel,

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:42.608
I feel great, being able to,

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.311
to, being rich.

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.746
- Yes.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And being able to buy
things for the people I love.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.083
- Yes.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:50.950
- So that they, so I
can buy their love.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.519
- Yeah, I mean, yes.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.122 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well I did a book tour
for the first book.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.926
And we weren't going to South
Florida where my parents are.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.797 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I flew them to the
Boston and New York events.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.999
And put them up in a hotel.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.902
And they, when they got
there, they were like,

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:11.371 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's so nice that your
publisher did this.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.239
And I was like, I did this!

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.507
I did this!

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.677
And they were like, oh
my god, you did this?

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.512 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So nice.
- And I was like, yes!

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.481
Yes I fucking did!

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.917
And they were like, I
mean I think they are,

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
not slightly uncomfortable,
but they kinda,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.655
I think they've lost the power.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:30.923
- Yeah.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.192
- So, then when I went
home for Thanksgiving,

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.261 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was like I'm
staying in an Airbnb.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.497
And they were like, wait what?

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:40.500
And I was like, I will be by
the beach, if you need me.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.568 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I am not staying
in the house.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.837
And they were upset.

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.038
- I think that is such,

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.874 align:start size:84% position:16%
that is what my
therapist taught me

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.209
is one of the greatest
boundaries you can have

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.911 align:start size:84% position:16%
is not staying at home
with your parents,

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.745
- Yes.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.147
- When you go home.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.415 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's such a power move
- Because it's a cluster fuck.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.283
- And it protects
you from so much.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.051 align:start size:81% position:19%
They're gonna take
offense to it.

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.586 align:start size:81% position:19%
But in the end,
it really protect,

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.289
and I don't do it, I stay
at home with my parents.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.558
And I do the opposite of like,

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.593 align:start size:84% position:16%
yeah my room's trash
but guess what?

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.862 align:start size:84% position:16%
I pay for everything
when I'm home.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yes.
- And we eat out constantly.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.132
You eat out more in one week,

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.600 align:start size:84% position:16%
then you do in a whole
year when I'm home.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.269
So my room's gonna be a mess

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.504 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you're not gonna say
anything about it to me, Mom.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.573
It's like you're buying,

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.641
- Freedom, it's freedom.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.675
- You're buying freedom.

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.577 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it's,
- It's complete freedom.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:27.814 align:start size:81% position:19%
- And I always
question if I was,

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.782 align:start size:94% position:6%
because I have been
broke and relied on them,

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.617
and it wasn't good
for our relationship.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.153
Not that this is even good
for our relationship either.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.088
Me feeling like I have
some sort of upper hand,

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.323
because I'm paying for things.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.558
Cause they're not
even asking for it.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.928
But it just, I don't
know what my point is.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.095
My point is,

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:45.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No I mean, I
think I would have,

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.699
They're a lot, my parents.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.702 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I think I would
have been very,

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.071 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think it would have damaged
our relationship further,

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.840
for me to stay in the house.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.408
And so, and then
they were upset,

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.510
and they have no boundaries.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.679
Them and my sister
have no boundaries.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.615
It's like very weird what
they talk about and are,

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.116
and I kinda have pulled back.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:06.652 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then the family
narrative is, Gaby's a bitch.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.321
But so, I like,

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I was like, this
is the craziest,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.093 align:start position:0%
is I said, they were upset that
I was staying at the Airbnb

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.628
and I said, well that's fine,

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:20.399
I'm, you know, gonna be in
your city, in an Airbnb,

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.667
if you wanna see me,

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.769
I'm so happy to spend
every second with you.

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.271
- Wow.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.973
- If you don't wanna see
me, I'll have a vacation.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.107
They lost it.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.575
And then I was like,

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is the healthiest
boundary, one.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.514 align:start size:88% position:13%
And two, I realized that
they want to see you

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.781
more than you want to see them.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.016
- Yes.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.284
- So you have the
power (laughs).

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.318
- It's really good
that you did that

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.486
and not a lot of people do that.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:41.954
And if you're listening at home

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.689
and you just got done with
the holidays and you're like,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.625 align:start size:84% position:16%
I could never do
that, yes you could.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.126
- Yes.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:49.095
- You don't have to go home
and stay with your family,

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.897 align:start size:84% position:16%
when you are going
home for the holidays.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:52.398
- If you have money, yes.
- You can get a hotel.

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:53.799 line:0%
Yes, of course.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.334 line:0%
But you could even
stay with a friend.

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.202 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Yes.
- You don't have to

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.403
go back home.

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:59.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's nothing,
there's no contract.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.940
We all just assume,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.942
we all just blindly go,

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.845
yeah I'm gonna stay in
my old childhood bedroom.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.647
None of that has
to happen, and yes,

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.081 align:start size:94% position:6%
they will be disappointed,
and they'll be like,

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.383
what does this mean?

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
It doesn't,
- Then use my line.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:14.053
Say, I'll be in your same city.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:17.924
I'm happy to spend as much
time with you as you'd like.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.092
If you're that upset with me
and you don't want to see me,

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
I understand and I'll
hang out with my friends.

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:22.929
- It's a good line.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.130
- Ughhh.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:24.931 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't know
how to do, I mean,

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.365
I did it one time.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.601
I went back and got a hotel.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.237
And I never did it again,
cause I'm always like,

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.372
I just wanna save the
money and stay at home.

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.574
But I think you're right,

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.275 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the end it's
just better to have,

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.444
- It's so guilty.
- those boundaries.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.613
- That's why you look at
what's worth it to you.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:41.547
- Yeah.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.182
- And then if having, you know,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.819 align:start size:97% position:3%
two Dropbox accounts, which
I did, and I was like,

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.554
why don't I just
use Google Drive?

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.488
- Okay.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.823
- And you get rid of 'em.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.425
And then that's the equivalent,

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.227
that's like a 9.99
payment a month.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:58.297
- Yeah, I don't have, I will
never have expensive handbags,

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.131 align:start size:81% position:19%
cause most of them
- Right!

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.366
- are made of leather

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.734
and I don't believe
in leather goods.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.668 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right, it doesn't matter.
- But also because

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.203
I've never cared about leather,

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.639 align:start size:94% position:6%
I've never cared about
handbags, I've just never.

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.408
And I want to.

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:11.210 align:start size:88% position:13%
I wanna be a girl who
cares about nice things.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.447
But my bag is always a
tote, a disgusting tote.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.915
(laughing)

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.916 align:start size:97% position:3%
A disgusting tote that you get
- Right you just look at--

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.417
in a gift bag.

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.652
- That's why a lot of money
advice is too generalized.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
You wanna look at
what matters to you.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.422
- Okay.

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.357 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And what matters to
each person is different.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:27.393
- So the coffee a day thing,

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:28.561
don't have shame
about the things

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.162 align:start size:84% position:16%
that actually really
matter to you,

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.230
that you're spending money on.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.732 align:start size:72% position:28%
- And,
- That's just.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.368
- A lot of the shaming stuff
is specifically towards women.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
They'll be like,
don't get a manicure.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.671
Don't get your hair dyed.

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.905
And it's like, oh I'm sorry,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
are you gonna tell dudes
not to buy sneakers?

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:42.475
Like do you know what I mean?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.377
It's all directed at women.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:48.447 align:start position:0%
- I want to not get my hair
done, or nails done, ever again.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.016
I'm so tired of it,

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.751
and I resent men that they
don't have to do it, Gaby.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.219
- They don't have to do it.

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:54.854 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's that picture of
Beyonce, very dressed up,

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.355
and Ed Sheeran wearing jeans.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.723 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I've never loved anything
more than that picture.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:58.591
(laughing)

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.926
(rock music)
