00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. So we've got our spring with our mass and it's bouncing up and down.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the spring starts from up here—the mass starts from up here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This would correspond to the mass fully compressed with no velocity

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because it's right at the top of its trajectory.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well after 7.5 seconds, we've made some common sense arguments

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to show that it has completed a few full cycles and then wound up here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Going through the equilibrium position, going upwards with maximum speed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But sometimes common sense isn't enough.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So my question is, what is the mass' position after 7.2 seconds?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The only information I am giving you is that the period is 2 seconds.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The mass starts from here at the top of its trajectory

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when we're just about to release it and then it bounces up and down.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what's the mass' position after 7.2 seconds?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I want you to write this in terms of Xmax. So enter you answer here.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Be really careful with this π/2. Be careful with which trig function you use. Good luck.
