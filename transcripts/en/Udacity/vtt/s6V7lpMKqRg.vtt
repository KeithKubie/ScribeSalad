As we just saw, if Grant invests $10,000 at a 3% annual rate, compounded twice

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:14.650
a year. Then in one year, there will be $10,302.25 in his account. Now, is this

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.751
more or less than Grant would have if interest was compounded only once a year?
