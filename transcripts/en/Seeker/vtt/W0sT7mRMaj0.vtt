00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:08.075
The sun is slowly killing you, and so are
those UV beds you lay on to darken your skin

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.214
tone before Prom.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:19.175
What can you do about it?!

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:23.575
You've probably seen this viral video in all
the dark corners of the web this week, showing

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.425
what the sun has done to seemingly beautiful
skin.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:31.964
It's shocking, but let's add a little context
to this random "scientific" video.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:37.345
Ultraviolet light damages all human skin,
dark, fair, and all the colors in-between;

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:43.545
the reason we even HAVE skin color is an evolutionary
response to sunlight damaging human skin.

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:47.335
First, what you're seeing in this video is
the reflection of UV light.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:49.185
Ultraviolet light works the same as any other
light.

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:52.925
It's either absorbed or reflected -- darker
colors absorb more than lighter.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:57.445
What the camera is showing us, is where the
skin is absorbing or reflecting more UV light.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:01.396
The dark spots are where the UV light isn't
bouncing back at the camera.

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:06.325
UV light is part of the light spectrum, and
though it's just outside the visible spectrum

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:11.505
for humans, if aliens were to show up tomorrow,
they might see us the way this camera does!

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.465
Some of those freckles, blemishes and spots
revealed by the camera are pockets there because

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.395
the skin is under attack.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.925
When UV light hits the skin it can be reflected
by our outermost layer of skin, the stratum

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:23.925
corneum.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:27.855
It that doesn't catch the radiation, the rays
hit the inner layer of skin, the epidermis

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.045
where it encounters that melanin packaged
within melanosomes.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:35.915
When skin is exposed to the ultraviolet rays
in sunlight, it darkens, or tans.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.675
All skin regardless of color, tans.

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.865
More melanin scatters more of the damaging
UV rays.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:45.495
Melanin in the skin is produced by melanocytes
located in the epidermis.

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:51.285
And it comes in the form of two pigments the
brown eumelanin and a yellow and red phaeomelanin!

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:55.125
Dark-skinned humans produce melanin all the
time, while lighter-skinned people produce

00:01:55.125 --> 00:02:00.695
it as needed.The melanin is evolution's way
of scattering the rays of UV light before

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:04.425
they can harm your DNA, since we no longer
have dark body hair to protect us.

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:08.965
If our skin didn't do this, the UV radiation
would get through, corrupt our DNA, and cause

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:11.254
cancer before we could reach breeding age.

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:15.275
There were probably human ancestors that didn't
tan -- and thus they weren't able to pass

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:16.995
on their genes as efficiently.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:21.275
Sunburns are radiation burns from overexposure
to ultraviolet radiation.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:26.635
It turns red because your body is trying to
heal the damage and sending blood to the area.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:30.855
The burn isn't going to protect you from anything,
neither will a tan, really.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:34.935
In the end, ALL sun exposure results in UV
light impacting your skin.

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:36.025
It is never ending.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.465
If it's cloudy, there's UV.

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:41.505
When it's snowy the UV can reflect off the
snow and cause even MORE problems.

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:43.725
When you're in a pool or ocean?

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:44.725
Yep.

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:45.725
UV.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.835
Light-skinned people are most susceptible
to skin cancers because they have to make

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:50.355
up for not having the melanin in the first
place.

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:55.595
Darker skinned people scatter more of the
UV rays naturally, and therefore have significantly

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:59.465
lower incidences of skin cancer, according
to the CDC[a].

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:03.625
Obviously, you can use sunscreen, which contains
organic and inorganic chemicals to block the

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.105
UV rays that cause cancers.

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:08.205
Some of the molecules absorb the rays and
release the energy as heat.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:12.845
However, a new study from the American Chemical
Society found an overabundance of sunscreen

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:15.245
in the oceans frequented by beachgoers.

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:20.285
The titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles
in the creams and lotions were reacting with

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:27.205
UV rays and creating hydrogen peroxide toxins
that kill algae and phytoplankton -- the lifebloods

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.725
of ocean ecosystems.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:30.735
It's a lose-lose.

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:33.775
Though it's better to wear it to protect yourself.

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:35.075
Maybe we should just go to a movie.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.575
In the end, this viral video does NOT show
us where people will be getting cancer.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:43.925
It's revealing bits of our skin's protective
layer which absorb or reflect light.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:46.295
It's stuff we don't normally see, but it's
always there.

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:50.325
How does it make you feel to know every moment
you spend in sunlight is hurting your body?

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:54.355
Warm up the comments with your own sunshiney
opinions and thanks for stopping by DNews.
