00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:02.469
- We are asked what is the distance

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.160
between the following points.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.381
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:10.433
There's multiple ways to think about it.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.925
The way I think about it
is really to try to draw

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.800
a right triangle where these points,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.881
where the line that connects
these points is the hypotenuse

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.462
and then we can just use
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:24.220
Let me show you what I am talking about.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.137
Let me draw a right triangle, here.

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.264
That is the height of my right triangle

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.847
and this is the width
of my right triangle.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.772
Then the hypotenuse will
connect these two points.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.441
I could use my little
ruler tool here to connect

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.024
that point and that
point right over there.

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:47.191
I'll color it in orange.

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.309
There you have it.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.478
There you have it.

00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:53.302
I have a right triangle
where the line that connects

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:57.361
those two points is the
hypotenuse of that right triangle.

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.861
Why is that useful?

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:00.802
From this, can you pause
the video and figure out

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.537
the length of that orange
line, which is the distance

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:06.273
between those two points?

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:09.405
What is the length of this red line?

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:11.567
You could see it on this grid, here.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.354
This is equal to two.

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.957
It's exactly two spaces, and
you could even think about it

00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.391
in terms of coordinates.

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.619
The coordinate of this point up here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.036
is negative five comma eight.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.751
Negative five comma eight.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.334
The coordinate here is
X is four, Y is six.

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:33.825
Four comma six, and so
the coordinate over here

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:37.992
is going to have the same
Y coordinate as this point.

00:01:39.494 --> 00:01:41.413
This is going to be comma six.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:43.134
It's going to have the same
X coordinate as this point.

00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:45.560
This is going to be
negative five comma six.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.362
Notice, you're only
changing in the Y direction

00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:50.700
and you're changing by two.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.612
What's the length of this line?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.884
You could count it out, one, two, three,

00:01:55.884 --> 00:01:59.171
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:01.752
It's nine, or you could even say hey look,

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:04.576
we're only changing in the X value.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:06.186
We're going from negative five,

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.076
X equals negative five, to X equals four.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:11.480
We're going to increase by nine.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.620
All of that just sets us up so that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.605
we can use the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.772
If we call this C, we know
that A squared plus B squared

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:25.290
is equal to C squared, or we
could say that two squared ...

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.834
Let me do it over here.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.996
Use that same red color.

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:33.079
Two squared plus nine
squared, plus nine squared,

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.930
is going to be equal to
our hypotenuse square,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.488
which I'm just calling C, is
going to be equal to C squared,

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:41.636
which is really the distance.

00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:43.400
That's what we're trying to figure out.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.567
Two squared, that is four,
plus nine squared is 81.

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:53.901
That's going to be equal to C squared.

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:56.568
We get C squared is equal to 85.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.847
C squared is equal to 85 or C

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.423
is equal to the principal root of 85.

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:06.916
Can I simplify that a little bit?

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:07.930
Let's see.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.063
How many times does five go into 85?

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:14.146
It goes, let's see, it goes 17 times.

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.857
Neither of those are perfect squares.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:19.997
Yeah, that's 50 plus 35.

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:22.284
Yeah, I think that's about
as simple as I can write it.

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:23.960
If you wanted to express it as a decimal,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.321
you could approximate it by
putting this into a calculator

00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.100
and however precise you want
your approximation to be.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.814
That over here, that's
the length of this line,

00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:33.358
our hypotenuse and our right triangle,

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.056
but more importantly for
the question they're asking,

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:37.889
the distance between those points.
