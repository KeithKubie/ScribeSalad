00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:14.420 align:start position:0%
700 megabytes so you could see that
could<00:15:12.809><c> be</c><00:15:12.870><c> a</c><00:15:12.959><c> hurdle</c><00:15:13.230><c> for</c><00:15:13.259><c> acquisition</c><00:15:13.920><c> so</c><00:15:14.250><c> we</c>

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.430 align:start position:0%
could be a hurdle for acquisition so we
 

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.949 align:start position:0%
could be a hurdle for acquisition so we
like<00:15:15.000><c> shortly</c><00:15:15.389><c> after</c><00:15:15.600><c> that</c><00:15:15.720><c> we</c><00:15:15.809><c> had</c><00:15:15.930><c> to</c>

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
like shortly after that we had to
 

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.650 align:start position:0%
like shortly after that we had to
quickly<00:15:16.199><c> pivot</c><00:15:16.500><c> our</c><00:15:16.889><c> central</c><00:15:17.730><c> tech</c><00:15:17.939><c> strategy</c>

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
quickly pivot our central tech strategy
 

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.809 align:start position:0%
quickly pivot our central tech strategy
so<00:15:19.500><c> what</c><00:15:19.649><c> we</c><00:15:19.740><c> did</c><00:15:19.889><c> is</c><00:15:20.069><c> that</c><00:15:20.160><c> we</c><00:15:20.309><c> made</c><00:15:20.579><c> our</c>

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
so what we did is that we made our
 

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:23.269 align:start position:0%
so what we did is that we made our

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
initial download 700 megabytes and what
 

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.340 align:start position:0%
initial download 700 megabytes and what
that<00:15:23.430><c> did</c><00:15:23.579><c> for</c><00:15:23.819><c> us</c><00:15:23.910><c> has</c><00:15:24.059><c> enabled</c><00:15:24.300><c> players</c><00:15:24.899><c> to</c>

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
that did for us has enabled players to
 

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.280 align:start position:0%

that's why we built that technology and
