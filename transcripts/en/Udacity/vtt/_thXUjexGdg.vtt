00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.980
Say you look at just two polygons from the side. A red one and a yellow one.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.050
Because they interpenetrate. The draw order will always be wrong for one pixel

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.855
or another. If the yellow object is drawn first, this upper pixel will have the

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:18.335
wrong order of yellow, then red. If the red object is drawn first, the lower

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:22.895
pixel has the same problem. Red than yellow. For the first answer, with the

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:27.537
yellow object being rendered first, there's no red object for it to blend with.

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:31.699
So this answer is correct. Blending has not been turned off for the yellow

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.714
object since you can see the grid lines through it. So this answer is wrong. The

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:40.066
yellow object blocks the red object at the top so it must have been drawn first

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:45.121
and written to the z-buffer. So this answer is also wrong. The fourth answer is

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.616
correct. The transparency algorithm states that the more distant object, the

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.790
yellow one, is drawn first. Another way to think about it is that you can have

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.323
red over yellow, or yellow over red, but not both at the same time.
