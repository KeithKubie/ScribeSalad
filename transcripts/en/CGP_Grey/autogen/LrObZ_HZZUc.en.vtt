00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:00.969
 City of London (Confidentiality) - Part 

00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.939
 Greater London is known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers and its old markets 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.270
 And its famous bridges. It can be said that it is the financial capital of the world and seat more than eleven 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.550
 * A * people. 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.120
 Moment, what? Eleven thousand? 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.150
 That's true. But London is a different place from London 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.839
 It is also known for its historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers and old markets 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.429
 Its famous bridges are also home to the government, the royal family and seven million people. 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.079
 But if you look at a map of London drawn by a professional map painter this map will contain 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.250
 A space of one square mile in the middle of which is almost - there lies the city of London 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 Within the city named London. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.300
 No matter how confusing the two names are, London has a separate municipality 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 Its municipality, which collects separate taxes to finance police forces, is elected 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.690
 Different laws. 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.010
 Mayor of London has a prestigious title is "Lord Lord of London Honorable" 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.920
 To match his luxurious costume. He also travels with his doctrines and works 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.740
 In the municipal building while the Mayor of London is wearing a formal suit and is traveling by bicycle and working in 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.640
 Office building. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.800
 The city of London has its own flag and logo, which is great for London 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 Which misses the two sad. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.579
 In short, the City of London has the right to act as a State in the United Kingdom 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.350
 Just a city with a strange location. To distinguish, some organizations run the city of London 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.960
 I come from the United Kingdom several hundred years ago. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 How did the United Kingdom end up in the cities of London? Briefly? Because: Romans. 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.080
 Two thousand years ago they came to Great Britain, killed a group of priests and established a site 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.729
 Commercial on the banks of the Thames River. And because they were Roman they did what the Romans did 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.670
 They put laws, increased trade exchange, built temples, public baths, roads, bridges, 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.340
 A wall protects their work. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.460
 The wall from which the city of London remains so far. Although the Romans came and went 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.010
 And the kingdoms of the kingdoms and kingdoms have collapsed, the wall has done its work 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.549
 And the city fever inside. The city ruled itself and dealt commercially with the world to grow richer. 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.549
 A thousand years after the Romans (still a thousand years from now) when William the Conqueror came 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.560
 To Great Britain all opened up and began modern British history 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.570
 The walled city of London found it harder to defeat the peasantry 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.720
 In the open fields. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.580
 So he agreed on the rights and privileges of the people of the city of London they were used to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.869
 As opposed to recognizing him as a new king. 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.549
 Although immediately after negotiations, William built the towers around the city of London 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.319
 Which protected William from the locals at the same time to defend 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.950
 Against the Viking from abroad. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.560
 This was the beginning of a thousand-year tradition in which the royal family renews this approval 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.410
 The city of London has its own place, and its privileged location. It is best to leave it alone 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.319
 With no confidence at the same time. 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.840
 Many members of the royal court believe that the city of London is strong and too rich. They built a capital 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.420
 New near them, called Westminster, to rival the city of London, 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.780
 To try to absorb its power and economic wealth. This was the beginning of the second London. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.630
 Over the centuries, Westminster expanded and merged into neighboring cities 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.630
 To surround the separate city of London within its walls. But people started naming 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 This urban area "London" became officially named when the two cities merged the two cities together 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.200
 Under one municipality and one mayor. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 But the mayor of London still has no powers over the small city of London 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.390
 Which has laws and traditions unmatched anywhere in the country or even the world. 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.879
 For example, the king can not enter the city of London whenever he wants, but it must be 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.160
 The permission is therefore requested from the Lord Mayor at a special ceremony. While it is not legally required, 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910
 But the ceremony is required. 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.489
 The City of London also has its own representative in Parliament and the post of Representative 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.690
 Protection of private city privileges. 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.489
 Because of this, some of the laws adopted by Parliament do not apply to the city of London at times. 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.590
 The most prominent observation is the voting method, which we will discuss in the future. But if you have curiosity, it is possible to say 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.680
 Unlike any other place in the UK, voting in London includes medieval guilds and modern companies. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.060
 Finally, London City owns and also occupies many land and buildings outside 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.129
 Its borders, making it very rich 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.849
 When you start looking for a city logo you will find it in many places, but most 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.580
 Note is the Tower Bridge, which with it is located in "London" but is managed by the City of London, 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.599
 These slogans are everywhere when you link to the city of London and its wealth and independence 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.849
 Making them in a great temptation to proponents of conspiracy theory. Add to that the oldest Masonic forum 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.430
 It will not wait long before the crazy Internet community cries out for clandestine gatherings 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.459
 Which controls the world by making the economy from within the city of London 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.230
 (And do not forget the evil queen that is really behind it all) 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.010
 To put the conspiracy theories aside, the City of London is not an independent nation like 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.890
 The Vatican, no matter how much you read online, is rather a very special site 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.800
 In the UK with a very long and complex history. 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.459
 The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago has now disappeared 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.519
 "London" and the secret city inside are not clear-cut. However, if you visit London next time 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.669
 I passed a small dragon in the street, it is still guarding the entrance to this city 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.520
 Within the city within the state within the state.
