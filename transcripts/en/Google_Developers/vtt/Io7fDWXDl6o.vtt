00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:08.470
ELIZABETH CHURCHILL: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.090
Hello.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.000
Thank you so much for
coming to this session.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.540
I'm Elizabeth
Churchill and I head up

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.060
research for Material Design.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.110
And I'm sure you've been hearing
about a lot of the innovations

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.610
that Material has brought
out recently here at I/O.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.690
And we've done a lot of research
in the background to back up

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.580
much of that innovation.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.160
And what we're going
to do today is just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.850
tell you a little bit about
some of that research.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.940
We're also going to encourage
you to come and talk

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
to us later, and we
will be in Dome F.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.250
Because we're
interested in knowing

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.780
how your integrating research
into your product and design

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.150
system development.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.480
But before I get
going, I want to know

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.280
how many people
out there consider

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.230
themselves to be developers.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.470
Yay.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.110
Welcome.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.820
Thank you for coming.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.910
And how many consider
themselves to be designers?

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.820
And you might have
multiple roles.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.170
Wonderful.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.370
This is great.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.417
Finally, researchers.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.400
Yay, research.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.420
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.470
One of the things we want
to emphasize in this talk,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.220
and that Material is
extremely committed to,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.850
is that we believe the
tight collaboration

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.000
between engineering
and development,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.980
between design and
research, really

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.420
is the key to creating
great user experiences.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.860
And by user experiences I
mean the users of the things

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
that you build, but
also you as users.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
Because in Material, as you will
see and you've been hearing,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.930
we build products for
you so that you can build

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.700
great products for your users.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.990
So I just wanted to
go over a few things

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.230
about Material, which you
may know, just to remind you.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
So the Material Design
system is open source.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.550
It's adaptable, and it helps you
bring high quality experiences

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.560
to your users.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.690
And our aim is to help you
make things that are beautiful,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.210
but that are usable and
useful and also, importantly,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.900
accessible.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.350
We're very committed
to helping you do that.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.060
So Material consists
of components.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.510
And components are
things like buttons,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.320
things like text fields,
and things like tables.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.730
You're familiar with that.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.900
And at this I/O we
have brought Material

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.800
theming into the picture.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.790
And we've heard you
and we have responded

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.710
because we want to make all of
these components customizable,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.660
so that you can adapt
them for your experience,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.330
so that you can have
your brand and your look

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.100
and feel for your users all the
way through, systematically,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.740
from design to code.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.350
So that's very much a key
part of our innovation.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.280
Material also consists of
patterns, patterns like account

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.370
switching, accessing settings,
or handling empty states.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.040
All of this information, these
components, these themes,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.730
and these patterns,
roll up into guidance

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.600
that you can see on
our site are spec.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490
If you have not yet checked
out material.io, please do so.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.470
Please go and have a look.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.860
Check out what we've got
there and send us feedback.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.780
Because a great
part of this talk

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.290
is to remind you
that we can shape

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.380
great experiences for people
with the help of folks

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.364
like you.

00:04:12.364 --> 00:04:13.405
So we need your feedback.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.529
Material also, as
I mentioned, has

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.370
a suite of products and tools
that are designed for you.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.450
One of them is here.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.880
This is Gallery,
and Sara is going

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.630
to be talking about Gallery
in a bit of detail later.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.110
Gallery has also been
launched here I/O

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.270
and, again, we
want your feedback.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.280
Gallery will allow you to take
those components, those themes,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.420
and that guidance and
turn it into reality.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.160
We're really
building these tools

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.800
to build this relationship
and this collaboration,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.028
the deep collaboration between
design and development.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.780
So just as a pause,
this is the outline

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.050
of the kinds of research
we do in this team,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.530
in the Material
experience research team.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.860
The most granular
research is on components,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.540
and Michael is going
to be taking you

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.850
through some of that.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.700
Here we look to make sure
the components really

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.900
are beautiful and usable
and useful and accessible.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.050
The next level of research
is the product research

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.970
on things like Gallery.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.190
And here again we use
interviews and observations,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.580
and we work with folks like
you to make these tools great.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.710
Sara's going to be taking
you through some of that.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.720
Finally, we look at workflow.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.410
Where do all of these
tools fit into your lives

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.380
as designers and developers?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.050
How do you pull these
together to accomplish

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.450
the things you need?

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:01.240
What is the bigger ecosystem of
the idea to design, to develop,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.250
to iterate workflow.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.590
And again, we do interviews,
we do behavioral studies,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.970
we observe folks in workplaces
like where you work.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.850
We do surveys to
try and understand

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.286
where our tools fit in for you
now, how we can improve them,

00:06:21.286 --> 00:06:22.660
and to start to
think about where

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.310
we need to go in the future
as the whole field explores

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.240
and innovates.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.340
And Sara is going to
help you with that.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.350
So with that said, from our
studies with a few users

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.970
to thousands of users, from
our close studies as we talk

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.580
to you to our
surveys, we're going

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.400
to give you a bit of a
flavor of that today.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.380
And I would like to
hand off to Michael,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.390
who's going to talk about
components research.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.630
MICHAEL GILBERT: Well, thank
you for the introduction,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.190
Elizabeth.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.060
And once again,
welcome, everyone.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.560
My name is Michael and I lead
up research on Material System.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.630
So as Elizabeth mentioned,
we do research on everything

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.680
that covers the minor details
of users' experience, all

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.750
the way up to the big picture.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.500
We look at everything from
how things look on the web

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.490
or on your mobile device to
how those things come together

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.760
to form an application or
a brand or an experience.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.530
For today, I'm
going to be focusing

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.810
on two types of research
that we've done,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.980
both examining the components
of a design system.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.910
First I'll go into some detail
on the top-down experimental

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.100
work that we've
done, which looks

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.800
into how the details
of design can really

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.300
impact how your users
interact with your products.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.870
And second, I'll go through some
of the bottom-up experiential

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.700
research that we've
done, focusing

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.870
on those same components, but
also aiming to understand how

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.780
experiences come
together in our products

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.430
and what those experiences
mean to our users.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.590
And by the end, I'm
hoping to give everyone

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.620
a better understanding about
how we do some of the research

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.170
here at Google so you can
take that back and do it

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.170
within your own teams.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.120
But first, a little
background on what

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.610
I mean when I say components.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.740
Elizabeth already
introduced some

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.250
of the components, the
patterns, and the guidelines

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.220
available in Material Design.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.429
Here we have three
examples of abstractions

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.650
of those components.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.929
And just to introduce
them, on the left

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.010
we have the Material FAB, or
the Floating Action Button.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.460
This was introduced in the first
iteration of Material Design

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.910
and since has become one
of its more recognizable

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.340
characteristics.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.280
In the center we have
the Material text field,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.680
and this provides a core means
for users to input content

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.940
into applications.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.540
And on the right. material
Buttons, which provide

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.940
a core means of interacting
with content in applications.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.580
And you probably are all
familiar with these already.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.730
But what I want to
call out here is not

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.880
that these components
are necessarily unique

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.980
or that there are
earth-shatteringly

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.410
critical to any one
single interaction,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.570
but that these components are
a fundamental part of a larger

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.080
experience.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.050
And because of that,
we want to make sure

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.240
that we understand
these components

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.580
at a fundamental level.

00:09:43.077 --> 00:09:44.660
But for now, we're
going to focus just

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.520
on this first one, the
Material text field.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.550
So this is the text field
that we started with.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.030
This was our baseline.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.950
This text field
performed well and it

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.310
aligned with the
original Material vision.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.920
But there was an
opportunity to make sure

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.840
that it worked even better, that
it worked across all devices,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.570
that it worked in both consumer
and enterprise applications.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.390
And when you look at
something like this,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.390
think of all the different
parts that have to come together

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.990
to make a text field.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.630
There is the underline
the indicates

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.380
where the field starts
and where it stops.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.590
There is the label that hints
at what might be typed in there.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.730
And there's the text itself,
once you've entered it.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.610
And of course, there's the
shape of the entire component,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.390
how each of those individual
parameters come together,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.490
and then how they're
used on a page.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.730
So it's clear that
even for a text field,

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.110
there's a lot going
on design-wise.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.230
But really, how many
options could there be?

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.160
Well, it turns out, quite a lot.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.470
And as an aside, I'm
not expecting everyone

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.240
to read through the
actual text on this slide.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.110
I just want to show
a few of the details

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.360
that we're considering here.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.580
So what we're looking at
here is an exploration

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.420
of label placement, as well
as some of the possible values

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.110
and consideration
for label placement.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.900
But we also looked at
things like background fill.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.630
We looked at different
elements of style,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.170
different types of
contrast, and, of course,

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.740
whether there should be
squared or rounded borders.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.120
In the end there were over
140 different variations

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.870
that we looked at in a
couple different contexts.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.760
First, we looked
at simple forms,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.660
which had stubbed content
that was procedurally drawn so

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.240
that we could test a
whole bunch of them.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.200
Second, we looked at real
quote, unquote "forms,"

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.680
which were forms that we
actually took from the wild

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.950
and inserted our
experimental text fields.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.680
And then third, we
looked at complex forms.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.320
And these are forms we
hope you would never

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.740
encounter in nature.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.280
They're unreasonably complex.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.660
But we created them to see how
each text field would perform

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.300
in extreme circumstances.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.110
Would it stand out too much
or would it get lost entirely?

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.980
And we'll show examples
of that one in a minute.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.630
But first, what
does that look like?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.140
This is, ultimately,
a tool that we

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.070
created that would create
each of those forms

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.280
with each of those text
fields, randomly drawing

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.240
the layout, the theme, and
each of the characteristics

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.460
that we had identified.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.890
We then deployed these forms
and a set of large-scale surveys

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.590
so that we could test
both the performance

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.760
of every individual text field,
as well as get an idea of what

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.610
users actually preferred.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.910
And on the right, you can
see the admin interface

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.430
for this tool that we
built. And it's simple,

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.540
but it allows us to zero
in on the types of designs

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.700
that we want to research.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.730
And more importantly, it
provides us with an artifact

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.180
that we can share with the
designers and developers who

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.060
are creating and building
these text fields.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.090
And maybe you're curious
about the complex forms.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.930
Well, this is what I mean
when I say complex forms.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.350
We don't condone
their use in the wild,

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.380
but this is just so you know
the lengths designers will

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.120
go to make sure that every
opportunity is explored.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.800
And they really are something.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.360
What we were able
to do, in the end,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.110
was to create a way for
people to interact with ideas

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.600
rather than products.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.660
And to be clear, we
weren't doing this research

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.040
as a way of telling designers
what products should look like.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.690
We were doing research as a
way of working with designers

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.970
to show them what
parts seem to work

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.390
and what parts might
require caution,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.270
to provide them with the
tools that, ultimately,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.690
can allow us to more
effectively bring our users

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.960
into the conversation.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.710
And this is one example of what
that conversation looks like.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.530
This is what the data actually
is from those text field

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.700
experiments.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.490
And without going into
too many of the details,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.590
I want to show you
how we were looking

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.870
at all the possible text fields,
every possible combination,

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.450
without dropping any
of those possibilities

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.290
because the data
says this or that.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.690
Each step that I'm
showing you here

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.050
involved a process of
working with our team

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.740
to explore the landscape
and to provide our designers

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.290
and engineers with the
tools that they can

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.960
use to create great products.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.690
And here, I'm referring to
research and the artifacts

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.745
from research as
one of those tools.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.410
And here is the before and
after example of what just

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.580
one text field might look
like, given this approach.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.010
Because ultimately
what we aim to do

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:24.410
is to support design that is
more usable, more useful, more

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.410
beautiful, and,
importantly, more

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:32.120
customizable, especially with
today's enhanced Material

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.760
Design system and
the introduction

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.710
of Material theming.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.940
We want to emphasize that the
components are customizable,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.250
and that within that
customize ability

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.370
we've done the legwork to make
sure that those components will

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.520
still work the way
that they should

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.000
and, importantly, that they'll
still look the way that you

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.870
want them to.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.310
So that's a quick look
at some of what we've

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.960
done with the
Material text field,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.400
but let's take a look at
the FAB and the button next.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.080
At the beginning, I
mentioned that we'd

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.130
be looking at both the top-down
experimental research that we'd

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.620
done as well as the bottom-up
experiential research.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.900
And this may look
familiar to many of you,

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.630
this bottom-up research.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.900
It usually involves sitting
down with your users

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.540
across a table,
sometimes in something

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.180
like usability
studies, sometimes

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.660
and things like interviews.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.400
And frequently it
looks a lot like just

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.810
a normal conversation.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.860
But what we try to
do as researchers

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.610
is to make sure that we're
asking the right questions.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.990
And that's not always, how
long does it take 10,000 users

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.490
to click on this?

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.590
Sometimes what we want
to know more about

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.060
is how the users think and
feel about our products

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060
and about interactions.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.940
And because Material Design
is about the performance

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.530
and the usability of components,
but it is also about that look

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.660
and that feel.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.990
So next I'm going to show
three examples to give you

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.069
a sense about how users
feel about these components

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.604
and what that means
for our design.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.010
So this first example is
from a study participant

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.670
who is interacting with
the new Material button.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.660
And she said, "When the boxes
are really bolded like that,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.100
it makes you feel like you're
actually pressing a button."

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.350
And sometimes
something like this

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.420
that happens in the
middle of these interviews

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.690
will make you actually take
a step back and ask yourself,

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.300
what is a button, really?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.460
And, really, what
should a button look

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:58.160
like if we define it by how
it feels when we press it?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.810
Or what should a button look
like if it's trustworthy?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.520
And these aren't just strictly
questions for fun, either.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.270
There's an entire
landscape of what buttons

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:17.650
might look like, of what they
might be, of what is button-y.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.390
And part of the
research we get to do

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.260
is to better understand
that landscape.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.485
And we get to do that by
talking with our users.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.490
And the second example is
from a study participant

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.520
who was interacting with
the Google Material themed

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.590
FAB shown here.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.270
And she said, "The last time
I looked at your email app,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.720
it didn't look as
Googley as this."

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.040
And I love this because when
we actually talk to our users,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.030
we learn about more than
just the components.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.270
We learn about more than
just the interactions

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.520
or the products.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.950
And in this example,
we can clearly

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.760
see how design can impact brand.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.780
But we get a better sense, from
the user's own perspective,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.836
about what seems to
jump out at them.

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:17.120
And in the end, we can
speak more effectively

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.510
about the meaningful
characteristics of brand

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.400
with the designers
and the developers who

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.240
are building these.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.670
And this last example is a
quote from a study participant

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.070
who could use assistive
devices to see,

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.560
but he was actually
legally blind.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.700
And he was interacting with the
Google Material themed extended

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.310
FAB shown on the bottom.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.970
He said, "It actually jumps
out a little bit more,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.010
even without the color.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.120
It pops out.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.280
It just seems more obvious
what's going on there."

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.820
And I think this is one
of the main strengths

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.530
of actually sitting down
and talking with our users.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.750
And the same way we want
to explore how a hundred

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.140
different text fields can
be implemented in a hundred

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.630
different ways,
we want to see how

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.550
these components
in our products are

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.190
encountered by all our users.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.068
It's a different way of looking
at the exact same landscape.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.090
To wrap things
up, I've shown you

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.340
a brief look at how
we've approached

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.910
a couple different
types of research.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.260
First, looking at the Material
text field from the top down,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.970
experimentally.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.710
And second, looking at the Fab
and the button from the bottom

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.620
up.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.900
I'm hoping you can see some of
the similarities of these two

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.580
approaches.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.730
On the one hand, we are
aiming to better understand

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.940
a whole range of
possible expression

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.835
to better support the brilliant
designers and engineers who

00:20:58.835 --> 00:21:01.810
are building Material Design.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.060
And on the other hand,
we're aiming to better

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.710
support our users to make
sure that each component is

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.570
usable, is useful, is
beautiful, no matter

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.030
how it's used or by who.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.860
And last, again,
I'm hoping you might

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.570
be able to take some
of the ideas we've

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.090
talked about here to
be able to do research

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.890
within your own teams.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.770
And with that, I'd like
to thank you for your time

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.870
and welcome Sara
to the stage, who's

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.600
going to be talking a little
bit about designer and developer

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.200
research.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.495
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.170
SARA CAMBRIDGE:
Thank you, Michael.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.780
So as Michael said, I'm Sara.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.050
And I lead research
for Material product.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.510
And what we do is create
products and tools,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.630
resources for designers and
developers just like you.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.950
So Michael shared with you how
we do research with our end

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.530
users so that we can
really understand

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.890
how to make our
components most effective,

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.710
but you are our end users, too.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.630
And designers and
developers is where

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.630
I put my energy to
understanding our products

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.450
and how you're using
them to make them better.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.930
So what I'm going to talk
about is the other two types

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.470
of research Elizabeth
mentioned, the workflow research

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.720
and product research.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.310
And I'll give you
examples of how

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.290
products that have
launched here at I/O

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.760
have been made better
through our research.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.570
So let's start with
workflow research.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.720
This gives us a really
big, broad picture

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.350
for how people creating
digital tools, people like you,

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.740
how you're doing your
work day in and day out.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.780
Usually, how this looks
as I'll interview,

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.750
ideally, designers and
developers who work together.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.920
I'll go to your office.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.430
I'll talk to you about
how you're working.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.960
I want to know all
the tools you're

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.550
using, who you're
collaborating with,

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.160
and, especially, anything that's
a problem in your workflow.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.110
And our goal with
this kind of research

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.840
is to get a big picture
of the bigger problems

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.540
that affect a lot
of people so we

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.030
can prioritize
building tools that

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.470
solve those problems for you.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.860
So this example is
from workflow research

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.130
we did with designers and
developers that work together.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.900
Like I said, we went
to their offices.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.450
And one of the
things we had them do

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.990
is take us through a recent
project from beginning to end.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.200
We had them walk us through
every part of the project, who

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.840
they worked with, what
the tools they were using,

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.970
and especially anything
that was a struggle.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.460
So here's a couple
of examples of how

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.850
people think about their work.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.580
So you can see people
look at their work

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.765
in really different ways.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.340
Whenever I do this
kind of research,

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.330
I want my developer, designer,
and product manager colleagues

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.860
working on those
products to come with me.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.160
Because every one
hears different things,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.310
and different things pop out
at them during the interviews.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.620
So we always do a
debrief where we

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.480
compare notes on what
we heard and what

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.060
was interesting or surprising.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.070
And because this
research was really

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.810
focused on understanding the
UX design process itself,

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.050
we were going to be doing a
timeline of a typical UX design

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.950
project.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.770
And so I had my
colleagues categorizing

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.960
the different phases that
they heard the people we

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.570
talked to went through.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.040
So let me show you
what this turned into.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.800
This is a UX design workflow.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.950
It's also known as a journey
map or experience map.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.340
But what we ended up
with was six phases

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.050
for the design process--

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.820
discovery, initial design,
iterating on the design,

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.670
validating, beginning
building, and then

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.740
the final implementation.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.370
And I'll explain
the structure first,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.370
and then I'll come around
and fill in some detail.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.520
So below that, in
the green to red,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.090
are a single positive
and a negative key moment

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.500
in each phase.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.720
And those were from
stories we literally

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.840
heard from the participants
we talked to that were either

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.420
really meaningful or
were a pattern we heard

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.520
several people talk about.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.060
And then at the bottom, we
had the tasks, pain points,

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.290
and tools.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.020
And this gave us a
really rich range

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.960
of experiences that we heard
different people using.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.630
Now, I took that out to just
simplify it to show you,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.540
but that whole thing
is a big poster that

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.470
hangs in our office.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.220
So for instance, thinking
about the key moments,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.349
often we heard people
get really excited when

00:25:41.349 --> 00:25:42.640
they're starting a new project.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.590
There's a lot of
promise and potential.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.030
But they quickly get overwhelmed
by scope or scope creep,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.385
so that becomes a
negative moment.

00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:51.760
And as you might
imagine, there's

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.580
a lot of interplay between
designers and developers here.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.410
The first one is when, in
the initial design phase,

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.466
when a designer is really
excited about an idea they have

00:26:02.466 --> 00:26:04.090
and they have to go
to their developer,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.030
and the developer says to
them, we cannot build this.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.910
The technical constraints
make this impossible.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.940
So has anybody here ever had
one of those conversations?

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.710
OK, all right.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.670
That's good that we're
resonating with your experience

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.430
as well.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.370
But of course, there's
positive interactions

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.060
between designers and developers
throughout this process.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.550
We definitely have heard
that designers do not

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.480
enjoy making design specs
for handing a project off

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.220
to a developer.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.280
But when that moment comes where
they get to hand off, formally,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.130
to a developer, that's usually
a milestone, a really positive

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.760
milestone in a project.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.040
So that's positive.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.320
And it can go south again,
because what happens

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.020
often is that
developers come back

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.560
later with unexpected
problems due to legacy code

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.990
and the designers
have to step back in,

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.712
often after they've already
moved on to another project.

00:26:55.712 --> 00:26:56.920
So again, is this resonating?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.210
Anybody had this happen?

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:58.810
OK.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.580
All right.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.610
So the whole point of doing
this kind of really deep dive

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.440
into understanding
the practices,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.980
again, is to surface
those problems that

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.836
affect a lot of people so we
can prioritize building them.

00:27:13.836 --> 00:27:15.710
And I just want to take
a minute and define--

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.210
I've mentioned
design specs and I'll

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.800
talk about it more in a minute.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.590
But when I say design
specs, what I mean

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:25.030
are the margins, guidelines,
colors, fonts, and often even

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:30.190
behaviors that designers give to
developers when they're getting

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.160
ready to implement a design.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.410
So another thing that
came out of that research

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.500
is pain points of
designers and developers.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.030
And I'll go through
these with you.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.840
So the key pain points
we heard from designers

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.120
are having to aggregate
feedback from a lot

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.590
of different stakeholders.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.100
Often the feedback is
living in different tools.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.450
Having to prototype motion,
but not having time to do it.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.390
Having to keep track of
different project resources

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.660
that they're going to need at
different phases of the design

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.374
process that often are
living in different places.

00:28:04.374 --> 00:28:06.040
Now, remember this
because I'll show you

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.850
a solution that we came up
with for this in Gallery.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.750
Creating design
specs, as I mentioned,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.920
and then having to share
design assets across their team

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.220
and keep them consistent.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.870
Top pain points we
heard for developers

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.090
was having to solve
for edge cases,

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.870
and often responsiveness
from a singular happy path

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.550
that they're getting
from their designer,

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.410
getting incomplete design specs
or getting ones that are wrong

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.970
or not getting them at all.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:39.320
I've absolutely I've heard
that one a lot as well.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.330
When you have to
create a new component,

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.460
trying to figure out,
am I going to customize

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.320
something that's
existing or build

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.450
something new from scratch.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.550
Getting design changes
late after you've

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.950
started working,
leading to rework.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.830
And finally, having
a lack of context

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.080
of what the intent was
with the design, so not

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.400
knowing what really matters.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.030
So you'll notice with
this kind of list

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.490
that both designers and
developers, both found design

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.230
specs as a real pain point.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.000
So it was this kind
of research that

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.750
let us realize what a problem
this is for both roles,

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.840
and let us prioritize building
a tool that solves this problem.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.440
And that project, as Elizabeth
mentioned, is Gallery.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.450
And I'm going to tell you more
about Gallery in a minute.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.330
But before I do, I'm
going to tell you

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.930
a little bit about the other
type of research I mentioned,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.120
product research.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.740
And this is really
just a big bucket

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.050
for any time we show
you something that we

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.120
want to get your feedback on.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.400
It may be a really
early stage idea

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.230
that we just want
to validate and make

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.960
sure the concept is
sound, or maybe it's

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.080
a refinement of a product we've
already invested a lot of time

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.810
in and we just want to
make sure that it's really

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.690
functioning well for
how you want to use it.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.150
So a lot of people
call this usability,

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.800
but for us, this
type of research

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.380
is doing so much more
than just telling us

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.640
if a product is usable.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.910
So also, let me walk you
through a little bit about how

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.850
I conduct research when
I'm doing product research

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.110
with designers and developers.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.910
So this is one of our
research labs on the left.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.070
Usually I'll bring
somebody into our lab.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.230
I'm meeting with
them one on one.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.610
It's streaming to a room
that my designer, developer,

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.770
and product manager
colleagues are sitting in,

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.810
like the one on the left.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.170
And I'll walk you through some
kind of prototype or beta tool,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.650
and getting your
feedback as we go along,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.660
like what do you like,
what's confusing,

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.460
and especially,
at the end, I want

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.290
to know how does this fit
into your existing workflow.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.800
Is this going to solve
any problems for you?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.140
And then after all that
is done, go back in,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.000
talk to my colleagues,
and we figure out

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.250
what was really
interesting here.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.440
What can we take from
this that we can use

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.080
to make our products better?

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.520
So now I've told
you a little bit

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.320
about how this process works.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.780
Let me walk you through
an example of something

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.590
we learned when we were
doing research with Gallery

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.660
and how that made it better
for the final product.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.940
So has anybody seen a
demo of Gallery in the--

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.940
OK, just a couple folks.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.360
And let me walk you through.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.650
So this is a project
page in Gallery.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.630
And also let me just
give an overview.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.750
Gallery is an online
collaborative tool

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.220
that lets designers share their
designs with other colleagues,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.570
get feedback.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.360
And it also has a
design specs feature

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.340
where they can get the
metadata from the sketch goes

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.070
into an online
way for developers

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.370
to get the code and the values.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.620
And then the developers
also have an access

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.934
to Material components
in that Gallery feature,

00:31:53.934 --> 00:31:55.600
if they're using the
Material components

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.558
when they're designing.

00:31:56.558 --> 00:31:58.994
And it's being demoed
in Dome F over there,

00:31:58.994 --> 00:32:00.160
if you want to check it out.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.680
So we're in a project
called Posivibes.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.650
There's a little description
of the project at the top.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.880
The colored rectangles
are a way for designers

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.390
to collect the
links they're going

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.250
to need at different
stages of the project.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.480
So as I mentioned,
we were solving

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.790
one of the problems we uncovered
in the research with that one.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.340
And then, below
that are basically

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.890
folders and people can organize
them however they want.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.550
And in this case, they're
organized by the device

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.900
that it's being designed for.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.070
So let's say you clicked into
the tablet view from here.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.920
You would see all the screens
better in that tablet.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.410
And if you clicked into
the first screen, then

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.410
you're going to see that
screen in more detail.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.924
Now, at the yellow
box at the top

00:32:42.924 --> 00:32:45.340
you can see all the different
things you can do from here.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.970
You can comment, inspect,
you can share it.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.470
But what's happening
here is someone

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.590
has rolled over the type at
the top, and you can see it's

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.980
got the typeface, the
weight, the color.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.250
All that stuff is right there
for the developer to access.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.000
So that's how it looks now.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.990
And let me show you something
that we were getting feedback

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.050
on a couple of months ago when
we did some research on it.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.550
So this looks a
little bit different

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.383
because it's the older
mock, but you can see

00:33:12.383 --> 00:33:14.850
it's basically the same thing.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:19.070
So in the study, what we did is
we were talking to designers.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.990
We had them use our new
Material theme editor, which

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.320
I hope you've heard about
the Material plug-in

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.090
and we have for Sketch.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.360
And that gives them access to
all these pre-built Material

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.810
components where they can
customize for their own brand.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:38.030
So that the one in the green
bar, the green bottom app bar,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.570
they had customized that in
Sketch and changed the color

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.150
and changed one of
the icons in there.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.995
And then they had
uploaded that to Gallery,

00:33:45.995 --> 00:33:47.870
where they were looking
at what they would be

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.460
sharing with their developers.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.210
So we were wanting to know,
what do you think of this?

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.320
And what we heard from
them, as you can see here,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.850
when you roll over that bottom
app bar, what you're getting

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.730
is the link to the code
and the specs for that.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.010
But you're not getting any
more granular information

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.839
beyond the size of
that entire bar.

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.630
And what we heard
designers saying is like,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.300
well, I want to see
what that shade of green

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.350
that I changed it to was.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.840
I want to make sure it's
my right brand color.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.999
And I want to see
what that icon was.

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:19.040
I want to make sure it's
the right icon in there.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.210
So what we heard is that they
wanted a lot more granular data

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.670
for the Material components
that we were showing them

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.780
in Gallery.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.580
And we had it.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.719
We just didn't put it in there.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.960
So this was a really important
thing for us to know.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.750
So this is the final version
that's been released.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.630
So as you can see, you've
still got that bottom app bar.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.590
But when you roll over any
single component inside it,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.260
you get that really
granular data

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.340
for that particular component,
in this case, the size

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.949
of that diamond-shaped FAB.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.440
So this is just one
of many examples

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.989
of how the research has made
our products launching here

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.370
at I/O better.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.730
Another one is the
Material I/O home page.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.220
So we in the same research
I'm talking about,

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.770
we also got feedback
on an earlier version

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.840
of the home page design.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.150
And we heard from
designers that they really

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.820
like to get overview
videos of any time there's

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.830
a new evolution of
something, so they

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.230
can get a quick sense
of what's changed.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.980
And we had that, but I was at
the bottom of a really long

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.100
page and nobody found
it before they were

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.060
able to click on the video.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.070
So what we did is in the website
that went live a couple of days

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:35.540
ago, right underneath that fold,
that video is really prominent.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.610
So we made it
really easy for you

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:42.950
all to get a quick overview
of what's new in Material.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.470
So what I've just gone
through with you has given you

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:49.940
some examples of how we use
workflow research to identify

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.750
the big problems that we want
to put our time into solving,

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.660
and how product research
improves the product,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.380
no matter what stage it's
in, and how we use products

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.780
that we will be
releasing at I/O,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.304
how we use research on these
products to make them better.

00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:07.970
And if you want to
go check out Gallery,

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.285
go to materialio/tools.

00:36:10.285 --> 00:36:11.030
All right.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.400
I'm going to hand it
back to Elizabeth now.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.920
ELIZABETH CHURCHILL:
Thank you so much, Sara.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.900
Thank you, everybody.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.530
So just a little bit of
a wrap up and a reminder

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:27.150
of the invitation to
visit us in Dome F. And so

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.570
what we've shown
you today is just

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.190
a flavor of the ways we're
using traditional methods

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.270
for research, as well
as inventing new methods

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:41.340
to understand how the components
work for everyday users,

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.890
in terms of beauty
and aesthetics,

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.120
in terms of usability, in
terms of sort of usefulness,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.910
but also accessibility.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.190
And Sara has shared
how important

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.910
it is for you to send us
feedback on our products.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.710
Because we do want
to work with you

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.350
to make sure that
your lives are easier

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.670
in this pretty difficult
workflow process from idea

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.520
to product that really works.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.260
Another thing I
want to let you know

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.910
is that we know that many of
you don't have research teams.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.920
We're lucky enough to have one.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.370
And so we think of ourselves
as the research system

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.220
that aligns with the design
system and the engineering

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.990
system.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.260
And we have committed to
writing up some of the methods

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.770
that we're using and
inventing, and we

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.530
will be sharing that along with
the other guidance and spec,

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.050
and sharing how
these methods can

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:42.060
help you understand how our
tools work for your context.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.280
Because as Michael
said very clearly,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.650
your context might be slightly
different from our own.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:50.010
So we will be sharing
more of that with you

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.050
over the next year.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.860
And so, finally, I
hope you take away

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.430
how we're bringing together
design and development

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.670
and engineering and research,
and how we're really

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.690
treating this as a conversation,
and a conversation that

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.800
needs to be a rich one.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.330
And so with that said, thank
you again for your attention.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.990
Please come and join
us in a Dome F--

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.400
Tent F, I should say,
at design accessibility.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.585
And again, thank you
for your attention.

00:38:22.585 --> 00:38:23.460
Thank you for coming.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.030
