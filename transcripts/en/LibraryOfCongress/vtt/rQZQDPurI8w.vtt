00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
It is my great pleasure

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
to welcome Brazilian author, Noemi
Jaffe, to the library of Congress.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.130
We just had a session recording for
the Archives of Hispanic Literature

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.150
on tape, and it was amazing.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.250 position:56%
So please look forward to
listening to her read from her work.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.300
Noemi Jaffe taught
Brazilian literature full-time

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.580
for over 20 years, and then
one day decided I'm going

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.390
to be a full-time writer, which
is what she does currently,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.810
besides teaching creative
writing in Brazil, as well.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.220
She's a frequent contributor
to the Cultural Supplement

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.610
of the [Portuguese name] and
also writes a monthly column

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.910
for the newspaper [Portuguese name]

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.690
and for the magazine,
Harper's Bazaar.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.130
She's the author of 10 titles,
starting with her book of poetry,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.100
which was also her first
book published, right?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.100
[Portuguese name], All the
Little Things, published in 2005.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.610
In 2016, she received
the Brazil Literary Prize

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.880
for her novel [Portuguese
name] The Orchids.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270
Today, she will be
reading and talking

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.550 position:56%
about her recently translated novel
[Portuguese name] What are the Blind

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.030
Men Dreaming?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.380
Which was a finalist for the prize
[Portuguese name] Literary Prize

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.680
in Brazil.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.980 position:56%
She is joined by Vivaldo dos Santos,
who is an associate professor

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.070
of Portuguese at Georgetown
University,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.530
where he's also the director
of the Portuguese program.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.230
Vivaldo is the author
of a book on the poetry

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.540
of Carlos [Portuguese name],
among many other titles

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.850 position:56%
on Brazilian literature and culture.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.520
Welcome Noemi and Vivaldo.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.820
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos:
[Portuguese word].

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.680
First of all, I'd like to
thank the Library of Congress

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.660
and especially the Hispanic
division and the publishers

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.190
for organizing this event,
and also Noemi for being here,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.520
and I'd like to, first of all just
to congratulate her on her book.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.300
It's such a beautiful book.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.210
Very touching, and I just love her
book, and it make me think a lot

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.670
about -- I always think
about my mother.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.530
I actually brought Noemi a poem
that I wrote about my mother.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.000
She's 99 years old,
and she had 17 kids.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.530
Lots of stories.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.970
This is just, you know,
for me to let her know

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.400
that when I read your book,
I was very touched by it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.310
and it did me think about, you
know, memories and also in growing

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.490
up in family, the struggle,
different kind of struggles,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.090
but I think the life story
of your mother, your family,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.550
it's an example, very touching.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.270
And I think the Jewish condition
is something that anybody

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.480
that has had suffered or
going through any diasporic,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.010
the African-Americans,
when the Jewish minorities.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.130
I think it's a very
important thing in life

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.820
to reflect of our human conditions.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.480
And I would just start,
I have several questions.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.070
I try not to be too professor and
have the audience ask questions.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.010 position:56%
So I will just start with a
question about the title of the book

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.070 position:56%
and What are The Blind Men Dreaming?

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.540
And to think about the title of
the book and also asking Noemi,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.250
what way are you dreaming or made
you dream about writing your book?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.230
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Okay
well first of all,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.860
I'd also like to think the Library
of Congress for inviting me,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.640 position:56%
Talia and Vivaldo, and I'd also like
to say how excited I am to be here.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.410
It's a dream of mine
to come to the library,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.070 position:56%
imagine even talking in the library.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.540
So I'm very excited.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.240
And good. Well, to
answer your question,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.430
it's a question everybody
wants to know, right?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.570 position:56%
Because the title is pretty strange.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.160
Well, my mother is a
very curious person.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.670
She's always wondering about
phenomenon, natural phenomenon,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.490
about cosmic phenomenons,
and she usually calls me

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.460
or asks me questions about natural
things like why is the world round?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.220
And why do dogs bark?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.370
And while I was writing the book,
she called me one day and asked me,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870
"Noemi, what are the
blind men dreaming?"

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.370
And the question was so --
it came just out of the blue,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.900
it was so poetic, that I
didn't know how to answer her,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.690
but I immediately said,
mom, that's the title

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.000 position:56%
of the book, and she agreed with me.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.260
She was wondering what
blind men dream of,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.670
because his blind men don't see,
she was thinking how do they dream

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.990
if they don't see, right?

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.200
But she has this problem
in her Brazilian grammar.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.350
She hasn't learned Brazilian
grammar very well, and so instead

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.130
of asking what do blind
men dream of, she asked,

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.770
"What are the blind men dreaming?"

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.370
And I like this mistake, quotes,
because it somehow talks a lot

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.650
about herself, the way she lives.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.760
She lives in the present
continuously.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.130
That's her decision.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.770
That in order to survive
what she went through,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.700
because she is a survivor
from Auschwitz,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.690
she decided to forget
everything that happened to her.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.090
So she's always living
in the present tense,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.510
and the present continues
to be more specific.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:35.730
So in the first place, I
thought it was very compatible,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.030
very convenient.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.240
The present continuous was
the best tense for her.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.840
So what are the blind men dreaming?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.410
And also, the content of the
question was also perfect,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:57.140
because it talks about her
imagination, about her curiosity,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.810
and also, it describes the
blindness, both of the people

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.050
who are inside the camp, and who
are forbidden to dream, right?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.750
Because when you're suffering

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.130 position:56%
as people do inside a concentration
camp, how can you dream of anything?

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.000 position:56%
And also because they didn't know
what was happening outside the camp,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.150 position:56%
what was happening the world, right?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.490
And also, because the
people outside the camp,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.410
both the ones who did know
what was going on inside it,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.600
but didn't do anything, right?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.040
Because people who work
in the city of Auschwitz,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.970
they were feeling the smell
of burning flesh all day long,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.270
and they didn't do anything.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.380
Not even go to the
border of the camp to see

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.350
if people needed a
piece of bread, nothing.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.510
And also, the people who
didn't know what was happening,

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.290
because Germany tried to
disguise it is much as they could.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.130
And I think the third reason is

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.210
because I think people
are still blind

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.490
to what's happening
in the world, right?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.560
Because there are happening things
that are similar to what happened

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.370
in Auschwitz, and we're
still blind to it.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.650
We're not doing much.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.330
And so that's the reason
for the title of the book.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.660
And there are other reasons.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.340
People always come up
with different reasons.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.060
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: And thank
you, that was following up.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.770
I was thinking about also
the meaning of dreams and,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.750
you know, how one dreams.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.230
You know, how dreams come to be in
anybody's life, but also the space

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.790
of dream is this, you know, the
relationship with the dreams

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.200
and the unconscious or some
experience that we have in life

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.690
that brings through, that's
kind of transformed, you know,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.380
our conscious to dreams
good or bad experiences.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.160
And also, the place of
literature as a place, you know,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.320
if you think of literature and
the imagination as some space

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:05.040
like an empty page, a blank space,
the way you project your dreams.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.880
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Exactly,
it's perfect.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.660
That's -- I really --

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.390
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: Another
question for you would be to think

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.450
about writing, the importance of
writing, like for your mother,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.460
for example, writing was a
[inaudible] memoir, right?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.490
After she left the camp,
but also the meaning.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.040 position:56%
I read that, you know, in her diary,
that she wrote for her daughters

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.360 position:56%
to read, but also the meaning of her
writing from her, but also for you,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.560
yourself, and your daughter.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.100
Like three generations,
the meaning of writing.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.120
Writing as, you know,
in psychoanalysis.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.950
You know, when you have a
experience, a traumatic experience,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.680
writing's always a good thing.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.880
Like how to materialize the trauma.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.520
You look at the trauma and like how
writing can be sort of a something

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.070
that can cure the trauma or
help you understand the trauma.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.180
Would you say something about that?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: Yes, that's
very interesting, because my mother,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.740
after she wrote this diary,
which is 90 pages long,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.220
she never wrote a single page in
her life after writing this diary.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.830
She's not a writing kind of person,
and as you said, when I ask her,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.350
why did you write this
diary if you don't write?

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.130
And she said, "For you to read it."

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.630
And she was 19 years
old at the time.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.290
She couldn't even imagine
she would have children,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.260
that she would meet my father,
and that she would come to Brazil.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:44.670
But anyway, and so I think
that for her to write,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.650
which is something she
wasn't used to doing.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.300
Like when she wants
to write a letter,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.410
we don't write letters anymore, but
when she wanted to write a letter,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.590
because her brother was living
here in the United States,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.240
she couldn't write more
than two lines like, "Hello.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.540
I'm in good health.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.840
So is my family.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.840
Goodbye." So she always
asked me, "Please,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.810
could you write a letter
for my brother?"

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.110
She couldn't write.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:17.340
So I think that for her, it
actually was a kind of decision.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.920
I interpret that now, a
kind of decision of hers

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:29.350
to extract her memory of what
had happened and leave it

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.110
in a diary, so she could forget it.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.990
Because that's what she did.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.740
So all of her memories
are in that diary.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.840
She doesn't remember
anything different

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.730
from what's written in the diary.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:48.560
You cannot make her
remember something casual.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.410
It's all that's written
in the diary.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:59.630 position:56%
So I think it was a way for her to
deposit her memories somewhere else.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.550
That's how I interpret it.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.580
But for me, I think
I became a writer,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.220
because since I was a really small
kid, like I was four years old,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.050
I knew I wanted to become a writer.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.750
That was the dream of my life.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.130
Talking about dreams, right?

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.280
That was a dream of my life.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.280
I invented books.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.620
I read from books without
knowing how to read.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.110
I opened books, and I
started reading them,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.890
inventing what was written.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.820
I invented languages.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.650
I read my sisters' books.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.560
They're much older than me, and I
read their books of psychoanalysis

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.700
when I was seven, eight years
old without understanding a word

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.240
of what I was reading, but I read.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.770
So I think I became a writer
because of this diary.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:13:02.170
Because I had to tell people what
my mother and my father told me

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.360
about what they had gone
through, and because I knew

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.400
that my mother had a diary,
which I didn't understand,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.780
because I don't understand Serbian.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:17.270
And that someday, I would
want to write about it.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:25.950
So for me, writing is a
necessity, is a mission,

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.220
and it's also very therapeutic
for me to overcome the fact

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.860
that I'm the daughter of a survivor

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.810
and all the things
that this fact implies.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:49.800
It implies a lot of guilt, a lot of
shame, and after writing this book,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.620
which was like the
mission of my life,

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.190
I think now I can start
writing about other things.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.220
And it was very therapeutic
to me, too.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.240
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: And how
long have you been, you know,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.540
how long has this book
been like as a project?

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.850
Another question for you would
be like when did you hear

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.070
about your mother's diary?

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.370
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Since I was a kid.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.980
She never hid it from us.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.180
So when I was four, I knew about
the existence of this diary.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.480
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: But
you couldn't read it, right?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.110
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: I couldn't
read it, but everything

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.370
that she told us is exactly the
same that was written in the diary.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.340
So when we finally translated,
we have this book translated,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.790
the diary translated into
Portuguese, which was in the 90s,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.510
I was more than 30
years old already.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.570
What we read were exactly
the same facts

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.990
that she told us all our lives.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.750
So I always knew about it.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.400
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: And
another question would be

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.600
like because your mother's diary
is in first-person point of view,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.110
and your narrative
is in third-person --

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.410
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Third person.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.710
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos:
Like the daughter.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.160
Could you tell a little
bit about that, please?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.460
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: That was a very
important decision that I made,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.530
because when I started writing my
part of the book, I was writing it

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:22.010
in the first person, because it's
about the story of my mother,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:27.220
about my life, my sisters'
lives, my opinions.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.540
But I wasn't feeling
comfortable with it,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.930
because the book wasn't about me.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.770
I already felt that I was
stealing my mother's memories,

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:44.190
and not only was I stealing,
I was also talking about me.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:49.340
I didn't feel the right to
do it in the first person,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.830
and I also didn't want
to be so truthful.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:00.350
I wanted to be able to fictionalize
little, and then I tried.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.060
I made an experiment to
write it in third person,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.400
and as soon as I began,
I felt so much more free.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.700
When I started writing in the
third person, I could invent more.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.020
I could acquire a little
more distance towards myself.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.550
I felt I wasn't in the
center of everything.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.880 position:56%
I wanted my mother to be the center.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:32.690
I wanted the issues to be the
center of attention and not me.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.870
And yeah, that's the reason.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.170
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos:
That's very interesting,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.680
because the book has these three
parts, and one is the diary,

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:48.110
and there is the second part,
it's Noemi's narrative part

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:54.810
and her granddaughter, or her
daughter also writing at the end

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.250
about her experience being the
grandchild of the survivor.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.790
So it's very interesting to
see these three elements.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.670
And I think, you know,
think about memories.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.880 position:56%
Because I think also is the question

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.300
of how much can we grasp
in terms of memory?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.790
You know, what's real?

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.100
Because the written text has
a tendency to fix things.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.730
We think this is what
really happened.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.610
You know, especially for someone
that writes, but there's a lot

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.750
of questions like in testimonial
literature, in terms of our own

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.390
like subjectivity in writing
that's very interesting to see.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.170
Your book is a project, like
trying to understand what happened.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.400
Three different perspectives
of the same fact,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.820
of the same history event.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.360
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Yes, and we all
have very different perspectives

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.660
about what happened.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.420 position:56%
Like my mother tells me sometimes,
"Noemi, you suffer more than I did."

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.420
Because she doesn't
suffer anymore, right?

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.440
She accepts the fact
that she suffered,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.200
and that her suffering
ended, and I'm the opposite.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.980
I'm always cultivating suffering.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.930
I'm always, interpreting
thinking and, you know,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.010
more intellectualizing
and thinking about things.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.520
What does it mean to survive?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.830
What does it mean to forget?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.680
What does it mean to remember?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.710
And she tells me, "Don't
exaggerate so much.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.430
You're so dramatic.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.130
Why do you make things
so complicated?"

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:35.130
You know, for her a fact is a
fact, but she lived the fact.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:42.160
I didn't. So what is left
for me is thinking, right?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.390
This stupid thing that
we do, and my daughter,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.260
she's a little more distant.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.560
A little more?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.860 position:56%
No, she's a lot more distant, right?

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.300
Because she's not the daughter of
someone who went through the war,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.130
and so she doesn't feel this
guilt that I feel or this rage,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.440
because my mother doesn't
feel anger.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.640
She forbid herself to
feel any kind of anger,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.130
not even towards the Nazis.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.210
And I feel a lot of anger.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.730
I want to go back to the
past and kill the men

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.580
who made my mother carry the
stone on top of her head, right?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.880
So I feel guilt.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.370
I feel rage, and my daughter,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.560
she doesn't feel any
kind of guilt, right?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.540
She's free to live her life.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.510
She doesn't have any
relationship with the war.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.810
She wants to fight for
other causes, right?

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:44.630
She's a very strong feminist,
like all the girls nowadays,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.460
thank God, are feminists.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.060
So she's a strong feminist.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.930
She fights for other causes in
Brazil, and so her relationship

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.260
with her grandmother's
life is different,

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.040
but it's also very
interesting, right?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.750
Her relation to Judaism
is also different.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.770
So the book contains
these three perspectives.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.070
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: Thank you.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.320
I think I should let the
audience ask some questions,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.650
if you have more questions,
you know, in case we need.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.930
But I think if anybody has a
question you could ask Noemi.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.230
Talia?

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.690
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
I talked to you

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:29.860
about this before how [inaudible],
but I have never seen a book

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:35.990
but in three voices with a
three generation [inaudible],

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:42.610
and I was wondering how
you came to that decision.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.730
Well, diary I guess [inaudible].

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.030
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Right.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.050
It's interesting, because
my daughter,

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.330
when I was writing
the book, she was 21.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.040
Now she's 28, but she was studying
languages at the University

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.270
of San Paulo, and she also
wanted to be a writer.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.390
She was a writer already, and
then, so one day, I asked her,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.340
would you like to write
the book with us?

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.720
She said, yes, why not?

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.630
And then we went to Auschwitz,
I asked her to come with me,

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:23.720 position:56%
and she did, and when we entered
Auschwitz, I said let's try to find,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.700
here in Auschwitz, things
that tourists don't find.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.240
Let's try to see the details about,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.890
the different things
about Auschwitz.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:44.530
And so I started walking
through the museums in the rooms

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:52.070
and the barracks and the
windows full of shoes and hair

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:59.840
and suitcases looking at the
small things like the names

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.240
on the suitcases and the
streets, the addresses,

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.490
and the braids in the hair.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.870
Like so there are three windows
full of hair to the top, right?

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.980
The hair that was taken
from people's heads.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.760
So I was looking at the braids
in the hair, and when we went

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.250
to the museums, I was writing
down the names of the survivors.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.890
And then my daughter started
looking at me in this strange way,

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:39.570
and she was getting mad and
mad and mad, until she said,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.430
"Why are looking at different
things here in Auschwitz?

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.070
There's nothing different
to look at!

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.910
You know, there's no
detail to look at.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.300
You shouldn't look at the braids.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.940
You shouldn't look at the names.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.240
Let's get out of here.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.630
I don't want to be part
of this book anymore!

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.050
What did you bring me here?"

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.710
She was really mad at me,
at the way I was trying

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.850
to find poetry in Auschwitz.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.880
So she decided not to
participate in the book.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.780
So we have this big
discussion in Poland.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:19.480 position:56%
We were fighting in Poland, and then
after, you know, we discussed a lot,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.080
and when we back to Brazil,
she said, "No, all right.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.080
All have a part in the book,
but only a very small part.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.630
The book is yours."

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.640
And I agreed with her.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:38.010
And that saw how it came
about, these three parts.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.320

Yes, yes. She even asks herself,
how was I able to endure it?

She doesn't understand how she
was able to endure pain, cold,

she feels hungry, she says,

"I'm not feeling very well
because I'm a little hungry.

How could I endure feeling

Is she feels a little cold,
she looks for a sweater,

how could I endure it?

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.820
Yeah, I think my mother's attitude
is the healthiest possible attitude

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.120
towards a trauma, right?

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.500
Because there are people
who like to live in the past

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.060
and who suffer all of their lives.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.190
I mean, I can't blame them,
because if you go through something

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:32.640
like this, you can't blame
a person in any way, right?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.090
If the person wants to
remember, let him remember.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.530
If the person wants to
forget, let him forget.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.290
Everything is acceptable and right.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:48.840
But I think the way my
mother did is the best.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.350
Right? Because my mother
is a happy person.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.880
She's a very generous,
optimistic, happy person.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.330
Whenever I feel sad, she's there
to, you know, encourage me,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.510
and she's encouraging everyone.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:09.590
She's teaching people how to
endure things all the time.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:15.510

way to go through problems.

Just following

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.240
up on your comment to her question.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.180
I remember like reading your book.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.710
There is so much about dignity and
endurance and also destiny of fate,

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.790
and your mother's acceptance
of death.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.810
Something that you mentioned like
the present, like all the survivors

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:43.860
in the camp expecting, you know,
like death was to be expected.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:49.950
Her perception of death is
what kept her alive, I guess.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.430
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Yeah,
she's not afraid of death.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.030
She's not afraid of anything.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:28:01.470
I think after you go
through the things she did,

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.520
you don't feel afraid of things.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.950
And she always taught us, her
daughters, not to be afraid.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:12.740
The three of us were all
very, we're very -- fighters.

Is that what you say?

I don't know.

We're fighters, but not very
fearful people, the three of us.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.160
But she's more.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.230
She's braver than us.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.590
And she's not afraid of anything.

Like, is 90 years old now.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.970
She says to us, "I'm
not afraid of dying.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.710
I may not be -- not
wake up tomorrow.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.010
That's all right."

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.740
We're more afraid of
her death and she is.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.940
She's not afraid of anything.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.100
She's only afraid of sickness.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:55.910
Not of her sickness, of ours,
and her grandchildren, right?

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.410
And so that's what she's afraid of.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.660
Which is totally understandable,
right?

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.180
And also, in the book,
there are many experiences

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.090
that she talks about.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.770
Like when she was asked
by her cousins to confess

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:21.970
that she had stolen butter from the
kitchen, and she hadn't done it.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.610
So she says, all right, I'll do
it, because her cousins were afraid

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.110
of confessing, and she wasn't.

Not immediately, but like, now,

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.780
many years after I wrote
the book -- not many years.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:21.150
Three years, four years after I
wrote the book, as I told you,

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.860
I'm ready to write
about other things,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.820
because I was always thinking
about being Jewish and surviving

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.320
and remembering or
forgetting, and now I'm ready

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.180
to write about other things.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.090
I think it's been very,
very important for my life

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:43.730 position:56%
to have written this book, in order
to overcome many problems that I had

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.100
and that I feel like I used
to have any, many nightmares.

get rid of the nightmares.

Yes, but as I was telling
him about the stone.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.510
So this is a very central
thing in the book,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.970
and the story of my
mother's life and in my life,

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:18.860
because my mother spent all her
time in the concentration camp

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.560
with her cousins, three cousins.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.990
They were sisters.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.060
And they were all working
in the kitchen.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.720
I think that's the main
reason why my mother survived,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.560
because she managed to
work in the kitchen,

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.310
in the kitchen they
had more access to food

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:39.080
like potato peels and
things like that.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:46.570
And they used to steal butter to
give it to people who were sick,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.460
and one day, the officer realized
that some butter had been stolen,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.160
and one of the cousins had stolen
the butter, but they were afraid

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.350
of confessing, because
they were three sisters,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.880
and they knew that
if they confessed,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.230
the officer might send
them to death.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.320 position:56%
And so my mother was somewhere else,
and when she arrived in the kitchen,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.870
they asked my mother to
confess that she had done it,

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.370
and she said all right, I'll do it.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.160
And she went to the officer and
she said, "I stole the butter."

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.160
And the officer said,
"Are you kidding?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.130
You're coming to me to confess you
stole something from the kitchen?"

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:30.310
Yes. So she was supposed to be sent
to death, but then she begged not

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.500
to die, so the officer, I
don't know for what reason,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.990
decided only to punish her
more lightly and asked her

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.580
to carry a stone on top
of her head for a couple

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.300
of hours kneeling on gravel.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:51.970
Yes. And she couldn't cry, and
she couldn't the stone fall,

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.510
and when these hours passed, the
officer came and said, "All right,

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.620
now get up and go to work."

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.440
And she couldn't even stand.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:11.560
Her knee is injured until
this day, and she told us,

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.650
she never spared us from the story.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:19.270
When we were kids, she told us
this story, so we always knew,

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.330
we the sisters, we always knew
what my mother had gone through,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:28.010
but to me, this fact, to know that
my mother had gone through this,

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.670
it was like determinant in my life.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.990
It wasn't a simple thing.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:42.670
And so I wrote two chapters
about this fact in the book,

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:50.500
and I think the whole book
circles around this fact, my life.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.800

that whole topic of
resilience, I'm sure [inaudible].

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.540
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Okay, thank
you for the questions.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.800
First of all, in terms of what is
happening in the world right now,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.810
I think the worst problem
that is happening

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.000
in the world right now is
the problem of the refugees.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.990
And so I was reading a book now
in the United States written

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.900
by a Mexican writer
called [Portuguese name],

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.720
a very nice writer.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.400
You know her?

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:12.700
And so she was -- she writes
about the children from Guatemala,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:19.150
Puerto Rico, Mexico, who are
coming to the United States alone,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.410
all by themselves, orphans
from these countries.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.890
They're being persecuted by
gangs in their countries.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.510
They're being killed and
raped in their countries,

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.940
and they come to the United
States followed by a coyote.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:39.370
And they get here, and they
cannot enter the country, right?

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.900
The country won't let them in,
but the country is responsible

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.440
for what's happening to them.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.210
I'm sorry to say that here
in the Library of Congress,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.340
but the country's responsible
for what's happening to them,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.550 position:56%
because the United States
supported the war in their countries

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.160
against them, and they
won't let them in.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.460
They need to find a lawyer
as soon as they get here,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.900
and they need to have
reasons that proves

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.220
to get inside the United States.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.350
So that's just one example
of what's happening.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.100
Right? Children wanting to get
into a country that is responsible

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.270
for what's happening to them, but
the country won't let them in.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.030
And so [Portuguese name]
decided to do something for it.

for these kids.

concentration camps for homosexuals.

killed like animals, and in Europe,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.260
people won't be let in, right?

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.260
And it's the same thing.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:56.000
Europe is also responsible
for what's happening in Asia,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.380
and I think these are some of the
problems that are happening today,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:09.200
and that many people shut their
eyes toward these problems.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.660
And in Brazil, I can't even start
telling you all the problems

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.450
we have.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:23.990
And about resilience, I attribute
my mother's resilience first

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:28.000
to the fact that she
believes in destiny.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.450
I think that makes
things easier for people.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.730
I don't believe in destiny at all.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:39.260
That makes me a little less
resilient than my mother.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:45.540
I believe more in our choices and
people's choices to do things.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.570
Not that things are prewritten
and that we only obey,

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.740
we follow something
that is not up to us.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.000
I think that makes things
easier for people, right?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.140
She thinks is that supposed
to happen, it will happen.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.440
If not, it won't.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.400
And also, because of
what Vivaldo was saying

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.700
about her, the maintenance.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.980
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: Maintenance.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.740
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Maintenance
of her sense of dignity.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:26.450 position:56%
You know? Like in the war, she would
sleep naked in order not to get lice

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:33.170
in her clothes, and she always
carried a spoon with her,

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:40.440
or she would make a needle out of
straw in order to sew a blanket

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.280
for herself, and like
she's 90 years old now,

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.640
but she's always hanging
her close on a hanger

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.210
and her shoes are always,
you know, very neatly placed,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.280
one beside the other,
and everything's so neat

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.720
in her bedroom and her linen.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.340
You know, she's always
taking care of herself

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.610
and using lipstick and makeup.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.690
She's always looking pretty.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:13.820
I think that makes a
person resilient, right?

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:21.810
She values her sense of being.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.110
&gt;&gt; Vivaldo dos Santos: Being.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.510
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Being, exactly.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:32.320
&gt;&gt; My question is about
language and culture.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.590
So you talked about her
understanding Portuguese

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:41.570
and how she speaks to this
day not quite properly,

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.200
but she always speak Portuguese?

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.800
Did she bring any of her Serbian
with her, and in community,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.850
is she strongly identified
with the Jewish community,

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.490
or has she assimilated, and how
important is Judaism to her now?

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.790
&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: Okay, good.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.340
Yes, when my father was alive,

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.040
they would speak Serbian
between themselves.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.160
But none of us sisters
speak Serbian.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.660
Only my older sister, used
to, because when they came,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.360
they didn't speak Portuguese.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.910
So they spoke Serbian all the time,
and she spoke a little Serbian.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:22.630
And my grandmother, who came with
my father, also spoke German.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.360
So my sister also speaks
a little German.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.970
Otherwise, they spoke Portuguese.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.500
And so after my father died, my
father died 21 years ago already,

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.860
and so she only spoke Portuguese,

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.690
and now she forgot
part of her Serbian.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.240
She also spoke a lot of Hungarian.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.600
She spoke Hungarian very
well, because in the city

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.190
where she was born, they spoke
both Hungarian and Serbian.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:59.210
So she understands at little
Hungarian, but she has to talk to,

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.200
and so she only speaks
Portuguese with us.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.290
And no, she gives great
value to Judaism.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:12.020
She's not religious at all but
she's not assimilated either.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:20.390
We keep the main celebrations,
Passover, Hashanah, Yom Kippur,

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.170
we always celebrate in her house.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:29.930
She still cooks the main
dishes for these celebrations.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:36.520
She goes to the synagogue only
in the most important holidays

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:43.260
of the year, but she
likes being Jewish.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:50.200
None of us -- oh, no, my
middle sister lives in Israel,

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.480
but my older sister and
myself, we never married Jews.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.160
And grandchildren didn't marry
Jews either, but she doesn't care.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.310
It's okay with her.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:09.010
But she gives a lot of
importance to being Jewish.

No, because she hasn't been
speaking in Serbian for many years,

&gt;&gt; Noemi Jaffe: In Brazil,
there was, but not in Serbia.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:22.330
I wish they translated it into
Serbian or into Swedish, also,

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.740
because she spent six months in
Sweden when she was liberated,

been translated.

where is the diary now?

in the Holocaust Museum
in Jerusalem, right?

was the place for it.

And so my sister took it
there and gave it to them.

It's totally different from my
mother's story, and he is also part

of the diary, because when
my mother gave him the --

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:51.050
when my mother went back to
Serbia after the war to see if any

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.350
of her relatives had
survived, he met my father,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.250

in love with her, and she didn't.

He had joined the American army.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.870
So she went Hungary and left her
diary with my father as a token

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:17.490
of her friendship, and my father
filled the diary with love letters

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.650
to her, and these love
letters, they're like, you know,

you are in love letters,
so romantic.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.570
And so my father went
after her to Hungary,

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:36.380
because he had a large family
in Brazil, and he told her

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:43.550 position:56%
to marry him, only bureaucratically,
so she would go to Brazil with him,

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.950
and then in Brazil,
she would get documents

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.770
to come to the United States.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.380

and in the middle of the way,

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.190

different than hers.

camp, not an extermination camp,

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.970

this camp disappeared.

different attitude from hers.

He was the kind who was
cultivating suffering.

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:48.940
distant stone, actual stone, crusty
stone, loose stone, any stone,

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.420

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.950
touchstone, philosopher's
stone, fundamental stone,

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.120
chipped stone, sleek stone.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.860
The stone in your shoe, precious
stone, semi-precious stone,

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.120
rolling stone, kidney stone,
keystone, crumbling stone,

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:11.540
sharpening stone, dry stone,
pre-stone, post-stone,

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.970
to throw the first stone, to
squeeze blood from a stone,

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.120
to be hard as stone, to
never have seen the stone,

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.790
to picture the stone, to be in
her place holding the stone.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:26.180
Being the child of a survivor
mean stealing the temptation

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.880
in some distant and
inhospitable part of your memory,

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.290
to have been in the
survivor's place.

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:35.240
To not have let her live through
all that she lived through,

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.640
to travel to the past and stop him.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.520
To kill the guard who
ordered her punishment.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.330
To pierce through time and
through the [inaudible] regulations

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.630
and save her.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.660
A mother who has suffered
is a failure of history,

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.820
a twist of reversal which leads
her children into the minute guilt

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.170
and absence and a dream or
a nightmare that they carry

00:53:55.170 --> 00:54:00.080
with them throughout the day, and
which impedes and stimulates life.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.990
The desire to save one's
mother is also a desire

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:07.670
to eradicate her suffering from
our memories so that she, herself,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:14.510
can be freed of it, so that
she can live without the stone.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.500
