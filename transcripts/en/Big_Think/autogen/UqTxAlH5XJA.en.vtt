through someone's list of faults like
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390
through someone's list of faults like
all day long and then we go through it

all day long and then we go through it
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070
all day long and then we go through it
again and it's the same list it's not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
again and it's the same list it's not
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530
again and it's the same list it's not
like we learn new faults but we're so
