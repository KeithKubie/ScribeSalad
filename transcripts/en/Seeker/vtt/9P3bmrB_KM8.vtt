Your skin is an incredible organ, it holds
you together, keeps invading pathogens from

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:14.480
killing you, and also doesn't do this.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Howdy skin jobs.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.730
Natalia here.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.810
Happy Halloween and thanks for tuning into
DNews!

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.880
Skin is the largest organ of your body.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.730
I've already mentioned a couple of the benefits
of having skin -- but here are a few more:

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.599
it grows hair to protect itself, it sweats
to cool the body down, has goosebumps to warm

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.850
us up, it’s self healing, and senses the
world around us…

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.219
Seriously, we're wrapped up in one of the
most fantastic materials!

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.670
But, there's one thing that vertebrate skin
doesn't do easily, and that's tear.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.710
A good example here is, leather: cow skin.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.600
Motorcyclists wear it because if they crash
it doesn't rip or break… it just skids,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.109
protecting their actual skin with other skin!

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.109
Weird.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.819
In fact, leather should skid longer than either
denim or bulletproof kevlar.

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.870
Textile companies test the strengths of leather
in what they call "breaking strength" tests.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.390
Basically, they attach two clamps and stretch
it until it tears.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.710
One company published that the breaking strength
of a 3-inch sample should never be less than

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.240
150 pounds.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.750
Remember, leather is just SKIN.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.310
So how can skin hold up against so much force?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.670
Well, because of its construction.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.229
Firstly, a bit about skin: not all skin is
the same thickness.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.729
The skin of the foot or the back is 4 millimeters
thick, while the skin of the genitals and

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.030
eyelids is way thinner.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.549
In that cross section, there are three layers:
the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis -- but

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.450
the dermis is the thickest.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.650
When you stretch your skin (like this) Hey,
I'm kinda stretchy!

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.509
You'll feel it pull back on you because of
the 'type 1' collagen: a super-common coiled

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.049
triple-helix protein.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.499
The stuff that lets it bounce back is called
elastin: a network of fibers that help with,

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.280
what else, skin elasticity (helping it hold
its shape when it's stretched or bent).

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.639
But even though we knew all this, a new study
in Nature Communications found out why it

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.869
can stretch, but doesn't tear!

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.660
They found that the skin's actual fibers will
rotate, straighten, stretch and slide, to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.200
keep the skin from ripping!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.099
Skin evolved to try and spread the stress
from a hole, notch, or tear!

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.470
That's so crazy, right?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.989
Normally collagen is disordered and chaotic,
spread randomly throughout in our skin, but

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.970
when skin is pulled, stretched or hooked into
some kind of horror gore torture device…

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.120
These spiraled collagen fibrils reorient themselves,
and align along the pull, resisting a tear,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.010
and keeping the inside of your body protected!

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.640
Researchers used rabbit skin, and a sophisticated
synchrotron x-ray machine to watch the collagen

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.390
in action, and postulated that this is also
how our own stretchy stuff gets its pluck.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.409
According to their studies, understanding
this behavior could help improve synthetic

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.610
and flexible fabrics, which currently use
stuff like wheat gluten.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.310
Gluten is like glue that holds bread together,
and it doesn't tear easily either!

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.180
Skin is more tear-resistant than gluten!?

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.180
That's a weird fact.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.410
As long as we're facting it up: beauty products
often say they have elastin in them, just

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.790
like your skin, but it comes from cows or
birds and if you rub elastin on your face,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.769
it still doesn't go under the epidermis into
the dermis.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.769
Sorry.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.049
Womp womp.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.329
Anyway, thanks to skin being so darn tear
resistant, some humans can even put hooks

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.299
through it and hang their whole bodies from
the ceiling.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.780
It's been done for 1000s of years for ceremonial
and religious purposes, and it's still done

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.830
today!

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.300
Skin is amazing.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.610
Happy Halloween!!

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.750
MUAHAHAHAHA!!

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.030
Have you ever thought about how your skin
needs sunlight to make vitamin D?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.560
What's going on inside your skin?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.340
Is it really MAKING vitamins?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.720
Find out here:

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720
What's your favorite organ?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.689
I like the skin, for sure -- but I've always
wondered about the spleen.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.720
Such a weird word.
