00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:11.598
At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC,

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:14.329
a comic play called The Babylonians,

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.392
written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.588
was awarded first prize.

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:23.989
But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.369
was so controversial that afterwards,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.554
a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:35.144
for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners."

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:40.701
Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights.

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:43.293
In it, he openly mocked Kleon,

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:47.618
ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:49.534
outside the city gates.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.803
This style of satire was a consequence

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:55.570
of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.411
and is now called "Old Comedy."

00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:02.906
Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas,

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:09.094
are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy.

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:10.969
They often use wild situations,

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.184
like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle,

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:19.516
or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside,

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.686
in order to subvert audience expectations.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:27.198
And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since.

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:32.709
The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel,

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.297
and "oide," – singing,

00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:40.093
and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways.

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:45.037
Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty,

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.591
their comedies usually ended happily.

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.415
And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend,

00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:53.998
comedy addressed current events.

00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:59.032
Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.408
His targets were arrogant politicians,

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:03.122
war-mongering generals,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.607
and self-important intellectuals,

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:08.783
exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre,

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:11.603
where everyone could see their reactions.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:16.165
As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi:

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.878
"those made fun of in comedy."

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:22.240
Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.775
held these leaders to account,
testing their commitment to the city.

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:31.621
One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work:

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:35.101
the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta.

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:38.692
In Peace, written in 421 BC,

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:43.310
a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.976
where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians.

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:53.083
Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC,

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.453
Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata."

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:59.111
In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:03.411
and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace.

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:08.658
Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations,

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.693
such as in "Clouds,"

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:14.299
where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.513
The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school,

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.193
where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right

00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:24.738
and that a debt is not a debt.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:30.756
No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end.

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:35.149
Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis,

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.622
a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly,

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:43.641
often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes.

00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.737
For example, in "Birds,"

00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:48.100
the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.104
and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize,

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:55.866
they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.553
Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke,

00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.274
as the play came in second.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.670
By exploring new ideas

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.915
and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.628
Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens,

00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:11.793
but he shaped the nature of comedy itself.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:15.287
Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy,

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.938
his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere,

00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:19.980
from slapstick

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.948
to double acts

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:22.335
to impersonations

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:23.963
to political satire.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:27.887
Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes,

00:04:27.887 --> 00:04:31.408
his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:37.271
And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today:

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.196
“I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice,

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.167
no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”
