00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is my solution. It's a fairly straightforward brute force search.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First, I wrote a function that return if a number r is a primitive root.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A loop through all the possible exponents to see if the result has been seen before in our set s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If it has, we return False. If no repeats were found, we return True.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Using is&lt;u&gt;primitive&lt;u&gt;root, we then loop through all the possible options,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
checking if it's a primitive root and appending it to our list.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
When we've looped through all the possible options, we return our list.
