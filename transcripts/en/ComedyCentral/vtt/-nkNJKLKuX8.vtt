I got a cone every night every
night. Every night you're cone

 Nailed it nailed that.
I got a lotta intro's for you.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.114
You know more
than my parents.

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.452
You're a pope for the day.
Oh wow.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.413
What would you now make a sin.
What would you decree as a sin.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.916
Probably DJ'ing. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.628
I'd get rid of DJ'ing that
just bothers me. Yeah this guy
sucks.

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:45.963
Yeah they make so much money.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:50.634
I know. Some of them. Calvin
 Harris makes 45 million a year.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.552
What. To DJ! What is that.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.429
I don't know.
I mean it's not an instrument.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.766
One time I saw a DJ
using his equipment

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.185
on top of a grand piano
which is like

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.980
that's like banging a blow
up doll on top an actual woman.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.691
Come on.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.944
What do you think's
the absolute worst name

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:12.698
you could name a kid.
What's just a crap, dumb name.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.244
What's a bad name.
I guess hemorrhoid.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.079
Johnson is up there.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.498
This is a true person
that existed that I knew.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:25.877
OK. Her last name was Jar
OK. And her first name was
Pickel.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.171
Come on. Not lying to you.
Wow.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.966
I know a girl in my middle
school Shanda

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:35.804
last name Lear. Shanda Lear.
She's a stripper now. Stupid
names.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.225
All right next
stupid question

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.019
we're both stand up comics here.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.730
What's your best bombing story
or worst.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.482
One time I did a gig at the
Comedy Cellar went pretty well.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.651
So this guy said
Hey I work in a hedge fund.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.278
I want to come roast my company.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.239
So he gave me a whole rap sheet
of all his employees.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.532
And it was heavy Stubby's

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.951
Be vicious be brutal really
kill him and I was like

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.203
All right you got it.
Get in there white tablecloth.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.165
Embrace looks well-to-do rich
and he goes

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.125
All right. There's your podium.
You've got your list

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.377
I've got it all
and I just go into and I go

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.838
Bob we all know
you're cheating on your wife

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.548
and she's there she's like what
the fuck!

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.427
And that didn't go well.
So I move on I go

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:17.679
Hey Jim we all know
you're addicted to coke

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.265
and sponsors they're like
What the hell what are you
crazy.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.060
You lied to me you know.
So he leaves and I go

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.063
Hey Jeff we all know you're gay.
His kids are there like

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:27.147
"I knew it Dad!"

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.358
And they all run out
and I'm bombing horribly.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:32.110
I do like five more of those
none of them work you know I 
get off stage

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.945
and the guys like
what the hell was that.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.197
What was that.
That was crazy

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.449
I was like I just used the stuff
you gave me like you

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.409
blew it! you blew it and I got
no money.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.247
Next to question
what would be the worst.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.000
Buy one get one free sale
of all time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.753
Wow. Buy one get one free
What do you thinks the
worst.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:53.965
Probably prostitute
because you have sex with one
prostitute

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.342
you feel the shame

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.470
you don't even want
the other one. Once you're
finished.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.305
You're like wow this was a big
mistake and two it's like

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.891
when you go to the grocery store
hungry like aw

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.102
I was too horny
I was thinking with my dick

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.895
so my eyes are bigger
than my dick.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.188
There was a guy in Vegas

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.606
I saw
he was like walk down the street

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.066
he goes what corner
of the tutes

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:15.529
on. The tutes!
He just called prostitues
"tutes"

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.030
I was like I don't know. Do I
look like a guy

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.949
who owns a prostitue
like "where are the tutes!"

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.411
