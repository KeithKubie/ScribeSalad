[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.640
RICHARD: Let me begin by
introducing Joanne Lipman.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.110
She has achieved great success
in the world of publishing,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.040
beginning as a reporter at
"The Wall Street Journal,"

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.640
on to being an entrepreneur
at "The Wall Street

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.120
Journal" in Conde Nast,
in starting new editorial

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.870
properties within
those organizations.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.350
She moved on to Gannett, where
she ultimately became editor

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.530
in chief of "USA Today"
and the chief content

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.420
officer of Gannett overall.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.430
So also, interestingly, I
had the tremendous pleasure

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
of getting to know Joanne
over the last year and a half,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.850
as we were both members of the
Knight Commission on Trust,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.280
Media, and Democracy.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.500
And we're, frankly,
at the latter stages

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.380
of completing that work, and
will publish a report sometime

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.000
in the next few months.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080
Which simply, to me, says
that Joanne is obviously not

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.860
shy about taking on very
challenging questions.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
So what's the future of gender
equality in the workplace?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
What's the future of democracy
in the world of the internet?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.220
These are vexing problems.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.960
And they don't, as we know, have
necessarily simple solutions.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.760
They have constructive
approaches, but not

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.260
necessarily simple solutions.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.960
So we're here to talk
about Joanne's book.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.050
By the way, we do have several
dozen copies available.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.550
It is available also on Kindle,
her book "That's What She Said,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.330
What Men Need to Know and Women
Need to Tell Them About Working

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.110
Together."

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.820
So let me just open up
by saying that these are,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.850
as we know, very challenging
times for our society,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.620
in many, many ways.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.490
These are also very
challenging times at Google,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.720
as we well know.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.810
And this last hour
is ample evidence

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.250
of that, of the
work we need to do,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.040
of the justifiable
concerns that many of us

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.210
have about the urgency in
addressing these challenges.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.060
And I hope today--

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.600
and I get verklempt.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.440
I hope today an indication
of our cultural commitment

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.470
to addressing them.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.280
And, again, it's
not over in a day.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.100
But I do think there's symbolism
to what happened today,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.960
and hopefully symbolism
that has long value.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.790
I might come back to that later.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.250
So let's get into this.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.079
Joanne, I think your book--

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.620
and I'd strongly
urge you to read it.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.210
It's filled with a
tremendous amount

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.260
of information,
examples, and data

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.990
about the environment we're in.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.440
And Joanne does an excellent
job of illuminating

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.290
those issues of
unconscious bias,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.100
of how women feel in the
workplace, of how they are

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.320
often perceived in
the workplace in ways

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.788
that we know they
should not be perceived.

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:17.870
And, as typical
with these sessions,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.500
I will, after the first
two or three or so,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.230
open it up to all questions.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.040
But let me start off with a few.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.080
And your book makes, I think,
a really important point

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.600
that, in addressing
these issues,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.080
it's how do we take
constructive approaches?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
How do we look more at
the dos than the don'ts?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.470
And I think we'll come
back to that several times

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.370
in this conversation.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.130
So let me just start off.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.460
Based on your
work, based on even

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.420
what you might know at a
fairly high level about Google,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.190
what are the several things
that you would advise Google,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.840
advise Googlers, male
or female, in guiding

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.917
that evolution of a
gender equal culture?

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:08.750
JOANNE LIPMAN: Sure.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.850
So first of all, thank
you guys for having me.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.310
And thank you for having
me today of all days.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.930
So I actually got here just
as the walkout was happening.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.470
So I got to be a part of it.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.550
And I was so energized by it.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.440
And also, I had been following
@GoogleWalkout on Twitter,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.300
watching this cascade around the
world, which is amazing to see.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.700
But what I loved being
outside with all of you

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.650
guys was how many men
I saw, and how many

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.730
male allies, and knowing
Googlers like Richard.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.070
And that is actually why I
wrote "That's What She Said."

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.470
And actually the reason
that I wrote the book

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.410
in the first place is
because I grew up--

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.030
my first two decades
of my career I

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.010
spent at "The Wall
Street Journal,"

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.500
where almost all of my
colleagues were men.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.690
My sources were men.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.860
My mentors were all men.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.550
And I had a very good
experience in a very male

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.890
dominated organization in
a male dominated industry.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.270
And yet, as I rose up
the leadership ranks,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.630
I started getting invited to
more and more of these women's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.280
leadership conferences.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.950
And at a certain
point I just became

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.950
a little bit frustrated,
because these conversations were

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.180
phenomenal.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.100
Women's conversations
with one another,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.320
when we talk amongst
ourselves, we

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.650
talk all the time about
the issues we face at work.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.800
And I don't mean just the
extremes of sexual abuse.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.650
But the everyday things of being
marginalized and overlooked,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.050
interrupted, not
taken seriously,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.570
not taken as seriously
as the guy next to us.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.790
And we talk about it all
the time with each other.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.290
But men are not part
of that conversation.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.580
And actually the book
grew out of a piece

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.220
I ended up writing for "The
Wall Street Journal" called

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.200
"Women At Work,
a Guide For Men,"

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.060
and in which I say-- and this
is the point of the book--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.900
women talking to each other,
it's a great conversation.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.100
It's half a conversation.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.090
And that gets us
to half a solution.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.150
So the only way we
solve this is for us

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.130
to all understand we
need to work together,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.210
and bring men into
the conversation.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.230
So at a high level, that's
the most important thing.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.360
That was amazing
to see that today.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.470
I also love seeing men
here, which is great.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.750
And I love being invited here.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.690
I've been talking to a lot of
male dominated organizations.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.690
There are so many things
that we can talk about.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.064
And I actually
have a cheat sheet

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:36.290
in the back of the book on
10 things you can do right

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.456
now to close the gender gap.

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.520
But it really breaks down into
things that individuals can do

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.680
and things that
organizations can do.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.680
And just to talk for a
moment organizationally,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.650
because I do think a lot of the
things that were on those five

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.260
changes actually mirror things
that I recommend in the book.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.050
Things like a gender
wage gap analysis

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.610
that is transparent I think
is very, very important.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.750
There's a law now in the UK
that just went into effect

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.780
that companies must report
their gender wage gap analysis.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.340
And would anyone
like to take a guess

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.620
of how many companies
in the UK pay

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.195
women more than they pay men?

00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:13.820
AUDIENCE: Zero?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.653
JOANNE LIPMAN: Zero.

00:07:14.653 --> 00:07:15.380
Exactly.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.340
Zero.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.650
Well, it's really important
to know that information

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.750
so that you can act
on that information.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.520
There are companies as
well that actually build it

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.800
into compensation
to incentivize,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.600
not just hiring, but training,
recruitment, promotion,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.590
and retaining diverse talent.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.630
Not just women, but
all diverse talent.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.620
I think that that's
very helpful.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.970
And then there are things
that we as individuals can do.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.640
But the bottom line
for organizations

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.359
is it really must
come from leadership.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:46.650
This is something I've learned.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.480
I've been traveling
around the country.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.580
And I think the frustration
that led to the walkout today

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.000
was a frustration in
that it's not that--

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.740
there's thousands of
women who have walked out.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.490
It's not like thousands of
women have been sexually abused

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.570
at work.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.660
But I think it's the
signal that that sends.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.540
When you have some bad
behavior at the top,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.480
the signal that it sends to
the rest of the organization

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.489
and through the
culture is that if you

00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:16.280
have that kind of
behavior at the top, then

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.870
what does that say
about how we value

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.120
women in the rest
of the organization?

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.940
And that translates into things
like respect, which there's

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.150
a huge respect gap
between men and women

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.480
that has been documented
in the research.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.700
And it's those kinds of things
that I think that individually

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.754
we all can address.

00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:36.140
RICHARD: Well, and as
you point out often,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.757
role modeling is key.

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:38.840
JOANNE LIPMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.157
And awareness is key.

00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:41.990
I mean, I talk a lot
about unconscious bias.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.656
When you read the
book, there's actually

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:46.130
a chapter focused on
Google and its efforts

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.810
to combat unconscious bias.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.010
And I spent time with a
fabulous unconscious bias expert

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.990
in your New York
office, Brian Welle.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.580
He was absolutely spectacular.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.410
Great researcher.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.190
But I think that the question
really in unconscious bias

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.880
is, it's so important.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.680
You have to be aware
of it all the time.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.910
And I know you guys have
unconscious bias trainings.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.800
But a couple of
hours of training

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.750
does not transform a culture.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.380
And so there's so
many things that we

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.804
need to be aware of
just in everyday life.

00:09:17.804 --> 00:09:19.970
Unconscious bias-- I'm sure
you all know what it is,

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.900
cause you've all been trained.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.400
Right.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.540
It's these biases we have
that are buried so deep

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.150
inside of us, we don't
even realize they exist.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.170
And we all have them.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.990
Men.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.490
Women.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.940
Black.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.440
White.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.480
No matter what,
we all have them.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.200
RICHARD: Effectively
about our tribes,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.936
in a sense, our
sense of tribalism.

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:35.810
JOANNE LIPMAN: It is.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.310
It is.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.910
And so we're not always
aware of how that impacts us.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.250
But just as a couple
of for instances,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.100
it turns out women are
interrupted three times more

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.600
frequently than men.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.190
Northwestern
actually did a study

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.110
of the Supreme Court
of the United States

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.510
and found that the
female Supreme Court

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.090
justices are interrupted
three times more

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.360
frequently than male
Supreme Court justices.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.310
Another thing that
probably every woman here

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.770
has experienced
is that thing that

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.410
happens when you're in a room.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.290
Generally, if women are
in a minority in a group,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.150
in a meeting,
which has certainly

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.750
happened to me many times,
and most of you probably,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.510
it is true.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.260
Your voices aren't heard.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.830
This research shows that if you
make up 30% or less of a room,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.150
literally the ear is tuned to
the male voices in the room.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
So how many women here
have had that experience,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.920
where you say
something in a meeting?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.380
And it's like nobody heard it.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.160
Crickets.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.210
Right?

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.240
And then two minutes later a guy
repeats exactly what you just

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
said, and everybody
just turns to him.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.580
They're like, Dave,
great idea you had, Dave.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.340
Well, that's happened
to me a million times.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.440
And I used to think
it was just me.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.600
But it turns out it
is in the research.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.610
That is actually
something that is very

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.930
common to almost all women.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.871
RICHARD: You mentioned
unconscious bias training.

00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:09.620
One of the things I
was surprised to learn

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.090
from the book was
the research that

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.680
tells us that diversity
training doesn't work

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.730
and that it's, in fact,
counterproductive.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.190
It felt counterintuitive to me.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.980
But also, as you
went into it, wise.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.130
And so I think it'd be
great for you to explain

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.580
like why is that the case?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.190
And more importantly,
what do you

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.660
think that tells us about how we
guide our workforce in building

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.017
a gender equal culture?

00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:37.850
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.110
So there is actually research.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.210
A Harvard professor by
the name of Frank Dobbin

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.280
did this research
where he looked at--

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.690
and this was at traditional
diversity training.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.810
So he looked at 30 years
of diversity training

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.240
at more than 800 companies.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.610
And he found that
for two groups,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.820
for women, as well as
for black men and women

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.550
that not only did it not work.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.580
It actually made things
worse for those two groups.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.360
In other words, those
two groups would

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.390
have fared better in those
companies had there been

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.640
no training at all.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.860
And he delved into
the reasons for this.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.890
And there were a
variety of reasons.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.960
But one of them was
that it was resentment

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.480
on the part of the
primarily white men who

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.990
were subject to the training.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.530
So I went back and found some
of these traditional trainers.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.280
And one of them actually
said to me, look,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.080
when we started diversity
training about 30 years ago,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.390
it was in response to lawsuits.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.730
And he said our
process basically

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.790
was beating white guys over
the head with a two by four

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.830
and trying to make
them feel guilty.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.870
And he said, and if
they cried, even better.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.380
So it had exactly the reverse
of the intended effect.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.960
That actually has
engendered and led

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.012
to the rise of
unconscious bias training.

00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:01.220
Because the idea with
unconscious bias training is we

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.950
all have it.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.460
We're not trying to make
you feel guilty about it.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.232
We're just trying to
help you interrupt it.

00:13:07.232 --> 00:13:09.440
But I think the issue with
unconscious bias training,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.080
you still do have people,
including you had a situation

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.190
here at Google as well.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.620
You do have people
who still feel

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.092
like they're getting beaten up.

00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:19.550
But I think the
larger issue really

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.740
is simply unconscious
bias training is not,

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.750
in and of itself, a fix.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.020
It is a piece of a culture.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.000
And that's what we really
need is a cultural overhaul.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.360
And that's not
specific to Google.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.990
Our corporate life
in this country

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.570
really needs to have
an overhaul in how

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.200
we interact with one another.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.660
RICHARD: I can't help
but think there's

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.670
something very deep in that.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.320
I mean, you mentioned,
for instance,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.340
just the dynamics of how
we guide, irrespective

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.475
of this issue, how we give
criticism to people, say,

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:00.370
in performance reviews.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.130
In one of the things
you mentioned.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.240
And also in terms of being
too shy about giving harsh

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.320
guidance.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.590
But, to me, I think the
larger lesson, which

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.090
I think we learn in all kinds
of ways in terms of parenting,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.160
is like it's always
so much better

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.810
to give an individual guidance
to how they can succeed,

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.530
and assume they will succeed,
rather than telling them

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.450
about all the things
they've done wrong,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.205
and assuming they will
continue to do it wrong.

00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:30.080
JOANNE LIPMAN: Right.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.310
I would totally agree with that.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.893
I would add in, there
is some research

00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:36.710
that shows us some of the biases
that creep into performance

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.290
reviews.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.990
So one actually is--

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.440
this stunned me actually.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.230
So in writing the
book, I traveled

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.240
around the country
and the world,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.060
seeking out primarily men
in positions of authority

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.920
who are trying to
close the gender gap.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.932
And the first question--

00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:56.390
Cause I wanted to learn from
them, what are the strategies?

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.550
Like what are success
stories and strategies

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.110
that we can all learn from?

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.180
But the first question
I would always ask

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.500
them is, tell me what
perplexes or frustrates you

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.420
about the women
who you work with?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.020
And I was stunned by how
many of these men said,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.220
I'm afraid she'll cry.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.770
Now, it is actually
true that younger women

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.740
do cry, biologically
speaking, more than older men.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.480
But the interesting
thing is these men

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.340
were afraid that they would
unintentionally say something

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.360
to a subordinate female
and unintentionally hurt

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.890
her feelings.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.790
But here's the thing.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.260
The research tells us, and
actually any women in this room

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.990
will also tell us that when
a woman does cry at work

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.480
it is not because her
feelings are hurt.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.660
It is because she's pissed off.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.910
She's furious.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.470
A woman crying at
work is actually

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.770
pretty much the same thing
as a man yelling at work.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.150
But these executive men.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.950
It has a serious consequence.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.110
Actually Catalyst did this
survey of executive men

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.850
and said, what might stand
in the way of you supporting

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.680
gender equality at work?

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.010
And it was more
than 70% of them--

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.980
I think it was 74%
of them cited fear.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.000
And part of the fear was
fear of loss of status,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.290
particularly among other men.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.130
But part of the fear was fear
of saying the wrong thing.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.010
And what that led to-- and
other research has shown

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.650
this-- is that these men who
were in positions of authority

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:31.360
are afraid to give candid
feedback to women in the way

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.280
that they give it to men.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.870
And what that
results in is women

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.310
getting many more of
these evaluations that

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.770
talk about their
personality, and often

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.720
have a personality critique.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.300
She's abrasive, or brash,
or aggressive, in a bad way.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.470
Versus men, who tend to
get very constructive,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.366
performance oriented critiques.

00:16:55.366 --> 00:16:56.740
And, again, that's
another thing.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.730
It's very subtle.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.070
But what that ends up
doing is giving men

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.110
more of the information
they need to succeed,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.580
and the women aren't getting it.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.490
RICHARD: And again,
so many insights

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.510
about unconscious bias,
into our cultural biases,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.750
into stereotypical
models of male behavior,

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.020
stereotypical models of societal
behavior, for that matter.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.099
And like you mentioned in the
book, that you wear high heels

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.990
to, in a sense, put
yourself closer,

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.319
on a more equal footing,
which interestingly

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.310
resonated with me in that I'm
not a particularly tall guy.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.880
I've raised a lot of money
from venture capital firms.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.400
And the end of that
process is always

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.770
you presenting to the full
partnership at their Monday

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.270
meeting.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.490
And talk about macho,
ego driven rooms.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.390
It's like way up there.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.130
And the ethos in VC firms
is, the idea is one thing,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.950
but it's all about the CEO
in a pretty extreme way.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.050
And when I would go into
those presentations,

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.320
I would literally sort
of puff myself up.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.102
I would stand several
inches taller.

00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:03.310
I would get closer to people.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.570
I'd use my arms.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.280
I would speak more loudly
to kind of present myself

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.852
in the way they were
expecting to see me.

00:18:13.852 --> 00:18:16.310
And I think there are obvious
techniques that work for all.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.010
But I couldn't help
in thinking about that

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.260
and saying-- in fact, my
wife, by the way, she jokes.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.730
She's like, you're the only
5'9" guy who thinks he's 6'2".

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.705
[LAUGHING]

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:26.330
JOANNE LIPMAN: I
thought you were 6'2".

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.650
RICHARD: See.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.340
But are we playing into
patriarchal models with that?

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.820
I mean, to what extent is
it about patriarchal models?

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.590
Or is it about societal models?

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.810
And how does that matter to
what we're talking about?

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.643
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:18:38.643 --> 00:18:40.540
Look, I mean, it
would be great for us

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.770
to be able to wipe out all
of these kinds of concerns

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.681
like that.

00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:46.180
Right.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.230
It would be terrific.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.900
But until then,
there are strategies.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.590
And what you experienced is
what women experience every day.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.205
And often many times a day.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:19:01.127
So I do wear high
heels every day.

00:19:01.127 --> 00:19:03.460
And I always thought it was
because I worked around men,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.640
and I wanted to have a
physically larger presence.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.700
But it turns out that
taller women earn

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.170
8% more than shorter women.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.740
Women who wear makeup earn
more than those who do not.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.890
Women who are thin out
earn those who are heavy.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.290
And people, generally, men and
women, who are better looking

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:21.790
earn more.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.690
RICHARD: And taller.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.400
JOANNE LIPMAN: And taller.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.910
Earn more.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.130
RICHARD: CEOs and height
is a fascinating--

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.480
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yep.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.440
It is an actual--

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.260
it's a thing.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.370
It's a real thing.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.750
But for women, grooming
actually counts much more.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.224
And there was this
great calculation.

00:19:33.224 --> 00:19:35.140
Debora Spar, who was the
president of Barnard,

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.380
calculated that over
the course of her career

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.550
a professional woman will spend
a total of five full years

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.180
longer than her male
spouse or colleague

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.520
getting ready for work.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.670
The hair, the makeup,
just maintenance.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.080
Which I found fascinating.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.095
But, again, the world
that we live in,

00:19:57.095 --> 00:20:00.730
and including Google, I mean,
the work world that we live in

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.190
was created by men for men.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.539
And so women are, in a
sense, trying every day.

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:10.330
There's 1,000 things
we do, some conscious,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.932
some unconscious to try and fit
into the world created by men.

00:20:13.932 --> 00:20:16.140
And a huge reason why I
wrote "That's What She Said,"

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.090
was to make men aware--

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.830
I actually geared
the book toward men,

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.260
even though it's for
women as well, obviously.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.597
But I really want
to bring men in

00:20:24.597 --> 00:20:26.430
to understand what some
of these issues are,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.470
just so that they have
an awareness of it.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.030
Because women are leaning in
so far we're falling over.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.380
But the men who I
spoke to were awesome.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.650
And these are guys
who realize that they

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.790
have to reach out as well.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.450
It's not just a one sided thing.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.950
And I do think that there's
been a little bit of too

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.020
much of an onus put
on women, particularly

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.110
in these past few years,
that it's all on us.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.920
And we have to demand to
be paid what we're worth.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:57.750
We have to go out there
and fix the patriarchy.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.750
But, in fact, actually this
is a two sided equation.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:05.550
And we need the men to recognize
that as well, and join us.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.450
RICHARD: I'm going to
move to the audience.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.070
There's a question
on the Dory that I

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.646
think relates to what
we're talking about here.

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:16.770
This person says, you have
talked about differences

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.930
in the ways that women
and men typically

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.430
present their thoughts.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.400
Suggestions versus declarations.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.980
Not all men and women
present in the typical way.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.460
How much of the lack of
respect for those approaches

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.390
do you attribute to the
approach itself, the technique,

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.077
versus speakers' gender?

00:21:35.077 --> 00:21:35.910
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:36.780
That's a great question.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.196
And the first thing
I would say is

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:42.780
that it is documented that
women do use more hedging

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.310
language than men do.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.230
And that would be things like,
I hate to bother you, but.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.830
You know, this might be
a stupid question, but.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.710
We use more up speak, like
when we ask a question, when

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.390
we mean a statement.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.880
And we apologize all the time.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.620
And we are not sorry.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.117
But we use that verbal tic.

00:22:00.117 --> 00:22:01.950
And we're highly aware
of these verbal tics.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.565
And we try like crazy
to counteract them.

00:22:04.565 --> 00:22:05.940
But the other
thing I will say is

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.720
I've heard from so many readers
of "That's What She Said,"

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.500
because all of this applies not
just to women, but to pretty

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.950
much anyone who's in an
under represented group.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.601
And so much of the
research I cite also deals,

00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:21.850
not just with women, but
with underrepresented groups.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.200
And one of the groups of readers
that I have heard a lot from

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.610
is introverted men, who
say all of these behaviors

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.190
are my behaviors as
well, and I suffer

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.060
from the same consequences.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.330
So I think it's highly relevant.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.900
And that's why it's so
important to be aware of it,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.800
because right now it is
the norm of behavior.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.700
And women have spent many
years trying to fit that norm.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.030
And what we need to do
is have men be aware,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.980
and women, all of
us, kind of be aware

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.750
of these different
communication styles,

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.257
and just be more
sensitive to those.

00:22:57.257 --> 00:22:57.840
RICHARD: Yeah.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.500
I want to be specific to that.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.749
And I'm going to take the
next question from the room.

00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:03.950
So get your thoughts together.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.460
A couple of things there.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.350
You mention in the book about
how important mentoring is.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.750
You mention how often senior
men are uncomfortable,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.340
concerned about perceptions
in mentoring younger women,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.470
which, frankly, I kind
of think is a cop out.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.020
I think if we can't, as
professionals, figure out

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.320
how to manage that
dynamic, then probably you

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.370
shouldn't be doing
what you're doing.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.090
But let's put that aside.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.730
In my own experience,
particularly

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.320
in my more advanced
stage, as it were--

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.040
meaning I'm old, I
do enjoy, and one

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.940
of my great pleasures at Google
is trying to coach people.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.540
I say try.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.915
I don't know how
good at it I am.

00:23:49.915 --> 00:23:53.550
But I've also sensed
that in this engineering

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:58.860
centric culture, it's not
just about men and women.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.790
I mean, it's not just
about women in this regard.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.370
That there are many folks
here who are introverted,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.660
not self assertive.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.410
But the question
I have for you is,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.280
today I try to coach women in
pretty much the same way as I

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.980
coach men.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.840
But are there
different approaches

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.530
that one should take place?

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.530
Or is it just about
different sensitivities?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.960
JOANNE LIPMAN: So,
first of all, I 100%

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.750
agree with you about
being a cop out.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.952
There are men out there
who say, oh, like #MeToo.

00:24:33.952 --> 00:24:35.410
I'm never going to
talk to a woman.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.999
I can't mentor a woman.

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:38.040
And that's just bullshit.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.540
Sorry.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.990
I have no patience for that.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:44.610
That's generally men who
aren't mentoring women anyway.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.100
But there are many, many
different ways to mentor.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.900
And I think that the
big difference is,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.390
and that we know
from the research

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.070
that women tend to have
mentors who give them advice.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.100
Men tend to have what
are known as sponsors

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.630
who can get them promotions.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.309
And so actually that Harvard
research I mentioned earlier,

00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:06.600
Frank Dobbin, when he was
looking at what are solutions

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.170
that work, versus the old
fashioned diversity training,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.560
one of them was formal
mentorship programs.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.910
And the idea with a
formal mentorship program

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.020
is it's not that I am mentoring
Susan because she's a woman.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.030
It is because I am
mentoring whoever it is

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.520
because they are in my field.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.010
And very often what
ends up happening is

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.550
senior women end up
being paired with

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:34.240
or sought out by other
women, but they're not

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.990
in the same field.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.471
They can't help.

00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:36.970
Right.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.540
And it's not gender
mentoring gender.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.150
You want to be mentored by
somebody who can actually

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.560
help you advance.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.472
And I think that's the
big, big difference.

00:25:47.472 --> 00:25:49.180
RICHARD: Is there a
question in the room.

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:55.210
AUDIENCE: I think what you're
saying is so interesting,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.450
because when I look back
over the course of my career,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.230
no one has done more for me
in my career than white men.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.940
Right.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.830
And I work with so many women.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.660
And I offer my
mentorship to them,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.840
and sponsorship in
certain cases as well.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.880
And what I often hear
is there's just not

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.526
enough females in
leadership positions.

00:26:14.526 --> 00:26:15.900
So I just don't
have any mentors.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.740
I don't have any sponsors.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.455
And my thought there is like,
it doesn't have to be a woman.

00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:22.330
JOANNE LIPMAN: Right.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.496
AUDIENCE: Look to these men.

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:25.360
Because they are in
the positions of power.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.610
And they will do a lot for you.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.540
And I wonder if there's an
oversaturation of just--

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.300
like these men don't
have enough time to--

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.860
there's few of
them, I would say,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.260
who are as connected
to women in the way

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.230
that the women want them to be.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.730
And I'm wondering, what can
we do to enable more men

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.400
to understand how women
need to be mentored,

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.250
and what they expect
from sponsorships?

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.380
Because so much of it
comes back to your point

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.050
around women in a lot of
underrepresented groups

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.440
actually don't get the
critical skill based feedback

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440
that they need.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.500
They're not getting
skill based mentorship.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.410
And that continues the
vicious cycle of people

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.660
not sort of understanding
what really needs to happen,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.030
because there's a fear
of hurting feelings,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.120
or that sensitivity.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.139
So does that--

00:27:13.139 --> 00:27:13.930
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yes.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.010
You made a great point.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.340
And actually what
you're talking about

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.310
is why this Harvard professor
said these formal programs are

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.600
actually more effective.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.840
And, in fact, there are
a couple of organizations

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.450
that I cite in the book
that put into effect

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.814
these formal programs.

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:32.230
And they found that it helped
with retention and promotion

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.544
not just of the people
who are being mentored.

00:27:34.544 --> 00:27:36.460
But it helped with
retention of the people who

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.870
were doing the mentoring, which
was also really interesting.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.440
But yes.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.680
I think we have to think about
that skills based mentoring.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.260
We have a tendency,
all of us as humans,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.920
to gravitate toward people
who remind us of ourselves.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.440
And that has been a huge issue.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.240
One of the solutions, one of
my recommendations in "That's

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.900
What She Said" is to
have a Rooney rule.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.670
So you guys know what
the Rooney rule is?

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.700
It's in football.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.900
If you have an opening, you
need to have a diverse slate

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.900
of candidates to choose from.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.380
But what I'm recommending, and
what I learned from the men

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.760
who I interviewed was
that's not enough.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.000
You actually need to have
a diversity of people

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.620
who are doing the interviewing.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.960
And that goes to whether
they are thinking

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.210
about looking at
somebody to be promoted,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.010
or filling an opening.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.630
You need a diverse
slate of people.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.790
Because if you've got
a bunch of white guys

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.460
who are evaluating a
diverse group of people,

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.030
you still do not get
an optimal result.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.950
And the other thing I will
say as, so many companies

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.280
that I visit with say,
oh, we really want

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.050
women in our senior ranks.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.970
But we can't find any.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.490
And to them I say,
and to Google I say,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.150
look in your junior ranks.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:50.650
Look.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.480
What's happening there?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.510
Look at who are the
people who are coming in.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.790
Look at every single
level, especially

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.670
in those low lower levels
leading to middle management.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.490
Look at every level and
see who are you promoting

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.480
and who are you not?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.220
Who are you losing
and who are you not?

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.290
Because there is
leakage in there.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:13.880
And there's people who are being
passed over who should not be.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.870
And if you do that,
it's not going

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.800
to take you that long until
you've grown your own leaders.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.390
Actually so I spoke at one
of the big consulting firms.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.080
And I had dinner afterward
with a table of 10 senior women

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.430
at this consulting firm.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.280
And they went around the
table, and all of them

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.207
had been recruited by other
major consulting firms,

00:29:37.207 --> 00:29:39.040
because they were already
at a senior level.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.060
And that's the problem.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.600
If we're just shuffling
around the same too few women

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.610
at the top, we are not
going to get anywhere.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:47.110
Right.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.169
I spoke to a bank
that, before I went,

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:51.460
I did a little bit of research.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.320
And I found that they
had made a commitment

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.892
to gender equality in 1982.

00:29:56.892 --> 00:29:57.850
I'm speaking to a room.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.810
I said, most of you guys
were not born in 1982.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.470
You had plenty of time to get
yourself to gender equality.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.360
But they're losing the
women on the way up,

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.200
and they're not growing
their own leaders.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.242
And I think that
is so essential.

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.950
Not enough companies
are focused on that.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:13.533
RICHARD: Yeah.

00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:15.440
I think that's so true.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.290
By the way, one other
thing, I think, again,

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.990
on trying to facilitate
mentoring and mentoring

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:27.050
programs, one thing I feel it's
also important to recognize

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:35.510
is to encourage people to
ask someone for mentoring.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.519
Not be shy about that.

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:38.060
I mean, when you
think about it, it's

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.490
actually kind of a nice
ego inflating thing

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.570
if someone comes and
says, can you help me?

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.869
Like you know more than I do.

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:45.785
You've been around the
track a few more times.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.467
That's a very simple path if you
can be comfortable doing that.

00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:57.050
JOANNE LIPMAN: So that's the key
is if you can be comfortable.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.925
I mean, yes, I agree.

00:30:57.925 --> 00:30:58.760
That's a great idea.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.740
But I think, again,
it puts the onus

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.690
on the person with less power.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.890
And we put too much onus already
on the people with less power.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.560
We need to put more on
the people with power.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.540
And, in fact, while I
was writing the book--

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.950
and I was at
Gannet-- it actually

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.200
changed the way I managed.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.850
And I started
realizing that when

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.240
we had openings, and especially
like with internal openings,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.730
I'd have all these guys who
would put their hands up

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.450
for it.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:28.280
But there would be women
or minority people of color

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.980
who were not putting
their hands up

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.370
who would have been very
qualified in the pool.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.180
So I took it on myself to
say-- cause I was in the middle

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:35.930
of this research--

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.013
I was like, wait a second.

00:31:37.013 --> 00:31:41.117
So I would actually go into the
newsroom and talk to people,

00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:42.950
and bring them into my
office, and say, hey,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.960
I see you didn't
put your hand up.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.260
You should know that you are
qualified to be in this pool.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.630
It doesn't mean that
you would get the job.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.970
And I'm not telling you you
have to put your hat in.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.020
But you should know that.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.540
And if you're not
interested, let's

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.060
talk about what you might be
interested in down the line.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.910
And I realized,
belatedly I think,

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.240
that it was really my
responsibility as a leader

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:10.220
to go out and make sure that
these people who have talent

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.080
are given these opportunities.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.440
And it shouldn't always
be on their head.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.850
RICHARD: Excellent point.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.480
I'm going to move
to our virtual-- oh,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.230
we have an un-virtual
audience right here.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.500
[LAUGHS]

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.450
Sometimes at an
individual level,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.490
we will see managers
behaving in ways

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.820
that are not as
egregious as firing,

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:41.870
but still are kind of leading
to outcomes that decrease

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.820
diversity.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:49.840
And I have thought about
speaking up many a time,

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.720
and I've had male mentors for
me who cared about me personally

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.400
who advised me not to speak up,
that it would hurt my career.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.650
And one of the few
times that I did

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.250
choose to do that,
suddenly I did feel

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.870
some pretty bad consequences.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:15.140
So what is your advice to
people who are seeing things

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.595
that are in the gray area?

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.630
What kinds of actions
are actually productive,

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.970
cause I haven't figured it out?

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.803
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:26.775
This is where allyship
is so important.

00:33:26.775 --> 00:33:28.150
I mean, what you're
talking about

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.930
is so common in
all organizations.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.410
And I talk a lot about
different kinds of allies,

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.900
women with women, or with men.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.224
But that's what's so important.

00:33:39.224 --> 00:33:40.640
I mean, I think
one of the issues,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.970
particularly that women
face, is particularly

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.760
if this behavior is
directed at them,

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.060
and maybe it doesn't rise
to the level of firing,

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.820
but it is demeaning,
perhaps, or dismissive,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.730
and the women feel
like, ugh, I've

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.910
got to figure out how
to deal with this.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.710
And that's where allies come in.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.750
In the case that
you're talking about,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.600
I would have hoped
that the mentors,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.060
they would have stepped
up and intervened.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.370
And that's the kind of behavior
that we want to encourage,

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.650
that kind of allyship.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:17.030
And I tell people that your ally
can be somebody at your level.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.969
It can be somebody in
a different department.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:21.010
I have found in different
organizations sometimes

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.570
I have been
approached by somebody

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.000
who doesn't report to me
who's not in my department

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.690
to tell me about some
sort of behavioral issues

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:29.409
with a manager.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.259
And it's really
important to do that.

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:32.800
And one of the
reasons it's important

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.590
is because I can say
almost every time, maybe

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.420
every time that has
ever happened to me,

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.300
where I've been approached
where somebody says,

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.850
I don't want to bring
it up to my boss, but--

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.730
almost always the person
they're talking about

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.090
has a history of bad behavior.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.510
So you need to surface
that so that the person can

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.120
be either talked to,
disciplined, dismissed,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.330
whatever the correct
course of action is.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.340
Too often we stay quiet.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.867
And that's why it's
important to have that ally.

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:04.450
And I'm sure, Richard,
you've probably

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.040
had this situation too.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.701
You're one of the good guys.

00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:08.200
Right?

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.160
So I can imagine somebody coming
to you and confiding in you.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.680
But I would imagine you
wouldn't tell them to be quiet.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.140
You would try and--

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.710
RICHARD: No.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.346
I mean, and can't say
as I know always what

00:35:19.346 --> 00:35:20.470
the perfect techniques are.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.340
But yes.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.290
In many of those
circumstances, I mean,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:28.570
it's understandable that
the individual confronting

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.480
the manager is not likely
to achieve the best

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.340
result, in both ways,
for that matter,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.460
and end up with a
consequence you don't like.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.840
Which is why you'd like to think
that organizations would have

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.100
people and mechanisms to address
that, because in that context,

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.500
depending on the
circumstance, yeah,

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.970
there are ways to address that.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.650
And there are ways
to address that

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.500
without the individual
being, in a sense, brought

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.340
into the equation.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.350
JOANNE LIPMAN: Right.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.170
RICHARD: It's bad behavior.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.490
I don't have to
declare who complained.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.950
There are lots of clever ways
to deal with that, I think,

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:06.869
if you try.

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:08.410
JOANNE LIPMAN: I
can mention actually

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.080
two quick ones, because these
both worked in real life.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.532
So one was, I was talking
to a senior executive

00:36:13.532 --> 00:36:14.740
while I was out on book tour.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.620
And the senior executive of a
big consumer products company

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.420
came up to me to tell me.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.769
He said he had a
team, senior team.

00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.560
And he said, there was
a woman on his team.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.820
And she was like a
real ball buster.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.420
She was great.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.930
Like he didn't worry about her.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.300
But she came to him
privately and said,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.580
hey, have you noticed that
when we are in our meetings

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.860
there is this particular guy
who every time I open my mouth,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.380
he shuts me down,
or cuts me off,

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.300
or takes credit for my idea.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.880
And this boss said,
actually I had not noticed.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.180
But once I did, he said,
we made a secret pact.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.760
And the secret pact
was, I was going

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.240
to be on the lookout
for that behavior.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.770
And every time I
saw it, I was going

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.260
to intervene and back her up.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.934
And he wouldn't have known
had she not mentioned that.

00:36:55.934 --> 00:36:57.850
And one other example,
which happened with me,

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.040
was somebody not
in my department

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.924
came to me at an
organization and said,

00:37:03.924 --> 00:37:05.590
I don't want to
complain to my own boss,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.370
but there is a particular
guy who is dismissive.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.084
And I know another woman
who quit because she didn't

00:37:12.084 --> 00:37:13.250
like the way he treated her.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.950
But it's not like he's hitting
on us, or anything like that.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.440
It's just dismissive behavior.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.680
So I actually went
to a friend in HR.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.180
And the friend said,
I'm so glad you

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:27.170
came to me because that
particular guy has a record.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.510
I didn't know that.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.260
But that's why
it's so important.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.079
Like they needed
this information.

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:34.120
They needed to know this
information so that they

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.240
could take the proper action.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.040
RICHARD: In some
cases what I've done--

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.320
and, again, so much depends
on the circumstance,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.470
is in providing that feedback
to the individual is you

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.700
sort of like multiply it.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.200
Right.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.549
And say like, I'm
getting feedback.

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:49.340
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yes.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.680
RICHARD: And it's not
necessarily singular

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.870
if you're getting feedback.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.145
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yep.

00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:53.080
RICHARD: And it
obviously that doesn't

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.350
work in all circumstances.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.160
And I get that.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.790
I think one of the
last ones was like,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.570
Richard, you use a
lot of foul language.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.300
Some people are
uncomfortable with that.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.490
And I see some people
I work with laughing.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.870
I haven't yet mastered
the solution to that.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.090
But I'm trying.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.506
JOANNE LIPMAN:
Question over here.

00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:12.047
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:13.940
JOANNE LIPMAN: Hi.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.230
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question about when

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.280
working towards
closing the gender gap,

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.990
how do we make sure that people
that don't identify as gender

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.806
binary fall through the cracks?

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.430
JOANNE LIPMAN: That's
a great question.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.880
And I make a real effort
in "That's What She Said"

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.730
to look at research that is--

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.450
the book itself is gender,
but I make a real effort

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.167
to look at
underrepresented groups.

00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:42.750
And I think what
you're talking about,

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.060
people that you're talking
about fall into the category

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.390
of underrepresented groups.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.460
And if you're
talking about people

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:55.830
who are not gender binary, or
people who fall into other--

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.670
religious minority.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.320
I mean, there are a lot of
people who, unfortunately,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.600
experience these same issues.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.480
And I think a lot of the
same strategies hold.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.660
And I was very cognizant
of that as I put together

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.880
the cheat sheet at
the end of the book

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.310
for recommendations
of things we can do.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.650
And I'm actually
working, as we speak,

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.950
on updating the
book for paperback

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:24.240
to look separately for
individuals, steps we can take,

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.472
and organizations, steps that
organizations should be taking.

00:39:27.472 --> 00:39:29.240
RICHARD: Thank you.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.490
I'm going to go to
our virtual audience.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.130
How much of a company's
actions are attributed

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.630
to it being self-serving?

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.860
A quote I've heard is that human
resources will help someone

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.897
as long as it doesn't go against
the interests of the company.

00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:44.730
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.060
So I think that your allies
when I'm talking about allyship

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.250
is not necessarily HR.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.025
HR does have a role in
protecting the company.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.079
What I strongly feel is the best
way to overhaul the culture,

00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:03.120
it really does have to
start with the leadership.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.130
The leadership has to
not just talk the talk,

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.421
but they have to walk the walk.

00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:09.030
They have to model the behavior.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:14.940
And I also think
that incentives need

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.390
to be modeled as
well, to incentivize

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.710
the right kinds of behaviors.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.840
We all react according
to incentives.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.540
And if our incentives
have nothing

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.590
to do with kind of the
inclusion and diversity,

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.720
then we're not going
to pay attention to it.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.580
And I have met some amazing DNI
professionals in my travels.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.830
But they alone cannot
change a culture.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.280
Really only the
leadership can do that.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.770
RICHARD: I'm going to probe
you to add a little bit more

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:48.600
to that, because it's absolutely
true that companies operate out

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.350
of self-interest.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.190
I mean, they should.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:54.210
It's the nature
of its existence,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.150
rewarding its shareholders,
so on and so forth.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:01.920
To me the objective,
indeed the opportunity,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.120
is how do you guide that to
be more self enlightened.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.250
Or enlightened self-interest
is what I'm trying to say.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.450
And you talk a lot in
the book about examples

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.390
of how companies are stronger
when they have gender

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.030
diversity, how they design
better products when

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.240
they have gender diversity.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.540
So to me, that's the
enlightened self-interest.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.357
How do you build a
talented workforce?

00:41:24.357 --> 00:41:25.440
JOANNE LIPMAN: Absolutely.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.040
Absolutely.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.690
So every piece of
research shows you,

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:29.315
and you've probably
heard some of this,

00:41:29.315 --> 00:41:32.460
that a gender balanced
leadership and a gender

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.220
balanced organization is
actually more successful.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.600
By every financial measure.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.060
And that goes for your
board of directors.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.310
Companies that have the
most women on boards

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.160
are more financially successful
than those with the least.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.080
Companies with gender
balanced leadership

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.350
outperform those
without by a factor

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.590
of like a double digit
percentage in terms

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.850
of return on equity.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.480
But also, work groups.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.220
Gender balanced work groups
are better at problem solving.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.160
They're more creative when
it comes to solutions.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.570
There was even
this research that

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.410
showed that they are more
accurate in solving a murder.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.120
There was this
research where they

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.660
had this all-male, all-female,
and mixed gender group,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.780
and they gave them a real
life murder case to solve.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:21.330
And both single sex groups had
so much fun with this exercise.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.390
And they agreed very quickly
on who the culprit was.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.340
And they were very
confident of the result.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.030
The mixed gender
group took longer.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.560
It was less fun.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.880
There was more back and forth.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.860
They were less
confident of the result.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.090
But guess who was right.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.870
They were right.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.536
They were right.

00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:41.040
Because you need that input
from a variety of perspectives

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.520
to really come to your
ultimate best solution.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.720
RICHARD: So another
question from the audience.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.970
While Google strives
for diversity,

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.240
it can be a challenge when
rank and file managers do not

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.360
value diversity of
opinions, or recognize

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.510
employees who approach problems
from a different perspective.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.530
How can that be managed?

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.740
Now, actually this kind
of hits home with me,

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.350
because this is
something where I feel I

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.590
often have to kind
of remind myself

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:15.420
to engender multiple
opinions, and, frankly,

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.770
break through my own thinking.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.520
I mean, I think there's this
interesting psychological

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.422
element that as any of us become
more confident in what we do,

00:43:25.422 --> 00:43:27.130
more confident in
whether it's leadership

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:31.090
skills or our knowledge, you
also inherently kind of start

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.250
to close your mind a little bit.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.740
And it takes effort
to break through.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.657
And I don't feel like
I've mastered that at all.

00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:39.490
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.330
I think that is a great point.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:47.020
And that's part of
the awareness factor.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.875
Being aware that
you tend to like--

00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:53.680
I've been in organizations where
they say, oh, the boss really

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.732
likes brassy women.

00:43:55.732 --> 00:43:57.190
Well, what if you're
a quiet woman?

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.870
Right.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.160
You really have
to check yourself.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.030
And, again, I do think that
this is an issue that we

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.757
see a lot of in companies where
you have sort of enlightened

00:44:06.757 --> 00:44:08.590
leadership-- particularly
in big companies--

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:09.430
enlightened leadership.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.690
But then you hear,
you know what?

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.740
It's not trickling down.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.880
I have a manager who doesn't
value what the company is

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.400
valuing, in terms of
diversity of opinion,

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.950
diversity of approach.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.450
And I do think,
again, that is why

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:32.360
I think we have these
intractable cultural issues,

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.020
which is what leads
to things like today,

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.970
where we had thousands
of people in the walkout.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.950
But ultimately,
sometimes that's what

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:45.947
you need to move the needle,
to actually affect change.

00:44:45.947 --> 00:44:47.530
AUDIENCE: At the
beginning of the talk

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.370
you mentioned that women
only leadership trainings

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:55.790
and conversations can be so
valuable for that audience.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.860
You also mentioned the
statistic about women getting

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.030
interrupted in mixed company,
and also diversity training

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.590
backfiring.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.570
So I wonder, how
do you recommend

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.780
that we bridge those divides,
besides just sort of waiting

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.960
for male allies to self identify
and proactively approach

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.266
the group in order to learn more
about the women's perspective?

00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:20.140
JOANNE LIPMAN: Right.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.790
So I actually advise women's
ERGs, Employee Resource Groups,

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.669
to invite men.

00:45:26.669 --> 00:45:28.460
You don't have to invite
them all the time.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:33.760
But there is a great example
of a firm where it was

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.710
a very male dominated company.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.110
And they had a women's meeting.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.740
It's not a company
as big as Google.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.380
So they had an all
women's meeting

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.570
for all of their North
America operations.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.120
And they decided we're going
to have just a women's meeting.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.270
And then the few senior
women said, you know what?

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.460
For a portion of this
meeting we're each

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.560
going to invite a senior man.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:58.180
And it turned out that those
invitations were so coveted

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.150
that all the senior men were
like lobbying to get invited.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.410
And like, did you get invited?

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:02.910
Right.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.280
It was like a big deal.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.830
And the beauty of that was
that these senior men came.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.830
They wouldn't have thought
of volunteering themselves.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:16.840
But when they were invited
into this conversation, first

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.250
of all, they were able to hear
what's going on with the women.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.520
But secondly, and I think
this is just as important,

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.710
they were able to create
these bonds and relationships

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.570
with the women in the firm.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.720
And they were exposed to
the junior women in the firm

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.880
as well, who they
normally would not

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.590
have really interacted with.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.540
So that means, and
this is what they

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:42.750
found, that when it comes
time for big assignments,

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.090
for the star assignments, when
it comes time for promotions,

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.790
these younger women
are now known.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:49.930
They're top of mind.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.550
And it actually helps with
bringing them all together.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.630
So I do think that we have
to bring in both sides here.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.670
And when I go and talk
to women's groups,

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.400
I always ask them
to invite some men.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.350
I'm speaking tomorrow.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.270
There's a women's power
summit in Hollywood.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.750
So I'm going to LA to
talk at this meeting.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.430
But I am in the one session
where it's about men.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.990
And we'll be talking with men.

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:18.520
And men are invited
into the group.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.500
Because I feel really strongly
that's where we need to go.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.485
And the men are
excited to be there.

00:47:26.485 --> 00:47:28.860
RICHARD: By the way, you spent
so much time on this book.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.510
You did a ton of research.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.620
What surprised you?

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.197
What challenged your own
assumptions and conclusions?

00:47:36.197 --> 00:47:38.410
JOANNE LIPMAN: So a lot.

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.940
But I would say probably
one of the top issues

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.930
that I found as I was
doing the research--

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.250
and there's about 50 pages of
research notes in the back.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.290
As I was diving
into the research

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.850
I came across so many of these
issues that I, my entire life,

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.740
have thought they were just me.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.380
I thought it was my
problem and just me.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.980
And I was stunned to find
that it is not just me,

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.240
that it is common to women.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.830
It is common to people in
underrepresented groups.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.170
And so I think that was
probably the biggest surprise.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.690
And then the other part
of it on the plus side

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:18.190
was it really did change the
way I behave as a manager,

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:21.720
both in terms of things
like being really focused

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.650
on the people who are not
raising their hands for a job.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.930
And also being
really focused on who

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.624
is in the conversation
when you're

00:48:29.624 --> 00:48:31.290
talking about who
should get a promotion

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:32.380
or who should get a bonus.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:32.880
Right.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.088
Understanding that we need
that diversity of opinion.

00:48:38.276 --> 00:48:40.150
RICHARD: Being no other
questions on the Dory

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:44.974
here, how has the experience
of the book impacted you

00:48:44.974 --> 00:48:47.140
in the sense of the next
chapter of your own career?

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.935
I mean, you achieved
great professional success

00:48:50.935 --> 00:48:53.320
in media organizations,
leadership positions.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.040
But this is a very different
role that you're in.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.340
So where do you see
this taking you,

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.690
professionally, personally?

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:01.990
JOANNE LIPMAN: Yeah.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.000
It's been fascinating.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.480
So since the book came out,
I've actually been speaking.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.620
I've been kind of
nonstop talking,

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.500
speaking with, meeting
with organizations.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.350
And what happened was I started
the book three years ago.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.300
So this was long before #MeToo.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.500
And then #MeToo happened.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:22.420
And on the plus side, there
is a growing realization

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.180
among organizations,
including very male dominated

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.887
organizations like this one
that we haven't done enough.

00:49:27.887 --> 00:49:30.220
And that there are things
that we have tolerated that we

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.810
shouldn't be tolerating.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.430
And there is a lot
of soul searching

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.140
about what do we do about it?

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.600
So I've been unexpectedly--

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.060
I expected I would write the
book, and go on book tour

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.520
for two weeks, as
one does with a book.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.970
And instead it's just been
sort of endlessly rolling,

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.410
because there is
a lot of interest

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.480
among these organizations
in trying to crack

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.560
the nut of where do we go next?

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.624
And how do we solve this issue?

00:49:56.624 --> 00:49:58.540
I will also tell you, I
have some frustrations

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:03.790
in that it's been a year since
#MeToo, since Harvey Weinstein.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.850
And there's been a lot
of talk, which is great.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.030
There has not been
enough action.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:14.720
And, again, I come back
to the walkout today,

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.270
which I found so inspiring.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.660
But what the walkout
is doing is it

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.300
is a microcosm, or
maybe a macrocosm,

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.730
of what I am seeing
around the country

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.190
as I talk to companies
in other industries

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.190
who are saying exactly
what you guys are saying,

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:36.040
which is, OK, we hear you, that
you're saying the right things.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.560
But we need to see action.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.360
We need to see movement.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.890
And that is not
unique to Google.

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.510
I am seeing that all
over the country.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.547
And, in fact, globally as well.

00:50:48.547 --> 00:50:50.380
I've been traveling
internationally as well,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.088
talking about the same
issues, and seeing

00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:54.250
the same conversation.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.920
RICHARD: Well, I do hope
that you're thinking

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.870
and expressions on this, it can
help move that forward further.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:08.150
Obviously, this is not
likely to be a short battle.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:11.522
So I so appreciate what you've
done, what you've shared.

00:51:11.522 --> 00:51:12.980
I mean, as I said
at the beginning,

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.940
I think these are just
extraordinary challenging

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.810
times, divisive times in so
many dimensions in our society.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:25.900
And for gender equality,
the situation in politics,

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.170
I so believe that the only
way we can address divisions

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.280
is to find a way
to build bridges,

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.000
is to find a way to talk
across the divide, to find

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.860
the right language,
the right solutions,

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.821
the right constructive
approaches.

00:51:39.821 --> 00:51:42.320
This has been an interesting
and challenging time at Google.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.420
I've worked here
for nearly 10 years.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.090
And I have always
believed, and I

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:51.710
do believe that it's a very
different company than most.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.420
It's a company that
cares about principles,

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.000
that cares about
its culture, which

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.710
doesn't mean it's perfect.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.440
It's not.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.790
In fact, it won't ever be.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:01.580
And I think that we
have to always assume

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.742
that our culture is not perfect.

00:52:04.742 --> 00:52:06.200
But I do think our
only way forward

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:12.140
is to engage, to challenge
each other's perspectives,

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.220
challenge each other
productively, constructively,

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:20.780
and give them paths to success,
rather than just assume

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.660
failure.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.670
JOANNE LIPMAN: There
are also some things--

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:23.600
and I know we're
running out of time.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.225
But there are also
some things that are

00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:28.670
very specific to technology.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.460
So I on just two quick ones.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:36.050
One is just in
terms of algorithms,

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:40.172
and who's doing the coding,
who's code is accepted.

00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:41.630
You probably know
this, but there's

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.394
been some blind taste tests.

00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:44.810
So there was one
done with GitHub,

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.600
which has open source coding.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.510
And when coding was
submitted anonymously,

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.720
women's code was accepted
more often than men's code.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.010
So you could conclude that
women are better coders.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.040
But when names were
attached to the code,

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.760
men's code was accepted at a
greater rate than women's code.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.380
There was an
engineer at Facebook

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.970
who did a similar experiment.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:09.750
And Facebook disputes this.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.710
But this engineer
claimed that code

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.870
written by females
at Facebook was

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.140
35% less likely to be accepted
than code written by men.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.330
And then the other piece
that that works into

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.460
is your algorithm.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.010
So when I go out on the road I
have like a little PowerPoint

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:26.676
that when I talk about
unconscious bias,

00:53:26.676 --> 00:53:29.000
I show just Google
image searches

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.510
for various things that show
partly our unconscious bias.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.570
One example is
while I was writing

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:44.000
the book I just did a search
for CEO, an image search.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.210
And it was all men,
except for one woman.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:50.780
And the one woman
was CEO Barbie.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:55.580
And that reflects our
own unconscious bias,

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.030
but it also is spit out
to us by an algorithm.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.310
And the algorithms are
largely written by men.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:04.760
So we have these very ingrained,
not intentional, but sort

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.175
of ingrained issues that I
think also are specific to tech.

00:54:08.175 --> 00:54:09.800
And then one other
that I would mention

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.580
is just simply, in working on
the book, I spent time here.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.945
And I spent time in the
Chelsea office in New York.

00:54:16.945 --> 00:54:17.570
And I loved it.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:18.528
And I had a great time.

00:54:18.528 --> 00:54:22.310
But I come from a
male dominated world.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:26.600
But I noticed that to go
to the cafe in New York,

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.100
you pass the LEGO room.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.410
You pass the game room.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.760
And at the end after
spending time and hearing

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.850
about all the great things
you were doing to try and get

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:40.580
to gender balance, I just
spoke to a group of women

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.750
in the New York office.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:45.397
And just as we're walking
through that office I said,

00:54:45.397 --> 00:54:46.730
I see the guys in the game room.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.200
I said, do you guys ever
go to the game room?

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.616
And they're like,
are you kidding?

00:54:49.616 --> 00:54:50.880
We want to be taken seriously.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.230
We would never do that.

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.810
And it's just these
little things.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.960
And it wasn't like they
were complaining about it.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.450
But it's a very
gendered environment.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:01.190
And it just made me wonder.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:02.750
Because it really was decorated.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.520
I had this sense of deja vu.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.010
And I swear to god,
I finally realized

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:10.970
that the Google office was
decorated like the bedroom

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.800
of my 10-year-old son.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.180
And it made me wonder like
what would happen if the Google

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:21.110
office were decorated like
a stereotypical 10-year-old

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.930
daughter, with purple, and
pink, and fluffy things,

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:24.680
and glitter guns.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.179
Right.

00:55:25.179 --> 00:55:27.560
Like how would the men feel
if that's the environment

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.770
they worked in every day.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:32.690
So it's not intentional at all.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:37.100
But it sort of has an
impact on the culture

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.740
at large, and how women feel,
and how comfortable they

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.130
feel in the culture.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.632
RICHARD: Again, thank you
hugely for what you've

00:55:45.632 --> 00:55:47.090
done, for all the
work you've done,

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.130
and for sharing
that with us today.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:53.106
And I hope we might have
a conversation a year

00:55:53.106 --> 00:55:55.230
from now, two years from
now, three years from now.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:58.149
And we might see progress
having been made.

00:55:58.149 --> 00:55:59.190
JOANNE LIPMAN: Fantastic.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.360
Well, thank you for having me.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.026
Thank you, guys.

00:56:01.026 --> 00:56:03.930
[APPLAUSE]
