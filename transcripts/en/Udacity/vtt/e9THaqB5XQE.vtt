00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.000
So the sequence that would probably give us the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.430
most severe change is the second one. And the reason

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.510
is because TGA codes for a stop codon. A stop

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.600
codon means we would produce this amino acid, methionine, then

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.050
valine. And then we'd stop. And we wouldn't get anything

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.040
else for the rest of the sequence. That is going

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.800
to drastically alter the overall protein. Now, the next most

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.360
severe change would be the first one. Because it changes

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.260
the amino acid to just something else. GCG

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.870
codes for alanine instead of valine. Sure, it's a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.510
change. It could possibly be bad. But, it's not

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.270
as bad as a stop codon, which eliminates all

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510
the rest of the amino acids. And then this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.280
last sequence here would be the least sever, most

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.160
likely because GTA is a change from GTG, and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.680
if we use the genetic code, we see that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.930
it doesn't change the amino acid at all. We still got a Valine.
