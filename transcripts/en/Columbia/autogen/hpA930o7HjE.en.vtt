00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169
graduate work here i realized that i
 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.599
graduate work here i realized that i
could actually be going to ask that

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609
could actually be going to ask that
 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.520
could actually be going to ask that
question more seriously in the context

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
question more seriously in the context
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.349
question more seriously in the context
of new york city and of course is the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359
of new york city and of course is the
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.849
of new york city and of course is the
answer to the question who cleans up

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
answer to the question who cleans up
 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.789
answer to the question who cleans up
after us in New York meaning us there

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799
after us in New York meaning us there
 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.050
after us in New York meaning us there
there are actually many answers to that

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
there are actually many answers to that
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.819
there are actually many answers to that
but when i say us i'm defining I've says

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829
but when i say us i'm defining I've says
 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.789
but when i say us i'm defining I've says
residents householders who collects

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

municipal waste the Department of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
municipal waste the Department of
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.670
municipal waste the Department of
Sanitation so then the question is

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680
Sanitation so then the question is
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.409
Sanitation so then the question is
anthropologically what is that work and

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419
anthropologically what is that work and
 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.890
anthropologically what is that work and
who does it and what's it like and the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900
who does it and what's it like and the
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.440
who does it and what's it like and the
uniform how do you wear that uniform

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
uniform how do you wear that uniform
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.300
uniform how do you wear that uniform
these are not sanitation workers there

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310
these are not sanitation workers there
 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.700
these are not sanitation workers there
supervisors the next level up but I it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710

wow so one of the many challenges and

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230
wow so one of the many challenges and

pleasures of working with any trash

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940
pleasures of working with any trash
 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.940
pleasures of working with any trash
related question is where you draw the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950
related question is where you draw the
 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.770
related question is where you draw the
boundaries around it so when I started

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
boundaries around it so when I started
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.930
boundaries around it so when I started
asking what is it to be a sanitation

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940
asking what is it to be a sanitation
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.800
asking what is it to be a sanitation
worker the question then expands to how

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
worker the question then expands to how
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.630
worker the question then expands to how
did the job get shaped the way it is and

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640
did the job get shaped the way it is and
 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.120
did the job get shaped the way it is and
then what's the organizational structure

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
then what's the organizational structure
 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.860
then what's the organizational structure
underneath that and then what's the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870
underneath that and then what's the
 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.560
underneath that and then what's the
historical moment that inspired the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570
historical moment that inspired the
 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.390
historical moment that inspired the
structure and then what was the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400
structure and then what was the
 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.120
structure and then what was the
political reality that influenced the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130
political reality that influenced the
 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.890
political reality that influenced the
historical moment that so you keep

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
historical moment that so you keep
 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.780
historical moment that so you keep
backing up and spreading out just like

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790
backing up and spreading out just like
 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.360
backing up and spreading out just like
garbage itself and and the boundary you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370
garbage itself and and the boundary you
 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.250
garbage itself and and the boundary you
draw around it's partly arbitrary and

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260
draw around it's partly arbitrary and
 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.350
draw around it's partly arbitrary and
it's partly you the scholar make that

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360
it's partly you the scholar make that
 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.030
it's partly you the scholar make that
decision and it's partly permanently

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040

always slightly beyond where ever you
 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.320
always slightly beyond where ever you
draw the line there's more you want to

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330
draw the line there's more you want to
 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.220
draw the line there's more you want to
pull in so that as I say that's that's a

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230
pull in so that as I say that's that's a
 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.000

down just briefly it kind of a hit and
 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.360
down just briefly it kind of a hit and
run because each of these could actually

of people were actually considering was
the cost of the labor and I don't just

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970
the cost of the labor and I don't just
 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.060
the cost of the labor and I don't just
mean what's the budget for the labor I

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070
mean what's the budget for the labor I
 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.680
mean what's the budget for the labor I
mean what's the physical burden of

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690
mean what's the physical burden of
 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.570

still done pretty much exactly the way

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
still done pretty much exactly the way

it's always been done pick it up you
 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.960
it's always been done pick it up you
carry it you put it into right now it's

a truck it used to be a cart and then

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820
a truck it used to be a cart and then
 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.850
a truck it used to be a cart and then
you have to transport it somewhere and

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860
you have to transport it somewhere and
 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.250
you have to transport it somewhere and
then you have to offload it that's all

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260
then you have to offload it that's all
 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.080
then you have to offload it that's all
exactly the way it has been for

centuries kind of since the invention of

centuries kind of since the invention of
 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.230
centuries kind of since the invention of
the wheel I think so what is that cost

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240
the wheel I think so what is that cost
 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.930
the wheel I think so what is that cost
what is the cost to the human being so

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940
what is the cost to the human being so
 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.020
what is the cost to the human being so
that's one set of questions issues of

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030
that's one set of questions issues of
 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.360
that's one set of questions issues of
energy use it takes a lot of energy to

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.370
energy use it takes a lot of energy to
 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.630

create all of the goods that then become
 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.740
create all of the goods that then become
commodities that then we use and then
