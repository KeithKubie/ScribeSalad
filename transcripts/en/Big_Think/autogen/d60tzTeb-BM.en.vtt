00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.749

kind of more expressionistic strain so

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469
kind of more expressionistic strain so
 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.349
kind of more expressionistic strain so
that we see different strains and I do

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359
that we see different strains and I do

not think that this is a time that can

not think that this is a time that can
 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.270
not think that this is a time that can

there are too many different things
 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.899
there are too many different things
going on but probably the one that is

going on but probably the one that is
 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.340

seemed to sort of sum up everything and

seemed to sort of sum up everything and
 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.570

the age of intense engagement with
 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.219
the age of intense engagement with

that in some cases were really quite

even other cases buildings that were

even other cases buildings that were
 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.420
even other cases buildings that were
just sort of excessive right now we've

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430
just sort of excessive right now we've
 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.210
just sort of excessive right now we've
kind of pulled back from that a lot but

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220
kind of pulled back from that a lot but
 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.410
kind of pulled back from that a lot but
we're not entirely sure where we're

we're not entirely sure where we're
 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.499
we're not entirely sure where we're
going there's a tremendous interest in

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509
going there's a tremendous interest in
 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.070
going there's a tremendous interest in
sustainability today and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080
sustainability today and

environmentalism and buildings being
responsible from a green standpoint

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230

which is all to the good there's a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780
which is all to the good there's a
 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.310
which is all to the good there's a
greater sense I think of the building as

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
greater sense I think of the building as
 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.460
greater sense I think of the building as
part of a larger whole and less as an

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
part of a larger whole and less as an
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.150
part of a larger whole and less as an
individual standalone monument so we're

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
individual standalone monument so we're
 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.740
individual standalone monument so we're
more concerned with urbanism how

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
more concerned with urbanism how
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.240

street and as part of a community we're
 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.229
street and as part of a community we're
more concerned I think with planning I'd

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
more concerned I think with planning I'd

that you can keep growing and spreading

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549

our cities denser and tighter in part to
preserve the land I sense a lot of that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
preserve the land I sense a lot of that
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.190
preserve the land I sense a lot of that
right now much more willingness to begin

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200
right now much more willingness to begin
 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.100
right now much more willingness to begin
to consider alternate forms of housing

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110
to consider alternate forms of housing
 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.840
to consider alternate forms of housing
as reflections of alternate forms of

as reflections of alternate forms of
 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.850
as reflections of alternate forms of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860
living and alternate family structures
 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.310
living and alternate family structures
and things like that you know for a long

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320
and things like that you know for a long
 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.090
and things like that you know for a long
time we've just assumed that everybody

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
time we've just assumed that everybody
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.880
time we've just assumed that everybody
would fit into the same little

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
would fit into the same little
 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.520
would fit into the same little
pigeon-holed box either a little

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530
pigeon-holed box either a little
 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.229
pigeon-holed box either a little
suburban house or an apartment in the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239
suburban house or an apartment in the
 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.360
suburban house or an apartment in the
city or whatever that was designed for a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370
city or whatever that was designed for a
 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.000

very traditional nuclear family in fact

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
very traditional nuclear family in fact
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.069
very traditional nuclear family in fact
family structures are different now and

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079
family structures are different now and
 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.810
family structures are different now and
they're changing and they're more

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820
they're changing and they're more
 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.610
they're changing and they're more
options and so why aren't there more

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620
options and so why aren't there more
 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.680
options and so why aren't there more
housing options at the same time to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690
housing options at the same time to
 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.080
housing options at the same time to
reflect that you hear more people at

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
reflect that you hear more people at
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.150
reflect that you hear more people at
least talking about that now and I think

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160
least talking about that now and I think
 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.120
least talking about that now and I think
if we were not in this difficult

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
if we were not in this difficult
 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.500
if we were not in this difficult
recession where it's tough to build

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510
recession where it's tough to build
 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.650
recession where it's tough to build
anything we

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
anything we
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.990
anything we
see more real stuff happening right now

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
see more real stuff happening right now
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.540
see more real stuff happening right now
but with luck we can use this time to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550
but with luck we can use this time to
 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.050
but with luck we can use this time to
plan to sort of develop ideas and be

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
plan to sort of develop ideas and be
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.150
plan to sort of develop ideas and be
ready to do more interesting stuff when

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
ready to do more interesting stuff when
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.960
ready to do more interesting stuff when
the time comes hopefully pretty soon
