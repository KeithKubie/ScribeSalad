1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,140
The Joe Rogan experience.
No, it was a fun show, man.

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,690
I went into the mosh pit Israel before
that song before they called the stuff

3
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:13,590
for that song for most of their settles
in the mosh pit and there was you, USC,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,080
uh, frontline men down
there rec and in the mosque.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,080
I was in there with them.
They were protected me. I
was like, Oh shit, be real.

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:26,550
You're up it up. Like, yeah, were good
shop together. It was. It was awesome.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,860
There's a video of Dana
white in a mosh pit once.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,780
I don't know what the
fuck he was thinking.

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,080
He must have been truck jumped
in the mosh pit like years ago.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,760
He's a big dude though.
He's a big dude.

11
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:39,180
But he's jumping around and their
motion around. Yeah. I dated a girl,

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,500
got killed in a mosh pit
once. It's, it's crazy man.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,980
I used to go into a lot of different
mosh pits in there. He's in the rage.

14
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,290
Mosh pit. Yeah, the rates is
safe, but every now and that,

15
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,410
and you're running into a Dickhead,
I'll tell you man,

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,670
that the craziest mosh
pits, you know, that I saw,

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,500
well the craziest mosh pits I've gotten
into, there was Olympus get mosh pit.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,790
That was crazy. And, but the
craziest was was the rage mosh pit.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,100
But the ones that I seen from outside of
it not being in it that were crazy was

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,960
there was a sound garden
mosh pit then. Yeah. At,

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,200
at Lollapalooza early on it was, uh,
when they had bad motor finger out.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,730
Oh Man.

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,200
That fucking mosh pit was
like a whirlpool of chaos bro.

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,160
I was loving it. And that was
on mushrooms watching this shit.

25
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:33,570
So fucking amazing.
And then,

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,740
and then a slayer mosh pit man.
They're fucking shit is brutal. Yeah,

27
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,010
that sounds like they're just
the pace of slayer. It's crazy.

28
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,700
But I got to tell you, since joining
profits of rage in us, you know,

29
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,630
when we tour Europe and stuff like that
and we'd do a combination of, you know,

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,160
uh, rage against the machine songs, public
enemy and Cypress Hill along with our,

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,300
our own material,
the mosh pits are fucking crazy.

32
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,610
But you know, there was one, one, one
thing that I saw that was not brutal,

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,630
but it was cool as fuck. And it was in,
um, I think, I believe it was weeding or,

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,760
or Switzerland, but they,
you know, out of like the 60,

35
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,500
70,000 people that were out there,

36
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,270
there was like maybe 5,000 concentrated
people who sat down on their ass.

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:22,530
Right. And we're like, the fuck are
these people doing? I don't know. Like,

38
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,590
are they protesting? Are
Separate, fuck is going on. Right.

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,680
And what was crazy is, you know, you,
you're not going to stop playing.

40
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,960
You just keep going.
So we start on, on, um,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,020
I believe the song was going real gorilla
radio that we were playing at that,

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,980
that point. All of a sudden we see
him start doing this. The Rowan,

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,690
they were wrote it. It was like a
viking row. It was a fucking move.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,660
It was a move that the crowd was doing.
So there's five,

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,520
5,000 people out of the 30,000
that are sitting in, you know,

46
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:57,660
like next to each other
lines, rows, you know,

47
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,250
just fucking of people rowing on beat dog.
It was the

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,190
fucking vikings man. How crazy that
the DNA just stuck with those people.

49
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,700
And that was just the little section of
it, man. If you were to see from stage,

50
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,534
Daryl was like,

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,520
it was spot like spotted groups and
they sat down and they sat down and were

52
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,040
rowing. It's so fucking crazy. Yeah.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,550
Have you ever seen the,
there was a,

54
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,500
they did a viking chant once at a
soccer game. Crazy. Aw Man. It's wild.

55
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,490
Cause a whole fucking arena did it and
you feel it. You like Yo, that shit.

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,390
Whoo. You gotta think man, when
they were going to wars back in the,

57
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,770
they rallied all their guys
up just like that. That yeah.

58
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,440
Fuck fucking roller out of tune though.
This fucking bolt's going to go sideways.

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,060
You don't, I don't, I don't know
where that moved comes from,

60
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,530
but it looks cool when he sealed as fuck.

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,440
It's gotta be an old school viking thing.

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,820
They'll probably do it when
they get drunk. Yeah. I mean,
you know, think about it.

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,300
You know they used to
conquest motherfuckers so
they're were like fucking row

64
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:04,510
and throw it around.
Imagine here it like,

65
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,710
see if you can find that the Viking
one at a soccer game. Cause it's like,

66
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,270
I think it's at a world cup or something
like that. But they're like, no,

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,490
you hear it in the crowd and he like,
oh my God.

68
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,320
Imagine hearing that shit over the,

69
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,320
when they're coming to get you towards
your village, like grabbed the baby.

70
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,070
We're going to live in the woods. Fuck
you. Gotta get Outta here. Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,150
And those are big

72
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,030
dude's. Yeah, here it is. Oh

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,520
look at that dog tuned in it
together, man. They're all insane.

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,940
Look at the hands.
That's spooky.

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,070
Yeah man. His mother fuckers,
if somebody reignites them,

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,300
imagine that they would take over
the world. There's enough of them.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Imagine that Hoard Cup and that shit
on my fucking crazy line of DNA.

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
You know a line of people that just
were conquerors, sturdy motherfuckers,

79
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,800
sturdy giant motherfuckers who
did mushrooms. Yeah, they would.

80
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,440
They would glaze up mushroom,

81
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:07,580
their fucking heads into oblivion and
just COPD slash people go get him.

82
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,360
It's crazy, man. This is
another one sitting. Other one.

83
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,410
So that's like

84
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,243
thing.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,790
I guess the NFL Vikings sort
of adopted this recently.

86
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,350
They do it in their football games.
Yeah.

87
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:24,040
We'll look at that dork with the glasses.
Put Your fucking hands down, man. Stop.

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,530
Listen Bro. A Viking breach
had to figure out who beat you.

89
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:36,180
Stop that. Sorry. Look. He's
like, Oh, you, he'll hire you
like at it. He's a spiking.
