00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.977
GORAN HANSSON: The Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences

00:00:02.977 --> 00:00:08.601
has decided to award the 2016
Nobel Prize in Physics

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.692
with one half to David J. Thouless
and the other half

00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:17.552
to F. Duncan Haldane and
J. Michael Kosterlitz

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:23.443
for theoretical discoveries of
topological phase transitions

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:26.343
and topological phases of matter.

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:28.219
[MUSIC]

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:31.477
F. DUNCAN HALDANE: I introduced

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:36.624
interesting models that
demonstrated unexpected

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.507
topological effects in quantum
mechanics at a time when

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:45.567
no one really -- very few people
had been thinking about

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:50.525
topological -- that quantum mechanics
could have a topological aspect.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:59.854
And topology has led to, leads to
a remarkable stability of these effects

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:05.821
and very interesting effects of the boundary
between so-called normal matter

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.525
and topological matter that
has lots of possibilities.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:14.058
So this partly introduced
a new way of thinking.

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:18.563
Off to class!

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:22.449
I think you never set out to do it.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:26.199
You can't say, I'm going to wake up
this morning and discover something big.

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:31.114
You get led by, of course there's
some pathway that

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:34.051
leads you in that direction,
and you have to kind of

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:39.068
be persistent enough to notice that you've
found something interesting, right,

00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.800
and get intrigued by it
and explore it more.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.154
Quantum mechanics
can do amazing things

00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:46.729
and we don't really --

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.079
People always say how mysterious
quantum mechanics is

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.038
but it's only now, really, this century,
we're now starting to actually

00:01:57.038 --> 00:02:00.038
manipulate things quantum mechanically.

00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:05.166
And we're going to discover all kinds of
stuff that we don't really understand it.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:12.284
We know how to do calculations but these
topological effects are examples

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:15.180
of things that no one
really had dreamt of.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:21.983
Someone had to initially find these
things but it can take time.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:28.170
[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.252
It's a graduate class.
Hopefully it will be

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:36.966
inspirational for the
graduate students.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.654
STEVEN LI: I just heard
this morning.

00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:41.863
My friend texted me, and
I realized that I have his class

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:48.136
in two hours, and I was just so
overwhelmed that he maintained his class.

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:52.687
It's just a completely different feeling
sitting in front of a Nobel laureate.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:59.699
F. DUNCAN HALDANE: It's all
due to your inspiration.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.557
JOSEPH TAYLOR: This is really great.
Congratulations.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.812
F. DUNCAN HALDANE:
Thank you.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:09.171
This is the man who
made it all possible for me

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:14.384
by giving me inspiration
to follow in his footsteps.

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:17.415
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
As a former student of physics

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:20.777
myself at Princeton,
one of my strongest memories

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:23.147
of my undergraduate years here

00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:27.061
was the day in 1980 when Val Fitch
won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.478
It was a wonderful moment for the
department and for the University,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.045
a celebration of the truly
groundbreaking work

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:38.030
that goes on here,
and as an undergraduate

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.682
I felt privileged simply to
have a chance to watch

00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:43.106
the excitement from the sidelines.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:46.566
When I was up late at night,
struggling through difficult

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:50.465
problem sets in Fine Library,
I would occasionally

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:54.461
seek inspiration by walking through
the halls of the physics building

00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.510
and gazing at the portraits of
the many Nobel laureates

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.057
who had studied in the department
or served on its faculty.

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:04.152
I am delighted today
to see this marvelous tradition

00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:07.756
extended as Professor Duncan Haldane
becomes the newest addition

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:10.923
to this extraordinary department's
"hall of fame."

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.482
LYMAN PAGE: It's hard to
just say a few words.

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:19.974
What an absolutely wonderful
colleague he is to have

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:21.584
on so many fronts.

00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:25.764
And this is, of course, a wonderful prize
but it's especially wonderful

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:30.602
that it went to Duncan.
So, cheers!

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:34.033
Here's to you, Duncan, and here's to
many more prizes for your colleagues.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.126
DIANA VALVERDE MENDEZ:
We were taking

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:39.261
the ENM prelim prep course
with Professor Haldane.

00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:42.429
Last Thursday, I had a doubt
about the subject,

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:44.591
and he stayed with me,
like, the whole lunch hour

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:47.387
just trying to figure out
what it was about.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:51.337
He's really approachable and a very
nice person, and I'm very glad for him.

00:04:51.337 --> 00:04:55.766
M. ZAHID HASAN: Duncan is
along the tradition of

00:04:55.766 --> 00:05:00.499
some of the best, wonderful theoretical
physicists we have at Princeton.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.399
This is in line with the tradition
and we're very much excited about it.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:09.399
RAJEEV ERRAMILLI:
It's kind of surreal to

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:14.061
be an undergraduate in a place where
there's so many people doing

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:17.881
such amazing, incredible work
and getting international recognition.
