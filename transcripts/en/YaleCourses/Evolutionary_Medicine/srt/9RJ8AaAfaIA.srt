00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,670
In this final lecture.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,730
I wanted to briefly contrast the way
that classical and evolutionary medicine

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,630
look at issues.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,950
Evolutionary insights are only helpful
some of the time it doesn't replace

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,090
earlier approaches.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,400
Evolutionary medicine compliments
them by providing additional insights.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,720
These insights are currently more
important for the clinical treatment of

8
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:26,680
infectious disease,

9
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,250
cancer and auto immune disease than
they are for many other conditions.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,810
The two ways of looking at the world
and make different basic assumptions.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Evolutionary medicine looks at
patients not as machines who broke,

12
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:43,591
who's broken.

13
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,591
Parts can be replaced if broken and it
doesn't look at this at pathogens as

14
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,210
machines that can be disabled
by breaking their parts,

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,860
without having other consequences.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,090
Both patients and pathogens are bundles
of tradeoffs in which it's impossible to

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,370
change one thing without
also changing something else

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,310
because evolution has already greatly
improved fitness in the face of trade offs

19
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,570
and constraints.
Changing those tradeoffs is often costly.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,770
Yeah.

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,530
This doesn't mean we should not treat.
Of course we should treat,

22
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,040
but it does mean that we need heightened
awareness about the potential negative

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,300
consequences of treatment.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Another way of looking at the world that
is not part of classical medicine is

25
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:37,231
that of conflict and evolutionary
conflicts are involved in some diseases.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:38,951
For example,

27
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,400
it is not been standard to think of
mother and fetus is in conflict over

28
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:46,810
maternal investment or if infant behavior
is modulated by conflict of maternal

29
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,070
and paternal interests.

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,380
Yeah,

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,910
evolutionary conflict theory has remodeled
or views of family health in very

32
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:54,900
fundamental ways.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,140
Okay.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,740
As we better understand the
mechanisms that mediate those effects,

35
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,610
we should be able to develop novel
treatments for diseases of pregnancy and

36
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,260
perhaps have some mental disorders.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,120
We also gained great insight from mismatch
and here the important insights could

38
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:17,390
lead to novel treatments for
allergies, Asthma, autoimmune disease,

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,620
and also to use our understanding of
the changes that we've experienced in

40
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,110
modern environments to treat obesity,

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,990
type two diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.

42
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,300
So in conclusion,

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,060
it would be foolish to displace
fascinating and useful cell and molecular

44
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:39,110
science to make way for
evolutionary insights. Instead,

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,220
we need to connect the insights from
evolutionary biology to insights from

46
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:47,840
molecular and cell science to produce new
interdisciplinary research that yields

47
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:52,160
integrated knowledge that's reliable,
exciting, general, and useful.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,510
It will reduce suffering
and it will save lives.
