But it turns out Storm has another son named Johnny, who's a reckless troublemaker.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.600
.....iiin THIS scene.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.820
He is literally never reckless or causes trouble throughout the rest of the film.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.160
Franklin: Well, you're not getting the car back.
Johnny: Excuse me?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.100
Franklin: You're gonna have to earn it. You're gonna have to come work for me.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.360
Johnny: I'm not wearing a lab coat.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.880
NC: So Johnny joins a world-changing experiment to get his CAR BACK!

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.980
...because, you know, LIFE,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.760
and is reintroduced to the team.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.400
Johnny: Is that... Adolf? Long time!

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.860
NC: You... don't need to make fun of his name; it does it quite naturally on its own.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.060
They have their little "Making Stuff" Montage complete with "doo-doo-DOO-doo" music...

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.160
♪ ("Doo-doo-DOO-doo" music) ♪

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.260
...and it appears they've made a lot of progress.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.960
Johnny: What's up?
Sue: I've gotta say it's fun having you here.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
NC: Uhhhhhhhh, did we miss that part?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.180
Not kidding, there has never been ONE moment of ANY of these characters smiling,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.960
except for ONE shot in the montage where they're eating, and NOT saying a word to each other!

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.100
Is the movie's idea of building chemistry LITERALLY BUILDING CHEMISTRY?!

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.960
Johnny: Look, don't get used to this. I'm just here to get my car back.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.460
NC (as Sue): You don't understand. We had Chinese food! AND DOO-DOO-DOO MUSIC!!!

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.480
Reed: (stumbles) Ooh!
Sue: Sorry.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.800
NC: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our first action scene.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.560
The time has come to test the portal on an unrendered model from Space Chimps,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.700
they would've a real monkey, but apparently, SITTING IN A CHAIR was too dangerous!

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.520
...and it seems to be successful.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.200
But it turns out they DON'T want to use the INVENTORS for the FIRST human teleports!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.180
D– Doesn't that kinda go without saying?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.580
Agent: We have to start thinking about sending men.
Reed: Us.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.620
Agent: I think it's time to start coordinating with our friends at NASA.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.360
Victor: Oh, hey. THANK you.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.480
NC: The... Shuttle to the Moon wasn't invented by Neil Armstrong!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.160
They even make a reference to that later

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.760
Victor: You guys know who built the Apollo spacecraft, went to the Moon?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.540
But you know who Neil Armstrong is, right?
Reed: Yeah.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.480
NC: Exactly! So.... WHY did you think you were going???

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.720
Reed: Unless we go first.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.720
Why don't we go first? God, this thing works!

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.340
NC: Ahh, yes. Let's screw up a history-making experiment for your egos!

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.900
I'm sure this will in NO way– y'know what? Hold on a second...

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.720
TURN ON A LIIIIIIIIGHT!!!!!!!!

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.000
Sorry, I just had to get it out just once.
(clears throat)

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.700
I'm sure this will in no way muck everything up!

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.940
But in order to DESTROY everything they worked for, our three scientists need one more to go with them.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.680
Well, I'm sure you're all thinking of the same brilliant mind who had such a big impact–

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.380
Ben.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.960
Ben!

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.660
Because, you know... WHY THE HELL NOT??

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.520
He has no scientific mind, done literally NOTHING, and outed himself as SO useless,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.160
that he just LEFT Reed before they even started building it!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.920
Ben: Here. A going-away present.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.400
Reed: I'm just going to school here.
Ben: It looks like you're home, buddy.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.380
NC: So.... Of COURSE!!! Of COURSE it should be him!!

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.820
Reed: Look, Ben... I need you to come, 'cause we're going tonight. I told the guys that I'm not going without you.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.220
Okay? Who's gonna have my back?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.140
Oh, yeah, BROOMHANDLE-ARMS is REALLY gonna be trouble for any DANGER out there!

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.520
SURELY he must be drunk!

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.460
Ben: You drunk?
Reed: Yeah, I AM a little drunk.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.580
NC: Even MORE reason to do it!! Why DIDN'T the Moon landing go this way??

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.140
Drunk Astronaut: Houston, I'M so plastered,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.100
and I KNOW one chick scientist worked REALLY hard on this and everything, but...

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.820
My buddy owned a JUNKYARD, couldn't protect me to save either of our lives, and...

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.240
Bros before hos. Scientifically, this HAD to be done!

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.860
Hey look, an asteroid! Let's go give it a kiss–

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.480
NC: So they travel to this new dimension to discover it's just as dark and bland as our world.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.940
Reed: It's amazing.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:37.980
We did it.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.260
NC (as Reed): Don't you DARE take off your Sub-Zero mask!

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.600
If we come across Reptile in this Outworld, we wanna be evenly matched!

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.000
(normal): But here's something I'd think you'd never thought that they would come across in this movie:

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.880
Something!

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.920
Yeah! Goddamn something! I bet you thought they would NEVER get to that in this film!!

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.220
(explosion)
Reed &amp; Ben: (scream)

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.000
NC: My God, Mountain Dew is working on another new flavor!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.240
DON'T LET IT TOUCH YOU!! OR MOST OF ALL, DRINK IT!!!

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.160
Victor gets left behind, Ben is covered in Cadbury eggs,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.920
and Sue... DESPITE NOT BEING THERE, SOMEHOW gets affected as well!

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.900
"Sorry, babe, it's one small step for MAN! YOU just get our gamma farts."

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.160
Life is fair.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.820
It turns out Reed can now stretch incredibly far.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.480
I dare even say we call him... MR. FANTASTIC?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.960
(chuckling) No, no, no, just kidding! That'd be just like the comic book.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.060
(flaming explosion)

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.920
Boy, the origin story for Flame Princess is a LOT more intense than I'd thought it'd be!

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.980
Sue, of course, gets invisible powers, and Ben looks like an uneaten Rockbiter Cheeto.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.840
Ben: Reed, wha– what happened to me?!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.520
Reed: I don't know! But I'm gonna figure this out!

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.260
Shit! Ben! Ben, I'm coming back for you, I promise!

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.660

Agent: Reed's gone. You wanna find a cure? We have resources here.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.920
NC: Okay, so this is particularly interesting.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.200
We JUST got done with a scene showing pretty much what Ben looks like:

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.080
a cookie turd shit out by the rock monster from Galaxy Quest.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.320
Yet for some reason, they keep his identity a secret here!

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.000
Even though, we CLEARLY already know what he looks like!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.420
The rooms being dark have already been pretty pointless,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.440
but this movie found a BLACK HOLE of pointless!

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.920
Like there's already no point, and yet somehow, it creates even LESS of a point!

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.000
Is it too late to call them the "All-Around Uninteresting Dark Blur Four"?

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.000
To make things even stranger, we're almost at the one hour mark,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.600
and only NOW have they changed into their hero forms!

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.060
Most of them just woke up, and suddenly, it's one year later,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.940
Ben is fighting for the Army, Johnny has just figured out how to shoot fireballs,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.660
Sue can turn herself and other things invisible while also creating forcefields,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.180
AND they want to harness this power so they can go back to the parallel dimension to get EVEN MORE powers!

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:26.180
Now... you THINK I'm paraphrasing there. What'd that take? Maybe a minute for me to say?

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.900
It takes the movie the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME to get ALL that information at you!

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.620
Yeah!

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.620
Most of the superhero stuff is done in ONE GODDAMN MINUTE!!

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.740
A-a-a-and it's not even in the FOREFRONT!

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.000
See Ben doing all this cool action stuff?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.420
Well, it's not nearly as exciting as watching it in the distance with a bunch of lifeless douchebags sitting around!

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.780
We finally get some friggin' action, and it's not even the FOCUS!!

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680
Rob: Nostalgia Critic?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.980
(gasp!) Nostalgia Critic!!! Oohhh!! Oh!

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.680
(Gregorian chanting)

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.180
Do you remember Chi-Town, Mr. Critic?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.020
It'll be spring soon! And the orchards will be in blossom!

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.540
(as Samwise): The birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket!

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.940
And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.180
And eating the first of the strawberries with cream!

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.620
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.100
NC: No, Rob...

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.520
I can't recall... the taste of food...

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.640
or... the sound... of originality...

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.960
I'm.....

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.300
naked in the dark!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.080
Rob: Ew!

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.300

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.800
That cliché... that portal... staring at me!

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.320
I can see it!

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.040
With my four bored eyes!

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.520
Rob: Then let us be rid of it! ONE AND FOR ALL!!

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.020
I can't carry that cliché, Mr. Critic, but I can carry YOU!!!

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.560
NC: Oh! OHH-oh-oh!!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.240
Rob: (grunting)

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.320
NC: Oh! OH!!... Oh-ho!

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.320
Rob: Gaaah!! Grr!

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.240
NC: OHHH-ho-ho!!

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.260
Rob: Gyaah!

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.420
(pants)

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.520
Or, y'know, you can just finish the damn review.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.880
NC: Yeah, I guess that's an option.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.200
Rob: (sighs)

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.760
NC: This was, um... this was weird... wh-what we just did right here.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.700
Rob: Yeah, a little bit.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.400
NC: So you might be wondering, "where the hell did this destroy-the-world thing suddenly come from?"

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.920
Especially from a guy with such a cuddly name like DOOM!

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.500
Well, I'll give this movie SOME credit: instead of having a HUGE exposition dump in one minute like before,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.960
this movie gives us at least...

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.360
20 seconds more...

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.840
Yep! In that SHORT amount of time, he says that his life cycle is tied to that world,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.880
that he believes OUR world would destroy it, so he wants to destroy OURS before they can get the jump on HIS world, and–

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.780
Ms. Crock from Screwed: WhooooooooooOO CARES?!?!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.940
NC: Thank you, clip from the obscure movie Screwed. You're right. Moving on.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.600
It looks like Professor Storm gets murdered...

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.580
oh, that just looks weird without a Jim Carrey song number going on...

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.488
and our hero– (starts laughing) Sorry!

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:19.100
It was only two syllables and I still couldn't say it!

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.180
Our....

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.540
THESE GUYS try to stop him from sucking the world into his dimensional bullshit.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.660

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.960
Bad guys from Spaceballs: Suck! Suck! SUCK!

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.040
(crowd panicking)

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.360
NC: But Victor is too powerful, and figures out ways to stop all of them.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.020
Reed: Victor, don't do this!

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.660
Doom: There is no Victor... there is only Doom.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.300
NC: I'm not wasting that clip on you.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.540
But the Fantastic Bore eventually get the drop on him.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.880

NC: Okay, I am actually SO disinterested in what's going on,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.560
I am actually more curious in who took how many rolls from that plate!

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.020
Okay, only Johnny seemed to take one; he apparently didn't finish it...

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.200
The others had coffee, but nobody drank their water!

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.720
Dude, that guy was on FIRE! I think he would at least have some WATER!

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.660
THESE are the biggest concerns I'm coming out of this movie with!!!

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.740
So, they're given their own location to continue to test out their powers,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.640
because Lord knows we haven't seen enough of that in these movies!

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.780
As they seem to interact off each other.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.000
Reed: I think that the four of us should have a name.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.060
Sue: Why would we need a name?

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.340
Reed: Because we're a team now, and there's four of us, so we should... come up with a name for it.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.420
Johnny: How about "Two Guys, A Girl, And The Thing That Nobody Wanted"?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.900

Reed: Hey, we both know that you could take him.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.500
NC: Jesus! I'm beginning to see why you didn't give them personalities!

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.340
Their relationships to the ROLLS was more interesting!

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.200
Ben: It's fantastic.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.500

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.180
Guys, I got it!

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.900
NC: Uhp! We didn't have to say it out loud!

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.880
But you still have to take a movie with a guy named VON DOOM seriously!

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.180
PISS OFF!!

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.660
And that was Fant-Snore-Stic. It's bad. REALLY bad.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.600
The other Fantastic Four movies fail too, but at least they fail in an over-the-top way,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.120
and at least try to embrace the look and corniness of the comic.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.680
It's like it's ASHAMED to have anything to do with Fantastic Four OR comic books in general!

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.580
In fact, when you add them all together,

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.420
the HAMMER film is still the ONLY ONE where they CHOOSE to fight crime,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.740
AND they're not the ones who CAUSED all the destruction they're fighting against!!!

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.880
How does that happen– How'd that happen in TWO REBOOTS you're trying to make better?!?!

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.120
All I can say is there's a right way and a wrong way to do dark, gritty comic book material.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.860
And THIS is DEFINITELY the wrong way.
