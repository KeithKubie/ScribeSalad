00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.149
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.750
- Two out of the three
fundamental mysteries

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.360
about our place in the universe
have already been resolved.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.840
The first is literally about
our place in the universe.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.360
Many years ago Copernicus told
us that we were not at its

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.110
centre, that we were just a
tiny dot suspended in the abyss.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.290
This is an image of the earth
taken from the probe Voyager 1

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.170
as it was leaving the
solar system from about six

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.150
billion kilometres away.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.270
All of human history, all of
the history of life on Earth,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.940
has taken place on
that pale blue dot.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.210
The second mystery,
Darwin then revealed

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.410
that we humans are just
one branch, or one twig,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.120
of a beautifully rich and
delicate evolutionary tree.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060
And that much of the
machinery of life

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.480
is shared even with the lowliest
of our fellow creatures.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.970
The third mystery is
that of consciousness,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.750
our inner universe.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990
Now earlier this year, for
the third time in my life,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.880
I ceased to exist.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.680
As the propofol anaesthetic
flowed from the cannula

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
in my wrist into my bloodstream
and then into my brain,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.770
there was a falling apart.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.490
A blackness.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.780
An absence.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.630
And then, I was back.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.020
Drowsy and disoriented,
but definitely there.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.240
And when you wake
from a deep sleep,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.750
you might be confused what
time it is, especially

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.200
in flying somewhere, but you'll
know that some time has passed.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.750
There seems to be
some basic continuity

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.630
between your consciousness then,
and your consciousness now.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660
But coming around from
a general anaesthetic,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.720
it could have been five minutes.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.980
It could have been five hours.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.580
It could have been five
days, or five years.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.500
I was simply not there.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.417
A premonition of the
oblivion of death.

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:53.750
And general anaesthesia doesn't
just work on your brain.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.166
It doesn't just
work on your mind.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.810
It works on your consciousness.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.960
By altering the delicate
electrochemical circuitry

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.080
inside your head, the
basic ground state

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.840
of what it is to be is
temporarily abolished.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.990
And in this process lies one
of the greatest remaining

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.300
mysteries in science
and philosophy.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.360
How does consciousness happen?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.630
Why is life in the first person?

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.920
It is going away,
and coming back.

00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:25.030
The modern incarnation
of this problem

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.030
is usually traced to Descartes,
who in the 17th century

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.870
distinguished between matter
stuff, res extensa, the stuff

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.750
that these desks are made
of, that clothes are made of.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.870
But also the brains and bodies
and made of, material stuff.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.070
And res cogitans, the stuff
of thought, of feelings.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.320
The stuff of consciousness.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.960
And in making this
distinction, he gave rise

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.210
to the now infamous
mind/body problem,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.090
and life has never
been simple ever since.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.480
But Descartes actually
generated even more mischief

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.300
with his doctrine of
the beast machine,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.930
which I'm going to mention now,
because it anticipates where

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.160
I'm going to end up as the bell
rings when I finish in an hour.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.990
Before Descartes, people
commonly believed in something

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.050
called the great chain of
being, with rocks and plants

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.350
at one end, and other
non-human animals, a bit higher

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.830
up than humans, and then angels
and gods at the very top.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.630
And this great scale
of being was also

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.070
a scale of moral virtue, so that
humans had more moral virtues

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.430
than animals and plants,
and then rocks and so on.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.070
Now Descartes, in making
this division between mind

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.490
and matter, argued that only
humans had minds, and therefore

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.620
moral status, while other
animals didn't have minds.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.770
They were merely physiological
machines, or beast machines,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.920
morally equivalent to
plants, and to rocks.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.870
And in this view, the
physiological mechanisms

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.630
that give rise to the
property of being alive

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.220
were not relevant
to the presence

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.340
of mind or consciousness.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.570
Now I'm going to propose, at the
end of this talk, the opposite.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.700
That our conscious sense of
self arises because of, and not

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.740
in spite of, the fact that
we, too, are beast machines.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.670
So to get there, let's return
to the apparent mystery

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.120
of consciousness.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.470
Now as recently as 1989, which
is quite a while ago, but not

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.480
that long ago,
Stuart Sutherland,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.210
who was founding professor
of experimental psychology

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.300
at my university of
Sussex, had this to say.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.360
"Consciousness is a fascinating
but elusive phenomenon.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.230
It is impossible to specify
what it is, what it does,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.790
or why it evolved.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.545
Nothing worth reading
has been written on it."

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:37.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.635
It's quite a pessimistic
point of view.

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.010
And that may have
been true then.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.080
I don't think it was true
then, but in any case

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.720
things have changed a lot since.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.970
And more or less, about
the time that Sutherland

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.400
made these remarks, we can
see the birth, or the rebirth,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.376
of the study of consciousness
within the neurosciences.

00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:58.750
And a good landmark
is this paper

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.900
by Francis Crick and Christof
Koch, published in 1990.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.170
And they start their paper by
saying that it is remarkable

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.650
that most of the work
in cognitive sciences,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.440
and the neurosciences, makes
no reference to consciousness

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.670
or awareness at all.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.010
And then they go on to
propose their own theory

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.530
of what the neural correlates
of consciousness are.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.350
What it is in the brain that
is responsible for being

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.160
conscious.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.190
And since then, over
the last 25 years,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.340
there's been first a trickle,
and now a deluge of research

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.290
on the brain basis of
conscious experience.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.510
Some of this work
is being carried out

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.000
in my laboratory, the Sackler
Centre, the consciousness

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.390
science, which was founded
six years ago with Hugo

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.860
Critchley, my co-director.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.620
And there are now even
specialised academic journals,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.040
The Neuroscience
of Consciousness,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.037
which I started last year
with Oxford University Press.

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:47.620
And this is a real
change of the tide.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.107
When I started out
more than 20 years ago,

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:51.940
it was thought to be a
very-- it was thought

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.520
to be career suicide to
want to study consciousness,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.780
scientifically.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.040
And it may still
be, we don't know.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.760
Let's see.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.470
So while the brain
basis of consciousness

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.870
is still a mystery,
it is, in some sense,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.452
an accessible mystery.

00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:08.910
And the author, Mark Haddon,
put this very nicely, I think.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.140
He said the raw material
of consciousness

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.390
is not on the other
side of the universe.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.230
It didn't happen 14
billion years ago.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.710
And it's not squirrelled
away deep inside an atom.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.190
The raw material
of consciousness

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.190
is right here, inside
your head, and you can

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.270
hold the brain in your hands.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.730
But the brain won't deliver
its secrets very easily.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.650
What's extraordinary
about the brain

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.270
is not so much the
number of neurons,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.924
though there are
about 90 billion.

00:06:35.924 --> 00:06:37.590
It's not even the
number of connections,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.210
though there are so many that
if you counted one every second,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.300
it would take you about
three million years

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.100
to finish counting.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.990
What's truly extraordinary
are the patterns

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.370
of connectivity, which
to a large extent,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.630
are still not known, but within
which are inscribed everything

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.860
that makes you, you.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.170
The challenge is then this,
at least the the way I see it.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.900
How can the structure
and dynamics

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.370
of the brain, in connection with
the body and the environment,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.950
account for the subjective
phenomenological properties

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.810
of consciousness?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.000
And considering
things this way, we

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.860
come up against what
the philosopher David

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.915
Chalmers has often called the
hard problem of consciousness.

00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:16.790
And the idea is this.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.020
There is an easy problem.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.810
The easy problem is to
understand how the combined

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.870
operations of the brain and the
body give rise to perception,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.810
to cognition, to thinking,
to learning, to behaviour.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.090
How the brain works,
in other words.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.570
The hard problem
is to understand

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.090
why and how any of this
should have anything

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.890
to do with consciousness at all.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.850
Why aren't we just robots,
or philosophical zombies,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.687
without any in a universe?

00:07:42.687 --> 00:07:44.270
Now there's a tempting
intuition here,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.850
which is that, even if we solve
the hard problem, even if we

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.390
solve the easy problem, the
hard problem would still remain

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.400
as mysterious as it seems now.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.740
But this just seems
wrong-headed to me.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.220
It may not be necessary to
explain why consciousness

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.910
exists at all, in order to
make progress in understanding

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.470
its material basis.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.310
And this for me, is the real
problem of consciousness;

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.590
how to account for its
various properties in terms

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.220
of biological mechanisms without
pretending that it doesn't

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.820
exist at all, as you do if
you solve the easy problem,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.720
and without trying to
account for why it's

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.678
parts of the universe in
the first place, which

00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:22.470
is the hard problem.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.090
And in the history
of science, we've

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.570
been somewhere similar before.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.390
It's hard to say if it's
exactly the same situation.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.480
But in our
understanding of life,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.049
eminent biochemists of the time
found it entirely mysterious

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.330
how biological mechanisms
could give rise

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.400
to the property of being alive.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.940
And there were
proposed of things,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.370
like elan vital
and essence vital,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.120
and all sorts of other stuff.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.480
And although we don't
yet understand everything

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.960
about life, this initial
sense of mystery about life

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.910
has, to a large
extent, dissolved

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.670
as biologists have just
got on with the business

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.340
of understanding the properties
of living systems in terms

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.720
of mechanisms.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.340
An important part
of this story was

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.620
the realisation that life
is not just one thing,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.030
but rather a constellation of
partially dependent, partially

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.040
separable, processes, like
metabolism, homeostasis,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.340
and reproduction.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.159
In the same way,
to make progress

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.700
on the real problem
of consciousness,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.600
it can be useful to distinguish
different aspects or dimensions

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.890
of what it is to be conscious.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.990
The space of possible
minds, if you like.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.370
And one simple classification
is into conscious level,

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.920
which is the property of
being conscious at all.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920
For example, the
difference between being

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.500
in a dreamless sleep, or
under general anaesthesia,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.080
and being awake and
conscious as you are now.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.800
And the conscious content,
when you are conscious,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.230
you're conscious of something.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.300
The myriad of sights, sounds,
smells, emotions, feelings,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.264
and beliefs that populate your
inner universe at any one time.

00:09:54.264 --> 00:09:56.680
And one thing you are conscious
of when you are conscious,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.580
is the experience, the specific
experience, of being you,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.044
and this is conscious self.

00:10:02.044 --> 00:10:03.960
And it's the third
dimension of consciousness.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.740
Now I don't claim
these distinctions mark

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.760
completely independent aspects
of what it is to be conscious,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.730
but they're a pragmatically
useful way of breaking down

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.630
the problem a bit.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.720
So let's start with
conscious level.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.800
What are the fundamental
brain mechanisms

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.320
that underlie our ability
to be conscious at all?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.920
And we can think of this, at
least a first approximation,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.200
as a scale from being
completely unconscious,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.810
as if you were in a coma, or
under general anaesthesia,

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.890
to being awake, alert, and
fully conscious as you are now.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.170
And there's various states
in between being drowsy,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.970
being mildly sedated and so on.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.990
What's important is that, while
being conscious and being awake

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.340
often go together, this
is not always the case.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.300
For instance, when you are
dreaming you are asleep,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.660
but you are having
conscious experiences.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.530
The conscious experience
of your dreams.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.620
And on the other
side of this diagram,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.320
there are pathological states,
like the vegetative state,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.340
where physiologically you will
go through sleep/wake cycles,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.180
but there is nobody at home.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.890
There is no
consciousness happening.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.890
So what are the
specific mechanisms

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.100
that underlie being conscious
and not simply being

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.560
physiologically awake?

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.840
Well there are a number
of possibilities.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.450
Is it the number of neurons?

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.880
Well actually, probably not.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.060
There are more neurons
in your cerebellum,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.720
this bit at the
back of your brain,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.553
than in the rest of
your brain put together.

00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:31.220
In fact are about four times
more neurons in your cerebellum

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.780
than in the rest of your cortex.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.330
But if you have damage
to your cerebellum, yeah,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.190
you'll have some problems
with coordination

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.940
and other things, some
cognitive problems,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.910
but you won't lose
consciousness.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.530
It's not just the
number of neurons.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.640
Doesn't seem to be
any particular region.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.090
In fact, there are regions
that, if you suffer damage,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.130
you will permanently
lose consciousness;

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.530
in thalamina, the
nuclei, and the thalamus

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.820
deep inside the brain.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.890
But these seems to be
more like on/off switches

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.820
than actual generators
of conscious experience.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.170
It's not even neural
activity, at least not

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.530
simple kinds of neural activity.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.660
Your brain is
still highly active

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.900
doing unconscious
states, during the sleep.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.090
And even if your brain
is highly synchronised,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.840
one of the first
theories of consciousness

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.930
was it depended on neurons
firing in synchrony

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:15.800
with each other.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.270
If your brain is
too synchronised,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.145
you will lose consciousness,
and this happens

00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:21.220
in states of absence epilepsy.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.170
What seems to be the case is
that, being conscious it all,

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.080
depends on how different
brain regions talk

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.570
to each other in specific ways.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.750
And this was some groundbreaking
work by Marcello Massimini

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.880
in Milan about 10 years ago.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.520
And what he did here,
was he stimulated

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.100
the cortex of the brain
with a brief pulse

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.680
of electromagnetic energy,
using a technique called

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.470
transcranial magnetic
stimulation or TMS.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.359
And then he used EEG
electroencephalography

00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:49.650
to listen to the brain's echos.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.233
A little bit like
banging on the brain

00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:54.089
and listening to its
electrical response.

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:55.630
And what he noticed
when you do this,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.610
and you can see on
the left is asleep,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.040
and on the right is awake.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.160
And this is very
much slowed down.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.700
When you stimulate the
brain in a sleep condition,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.790
there is still a response.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.780
There's still an echo, but
the echo stays very localised

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.020
to the point of stimulation.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.478
It doesn't travel
around very much,

00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:12.210
and it doesn't last very long.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.970
But when you stimulate
a conscious brain,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.730
there's a spatial
temporally complex response.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.360
This echo bounces around
all over the cortex

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.700
in very interesting ways.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.960
What's more, the complexity of
this echo can be quantified.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.780
You can apply some
simple algorithms

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.680
to describe how
complex, how rich,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.320
this pattern of
interactivity is.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.310
This is also from
the Milan group.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.662
And what they've done here is,
they basically look at the echo

00:13:40.662 --> 00:13:41.870
as it moves around the brain.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.780
And they see the extent to
which you could describe it,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.190
the minimum description length.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.440
How much can you compress
the image of that echo?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.990
Much the same way
that algorithms make

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.770
compressed files from
digital images in your phone.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.990
And they came up
with an index called

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.460
the perturbational
complexity index.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.890
And what you find
is, you now have

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.860
a number that you can attach
to how conscious you are.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.460
This is, I think,
really intriguing,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.520
because it's a first
step towards having

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.830
an actual measurement
of conscious level.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.720
This graph on the bottom
shows this measure

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.690
applied to a variety
of conscious states,

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.647
ranging from pathological
conscious states,

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.230
like the vegetative
state, where there

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.080
is no consciousness at all,
all the way through locked

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.320
in syndrome, and
then healthy waking.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.240
And you can immediately
see that techniques

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.040
like this might already have
clinical value in diagnosing

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.660
potential for
consciousness patients

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.517
might have after
severe brain injury.

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:37.850
Now at Sussex, we are continuing
work along these lines.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.850
We actually look,
instead of bashing

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.740
on the brain with a
sharp pulse of energy,

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.440
we want to see whether we can
get something similar just

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.920
by recording the spontaneous
activity of the brain.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.700
So we look at
spontaneous dynamics

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.430
from, in this case, waking
states and anaesthesia.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.370
This is work with my PhD
students Michael Schartner

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.450
and Adam Barrett.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.460
We measure its
complexity, and indeed, we

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.040
find that we can
distinguish different levels

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.320
of consciousness just by
the spontaneous activity

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.130
of the brain.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.630
In a way this isn't
that surprising,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.880
because we know
various things change.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.510
The balance of
different frequencies

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.250
of your brain activity changes
when you lose consciousness.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.480
But this doesn't
have to do with that.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.646
This is independent of that.

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:17.960
There's something specific
that is being detected

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.870
by these changes in complexity.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.370
More recently we've applied
the same measures to sleep,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.390
in this case taking
advantage with colleagues

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.420
in Milan of recordings
taken from directly

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.310
within the human
cerebral cortex.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.380
These are implanted electrodes.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.100
And we see much the same story.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.830
If you compare where
the two areas are,

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.560
you compare the complexity
of wakeful rest,

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.560
and early non-rem sleep, where
you are not dreaming very much.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.650
You see that complexity
fools a great deal.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.310
What's interesting here is, if
you compare wakeful rest to REM

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.370
sleep, where people will often
report dreams if you wake them

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.130
up, the level of
complexity is very much

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.779
as it is during
the wakeful state.

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:58.320
There's something
else going on here,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.861
which is that the complexity in
the frontal part of the brain

00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:03.140
seems to be higher than in
other parts of the brain.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.502
And that's something we still
don't understand fully, yet.

00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:08.960
I just wanted to
give you something

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.570
hot off the press, so to speak,
which is where you've also

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.690
been applying these
measures now to data taken

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.810
from people under the
influence of psychedelic drugs;

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.590
psilocybin, ketamine, and LSD.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.890
And what we find, at least in
our hands to start with here,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.870
is that the level of
complexity actually

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.140
increases as compared to the
baseline state, which is not

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.590
something we've seen before
in any other application

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.510
of these measures.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.330
So what's important about
this way of looking at things

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.510
is that, it's grounded
in a theory that

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.960
tries to explain why certain
sorts of brain dynamics

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.720
go along with being conscious.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.460
And put very simply,
the idea is this--

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.670
and it goes back to Guilio
Tononi and Gerald Edelman,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.500
people that I went to work with
in America about 18 years ago--

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.270
the idea is very simple.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.250
Consciousness is
extremely informative.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.190
Every conscious experience
you have, or have had,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.220
or will have, is different
from every other conscious

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.460
experience you have had,
are having, or will have.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.069
Even the experience
of pure darkness

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.890
rules out a vast repertoire
of alternative possible

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.300
experiences that you could have,
or might have in the future.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.700
There's a huge amount of
information for the organism

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.650
in any conscious experience.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.230
At the same time every
experience that you have

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.819
is highly integrated.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.980
Every conscious scene is
experienced, as all of a piece,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.970
is bound together.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.180
We don't experience colours and
shapes separately in any way.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.350
It's conscious experiences
at the level of phenomenology

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.710
combine these properties.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.040
They are the one hand
highly informative, composed

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.240
of many different parts.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.540
On the other, bound
together in a unified whole.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.780
And this motivates us to search
for mathematical measures which

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.930
have the same property,
which are neither

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.730
lacking in information.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.160
On the left, you
see a system which

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.700
is all connected together,
so it can't enter

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.080
very many different states.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.810
On the right is a system which
is completely dissociated,

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.840
so they can enter states,
but it's not a single system.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.910
We want measures that track
this middle ground of systems,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.402
that combine both integration
and differentiation.

00:18:15.402 --> 00:18:17.110
And a number of these
measures now exist.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.730
There are some
equations here, which

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.770
we can talk about
later if you like,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.630
that try to target
this middle ground.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.610
And time will tell whether,
by applying these more

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.500
phenomenologically
grounded measures,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.310
we come up with even more
precise practical measures

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.790
of consciousness.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.054
Now why is this business
of measurement important?

00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:38.720
And I want to make a
general point here,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.590
which is that, if you're
trying to naturalise

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.330
a phenomenon which
seems mysterious,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.360
the ability to measure it
is usually one of the most

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.860
important steps you can take.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.970
And we've seen numerous
examples of this.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.390
The history of our understanding
of heat and temperature

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.660
is one very good example
Here's an early thermometer

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.600
from the 18th century, which
used the expansion of air.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.580
But of course there
are many problems

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.370
in generating a
reliable thermometer

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.470
and a scale of temperature,
if you don't already

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.470
have fixed points.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.200
And if you don't
know what heat is you

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.210
get trapped in a kind
of vicious circle

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.190
that took a long
time to break out of.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.076
But people did
break out of this,

00:19:14.076 --> 00:19:15.700
and the development
of the thermometers

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.040
catalysed our
understanding of heat

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.220
from being something that flowed
in and out of objects, to being

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.640
something that was identical
to a physical property.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.640
The mean molecular kinetic
energy of molecules

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.690
in a substance.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.270
And having that
concept of heat now

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.770
allows us to talk
about temperature

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.710
far beyond the realms
of human experience.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.390
We can talk about
the temperature

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.160
on the surface of
the sun, in a sense,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.860
the way we can talk about the
temperature of interstellar

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.562
space, close to absolute zero.

00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:45.020
None of these things
make any sense

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.610
and in our phenomenological
experience of hot and cold.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.010
So this brings me to my
first take-home message.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.180
Measurement is important, and
consciousness, conscious level,

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.740
depends on a complex balance of
differentiation and integration

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.720
in brain dynamics,
reflecting the fact

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.000
that conscious
experiences themselves

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.800
are both highly informative
and always integrated.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.660
Now when we are conscious, we
are conscious of something.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.600
So what are the brain
mechanisms that determine

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.550
the content of consciousness?

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.230
And the hero for this
part of the story

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.140
is the German physicist and
physiologist Hermann Von

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.730
Helmholtz.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.340
And he proposed the
idea that the brain is

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.880
a kind of prediction machine.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.090
That what we see,
hear, and feel are

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.530
nothing other than the brain's
best guess about the causes

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.600
of sensory inputs.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.150
And the basic idea is,
again, quite simple.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.080
The brain is locked inside
its bony skull home,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.750
and has very indirect access
to the external world.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.010
All it receives are ambiguous
and noisy sensory signals,

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.080
which are highly
and directly related

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.270
to this external world
of objects, and so on,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.320
if there is an external world
of objects out there at all.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.580
They know about that.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.490
Perception in this
view is, by necessity,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.440
a process of inference in
which the brain interprets

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.380
these ambiguous and noisy
sensory signals with respect

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.870
to some prior
expectations or beliefs

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.310
about the way the world is.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.470
And this forms the
brain's best guess

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.840
of the causes of the
sensory signals that

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.570
are impacting our sensory
surfaces all the time.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.540
What we see is the brain's
best guess of what's out there.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.340
I want to give you
a couple of examples

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.790
that illustrate this process.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.580
It's quite easy to do, in a way.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.430
This first example is a
well-known visual illusion

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.440
called Edelstein's Checkerboard.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.450
Now here, you'll
see two patches.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.620
You'll see patches A and B. And
I hope to you they look to be

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.590
different shades of grey.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.632
Do they?

00:21:44.632 --> 00:21:46.340
They look to be
different shades of grey.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.360
Of course they are exactly
the same shade of grey.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.150
I can illustrate that by
putting an alternative image,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.250
and joining up
those two patches.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.286
You'll see that's it's
the same shade of grey.

00:21:56.286 --> 00:21:57.910
You may not believe
me, so what I'll do

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.150
is, I'll shift it along, and
you'll see even more clearly.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.410
There are no sharp edges.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.350
It's the same shade of grey.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.170
What's going on
here, of course, is

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.960
that the brain is unconsciously
applying its prior knowledge

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.320
that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of surfaces

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.360
that it casts onto.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.080
So we therefore see
the patch B as being

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.790
lighter than it
really is, in order

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.979
to account for that effect.

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:24.520
And this is of course
an illustration

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.670
of the success of the visual
system, not its failure.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.220
The visual system is a very
bad physical light metre,

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.330
but that's not what
it's supposed to do.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.630
It's supposed to, or one
thing it's supposed to do,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.150
is to interpret the
causes of sensory signals

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.220
in terms of meaningful
objects in the world.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.010
It's also an example
of what we sometimes

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.780
call cognitive impenetrability.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.570
Even if you know the patches
are the same shade of grey,

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.460
when I take that bar away,
they again look different.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.080
Can't do much about that.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.360
The second example
just shows you

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.020
how quickly the brain can
take in new prior information

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.120
to change the nature of
conscious perception.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.260
This is a so-called
Mooney image.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.980
And if you haven't seen
it before, hopefully what

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.870
you will see here
is just a passing

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.210
of black and white splotches.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.780
Does everybody kind of get that?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.820
Black and white splotches?

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.590
Some of you might
have seen this before.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.260
And now what I'm going
to do is fill it in,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.270
and you see something
very different.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.510
What you'll see is a very
meaningful scene here involving

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.350
at least two objects, a
woman, a hat and a horse.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.150
Now if you stare at
this for a while,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.710
I won't leave it
up for too long--

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.870
but if you just look
at it for a little bit,

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.440
and then I take that
image away again,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.790
you should still be able to see
the objects within that image.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.290
Now for me this is
quite remarkable,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.795
because the sensory information
hasn't changed at all.

00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:48.530
All that's changed are your
brain's prior expectations

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.380
about what that
sensory data signifies.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.740
And this changes what
you consciously see.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.920
Now this also works in
the auditory domain.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.450
Here are two spectrograms.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.200
This is something
called sine wave speech,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.520
and what you see here are two
time frequency representations

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.310
of speech sounds.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.420
The one on the top has all the
sharp acoustical features that

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.040
provide normal speech removed.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.920
A little bit like
thresholding an image.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.170
And the bottom is
something else.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.870
So I'm going to
play the top first,

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.830
and let's see what
it sounds like.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.770
[STRANGE BEEPS AND NOISES]

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.066
And now I'll play
you something else.

00:24:33.066 --> 00:24:35.190
(BOTTOM SOUND - A MAN'S
VOICE): Jazz and swing fans

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.125
like fast music.

00:24:37.125 --> 00:24:42.250
- So I hope you all understood
that piece of sage advice.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.012
And now if I play the
original sound again--

00:24:45.012 --> 00:24:48.176
[BEEPS AND WHISTLES THAT SOUND
 LIKE THE SENTENCE]

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.096
- Yeah?

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:52.266
This is exactly the same.

00:24:52.266 --> 00:24:53.640
Again, all this
change is what we

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.980
expect that sound to signify.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.021
[SAME SOUND PLAYED AGAIN]

00:24:56.021 --> 00:24:59.460
- One more time, just for luck.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.140
It's not just a bunch of
noisy whistles, it's speech.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.490
Now this typical
framework for thinking

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.110
about these kinds of effects
is Bayesian Inference.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.830
And this is a form of
probabilistic reasoning, which

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.450
is applicable in all
sorts of domains,

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.565
not just in neuroscience,
in medical diagnosis,

00:25:14.565 --> 00:25:18.840
and all sorts of things,
like finding lost submarines.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.190
But in neuroscience, we talk
about the Bayesian brain.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.970
And it's a way of
formalising Helmholtz's idea

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.840
that perception is a
form of best guessing.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.260
And the idea is that sensory
signals and prior beliefs

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.490
can be represented as
probability distribution.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.430
So for instance,
this yellow curve

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.500
is the probability of
something being the case,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.930
maybe that you've got a brief
glimpse of an object moving

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.190
to the right.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.170
The sensory data may
say something different.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.290
It may have a
probability that peaks

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.420
at a different
angle of movement.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.100
Maybe it's drifting in
a different direction.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.940
And the optimal
combination of the prior,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.700
and the likelihood, the yellow
curve and the red curve,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.220
is this green curve, which
we will call the posterior

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.570
distribution.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.080
And that represents the
best optimal combination

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.970
of these two sorts of evidence.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.860
And the idea is, well
that's what we perceive.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.090
Thinking about
perception in this way

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.222
does something rather
strange to the way,

00:26:15.222 --> 00:26:16.680
classically in
neuroscience, people

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.030
have thought about perception.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.190
The classical view
is that the brain

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.890
processes sensory
information in a bottom-up,

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.310
or feed-forward direction.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.180
This is a picture of the
visual system of the monkey,

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.329
and the idea is that information
comes in through the retina,

00:26:30.329 --> 00:26:31.620
then goes through the thalamus.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.550
It then goes to the
back of the brain.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.660
And as the sensory signals
percolate deeper and deeper

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.560
and deeper into the
brain, they encode

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.720
or represent progressively
more sophisticated features

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.250
of objects.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.690
So you start out at early
levels the visual cortex

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.240
with response to
luminance, and edges,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.920
and then higher up to objects,
including other monkeys.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.650
What's important here is
the perceptual heavy lifting

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.730
is done by information
flowing in this bottom-up or

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.960
feed-forward direction.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.540
Now the Bayesian brain idea
says something very different.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.650
It says that what's really
important are the top-down

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.350
or inside-out connections
that flow from the centre

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.310
of the brain back out.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.140
And we've known for
a long time there's

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.050
a large number, a very large
number of these connections,

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.990
and some descriptions more
than flow the other way around.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.416
But the function has
been rather mysterious.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.790
Thinking about
the Bayesian brain

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.373
gives us a nice way
to interpret this.

00:27:25.373 --> 00:27:28.890
Which is that it's exactly
these top-down or inside-out

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.250
connections that
convey predictions

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.920
from high levels of the brain to
lower levels, to lower levels,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.460
back out to the
sensory surfaces.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.820
So these blue arrows convey
the brain's predictions

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.920
about the causes
of sensory signals.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.070
And then what flows in the
feed-forward or bottom-up

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.100
direction, from the outside-in,
that's just the prediction

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.860
area, the difference between
what the brain expects

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.360
and what it gets at each
level of description.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.700
So this is often called
predictive coding,

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.720
or predictive processing,
in some formal frameworks.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.910
And the idea is that
minimization of prediction

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.480
error occurs across all
levels of this hierarchy

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.060
at the same time,
and what we then

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.620
perceive is the consequence
of this joint minimization

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.104
of prediction error.

00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:18.770
So you can think of
perception as a sort

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.080
of controlled
hallucination, in which

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.380
our perceptual predictions are
being reined in at all points

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.710
by sensory information from
the world and the body.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.620
Now there's quite a
lot of experiments

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.270
that show that
something like this

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.930
is probably going
on in the brain.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.740
These are a couple of examples.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.214
And since they're--

00:28:37.214 --> 00:28:38.630
I was looking for
the best example

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.550
so they don't come
from my lab at all.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.910
This is from Lars
Muckli in Glasgow.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.000
He's shown using advanced
brain reading techniques, which

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.920
I won't describe, that you
can decode the context of what

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.460
a person is seeing from parts
of the visual cortex that

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.860
isn't even receiving any input.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.600
And what's more, you
can decode better

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.010
when you decode from the top
part of the cortex, which

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.150
is supposed to receive
predictions from higher levels.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.830
So that suggests there are
predictions being fed back.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.040
And another study by Andre
Bastos and Pascal Fries

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.190
in Germany, they used a method
called Granger causality, which

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.280
is sensitive to information
flow in systems.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.270
And they find that top-down
signals and bottom-up signals

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.214
are conveyed in
different frequency bands

00:29:28.214 --> 00:29:29.630
in the cortex,
which is what you'd

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.930
predict from predictive coding.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.480
One last experiment which I
find particularly interesting

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.070
is an experiment from a Japanese
group of Masanori Murayama.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.080
And they used to
optigenetics, which

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.420
is a way of using lights
to selectively turn

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.220
on or off neural circuits.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.870
And in this
experiment they showed

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:53.510
that by just deactivating
top superficial levels

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.244
of somatosensory
cortex in a mouse

00:29:56.244 --> 00:29:57.660
brain, the part
of the mouse brain

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.710
that's sensitive to
touch, they could

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.920
affect how well that
mouse was able to do

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.520
tactile discriminations.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.560
Those top-down connections were
coming from a motor cortex.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.320
So there's a lot of evidence
that top-down connections

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.090
in the brain are
important for perception,

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.620
is the basic message there.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.828
But what's rather strange,
and what I'm going to tell

00:30:17.828 --> 00:30:20.240
you next is that all this
stuff is all very good,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.060
but predictive processing is
not a theory of consciousness.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.510
Nothing I've said has anything
to do with consciousness,

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.010
at all.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.790
It has to do-- it's a
very general theory of how

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.800
brains do what they do.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.450
How they do
perception, how they do

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.310
cognition, how they do action.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.010
So somewhat
counter-intuitively, I

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.632
think this is exactly why it's
a great theory of consciousness.

00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:43.340
And the reason I think
this is because it

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.580
allows us to ask all
sorts of questions

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.290
about the real problem.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.320
About what it is,
what happens in brains

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.120
that underlies what you happen
to be conscious of right now,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.480
without getting sucked into the
metaphysical pluckhole of why

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.250
you are conscious
in the first place.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.520
In other words, it provides
a powerful approach

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.920
to looking for neural
correlates of consciousness,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.590
those things in the brain that
go along with being conscious.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.480
Because we can
now take advantage

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.790
of a very general theory
of how brains do what

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.380
they do, rather
than just looking

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.760
at this region or that region.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.700
So what does
predictive processing,

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.430
or the Bayesian brain say about
consciousness, specifically?

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.510
Well many years ago, some
influential experiments

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.850
revealed a very
strong connection

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.090
between top-down signalling
and conscious contents.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.600
In this example by Alvaro
Pascual-Leone and Vincent

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.910
Walsh, what they
did was they had

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.780
people look at visual motion,
examples of visual motion.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.600
And they used TMS, this
interventional technique

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.470
where you can zap the
brain very briefly.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.780
I mentioned it before.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.790
But they used it
here, specifically

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.390
to interrupt the
top-M down signalling

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.040
that was evoked by this
perception of visual motion.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.400
And the result was that, if
you interrupted specifically

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.280
the top-down feedback,
you would abolish

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.030
the conscious perception
of visual motion,

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.180
even if you left the
bottom-up signalling intact.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.620
So that was an early key.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.500
Now, more recently, in our
lab and in many other labs

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.530
all over the place, we've been
asking some other questions

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.220
about the relationship
between what you expect

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.900
and what you
consciously experience.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.700
One of the most basic
questions you can ask

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.030
is, do we consciously see
what we expect to see?

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:29.000
Or do we see what violates our
expectations of what we expect?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.540
And a recent study from our
group, led by Yair Pinto,

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.790
used a method called
continuous flash suppression

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:35.914
to address this question.

00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:36.830
It's illustrated here.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.210
You see different images
in the different eyes.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.700
In one eye you see this rapidly
changing Mondrian pattern

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.540
of squares.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.430
And in the other eye, you
either see a face or a house.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.530
And they change
contrast like this.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.450
So initially, the person would
just see this random pattern,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.240
and then they'll see
either a house or a face.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.759
And simply, you just
ask them to expect

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:00.800
to see-- you just tell
them a face is more likely

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.340
or a house is more likely.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.190
And what we find over
a number of studies

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.760
is that we see faces
more quickly when that's

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.110
what we're expecting to see.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.530
It may seem obvious, but it
could be the other way around.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.270
At least in these studies,
we see what we expect to see,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.210
not what violates
our expectations.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.710
That's the data.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.120
And the same goes for houses.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.070
These kinds of studies
support the idea

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.110
that it's the top-down
predictions that

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.820
are really important
for determining

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.302
what we're conscious of.

00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:29.510
There's another experiment
which I will just mention.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.960
We did pretty much
the same thing.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.062
This is called motion
induced blindness.

00:33:33.062 --> 00:33:35.270
If you are in a lab rather
than in a lecture theatre,

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.180
and you stare at this
central point here,

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.130
then this red dot might
disappear from time to time.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.080
And what we did was
after it disappeared,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.380
we changed its colour and we
led people to expect the colour

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.460
change to be one
thing or another.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.390
And again, it reappeared more
quickly if it changed colour

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.650
in the way you were expecting.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:58.580
Again, I am confirming that
once your expectations were

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.810
validated, then that accelerated
your conscious awareness

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.180
of something in the world.

00:34:06.749 --> 00:34:08.290
Now that's just
behavioural evidence.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.219
That's just asking people what
they see and when they see it.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.540
We've also been interested
in the brain mechanisms that

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.590
underlie and shape how
our expectations change,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.675
what we consciously see.

00:34:20.675 --> 00:34:22.800
And we've been particularly
interested in something

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800
called the alpha rhythm.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.590
Now the alpha rhythm
is an oscillation

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.350
of about 10 hertz or
10 cycles per second.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.020
That's especially prominent
in the visual cortex,

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.620
across the back of the brain.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.630
In one study, led by in
this case a PhD student,

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:40.530
Maxine Sherman, with
Ryota Kanai, in Sussex.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.836
What we did here, we manipulated
people's expectations

00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:45.210
of what they we're
likely to see.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.030
And it's a very boring
experiment, this was.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.690
The only thing they could see
was what we call Gabor patches.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.570
They're just very dim
patches of lines that

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.780
are blurry around the edges.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.863
But the visual system loves
these kinds of things.

00:34:57.863 --> 00:35:01.650
They activate early visual
cortex very, very well.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.080
And people were expecting
either that a patch

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.170
was there, or that it wasn't
there, in different conditions.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.870
And while doing this we
measured brain activity.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.360
And to cut a long story
short, what we found

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.060
was that there were certain
phases, certain parts

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.520
of the cycle, this
10 Hertz cycle,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.750
at which your expectation
had a greater effect on what

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.060
you said that you saw.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.030
So there was part of this
cycle, as the alpha rhythm,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.370
there was part of it where
your expectations dominated

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.037
your perception.

00:35:30.037 --> 00:35:31.620
And there was another
part of it which

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.320
was the opposite, where
your sensory signals were

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.050
more important in determining
what you saw at that point.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.830
So this suggests
that this oscillation

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.800
in the back of the
brain is orchestrating

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.190
this exchange of predictions
and prediction errors.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.430
And that's the
sort of cycle that

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.700
might be the neural mechanism
for conscious vision.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.226
And other theories about what
the alpha rhythm is doing,

00:35:56.226 --> 00:35:56.850
there are many.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.490
One is that it's doing
nothing, it's just the brain

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.240
idling away, and I think this is
at least a more interesting way

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.170
to think about it.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.630
Another experiment we've
done with another PhD student

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.330
Asa-Chang, we showed
people these very fast

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.550
changing luminance sequences.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.930
And it turns out
that your brains

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.690
will learn to predict
the specific changes

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.802
in these sequences that
change you very quickly.

00:36:17.802 --> 00:36:19.260
And the signature
of this learning,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.850
again, happens to be
in the alpha rhythm,

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.450
and suggests that this
oscillation has something

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.630
important to do with how
the brain learns and updates

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.600
predictions about
sensory signals.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.990
But we do not go around the
world looking at Gabor patches

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.210
or rapidly changing
things like this.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.790
We go around the world
looking at people and objects.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.790
And that's what our visual
world is composed of.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.790
So can any of these
ideas say anything

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.265
about our everyday
visual experience?

00:36:47.265 --> 00:36:49.140
And I think that's a
very important challenge

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.490
in neuroscience to cross.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:55.260
Get out of the lab and think
about real world experiences.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.890
So we've been using virtual
reality over the last few years

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.480
to try to get at
some of these ideas.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.010
This is an Oculus Rift, which is
now available to buy, I think.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.020
And we've been using
these to address

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.822
some of these real world
aspects of visual perception.

00:37:09.822 --> 00:37:11.280
And one of these
real world aspects

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.990
is called perceptual presence.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.570
And this is the
observation that,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.530
in normal perception, objects
really seem to be there,

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.420
as opposed to being
images of objects.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.100
And this is, of
course, what Magritte

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.630
plays with in his
famous painting,

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:28.080
The Treachery of Images.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.270
For instance, this is an object.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.950
I think it's there,
and in some sense

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.800
I can perceive the back
of it, even though I

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.290
can't see the back of it,
even though the back of it's

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.740
not giving me any sensory
data, I perceive it

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.750
as an object with a back.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.820
How does one explain that?

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.164
Well one idea you can come up
with within this Bayesian brain

00:37:48.164 --> 00:37:49.830
framework is that,
the brain is not only

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:55.290
predicting the possible causes
of the sensory signals getting

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.640
right here, right now.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.800
But it's also predicting
how sensory signals

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.010
would change were I to
make particular actions.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.590
Were I to pick this object
up and move it around,

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.822
or just move my eyes from
one place to another.

00:38:07.822 --> 00:38:08.990
There's a long paper.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.005
I wrote about that which I--

00:38:11.005 --> 00:38:11.880
please don't read it.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.870
- But that's the basic idea.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.830
And how do you test
an idea like that?

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.110
So we've been using some
innovative virtual reality

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.790
methods, or augmented
reality methods,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.100
with my post-doc,
Keisuke Suzuki.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.610
And what we do is, we
have virtual objects,

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.210
and these virtual objects,
they either behave

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.417
as a normal object would.

00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:36.000
They're all weird,
unfamiliar objects.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.020
But they can either behave as
a normal object would behave,

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.180
so you can learn to
predict what would happen.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.990
This one is weird.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.910
It always shows
you the same face,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.950
a little bit like having
the moon on a plate

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.612
in front of you.

00:38:48.612 --> 00:38:50.070
And then there are
other conditions

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.440
where objects respond
to your movements,

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.860
but they do so in
unreliable and strange ways.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.720
So the question is,
what does the brain

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.400
learn about these objects,
and how do we experience them?

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.710
Do we experience them as
objects in different ways

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.470
when they behave differently?

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.720
And we're still doing
those experiments.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.510
Another way we can use
VR, is to investigate

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.410
what happens in visual
hallucinations of the kind

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.150
experienced in psychosis,
and in certain other more

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.274
pharmacologically
induced conditions.

00:39:21.274 --> 00:39:22.940
What we're doing here
is, we're coupling

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.480
immersive virtual
reality, imagine

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.230
you've got a headset
strapped to your head

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.880
again, with clever image
processing that models

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.900
the effects of overactive
priors on visual perception

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.110
to generate a highly
immersive experience.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.270
This is Sussex campus,
actually, but now it

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.200
seems quite different than
it did at lunchtime today.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.710
I'll tell you that.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.320
What we've done, we've
recorded this panoramic video

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.180
which we can feedback
through VR headset.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.460
And we've processed
this video through one

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.140
of these Google deep dream
algorithms you might have seen,

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.730
that can generate
sort of bowls of pasta

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.010
that looks like animals.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.760
And this might seem
like a lot of fun.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.718
It is fun, but there is
a serious purpose here,

00:40:03.718 --> 00:40:07.510
because it allows us to
model the effects, model very

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.250
unusual forms of
perception and how

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:15.280
they might play out in different
ways in the visual hierarchy.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.580
And understanding how visual
hallucinations might happen,

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.980
and how the wider effects they
have on the mind, I think,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.160
is a very important part of
studying visual perception.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.380
So that brings us to the
second take-home message,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.500
which is that what
we consciously see

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.860
is the brain's best guess of
the causes of its sensory input.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.170
Normal perception is a fantasy
that is constrained by reality.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.910
Now before I move on
to the last section,

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.420
I want to pay tribute to an
unlikely character in a talk

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.060
about neuroscience,
which is Ernst Gombrich.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.300
Ernst Gombrich was one of
the foremost historians

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.260
of art of the 20th century.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.690
And it turns out that Gombrich's
approach to understanding art

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.390
had a lot in common with
ideas and the Bayesian brain.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.920
And more specifically,
with the idea

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.890
that perception
is largely an act

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.530
of imagination, or construction,
on the part of the perceiver.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.890
And this is most apparent in
his concept of the beholder's

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.230
share, which emphasises
that the viewer brings

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:17.730
an awful lot to the table in the
act of experiencing an artwork.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.820
So he had this to say in his
1960 book, Art and Illusion,

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.080
"the artist gives the beholder
'more to do', he draws them

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.330
into the magic circle of
creation and allows him

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.360
to experience something of the
thrill of making which had once

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.330
been the privilege
of the artist."

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.830
I think for me this
is very powerful

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.459
when looking at, especially,
things like Impressionist art.

00:41:37.459 --> 00:41:39.000
And here, one way
to think about this

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.340
is, that the artist
has reverse engineered

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.840
the whole perceptual
process, so that what's

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.230
there are not the objects,
the end points of perception,

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.110
but rather the raw materials;
the patterns of light that

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.080
engage our perceptual
machinery in doing its work.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.690
And for me this might be
why paintings like this

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.950
are particularly powerful.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.490
Now the final dimension
of consciousness

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.920
I want to talk about
is conscious self.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.290
The fundamental experience
of being someone.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.300
Being someone like you.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.550
There are many aspects
to our experience

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.600
of being a conscious self.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.510
There is the bodily
self, the experience

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.470
of being and identifying
with a particular body.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.200
A bit of the world goes
around with you in the world

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.500
all the time.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.700
There's the perspectival
self, the experience

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.920
of seeing the world, or
experiencing the world,

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.460
from a particular first
person perspective,

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.660
usually somewhere in the
body, but not always.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.470
There is the volitional
self, the experience

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.380
of intending to do things,
and of making things

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.430
happen in the world of agency.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.090
And these ideas are, of
course, often associated

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.790
with concepts of will.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.040
Then there's the narrative self.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.809
This is where--
only until now, we

00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:57.600
don't have to worry
about the concept of I,

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.390
but when we get to the narrative
self, there is now and I.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.750
There is a continuity of self
experience from hour to hour,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.400
from day to day,
from month to month,

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.190
and from year to year, that
you associate a name with,

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.880
and a particular set of
autobiographical memories.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.220
And finally, there's
a social self.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.590
The way I experience
being me is partly

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.890
dependent on the way I
perceive you as perceiving me.

00:43:22.374 --> 00:43:24.290
I'm just going to talk,
in the minutes remain,

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.426
about the bodily self.

00:43:25.426 --> 00:43:27.800
This is something we're working
on quite a lot in Sussex.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.740
The experience of
identifying with, and owning,

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.480
a particular body.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.010
And the basic idea I want to
convey, is again, very simple.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.180
It's just that we should think
of our experience of body

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.600
ownership in the
same way that we

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.060
think about our experience
of other things, as well.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.050
That is, it's the brain's
best guess of the causes

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.594
of body-related signals.

00:43:48.594 --> 00:43:50.510
And the brain is always
making this inference.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.320
It's making its inference
about what in the world

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.750
is part of the body, and
what is not part of the body.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.500
But it has access, in
this case, to other sorts

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.080
of sensory signals, not
just visual signals,

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.530
or tactile signals, but
also proprioceptive signals.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.090
The orange arrows here.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.180
These inform the brain about
the body's configuration

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.730
and position in space.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.100
And then also, and
often overlooked,

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.640
are interoceptive signals.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.240
These are signals that originate
from within the body, that

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.000
tell the brain about
the physiological state

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.790
or condition of the inside
of the internal physiological

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.440
milieu.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.920
And you can think the idea
is that our experience

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.170
of embodied self-hood
is the brain's best

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.710
guess of the causes of all
the signals put together.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.000
Yeah, that's just to
emphasise interoception.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.950
An important part
of this idea is

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:49.700
that interoception, the sense
of the body from within,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.960
should work along the same
principles, the same Bayesian

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.710
principles that we've
been thinking about,

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.960
vision and audition, previously.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.920
That is, our experience of
the inside of our bodies

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.220
is the brain's best guess of the
causes of the signals that come

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.300
from the inside of our bodies.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.750
So we can think of, again,
top-down predictions

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.870
carrying predictions about
what the bodily state is like,

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.670
and bottom-M up
prediction errors that

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:17.150
report the differences
between what's going on

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.560
and what the brain expects.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.040
So what is our experience
of the inside of our bodies?

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.310
Well, way back at the
beginning of psychology,

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.530
William James and
Carl Langer proposed

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.530
that emotions,
emotional experience,

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.960
was really about the brain's
perception of changes

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.690
in its physiological state,
rather than perception

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.110
of the outside world.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.800
So, in this classic
example, seeing a bear

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.220
does not in itself generate
the experience of fear.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.810
Rather seeing the
bear sets in train,

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.890
a load of physiological changes
preparing for fight and flight

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:49.910
responses.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.160
And it's the perception
of those bodily changes

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.950
in the context with the
bear being around that leads

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.750
to our experience of fear.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.570
So the Bayesian perspective
just generalises that idea,

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.160
and says that
emotional experience

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.340
is the brain's best
guess of the causes

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.570
of interoceptive signals.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.140
And this fits very nicely
with a lot of evidence.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.550
And this is just one study
done by a Finnish group.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.470
And all they did here was,
they had people report

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:25.570
where on their bodies they felt
various emotions to take place.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.710
And so you feel anxiety
in one part of your body.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.240
You feel fear in
another, and so on.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.930
So our experience
of emotion does

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.250
seem to be
intrinsically embodied.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.210
Now another part of our
experience of being a body

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.470
is the body as a physical
object in the world.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.140
And this might seem quite
easy to take for granted,

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.510
since our physical body
is just always there.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.800
It goes around with us,
it changes over the years,

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.450
in unfortunate ways.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.450
But it's always there.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.890
But it would be a mistake to
take our experience of body

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:02.950
ownership for granted.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.533
And there are some
classic experiments

00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:06.880
that demonstrate how malleable
our experience of body

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.900
ownership is.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.791
This is the famous
rubber hand experiment.

00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:11.290
Probably some of
you have seen this.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:16.600
What happens here is that a
volunteer has their hand hidden

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.230
under a table, and the fake
hand is put on top of the table,

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.090
and then both hands
are simultaneously

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.890
stroked with a paintbrush.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.670
And it turns out that just
seeing a hand-like object where

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:31.360
a hand might be, feeling
touch, and then seeing

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.240
the object being touched,
is enough evidence

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.530
that the brain's best guess
becomes that fake hand is,

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.810
in fact, part of my body.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.410
Sort of part of my body.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.210
This is what it looks
like in practise.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.300
Here you can see the fake
hands, focusing on it.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.770
There's the real
hands, not focusing

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.780
on it, simultaneous
stroking-- and there are

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.010
various ways you can test it.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:48:00.954
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:48:00.954 --> 00:48:04.270
- I found in doing this, it
works even better on children,

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.860
by the way, if you do that.

00:48:10.769 --> 00:48:12.310
So that's interesting,
because that's

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:16.990
using visual and tactile
signals to convince

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.629
the brain that this object
is part of its body.

00:48:19.629 --> 00:48:21.670
In my lab, we've been
interested in whether these

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.380
signals that come from inside
the body also play a role.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.280
So we set up a virtual reality
version of this rubber hand

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.790
illusion, where people
wear these goggles,

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.130
and they see a
virtual fake hand.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.710
And we also record
their heartbeats.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:37.270
And now what we can do is,
we can make the virtual hand

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.960
flash either in time or out
of time with their heart beat.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.940
And we asked the
question, do people

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.830
experience this
virtual hand as more

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.780
belonging to them
when it's flashing

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.170
in time, rather than out of
time, with their heartbeat?

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.820
And the answer is that it does.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.220
And this is just some
data, basically that,

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.100
bigger than that, which means
that, indeed, they experience

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.666
the hand as more their own.

00:48:58.666 --> 00:49:00.040
The way we measure
that actually,

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.840
is that first we can ask them.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.944
That's the easiest way.

00:49:02.944 --> 00:49:04.360
Then we can also
ask them to point

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.910
to where they think
their hand really is,

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.910
and we can see
how far they drift

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.760
from where their hand really is
to where the virtual hand is.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.280
And that provides a
more objective way

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.390
of measuring the
strength of the effect.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:19.790
Here's what it looks
like in practise.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.989
Again if you can see this,
that's the real hand.

00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:24.280
That's somebody's virtual hand.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.904
Again, imagine you're
wearing a headset

00:49:25.904 --> 00:49:29.800
so you'll see this
in 3-D. And you

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.280
can just about see it pulsing
to read and back, I hope.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.940
And you can also do
some other things

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.650
with these virtual
reality rubber hands

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.020
that you couldn't do
with real rubber hands.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.470
For instance, you can map
movements of the real hand

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.840
to the virtual hand, so you
can start to ask questions

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.040
about the extent to which
the virtual hand moves

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.260
as I predict it to move.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.820
How much does that affect
the extent to which I

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.070
feel it to be part of my body?

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:58.750
You can make it change colour.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.850
So you can have somebody embody
a skin colour associated with

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.090
a cultural out-group, and see
if they become less racist

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.730
as a result.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.670
And then my favourite is where
you can change, actually,

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:13.840
the size of the body.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.310
And that's coming up here.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:19.690
So here what we do is, we
can have the hand telescope

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.466
up and down in size.

00:50:21.466 --> 00:50:23.590
And again, this might seem
like fun, and it is fun,

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:24.881
but there is a serious purpose.

00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:26.310
There are various conditions.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.768
There's in fact,
a condition called

00:50:27.768 --> 00:50:29.890
Alice in Wonderland
Syndrome, where people report

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.710
that all parts of their body
are, indeed, telescoping

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:34.720
up and down in size.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.790
And in a more subtle way, there
are lots of body dysmorphias,

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.540
of subtle misperceptions
of body shape, which

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.120
might be associated
with eating disorders.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.717
And so these sorts of
techniques allow us to approach,

00:50:46.717 --> 00:50:48.550
in a very fine grained
way, how people might

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.150
mis-perceive their own bodies.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.510
That brings me to the third
take-home message about self.

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.980
And with apologies to
Descartes, the take home message

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:04.390
is that, I predict
myself, therefore I am.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:07.060
In the last nine minutes,
before the bell rings,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.780
I want to go full circle and
return to this Cartesian idea

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.980
of the beast machine.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.470
To try to convince you that
our experience of being

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.550
a conscious self is intimately
tied up with our beast machine

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.540
nature.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.570
And to do this, I need to
mention one final aspects

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:25.270
of perceptual inference,
which has a lot

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:28.630
to do with Karl Friston,
who's done a lot of work

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:31.522
in the Bayesian brain
UCL here in London.

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:33.730
And if we think of the brain
as being in the business

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:36.970
of minimising prediction
errors, this can be done either

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:40.106
by updating our
perceptual predictions,

00:51:40.106 --> 00:51:41.980
which is what I've been
talking about so far.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.290
And this what Helmholtz said.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.470
Or we can minimise prediction
errors by making actions.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.300
We can change what
we predict, or we

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.990
can make an action so that
our predictions come true.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.150
You can change
with sensory input,

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.170
or you can change
what you believe

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.220
about your sensory input.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.220
One point of doing this is,
that you can make actions,

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:10.547
then, to find out more about
the world that surrounds you.

00:52:10.547 --> 00:52:12.130
And this is what
Helmholtz has in mind

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.200
when he says that
each movement we make,

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.600
by which we alter the
appearance of objects,

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.060
should be thought of as
an experiment designed

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.750
to test whether we've
understood correctly

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.700
the invariant relations of
the phenomena before us.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.860
Which Gregory, much later,
said something similar

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.190
when he talked about perception
as hypothesis testing.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.440
The point of this
is, that we make

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.480
eye movements, and other
kinds of movements,

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.070
to understand what
the world is like.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:39.130
That, in fact, there was is
tomato there, for instance.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:42.200
But there's another way to
think about active inference,

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.010
which is that, when we
minimise prediction error,

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.584
what we're actually doing is
controlling a sensory variable.

00:52:47.584 --> 00:52:49.000
We're preventing
it from changing,

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.916
because we're making our
prediction about what

00:52:50.916 --> 00:52:53.290
it is come true.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:55.810
And this is the use
of active inference,

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.120
to control or
regulate something,

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.570
rather than to understand what
the causes of that something

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:02.110
are.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.840
And this brings a very
different tradition

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.180
to mind, which is 20th
century cybernetics.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.040
And this is Ross Ashby,
who was a pioneer

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.600
of this way of thinking.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.210
And he, with Roger Conan
right at the end of his life,

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.220
wrote a paper.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.370
The title of the paper,
was "Every good regulator

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:21.400
of a system must be a
model of that system".

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.520
The idea here is, if you want
to regulate something very

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:28.180
precisely, then you
need a good model

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:33.570
of what effects that system.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.359
Now you could apply this idea
to the external world, as well.

00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:38.900
When you try to
catch a cricket ball,

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:42.090
you are actually trying
to control the level

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.910
of the angle above the horizon.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.070
But it applies more
naturally, I think,

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.510
to the internal
state of our body.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:53.400
So really, what matters about
my internal physiological

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.170
condition, I don't
really need to know

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.050
exactly what it's like inside
my body, and care about it.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.260
But I need to control it, and
my brain needs to regulate it.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.240
So this way of thinking
about active inference

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.200
applies more naturally
to interoception.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.970
Think about it this way that.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:13.440
Having good predictive
models are always useful,

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.990
but we can have a pendulum
that swings, on the one hand,

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.280
towards control.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.830
We can use these predictive
models for control,

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.960
and that's more applied to the
state of our internal body.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.732
Or we can swing the other way,
and think about perception,

00:54:26.732 --> 00:54:27.315
understanding.

00:54:27.315 --> 00:54:30.330
You could think of the
instrumental, epistemic ways

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.660
of thinking about the role
of action and perception.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.349
And this brings to mind--

00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:36.390
I mentioned Karl Friston.

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:39.120
He's come up with this
thing called the free energy

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.900
principle.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.580
And I can only nod
to the vast body

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.230
of work he's done here on this.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:47.070
With the slogan, which is that
organisms, over the long run,

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.520
maintain themselves in states
in which they expect to be in,

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.860
in virtue of having
good predictive models

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.020
about their own
internal condition.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.120
So this takes us right
back to Descartes,

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.680
but in a very different way.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.140
As I said right at the beginning
of this lecture, for Descartes

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.680
our physiological
reality was rather

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.470
irrelevant to our minds, our
rationality, our consciousness.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.980
This is a quote from a 1968
paper on his beast machine

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.830
argument, "without minds to
direct their bodily movements,

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.730
animals must be regarded as
unthinking, unfeeling machines

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:29.110
that move like clockwork."

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:34.550
Now I think if you
try to think how

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.400
this idea of our
predictive models

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.460
controlling our internal
physiological states,

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.940
and the resulting experiences
that perceptual content that

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.610
might give rise to, you
can make the opposite case.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.880
And the opposite case would
be that conscious self-hood

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.780
emerges because of, and
not in spite of, the fact

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.270
that we are beast machines.

00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.560
And I think this is a deeply
embodied view of consciousness

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.070
and self, and it speaks to this
fundamental link in continuity

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:08.300
between what it is to be alive,
what it is to have a mind,

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.457
and what it is to
be a conscious self.

00:56:14.562 --> 00:56:16.520
So I repeat, the third
take-home message should

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.660
make even more sense now.

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.850
That I predict myself,
therefore I am.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:23.320
And I am a conscious
self because I'm

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.550
a bag of self-fulfilling
predictions

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:29.510
about my own physiological
persistence over time.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.800
Now why does any of this matter?

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.920
It's a lot of interesting
ideas, but why should we

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.450
be interested in
studying consciousness?

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:38.270
Well it's a very
interesting thing,

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:39.440
I hope I've convinced you.

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.065
But there are lots
of practical reasons

00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:42.350
to be interested as well.

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:46.010
There are between 20 and
60,000 patients in the UK

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.350
alone, who are in
disorders of consciousness.

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:50.630
You are in the vegetative
state, or in coma,

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.030
or in some other
severely abnormal state

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.870
of consciousness.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:56.030
Having better measures
of conscious level,

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.800
as I described at
the beginning, is

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.810
going to really
change again, and how

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.630
we treat people like this.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.010
And of course, in psychiatry.

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:09.710
Psychiatric disorders are
increasing that prevalence

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.870
across all modern
societies, and it's

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:14.960
estimated one in six
of us, at any one time,

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.150
are suffering from a
psychiatric condition.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.700
And understanding the mechanisms
that underlie conscious

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.920
content and conscious
self, because a lot

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.430
of psychiatric disorders
include disturbances

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:27.230
of the way we
experience our body,

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:31.100
even though that might not
be the most obvious symptom,

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.860
can help us understand
the mechanisms

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.650
involved in
psychiatric disorders,

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:37.830
not just the symptoms.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.181
There are also some
more general reasons

00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:41.930
for studying consciousness,
which bring up

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.120
some ethical questions.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.790
When does consciousness
emerge in development

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:48.350
on newborn babies conscious?

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.250
Or does consciousness
start even in the womb?

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.080
Maybe different dimensions
of consciousness

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.930
emerge at different times.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.250
Are other animals conscious?

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.980
Well I think it can make a
very good case for mammals

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.110
and primates, but what
about the octopus?

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.600
The octopus has more
neurons in its arms

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.980
than in its central brain.

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.250
They're very smart creatures.

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.570
Here, you have to ask the
question not only, what

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.250
is it like to be an
octopus, but what is

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:14.970
it like to be an octopus arm?

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.330
And finally, with the rise
of artificial intelligence,

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.210
we should begin to ask
questions about what would it

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:27.470
take for a machine to have some
kind of subjective experience.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.500
I don't think we're
anywhere near that yet,

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.290
but we should consider
what science can tell us

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:36.360
about its possibility, because
that would raise some very,

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.860
very tricky ethical questions.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.540
But, fundamentally,
consciousness

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.960
remains fascinating for
me for the same reason

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.710
that it's motivated people
throughout the ages.

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.140
I mean, Hippocrates, the
founder of modern medicine,

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:51.890
put it one way.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:55.810
He said, from the brain and
from the brain alone arise

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.830
our sorrows, our joys.

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.440
And he also had his
first view of psychiatry

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.050
that madness comes
from its moistness.

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:05.362
And then Francis Crick,
in the 1990s, who

00:59:05.362 --> 00:59:06.570
I mentioned in the beginning.

00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:09.320
He gave birth, if you like,
to the modern neuroscience

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.370
of consciousness.

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:15.320
He said much the same thing
in his astonishing hypothesis.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.400
But there is this
mystery and wonder still,

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.760
about how the biological
machinery inside our heads

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.550
gives rise to the rich
inner universe that

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:27.350
makes life worth living.

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.360
And despite this mystery, modern
science is making progress.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.290
I hope I've given you a flavour,
even though we don't understand

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.410
how consciousness happens, we
can begin to understand its

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.850
mechanisms.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.650
So we should not be afraid of
naturalising consciousness.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:44.900
It's not a bad thing
to understand its basis

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.100
in the material world.

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.970
As so often in science,
with greater understanding

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:54.410
comes a larger sense of wonder,
and a greater realisation

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:59.780
that we are part of, and not
apart from, the rest of nature.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.230
