00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
KATIE STECKLES: I would
like to talk to you

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.570
about the number 5.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.450
And the thing that I like most
about the number 5 is that

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.616
there are only five
platonic solids.

00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:10.540
JAMES GRIME: This is
a regular polygon.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.510
It's a regular triangle.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.400
And it has the same number
of triangles

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.360
meeting at each corner.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.340
KATIE STECKLES: The definition
of a platonic solid is a shape

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.080
where you've got sort of
different sides to the shape,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.220
but all of the sides
are the same shape.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.640
That shape is a regular kind of
polygon-- so like a square

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.560
where all the sides are the same
length and the angles are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.040
the same and every corner
looks the same.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.770
So those are the conditions.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.920
JAMES GRIME: And this is, in
fact, called a tetrahedron.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.100
It's like a pyramid.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.980
But it's got a triangular
base, not a square base.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.910
KATIE STECKLES: So a tetrahedron
is four triangles.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.575
JAMES GRIME: This is
the octahedron.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.174
It has eight--

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:48.058
oct--

00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:50.530
eight triangular faces.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.030
KATIE STECKLES: So if I get two
of those and stick them

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.570
together, you'll see that I
also get the same corner

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.640
everywhere else.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.755
And this is an octahedron.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.350
JAMES GRIME: So unlike our
tetrahedron, this has four

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.942
triangles meeting
at each corner.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.740
KATIE STECKLES: And
this is one of my

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.000
favorite platonic solids.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200
This is called an icosahedron.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.520
You can see every single corner
has got five triangles

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.700
meeting at it.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.440
And all of the faces
are triangles.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.610
And in fact, you get
20 triangles.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.730
So this is an icosahedron.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.530
JAMES GRIME: This
one over here--

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.007
my marvelous props-- well,
Brady, what's that?

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:25.961
BRADY HARAN: That is a cube.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:26.640
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.090
It's a hexahedron.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.710
Well done.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.760
So a hexahedron has
six square faces.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.090
KATIE STECKLES: So I'm
happy with that.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.930
And I'll put a cube
on my list.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200
And that is six squares.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.900
At this point, I would
jump to pentagons.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.460
I don't have any pentagons,
unfortunately.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.450
But you can fit three pentagons
around a point.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.680
JAMES GRIME: This is
the dodecahedron.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.855
Dodec means 12.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.210
It has 12 pentagon faces.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.780
And at each vertex, we
have three pentagons.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.520
OK, so we're going to show
that there are only five

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850
possible regular solids.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.600
So let's imagine we're looking
at a shape that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.200
has triangular faces.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.670
OK, so it has to have
at least three.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.030
Let's think of a corner.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.494
There we go.

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:12.140
Let's try to get that right.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.720
So there you have it.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.116
Let's imagine this
corner here.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:20.170
And around this corner are
three regular triangles.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.280
Now, we've got this gap here.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.600
Here's a big gap--

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.530
a space.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.210
If you glue this side to this
side, it's going to be a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.980
concave shape.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.500
And that will actually be three

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.640
triangles around a point.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.530
That will be your tetrahedron.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.910
Let's add another triangle.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.610
Let's make it like this.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.560
So now we've got
four triangles.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.000
We've got this gap again.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.110
Now, if we glue these
sides together--

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.820
this gap-- four triangles
around a point--

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.300
well, that will be
your octahedron.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.440
That will make a octahedron--

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.540
fine.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.640
Let's draw another
triangle in here.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.745
So now we've got five triangles
around a point.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:02.940
Glue it together.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.190
Here's a little missing
gap here.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.220
Glue it together.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.690
And this will make your
icosahedron--

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.630
five triangles around a point.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.840
If you tried to keep going--
if you try six triangles

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.200
around a point, though, all
you get is a flat object.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.320
It's just a flat
piece of paper.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.180
It's not concave.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.260
It's not a shape.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.290
So that's as far as you
can go-- seven--

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.700
eight.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.120
You can't add any
more triangles.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.826
All right, let's
do the squares.

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:31.416
Let's have three squares
around a point.

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.120
There we go.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.730
And these are all 90 degrees--

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.450
90 degrees.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.970
There's a missing gap here.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.220
Glue it together--

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.700
this side glued to this side.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.570
And you'll get your cube.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.300
If you try and add a fourth
square to it,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.880
you'll get 360 degrees.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.720
You'll get a flat
shape again--

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.140
no point.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.120
Let's try the pentagons.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.260
That's all we have to do.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.280
Pentagons--

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.700
I will do my best.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.170
BRADY HARAN: Pentagons are hard
to draw, aren't they?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.640
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.970
I'm a mathematician rather than
an artist, so I may just

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.820
leave it there.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.610
I think I'm going to have to--

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.030
I'm going to struggle
around this.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.920
But if I draw pentagons,
a pentagon has an

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.130
angle of 108 degrees.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.710
You can fit three
around a point.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.230
If you fit three around a point,
that would add up to

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.470
324 degrees.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.474
And you have a little gap.

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.110
And you can glue it together.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.620
And if you do it, you'll
end up with three

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.680
pentagons around a point.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.840
That's a dodecahedron.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.150
You can't fit four
about a point.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.710
The angles are too big.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.050
So let's move on.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.330
Let's try the hexagons.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.170
Hexagons have an angle
of 120 degrees.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.440
If you try three hexagons
around a point, that

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.026
will add up to 360.

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:47.660
BRADY HARAN: You
can draw them.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.410
JAMES GRIME: OK, I'll
draw those--

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.030
he says.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.430
Let's draw three hexagons
around a point.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.090
Each one has 120 degrees--

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.890
120 degrees--

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.890
120 degrees.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.980
It adds up to 360.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.300
It's flat.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.370
It makes a flat shape.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.970
It's not a concave shape.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.270
It's not a solid.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.610
After that, if you're looking at
seven sided shapes-- eight

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.500
sided shapes--

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.940
the angles are too big.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.220
And they don't making regular
solids at all.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.110
BRADY HARAN: Katie, I think the
viewers are going to have

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.760
two questions.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.580
Here's the first question.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.440
Where does a sphere fit
into all of this?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.800
KATIE STECKLES: A sphere isn't
a platonic solid because it

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.290
doesn't technically
have faces.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.660
I guess in some sense the sphere
is kind of the limit of

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.950
having more and more faces.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.790
Like if you get enough faces,
eventually the faces are all

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.580
of size zero.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.790
But it's not counted as a solid
of any shape because

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.170
it's not got kind of individual

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.835
faces that are a shape.

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:48.090
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.700
And the other question they're
going to have is, where can I

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.100
get some of those cool
magnet toys.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.020
KATIE STECKLES: These
are amazing.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.750
It's called Polydron.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.820
They do like a clippy
together version.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.110
But this is the magnetic
version, which is like the

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.570
Ferrari of Polydron.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.130
And while we're using
brand names, I think

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.770
this is really nice.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.120
They do sell pentagons.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.860
And if anyone wants to get me
a very nice present, some

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.080
pentagons would be
much appreciated.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.470
But as it stands, I own
squares and triangles.
