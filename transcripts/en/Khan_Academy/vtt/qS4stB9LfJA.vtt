00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.004
- [Voiceover] What is the
area of the shaded figure?

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.581
So down here we have
this green shaded figure,

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:11.818
and it looks like a rectangle
except it has a square

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:14.133
cut out in the middle.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.490
So when we find its
area, we can think of it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.802
exactly like that.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.916
We want to know how much space it covers.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.888
It covers this rectangle's amount of area

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.958
with this square cut out.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.029
So what we can do is find the
area of the larger rectangle

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.661
and then cut out or subtract
the area of the square

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.162
to see what's left in this shaded area.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.995
So let's start by finding the area

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:44.260
of this larger rectangle.

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:49.173
And to do that, we can
look at the side lengths.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.281
It has side lengths of nine and eight.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.765
To find the area of a
rectangle, we can multiple

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.757
the side lengths.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.924
So nine times eight is 72.

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.970
So that means that this rectangle

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.387
covers 72 square centimeters.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:10.129
This entire rectangular area
covers 72 square centimeters.

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:15.755
But now we need to cut out or subtract

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.148
the area of this square
'cause that's not part

00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:21.260
of our shaded figure.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.315
We need to cut that part out.

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:27.001
So to do that, we know
the side lengths are four

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.296
on the square so we can think of this as

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.817
this is four centimeters
across so we can divide it

00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:35.380
into four equal sections,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380
and same going this way,

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:41.212
and then if we connect these lines,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.243
what it will show us is that we have,

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.993
it's not drawn perfect,
but we have four rows

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:52.701
of four square centimeters.

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.999
Four times we see four square centimeters.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.805
This top row, one, two,
three, four, and so on.

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.993
Four rows, so there's
16 square centimeters

00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:05.326
we need to cut out of the 72

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:09.090
of this entire rectangular area,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.533
we need to cut out or subtract

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:14.421
16 of these square centimeters.

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.047
So let's do that.

00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:19.178
We have 72 as the entire area,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:20.741
and then let's start subtracting out.

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:23.015
We subtract out 10 of them,

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:26.223
just for me like subtracting
10s 'cause they're simpler.

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:29.973
So four, eight, 10 of
the square centimeters.

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:34.131
Now we're down an area of 62 left.

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:38.455
And then let's subtract those two more.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:43.071
We'll get us to subtract
two more, will get us to 60.

00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:45.306
And then there's four
left to subtract in order

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:48.306
to subtract all 16, so 60 minus four

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:51.375
gets us to 56.

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.442
So the entire area of 72,

00:02:57.647 --> 00:03:01.385
we subtracted out these
16 square centimeters,

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.135
leaves us with a final area of 56

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.892
square centimeters.
