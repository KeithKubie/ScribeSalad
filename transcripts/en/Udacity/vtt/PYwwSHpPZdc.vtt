00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.790
Alright, so, here's a little bit of background on

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.670
this visualization. Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, and suffered

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.110
a number of devastating losses. So Charles Minard created

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.240
this chart to describe the sheer amount of loss

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.590
that Napoleon caused in a simple, yet powerful graphic.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.760
So if we start at the left of the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.340
graphic, we are at the Polish Russian border near

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.445
the Neman River. And this flow line shows the size

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:29.020
of Napoleon's grand army 422,000 as they invaded Russia

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.890
of June of 1812. The width of this band indicates

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.380
the size of the army at each place of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.450
the map. In September when the army finally reached Moscow,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.440
it had dwindled to 100,000 men. The path of

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.770
Napoleon's retreat from Moscow is depicted by this lower, darker

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.630
band which is linked to a temperature scale which is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.520
hanging down here. And also these dates that we see

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970
at the bottom of the chart. It was incredibly

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.960
cold, and many froze on the march out of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.400
Russia. This chart shows that the crossing of the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.460
Berezina River was a disaster. And the army struggled back

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.630
to Poland with only 10,000 men remaining. Menard made

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.380
this plot to really highlight the huge amount of loss

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.280
that was caused by Napoleon's march on Russia. Look

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.370
at how many men died marching to and from Moscow.
