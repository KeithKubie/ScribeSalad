00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.270
So if you'll recall from our
last lesson, we had created a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.560
method that set up all of the
appropriate properties with

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.410
our GPP sign in object and
created all the appropriate

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.800
delegate methods, but we hadn't
actually called the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580
method that sets anything up
or, for that matter, done

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.270
anything to sign the user in.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.600
So let's do that now.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.910
We're going to go back into
our code, and let's add a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.160
viewDidLoad method.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:47.830
And we'll say Super viewDidLoad,
and then we can

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.750
initialize this GPP
sign in object.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.630
And then we can take this
shared instance and call

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.230
authenticate.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.370
And this is basically the call
that tells our sign in object,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.379
OK, now let's attempt
to sign in the user.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.519
So let's try this now.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.769
See what happens.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.500
Hey, look at that.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.760
We're set right into
our OAuth dialog.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.320
Now before I go on, let's take
a look at this URL here.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.790
I'm going to Select All.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.275
Of course, it turns out this
doesn't actually Select All.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.086
Let's go from here.

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:32.360
All right, now I'm going
to copy this.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.450
And let's open up a random
text file here,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450
and paste this in.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.600
And we get this giant URL.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.960
But let's break this up by the
URL arguments, and take a look

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.210
at this thing.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.660
Does this look kind of
familiar to you?

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.580
This URL looks pretty similar
to the one we had in our

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.750
presentation.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.510
Remember this one?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.980
We went to accounts.google.com,
we set

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.010
the client ID, we set
the scope, and we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.740
set a redirect URI.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.770
Well, now let's go back
and look at our URL.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.920
And you can see here we have a
scope, we have a client ID,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.850
and we have a redirect URI.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.900
There's a few other things
that we've added here.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.180
This response type code means
give me back a one time code.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.060
This line basically specifies
the user's language.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.990
This state variable is
used to help deter

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.800
cross-site forgery requests.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.450
And this GP SDK basically just
says that the request came

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.730
from the Google+ SDK
version 1.3.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.560
But look at that.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.290
This giant URL, you'll pretty
much know what's going on.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.220
We're saying, hey, Google,
here's our client ID.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.310
This is our "Guess My
Number" application.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.070
We're asking for the
Auth/gamescope.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.965
And when you're done, send it
back to com.google.Guess

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:55.090
MyNumber:/oauth2callback.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.860
Look at that.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.170
We're now able to make sense
of this giant URL.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.690
So now let's go back
to our simulator

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.790
here and scroll down.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.240
And I'm going to click Accept.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.530
Now at this point, it redirects
back to our

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.600
application, which
is good, right?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.690
Because that's what we specified
in our redirect URI,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.310
go to com.google.GuessMyNumber.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.960
However, if we were to take a
look at our console output in

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.370
Xcode, we don't see anything.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.560
We didn't get to this finish
with auth error handler.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.550
And the question is, why not?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.640
Well, that's because while
mobile Safari does correctly

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.520
redirect back to our
application, our application

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.420
does nothing to handle
that URL.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.890
It just kind of gets sent
to us and we ignore it.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.860
So we need to do something
about that.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.830
And this is something we do
within our App Delegate.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.280
So go over to your App Delegate,
and let's import

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.530
Google+/Google+.h.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.750
And we're going to add
another method here.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.470
We're going to add application
open URL source application

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.000
annotation.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.160
This is basically the method
that gets called when your

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.660
application receives some sort
of URL and is asked by the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.530
system, hey, can you
handle this?

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.230
It returns yes if it's able to
properly handle it and returns

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.990
no if it says, I don't
really know what to

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.160
do with this thing.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.959
Now it turns out this method is
pretty simple because the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.560
Google+ library includes its own
method that does most of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.210
the heavy lifting for you.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.440
So first, just in case actually
you're curious, let's

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.760
add in a little NS
log that shows

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.380
the URL that we received.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.150
So I have received the
URL to handle.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
We can call URL absoluteString.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.730
And then we're just going
to call the class method

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.360
GPPURLHandler handleURL source
application annotation.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120
So the URL here is URL.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.900
Source application is
source application.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.070
And annotation is annotation.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.550
So we put this into
conditional.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.820
We're basically checking with
Google+ and saying, hey, does

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.870
this look like a URL
you can handle?

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.070
If it does, we return yes.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.360
Otherwise, we'll return no.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.060
In case you're saying
to yourself, hey,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.870
that's extra code.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.960
Why not just say return this?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.930
The answer is that this might
work if the only URL you are

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.815
ever going to check against
is one sent from Google+.

00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:25.870
But in reality, there
might be URLs you're

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.880
going to want to handle.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.750
So more likely than not, there
might be another elsif here

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.940
and another elsif and so on
before you finally return no.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.960
So that's why we wrote
it that way.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.170
So now we can run this, and
let's see what happens.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.730
Again, we're taken to the "Guess
My Number" application.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.470
I click Accept.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.130
We get redirected back
to our application.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.900
And look here, we've got
a whole bunch of OAuth

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.030
information here in our log.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.930
You can see the URL
we received.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.040
And this code equals blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.160
This is our one time use code
that the system received.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.080
It then exchanged that
for a bearer token.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.220
And since everything worked as
planned, our GPP sign in

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.140
object called finished
with auth error.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.940
And in this case, our Auth is
a GTM OAuth2 authentication

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.740
object that includes an access
token, a refresh token, and

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.790
our one time use code along
with an expiration date.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.530
And our error here is null
because we ran into no errors.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.510
So look at that.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.240
We received our bearer token
from the system, and we've

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.120
successfully signed
the user in.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.860
Of course, it turns out I still
kind of lied to you.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.320
We signed the user in, but
we just did it by calling

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.140
authorized during viewDidLoad.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.380
This isn't the greatest
user experience.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.530
You don't want your player
taken to an OAuth2 dialog

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.650
before he or she has even had
a chance to see your game's

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.810
title screen.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.010
So we really are going to add
a sign in button to initiate

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.300
the sign in process.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.920
And really, honest this time,
we're going to add it in the

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.100
next lesson.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.690
Have I ever lied
to you before?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.830
So stick with me.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.330
Sign in button's coming next.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:15.722
