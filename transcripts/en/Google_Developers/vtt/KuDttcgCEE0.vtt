00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.890
MIHAI IONESCU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.100
Welcome to another session of
Payments on Developers Live.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.710
We were hoping to have a partner
join us today, but

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.000
unfortunately, they
couldn't make it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.030
But they promise they will make
it in a couple of weeks.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.380
PENG YING: They promised.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.880
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll
hold them to that.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.110
But nevertheless we have so
many things to talk about.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.890
You will definitely
be entertained.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.780
We have announcements.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.850
We have lesson demos.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.620
And of course, we'll
take questions.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.810
First, we'd like to make
an introduction.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.490
We have a new colleague.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.500
We were telling you that
we were hiring.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.050
And we're very happy we've
made a great hire.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.460
And on my right side here, there
is Nasir Khan, which is

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.780
a new developer advocate.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.510
We're very happy to
have you, Nasir.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.880
Tell us a little bit about
yourself and what you will be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.080
working on.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.920
NASIR KHAN: Thank you for
the introduction, Mihai.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.460
I'll be focusing on the Wallet
API for mobile payments.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.970
I'm really excited to be here,
and hello everyone, hoping to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.690
see you in the near future for
more of these sessions.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.250
MIHAI IONESCU: All right, we'll
be counting on you.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.950
Tell us a little bit about
the interview process.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.970
We've been telling people that
we're hiring, and we have a

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.340
pipeline of great candidates,
and you were one of the best.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.500
How was it?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.050
NASIR KHAN: Absolutely.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.125
So when I started out with the
interview process I was a

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.180
little nervous because you hear
and read these things

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.530
online that it's a really
excruciating process.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.320
MIHAI IONESCU: A little bit.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.200
NASIR KHAN: It was intensive,
I would say, but it was very

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.530
interesting, too, at
the same time.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.880
So it was a very interesting
day overall.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.185
I really liked it.

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:56.920
It was pretty smooth.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.880
And it turned out
well in the end.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.390
MIHAI IONESCU: Awesome,
awesome.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.030
Yeah, we took it--

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.540
we took it easier on you.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.690
NASIR KHAN: Thank
you for that.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.320
MIHAI IONESCU: And you're
really good.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.390
So we're very happy
to have you here.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.250
PENG YING: How do you
like Google so far?

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.220
NASIR KHAN: It's been
an amazing ride.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.250
I've just been about
a month now.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.050
And every day is a new
day, literally.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.810
Because there's so many
things to learn.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.450
And in fact, the Payments
area, of course, is so

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.820
interesting, so diverse, and
really moving ahead in various

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.170
directions.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.940
So it's very, very exciting
to be here.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.480
MIHAI IONESCU: So many exciting
things happening.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.020
Awesome.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.520
Well, welcome, Nasir.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.040
PENG YING: We're still hiring,
if anybody else is--

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.340
MIHAI IONESCU: We
are hiring, yes.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.840
PENG YING: --interested in
joining the team as well.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.900
MIHAI IONESCU: And we'll see
more of you in upcoming weeks.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.290
All right.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.940
So let's move on to some
announcements.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.850
You've been traveling a lot.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.070
What's been going on?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.010
PENG YING: I have been
traveling, yeah.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.110
Well, I just got back
from Kansas City.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.540
And what we're doing there was
we were holding a Google for

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.140
Entrepreneurs event in Kansas
City, where we walked through

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440
the APIs and the products that
we think can be beneficial to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.260
entrepreneurs and developers.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.360
So I went there, and I spoke
about Google Wallet for

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.060
digital goods, and was telling
them about a high-level

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.650
overview of what Google Wallet
is, and how it can benefit

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.560
developers and entrepreneurs
selling digital goods.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.825
I also got to check out
Google Fiber, which is

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:19.325
something that is--

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:19.760
MIHAI IONESCU: All right!

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.000
Yes!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.780
PENG YING: Yeah, totally
amazing.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.020
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh, I envy you.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.850
PENG YING: I think-- well, I
watch a lot of TV, which is

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.460
probably not the best thing,
but I'm using Comcast right

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.150
now, and the UI for Comcast,
Google Fiber blows it away.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.900
It was amazing what you could
do using a 7-inch tablet as

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.270
your remote control and being
able to schedule DVR and

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.850
stuff, and then stream the DVR
content to the 7-inch tablet

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.210
while you're watching TV, like
some other channel on TV, it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.130
was just a awesome experience.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.510
And I'm totally excited for
people in Kansas City.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.650
Giving you guys a shout out.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I heard
that a lot of start-ups are

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.940
popping up in the Kansas
city area.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.600
PENG YING: It seems like it.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.980
We had pretty good attendance.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.170
MIHAI IONESCU: Wow.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.450
Great.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.220
PENG YING: Cool.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.270
Oh, one more thing.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.030
I want to talk a little
about Stack Overflow.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.960
So we've now pretty much fully
migrated from Google Groups

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.390
over to Stack Overflow.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.680
And we're starting to
see a little bit--

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.339
we're starting to see more and
more questions about any

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.320
Google Wallet topic
on Stack Overflow.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.720
So if you have questions about
Google Wallet APIs, such as

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.350
Checkout Google Wallet for
digital goods, Google Wallet

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.800
for online commerce,
Save-to-Wallet, or any of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.990
those APIs, you can post them
in Stack Overflow and tag it

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.680
with Google-Wallet.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.220
And then we pretty much check
almost every day.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.530
And we'll try to answer
as many of those

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.660
questions as possible.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.490
MIHAI IONESCU: So we're
counting on

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.375
the developer community.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:46.330
If someone misses a question or
doesn't tag it correctly,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.540
please re-tag it.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.220
We'll be forever grateful.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.630
OK, what else is going on?

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.580
Some exciting new launches.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.680
Yeah, Nasir, do you want
to talk about it?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.190
NASIR KHAN: Interesting, yeah.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.870
So as I said, I'll be working
on the Google Payments, and

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.150
there are two new, exciting
devices that have just come on

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.340
the market--

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.650
LG Nexus 4 and Samsung
Nexus 10.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.790
They have Google preinstalled
on them.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.790
And they also have the
latest and greatest

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.460
4.2 Android on them.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.930
PENG YING: 4.2.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.860
MIHAI IONESCU: 4.2 is awesome.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.310
PENG YING: I just got the
OTA this morning.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.670
NASIR KHAN: You did?

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.830
OK, great.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.040
PENG YING: I haven't got
to check it out yet.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.560
I heard the Nexus 4 sold out in
something like 30 minutes.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.330
MIHAI IONESCU: 30?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.150
PENG YING: I could be wrong.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.780
It might be like 50 minutes.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.720
MIHAI IONESCU: No, it sold
out pretty fast.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.240
But there are more on the way.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.670
It's a very nice device,
so no wonder.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.820
And it's a great price.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.150
OK, so what else is going on?

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.170
Oh, I also have an
announcement.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.150
So remember last time someone
asked about to open-ended

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.810
subscriptions?

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.600
So subscriptions with no
expiration date, you just set

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.280
the subscription, let it go,
and either it will end when

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.300
the customer cancels it or
the merchant cancels it.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.260
So our engineering team
went to work.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.590
Open-ended subscriptions are now
available, and I'm going

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.250
to switch to my screen and
show you guys how you

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.700
can set them up.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.040
So if my screen is on, you
will see that we have a

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.360
"numRecurrences" field
in the JWT.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
That is now optional.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.470
If you are not setting it, if
you're omitting it, then the

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.380
subscription would be
open-ended, and it would recur

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.600
until canceled.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.330
And to show you how a screen
will look like when a customer

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.710
places an open-ended
subscription, it'll look just

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.970
like this, and it will nicely
say "The subscription will

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.230
occur every month starting
when, until you cancel on

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.250
subscription/" So that all
means it's open-ended.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.040
So for those who are looking
for this new

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.900
feature, it's there.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.290
Go ahead and use it.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.700
And we were happy that we had
such a fast turnaround.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.790
So with that said, any
other announcements?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.840
PENG YING: Pretty sweet.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.350
MIHAI IONESCU: We will have
some interesting partners

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.230
joining us hopefully in
the next few sessions.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.420
PENG YING: Yeah, in the
next few sessions.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.110
We'll have Carbon Games
bringing on AirMech.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.430
And then we'll have Kabam
talking about their

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.620
monetization and how they've
monetized their games.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.080
MIHAI IONESCU: So don't miss
the next few sessions.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.665
PENG YING:Yep.

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:12.360
Let's go to some questions.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.350
MIHAI IONESCU: Questions,
yes, my

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.390
favorite part of the session.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.350
So I'll take the first one.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.790
So the first one is, "Can we
share revenue via the other

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.000
current or near-future
Google Wallet API?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.240
Is this a beta program?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.050
How can we sign up
to test it?"

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.760
So that is a very good question,
and it's coming up

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.880
frequently.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.300
It is a valid business case and
something that a lot of

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.390
developers are looking
forward to.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.440
Currently, there is no API that
allows you to do revenue

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.460
sharing, but it is on
our to-do list.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.340
So we are working on it.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.800
PENG YING: I'll take
the second one.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.600
"Any word on support for the
Sprint Galaxy Note 2?" So, as

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.580
you know, we can't publicly
give stuff out before it's

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.040
announced here.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.535
But I would say to check the
list of available devices in

00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:08.210
the Help section on
wallet.google.com.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.035
And it's at the bottom
of the page.

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:13.640
It's under Eligible Devices.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.130
And we should be supporting
most of the

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.620
Galaxy devices on Sprint.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.330
Take a look.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.500
Maybe it's there already.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.600
I haven't look at that page
for a little bit.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.430
But if you're interested, go to
wallet.google.com and then

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.430
click Eligible Devices.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.300
MIHAI IONESCU: Upgrade
to a Nexus 4.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.820
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.740
Upgrade to--

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.240
Nexus 4 is an awesome phone.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.490
I played with it a little bit.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.400
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, so let
me take the next one.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.289
And this one, the question is,
"How can I pass user- and

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:46.060
order-specific information on a
Google Wallet transaction?"

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.210
It's not clear from the question
which Google Wallet

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.710
API the developer
is using here.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.300
So let's assume it's the digital
goods API, also called

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.240
the In-App Payments API.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.810
With that, you have a field
called "Seller Data" in the

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.830
JWT, and you can pass any type
of information in that field.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.960
It's nice if you encrypt
it to make sure no one

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.290
else can see it.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.910
And then that information
will be mirrored back

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.510
to you in the postback.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.530
So that's one way you
can pass private

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.170
information back and forth.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.930
If you're using the Google
Checkout API, then you have a

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.760
similar field in the cart XML
and that's called "Merchant

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.970
Private Data"--

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.480
if you search for it, you'll
find it in the documentation--

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.140
similarly passed in the cart
XML, and you will get it back

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.670
in the notification API.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.590
You'll have to subscribe to the
notification API, so very

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.300
similar mechanisms
and very useful.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.330
PENG YING: Cool.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.540
I'll take the next one.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.110
"Is there any progress in
getting Google Wallet on

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.540
carriers such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile,
et cetera?" Again,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.710
we can't really elaborate
on that.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.880
I get all the questions where
I can't say anything.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.250
Sorry, guys.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.380
But we're still working
with them.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.220
I can't get into any details.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.800
So I guess next question.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.060
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I don't
know if that's an easy

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.510
question or a hard question.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.470
It's easy to answer,
but hard because we

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.590
can't give more details.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.300
PENG YING: Yeah, that sucks.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.380
I wish we could.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.600
MIHAI IONESCU: We really
wish we could.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.890
PENG YING: Yeah, transparency
is great.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.860
MIHAI IONESCU: Let me
take the next one.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.270
The question is, "How can I
redirect the customer back to

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.490
my site after a Google Checkout
transaction?" So in

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.860
Google Checkout, there is
no automatic redirect.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.710
There is a "Continue Shopping"
URL field so that you can

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.020
specify, and that will
appear as a link on

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.790
the final order page.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.050
The customer will need
to click on it to go

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.910
back to your site.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.295
So it is not an automatic
action.

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:52.650
It is a user-initiated action.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.200
And this is a one of the
drawbacks of the Checkout API.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.410
If, however, you are selling
digital goods, definitely use

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.330
the Google Wallet for digital
goods API because it's

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.430
designed to be on all ENAP APIs,
so the customer never

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.560
leaves your site.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.010
It all happens on your site.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.200
So you have complete control
over the buy flow experience.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.710
So something to consider,
depending on what kind of

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.960
goods you're selling.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.730
Next question.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.945
Let me take this one because
it's also about subscriptions.

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:27.240
PENG YING: All right.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:27.800
Go for it.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.840
MIHAI IONESCU: It's A little
bit down my alley.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.360
So the question is, "When
testing recurring subscription

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.060
in the Sandbox, how can I verify
that my subscription

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.090
recurs on the correct date?

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.120
Do I have to wait a month, as
the only available frequency

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.360
is monthly?" So the nice thing
about the Sandbox is that you

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.310
can do all kinds of testing and
place order, cancel orders

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.780
without really incurring
me transaction costs.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.720
So to verify that a subscription
recurs correctly,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.210
you can play a little
bit with the JWT.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.550
And let's say you set up a free
trial subscription that

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.020
recurs one day in the future.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.330
So you set the first
subscription charge to occur

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.870
one day in the-- tomorrow.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.210
And then you just wait one day,
and you verify on your

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.140
buyer account, did I get
the transaction email?

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.880
And you look in the
merchant account.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.800
Did the transaction
appear there?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.030
Can I cancel it?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.500
So it's not as bad as it looks
with the monthly frequency.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.860
You just need to play a little
bit with our JWT and get a

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.290
little bit creative.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.145
PENG YING: I have a question
about subscriptions.

00:12:41.145 --> 00:12:41.820
MIHAI IONESCU: Go ahead.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.950
PENG YING: Are we going to
enable anything other than

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.790
monthly soon?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.330
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes, we're
going to do that.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.200
Most likely weekly should be
pretty easy to do, and then

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.890
three months, so quarterly
should also be easy.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.030
We're looking at six months.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.320
So we're verifying.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.260
We're asking people which are
the most useful ones, and then

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.280
we'll go in that priority.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.290
NASIR KHAN: I've seen monthly
and yearly subscriptions.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.890
MIHAI IONESCU: Yearly
subscription is also very

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.910
popular, yes.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.890
So we're looking at
all of those.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.470
PENG YING: Cool.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.770
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, you want
to look at the next one?

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.490
PENG YING: Sure, I'll take
this shipping one.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.040
So it looks like somebody is
having trouble with Checkout.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.100
And the question is,
"I have trouble

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.050
shipping with Checkout.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.570
I use product weight to
calculate the shipping cost

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.540
from the table in the
Merchant Center.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.090
One item has flat-rate
shipping with

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.120
product shipping class.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.810
When this item is in the cart,
the customer is only charged

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.050
the flat rate."

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.640
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.930
We need a little time
to parse this one.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.860
It's quite technical.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.780
PENG YING: I did a lot of
Checkout support in the past.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.830
In order to troubleshoot this
issue, I would actually need

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.630
the cart XML.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.760
It's the clearest way to
understand what's going wrong.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.350
But from this description
and from my experience

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.650
troubleshooting shopping carts
and Checkout, I think what's

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:09.370
going on is that the carts that
are being submitted, it

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.050
also includes shipping
information within the cart.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.520
So that shipping information
is then overriding--

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.010
it takes precedence over the
Merchant Center configuration.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.063
So if you've set up your
shipping tables in the

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.190
Merchant Center,
and you have--

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.040
like let's say you're using
e-commerce platform, and this

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.270
e-commerce platform is
generating some shipping

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.090
information in the
cart itself.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.050
That shipping information
that's generated by the

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.720
e-commerce platform will take
precedence, and that's what

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.050
Checkout will use to
charge a customer.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.460
And that could be what's
happening here.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.080
MIHAI IONESCU: Most
likely, yeah.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.650
PENG YING: If it's not, if
you're looking at the XML cart

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.710
and it's not working, maybe try
posting the question on

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.830
Stack Overflow, and then include
your XML cart, and

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.940
include what you're seeing,
a description

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.570
of what you're seeing.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.610
And then we'll try
to take look.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.570
MIHAI IONESCU: Definitely we're
going to be parsing also

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.110
the Stack Overflow stream for
more technical questions.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.180
Unfortunately, this is a
Moderator question, and you're

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.500
limited as far as how
much information

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.240
you can put in there.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:20.280
So I can understand why this was
hard to express what the

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.270
problem is.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.360
So Stack Overflow with code
samples, and we're going to

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.500
look at them.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.040
And maybe we can
debug it live.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.490
That would be fun.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.740
PENG YING: Debugging live.

00:15:33.301 --> 00:15:35.080
It's coming.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.170
I swear.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.060
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, so it
looks like we're at

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.770
the end of the questions.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.310
The next couple weeks are
going to be exciting.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.860
PENG YING: Yeah, Thanksgiving
next week.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.390
Gobble, gobble.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.610
MIHAI IONESCU: And after that,
another Payments Live session.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.390
PENG YING: Yeah, we're
definitely going to be another

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.210
Payments Live session.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.030
We'll have AirMech on.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.860
I don't know if you guys have
heard of AirMech or played

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.220
with AirMech at all.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.065
Well, right now it's kind of
like a defense of the Ancient

00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:12.315
style game.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.860
If you don't know that, it's
kind of like a competitive

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.000
Tower Defense game.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.900
And then basically the reason
why it's amazing is because of

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.200
the technology that
they've built and

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.580
enabled into the browser.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.300
So we'll be showing this
awesome-looking game in the

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.630
browser, and then we'll be
talking to them about how

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.370
they've monetized the game, the
method of monetization,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.760
which in their case
is freemium.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.320
So we'll be discussing a little
bit about the freemium

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.110
methodology, and then if it's
been successful for them, and

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.580
maybe you'll find
some insights.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.060
MIHAI IONESCU: It's an excellent
use case of how you

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.540
can use the digital goods API to
monetize a browser app for

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.060
any kind of game.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.470
All right.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.670
Well, thank you.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.240
And thank you, Nasir,
for joining us.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.800
We'll see everyone next time.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.400
Bye.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.650
PENG YING: See ya.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:32.600
