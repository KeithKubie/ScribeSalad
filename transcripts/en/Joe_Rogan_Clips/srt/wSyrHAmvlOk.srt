1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,620
Well that is the one area of your life
where you've got some or furry in control

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:10,260
and that's, yeah, that is
what on the bow is like the,

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,790
well I can stop myself being like, uh, uh,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,050
watching pornography. I can stop myself
using drugs if I want to. Like, you know,

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,290
we have some support and that's
what that this book here, mentors,

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,050
we should talk about you in only for
a paragraph. You know what I mean?

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,410
It's not too, it's not like,
uh, like literary fellatio.

9
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:32,910
It's as a small nod of your, uh,
of your influence in impaction.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,300
I talk about how we have light and latent
qualities within us that are sometimes

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:42,360
hard to realize on,
on without support.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,980
But if you find a mentor in an area
where you're looking to improve,

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,860
they can get kind of energized,

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,890
awakened energies within you there on
your own you wouldn't be able to use.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,200
I had a really recent experience of it
where I was sort of like freaking out

16
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,010
about something.
I spoke to like a,

17
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:04,200
a mentor of mine and like the way that
you sort of spoke to me was like sort of

18
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:07,140
aggressive, like a sort of an
aggressive, that's not going to happen.

19
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,220
You are not afraid.

20
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,970
And like it sort of woke up the
part of me that's feels that way,

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,050
that has that kind of,

22
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:18,051
I would say sort of a male certainty
are kind of grounded energy.

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
He was able to sort of like direct at
me and like in that moment in myself or

24
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,810
but welded, I wasn't
able to do it, you know,

25
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,300
and needed to resource it
externally in a moment.

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,050
So this is how I sort of feel
like your individual journey.

27
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm interested in how,

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,310
because I'm guessing with your
background in martial arts and stuff,

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,970
men or ships seems pretty much stitched
into that you must continually be

30
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,650
looking at someone learning from someone,
trying to equal them or whatever it is.

31
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,990
Yeah.
The good part about that,

32
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,700
as you get good at learning things and
you get good at listening, you know, uh,

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,590
as a martial arts student, you don't
just listen, you listen very intently.

34
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,620
You bow, you say, sir, you
know, I mean there's a,

35
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,030
there's so much discipline
involved in the, the,

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,940
the act of learning.
Yeah.

37
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,620
And so much reverence and respect
for people to know more than you and

38
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,690
appreciation. So, uh, that,

39
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:10,150
that helped me with pretty much
everything I ever wanted to learn.

40
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,000
I just would listen very
intently and I don't think, ah,

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,010
maybe I could figure it out better.
I will.

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,290
I'm very good at listening to
people that are good at things.

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,790
That's interesting. Did you
first get into like, you know,

44
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:26,140
I've picked up stuff over
the various shows that, of
yours that I've listened to,

45
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,170
but would you say that your inaugural
rural interest in martial arts came from

46
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,810
kind of domestic distress and stuff?
We have a difficult home life and,

47
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,630
and not a good relationship
with your Stepdad Mri.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,150
There was that, but it was, was also
moved moving more than anything.

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,970
Anonymous does a nice guy,
but it was stepped out.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,730
It's always a weird situation.
You know?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,450
No one likes the dynamic of someone
having sex with their mother.

52
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,630
I remember I had similar
feelings about my [inaudible].

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,910
I don't want to like,
no, of course I'm in a

54
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,590
bad way. Not just what was really hard
was moving a lot and running into bullies.

55
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,360
That was way harder than anything else.

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,000
So there was a time in your life where
you felt very presumably vulnerable. Yeah.

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,610
Not grounded. Didn't have any friends.
Constantly moving in new neighborhoods,

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,880
meeting New People and uh, you
know, and when you're a young boy,

59
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:20,370
you're a teenage boy. Teenage boys are
fucking dangerous. Yeah. Made it worse.

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,180
They're the worst.
You see a group of them.

61
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:27,170
Now I'm talking about my country for 1314
years old are across the street. Yeah.

62
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,250
Loneliness. Well, young boys are just,

63
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,310
they're always looking to impress each
other and the, the, they have these,

64
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,080
if you want to find real toxic
masculinity, it exists in teenage boys.

65
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah. And it's mostly
exaggerated, didn't men,

66
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,950
the way it's described as
mostly exaggerated in terms
of the way the media talks

67
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,410
about it,
but in its purest form and teenage boys,

68
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,740
they get together and they start light
and frogs on fire and doing shit.

69
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,790
They do things because they want to like
one up each other and they feed off of

70
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,624
each other.

71
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,490
Like what one boy would do is so
different than what five boys would do,

72
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,040
what five boys would do.
It could be horrific,

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,780
but with one boy would do on his own.

74
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,120
It's very rarely there
because what you know,

75
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,730
you have to think about yourself
and think about is this right?

76
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:14,560
And you objectively analyze the way
you're behaving and I'm like, um,

77
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,660
yeah. People wouldn't be proud
of me if I did it this way.

78
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,950
When you're with five other boys and
you're all rambunctious and fill with

79
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,810
testosterone and piss and vinegar, you
wind up doing crazy things. This is I,

80
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,340
you know,
when I hear something like that,

81
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,300
it's difficult not to think that it's
of course relative relative to us,

82
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,080
the behavior of adolescent
mouse is reckless and crazy.

83
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,250
It's not impossible to conceive of
an intelligent that would look at the

84
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,940
behavior of adult human beings
and think, oh my God. Yeah,

85
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,700
all what's governing these people? What
principals are they using right now? Like,

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,130
what's the end goal to like what are
you trying to accomplish with your life,

87
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,630
with your existence,
with your time?
