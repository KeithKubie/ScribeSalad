x plus 10 squared is correct. Great job if you got that one right. If you're a

00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:07.304
little stumped, then stay with me and we'll figure this out together. You

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.126
might've also put x plus 10 times x plus 10, which is also correct. We have the

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:16.274
same factor listed twice, so we could've just written it as x plus 10 squared.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:20.282
This expression follows this factoring pattern. The first term is a perfect

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:24.528
square. Since x squared is x squared, and the last term is also a perfect

00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:31.703
square. Since 10 squared is 100. So the a is really x, and the b is really 10.

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:37.430
This means that we can rewrite this expression as x squared plus 2 times x times

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.834
10 plus 10 squared. We know this perfect square trinomial can be written as a

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:47.635
binomial squared. So, we really have x plus 10 squared. Don't worry if you

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:50.383
didn't get this first one right, there'll be more to come.
