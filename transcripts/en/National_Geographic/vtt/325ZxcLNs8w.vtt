00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
The first story
that I wanted to share

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.971 align:start size:94% position:6%
of this new work is a
story about Tiger Sharks.

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.973
Now, Tiger Sharks if
you read the literature

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:10.276
are described as the
most dangerous sharks

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.711
in tropical waters.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
They are considered the
second most dangerous species

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.283 align:start size:84% position:16%
of shark overall
after The Great White.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start size:97% position:3%
They've certainly been
portrayed as mindless monsters

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.756
but in reality the
cutting edge science

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.725
that's being done right
now is showing that these

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.526 line:0%
are animals that actually
have a pretty high degree

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.129 line:0%
of cognition and they
have the ability to learn

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.031 line:0%
and the ability to remember.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.599 line:0%
Can't get into
all that right now

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.068 line:0%
but this is some of the stuff

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.870
that will be published I
think in the time ahead.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.706
They're also one of the most
versatile species of sharks.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.643 align:start size:94% position:6%
One day they'll be hunting
in a thousand meters

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.911
of deep Pacific water
and the very next day

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.781
they'll be in a marina
looking for fish scraps

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.649
under a fisherman's boat.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.252
When they are born tiger
sharks look like this,

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.989
they have this amazingly
stunning pattern of stripes

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.391
which off course is where
they get the name from,

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.061
the tiger like stripes that
they have on their body.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.331
This was a neonate just a few
days old that I photographed

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.132
in Hawaii last year.

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.269
Those stripes begin
to fade as the animal

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.804
gets a little bit older and
they're not quite as vivid

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.505
and quite striking.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:16.308
But the in the 20 years or so,

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:17.743 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've been diving
for almost 40 years,

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.012
but for about 20
years of my career,

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.649
I was very interested
in finding tiger sharks

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.116
but had almost no success.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.386 align:start size:97% position:3%
I would do trips to various
places but never really

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.023
found them in any predictable
way but a number of years ago

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.358
a buddy of mine that ran
or runs a dive business

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.527 align:start size:94% position:6%
out of Palm Beach Florida
discovered a place

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.229
in the Bahamas, in
the Northern Bahamas

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.797
that he named Tiger Beach.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.265
And this is an aerial view,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
I used the National Geographic
blimp to do a low altitude

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.235
aerial shot here.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.873
And this is a place, it's
sort of a sandy, shallow,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.774
sand flat area in the
Northern Bahamas where

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:52.478 align:start size:97% position:3%
these animals congregate,
you'll find on any given day,

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:53.746
a dozen or more of them.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.215
So we see a bunch of
these big ol' tigers

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.818
hanging out behind the boat,
perfect day to go swimming.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.086
As we see right here.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is what it looks
like underwater,

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.256
this is the scene underwater.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:08.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
You can swim down about
maybe 20 feet or so

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:12.097 align:start position:0%
and find yourself in the company
of these big tiger sharks.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:16.101
Many of these are between
12 and 14 feet in length.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.337
And they'll come up very close,

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
they'll give you some
great closeup encounters

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.810
not using any cages
here or anything.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.612
And it's a pretty
extraordinary thing

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:29.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
to be able to see
these animals like this

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.851
and to be in their presence.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.253
The first time I did
it, my heart was racing

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.155
through my chest but over time,

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start size:84% position:16%
you never fully
let your guard down

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.593
but I think you relax
at least a little bit

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.361
to some extent.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:45.330
Part of the approach
that I took this time

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.866
when I was out there
for this latest story

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.835 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the magazine was, to
try to show these animals,

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.805
a little bit like their
terrestrial namesake,

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
to try to make pictures that
looked a little bit like

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:58.644 align:start size:88% position:13%
a tiger on land maybe
sneaking its way through

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.646 align:start size:84% position:16%
the grasses of
India or something,

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:03.682
channeling my inner
Steve Winter here.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:07.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
But the difference was
off course I wasn't

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.654
on the back of an elephant.

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:12.392
So you have be eye to
eye with these guys.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.727
And that's what some
people like to do,

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.062
you like to just have
a little conversation

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
with tiger sharks,
just "how was your day?",

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.168 align:start size:97% position:3%
kinda have a little chat
here like this diver's doing.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:26.973
Actually this is showing
the fact that ecotourism

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.807 align:start size:84% position:16%
has really prospered
in this place,

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:31.444 align:start size:88% position:13%
ever since the discovery
of Tiger Beach,

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
a number of companies
have sprung up.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.882
Ecotourism dive companies
that will get you out there

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.318 align:start size:88% position:13%
and get you in the
company of tiger sharks,

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.519
like we see right here.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.988
Sometimes it can
get a little dicey,

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.623 align:start size:97% position:3%
especially when you get
multiple sharks coming around

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.292
but, in my experiences out there

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.093
in the weeks that I've
spent out in Tiger Beach,

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:50.529 align:start size:97% position:3%
I have to say that they
were all very well behaved,

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.765 align:start size:84% position:16%
generally well behaved
for the most part.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.301
Occasionally, they'll
try to eat my camera,

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.137
like this one did
right here but,

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.773 align:start size:94% position:6%
once they realize that
it's not especially tasty,

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.675
they sort of just move on.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:06.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
And during my time out
there on these recent trips,

00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:08.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
I also wanted to move
away from those shallow,

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
sandy places,
Tiger Beach proper.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
And try to photograph
tiger sharks

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:14.720
out in the deeper reefs.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.121
Because they hang out there too.

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.890
Lots of tigers in the Bahamas

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.559
and I wanted to see if I
could get the lord of reef

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.262
sort of patrolling
over these sponges

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.164
and corals that we see here.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
Or to look at the behaviors
of multiple animals.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.570 align:start size:97% position:3%
We do see a lot of different
sharks here and there

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.875
there definitely seems to
be sort of some hierarchy,

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.343
some social behavior.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.811 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's not fully understood,
I mean to some degree,

00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:41.313
it's usually the big shark wins,

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:43.282
the other one usually
goes the other way but,

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.884 align:start size:81% position:19%
there is something
going on there

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.986
that I think we'll
figure out in time.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.155
And we see this a lot too.

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.857
Sharks with hooks
in their mouth.

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:55.027
And it's not relegated
only to tiger sharks,

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
pretty much everywhere
I go in the world,

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.265
you see evidence of
fishing pressure.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.567 align:start size:84% position:16%
This tiger had two
big hooks in its mouth

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.203
but we see jewelry
as it's often called

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.171 align:start size:81% position:19%
on many sharks all
over the world.

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:09.142
It's a very troubling trend

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
that seems to be
happening everywhere.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.779 align:start size:97% position:3%
And thanks to a grant from the
National Geographic Society

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.281
on these latest projects,

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.217
we were also able to fund
some research out there.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is, on the
right of the frame,

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:23.690
this is Dr. Neil Hammerschlag
from the University of Miami

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.791 align:start size:94% position:6%
who's been studying tiger
sharks in this region

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:28.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
for some time and one
of the ways he does this

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.463
is he built this special
platform that can submerge

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.032
just below the back of our boat,

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
you tie it up to the
back of the boat,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.303
and then he brings
a Tiger shark in

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.971 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm not sure his
insurance company

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.172
is seeing these pictures

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.875 align:start size:84% position:16%
but nonetheless,
what could go wrong.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he brings it in and
then they work up the shark,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.681
they do some science here.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.918 align:start size:94% position:6%
But the standard
procedure has always been

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:55.787
to measure the shark,
take a DNA clipping,

00:05:55.787 --> 00:05:58.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
maybe a fin clipping
for DNA sample,

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.060
they tag the shark usually,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.728
sometimes that's
done surgically,

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.330
they implant a body cavity tag

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
so they can track
the animal over time.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:10.402 align:start size:97% position:3%
But some of the newest
research is ultrasound work

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.238
that's going on right here
and that's what this woman

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.206
researcher is doing in the
center of the frame here

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.440
with the goggles.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.776
Because Tiger Beach,
it's been discovered,

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.645
seems to be a maternity ward.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
Most of the sharks there
are females and many of them

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:24.550
are pregnant and that
shallow warm water

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.485
seems to promote gestation.

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:30.322 align:start size:97% position:3%
So they're doing these
sonograms that they can keep

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.760
a videograph of and they can
see how many pups are inside

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.163 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then the tagging data will
show where the animal goes,

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.965
they don't actually have
their pups in the Bahamas,

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.900 align:start size:97% position:3%
they're going up into Northern
Florida, Georgia water,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.336
so in terms of conservation,

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.238 align:start size:84% position:16%
this would be a very
critical habitat,

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
we might want to
protect in the future.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.541 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we also did
some crittercam work.

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:50.910
I think most of you might know

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
about National
Geographic's crittercam

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:56.615
where they attach cameras and
various scientific instruments

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.651
to animals and let
them sort of carry it

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.152
and then it pops off.

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.488 align:start size:94% position:6%
This was the first time
that one had been attached

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.956
and deployed underwater.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.626 align:start size:97% position:3%
So this is Neil Hammerschlag
after he just put that

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.794 size:88% position:44%
fin clamp on the
tiger shark here

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:10.629 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he's sort of checking
it, making sure it's alright.

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.366
And then off it goes for
the better part of the day

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:17.069
recording both video and
all kinds of other data.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.571
And here we can see the shark

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.406
sort of swimming around
a little shark cameraman.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:24.476
Here just another example of
an animal taking our jobs.

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:28.080
But in any case, what this data,

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.683 align:start position:0%
I mean they only did it a little
bit while we were out there

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:33.385
but it did yield some
interesting things.

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.454 align:start size:97% position:3%
Most of the ecotourism
operators that are out there

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.556
felt that they knew exactly
what these sharks were doing.

00:07:37.556 --> 00:07:39.392
They go in from one
operator to the next,

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.393
and just staying on
that shallow area.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:44.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
But the crittercam
showed that in between

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.732
some of those visits, they're
making these very deep dives.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.834
We don't quite know exactly
what's happening down there

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:51.036
but clearly there's
a lot more going on

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
in these animal's
lives than we realize.

00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:55.107
So here's a little video
that I wanted to share

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.742
behind the scenes,
just a short video.

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.647
(soft music)

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:25.237
just give you a sense of what
it's like to be down there

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:26.472
with those giant animals

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it can be a little
unnerving at times

00:08:28.907 --> 00:08:31.277
but as I said it's
all been pretty good.

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:33.912
So this, for that same
story on Tiger sharks,

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:35.781
I also worked in South Africa.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:38.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is a photo my assistant
made of me on assignment

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.353
here with a tiger shark
up in the water column

00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:44.890
and this site is a new site
that was sort of discovered

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.992 align:start size:84% position:16%
by a researcher named
Dr. Ryan Daly,

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:49.561
it's up near the
Mozambique border.

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:52.164 align:start size:97% position:3%
And what Ryan Daly found is
that there's a deep water reef

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
there that tiger sharks
seem to frequent,

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:58.203
but if we dive in the shallow
waters just below the surface,

00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:01.440
Tigers will often rise up
and sort of check us out

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.343 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he's just beginning his
research out there to find out

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:05.978 align:start size:94% position:6%
what these animals are
doing, where they're going

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:06.912
and so forth.

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:08.113
But he invited me to come out

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:09.581 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it was a chance
for me to make pictures

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
in a sort of
different environment,

00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:12.217
instead of being on the bottom.

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:15.388 align:start size:88% position:13%
But these are
completely wild sharks,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.857 align:start position:0%
they're not acclimated or
habituated to humans whatsoever.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
Very very wild and
you're definitely
part of the food chain

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.895
when you're out there.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.197
And unlike Tiger Beach, you
can't stand on the bottom,

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.632 align:start size:84% position:16%
you don't have that
sort of safety blanket

00:09:27.632 --> 00:09:29.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
of being able to
stand on the bottom.

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.770
So you're really
kind of out there.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.305 align:start size:88% position:13%
But I have another
little video that shows

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:34.406
what we were doing out here.

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:35.908
I was living at a coastal jungle

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.676 align:start size:84% position:16%
and going out everyday
in an inflatable

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:38.644
so this is about a
two minute video.

00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:35.360
So lots more work to
do in South Africa.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.097 align:start size:97% position:3%
So these are just a few frames
that I made of those sharks

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.565
and again they have sort of
a different look up in the

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.801
blue water there,
big beefy sharks.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:45.971
A little bit unnerving when
they come real close to you

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
but you know it's stunning
seeing this was one

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.676
that was just covered in
remoras adorned in remoras,

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:54.013 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it was actually a silver
tip shark in the bottom

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.347
right of the frame.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.581
There were many other
species out there,

00:11:56.581 --> 00:11:58.049
dusky sharks and bull sharks,

00:11:58.049 --> 00:11:59.851
but it was the tigers off course

00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:03.589
that I was interested in
but one sort of turning it.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.291 size:84% position:42%
It's one of those things
where you're in the water

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.693
out there you wanna
get close to them

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:09.995 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then all of a sudden
one turns and starts

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.463
coming at you.

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:14.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're not so sure you wanna
be close to em anymore.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's really that
interesting dance that we do

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.905
in the water out
there well anyway,

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.108 align:start size:94% position:6%
the next shark that I
wanted to share with you,

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:23.275
one of the four,

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
is the Shortfin
Mako, the Mako shark.

00:12:25.443 --> 00:12:28.346
And I have to say being in
the water with all sharks

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:31.750
is pretty extraordinary and
I love looking at all animals

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
but, there is truly
something very special

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:37.322
about being in the
water with a Mako.

00:12:37.322 --> 00:12:39.424
I've always found these animals,

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:41.593
they tend to be coastal animals

00:12:41.593 --> 00:12:43.996
but not really close, you
don't see them swimming

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:45.164
over the bottom.

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:46.531 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have to go several
miles off shore

00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:49.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
and try to attract them,
difficult to attract.

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:51.336 align:start size:94% position:6%
But when you do see em
you know they just come in

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.906
all jacked up just sort
of powering their way

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.141
through the water,
just full of muscle.

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:58.210 align:start size:94% position:6%
And this was one that I
photographed in San Diego,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.112
I worked in a few places,
San Diego, New Zealand

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.881
and Rhode Island, for Makos.

00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:05.183
But this was one in
beautiful blue water

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:07.786
off the San Diego bite
when the sun was shining

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:10.855 align:start size:81% position:19%
on a beautiful
September day but,

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:13.758
these are very scary animals.

00:13:13.758 --> 00:13:15.293
This is probably the last thing

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:17.029
that a yellow fin tuna sees

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.398
before it's lights out.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.066
They are ambush predators.

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:24.336
Makos attack from below,
they have that big eye

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:28.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
that allows them to see very
well in deep dark waters

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.374
and to be able to look up

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:30.942
and see those patterns.

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:33.344
And then when they see a
prey fish they come up and,

00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:36.782
they'll often bite the
tail off of their prey,

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:40.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
whether it's Tuna or Marlin
or something like that

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:42.021
and then wait for it to
bleed out a little bit,

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.656 align:start size:94% position:6%
circle around and then
come in and finish it off.

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.225
And those are the things
that are always foremost

00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:49.461
in my mind when I'm
swimming with a Mako

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:51.329
and it's nipping at my fins.

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:53.231
I've actually switched my fins.

00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.100
I used to have these split
fins that looked a little bit

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.535
like a fish and so now
I've gone with something

00:13:57.535 --> 00:13:59.838
that like two big two
by fours on my feet,

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:02.741
something that looks
very un-fish like.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:07.212
But yeah everything about
this animal says predator.

00:14:07.212 --> 00:14:11.283
It's really built like
a torpedo with teeth.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:14.520
Just pure muscle and
all about feeding.

00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:19.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now I also wanted to share
sort of a little inside

00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:22.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
baseball story
about shark diving.

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:25.597
A lot of shark operators
over the last few years

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:29.101
have taken to using
music on their boat

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:30.936 align:start size:94% position:6%
to try to attract certain
species of sharks.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.604
There's places where they
do that with Great Whites

00:14:32.604 --> 00:14:35.373
in Australia, other places
for Blue sharks and so forth.

00:14:35.373 --> 00:14:37.643
But Makos are very elusive.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.545
I've been trying to dive
with Makos for decades

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:41.947
and had very little success.

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.748 align:start size:81% position:19%
On this story I
had some luck but,

00:14:43.748 --> 00:14:46.351
they are very hard to get
to come close to the boat

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:48.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
and a lot of times,
when they do come close,

00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:50.288
they're just in for a
few seconds or a minute

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:52.658
and then they're gone.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:56.461
So I've had my best luck
by trying the music thing.

00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:58.897
I actually went out
there and tried music

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:01.766
but what I've learned
was that the only music

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:03.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
that actually works
for Makos 

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.470 align:start size:84% position:16%
is AC DC.

00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:07.439
These are just badass sharks.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:10.141
I mean that's just
all there is to it.

00:15:10.141 --> 00:15:11.843
And I'm not kidding,
we've been out there,

00:15:11.843 --> 00:15:13.879
I've been out in San Diego
and New Zealand for days

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.614
where nothing was happening

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.849 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I look at my assistant
and say you know,

00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:19.451
time for a little AC DC.

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:22.220
And not every time,
but a lot of times,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.089
you'll see a Mako come and so,

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.057 align:start size:88% position:13%
this was one in New
Zealand which is sort of

00:15:26.057 --> 00:15:28.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
Mako central or as they
call em there Mako.

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.428
Mako central, there's
a lot of em around

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:32.731
and there were days where
we had maybe a dozen or so

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.932
around us in the water.

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
It gets a little too
crazy when that happens.

00:15:36.067 --> 00:15:38.736
But even the little ones, this
is another one in San Diego.

00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:41.373
Even the little ones
come in with attitude.

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:43.942
They're like, they come in
hot and they're all fierce

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:47.146 align:start size:84% position:16%
and bitty, Makos will
just bite things.

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.447
They obviously don't have
hands and they're just

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:52.651 align:start position:0%
all jacked up, it's like
they're on cocaine or something.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:53.919
Not that I would know.

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:56.087
But, people have told me.

00:15:56.087 --> 00:16:00.291 align:start size:84% position:16%
But you know, that
one had these copepods

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.361
on its dorsal fin and
this is another one,

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
a bigger animal that
was swimming down

00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:06.198
in that beautiful blue
water off California

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.767 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they often get
those parasites on their

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:12.470 align:start size:84% position:16%
dorsal looks like
little streamers kinda
hanging off there.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.774
But this diving like the tigers,

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:17.309
I always do without cages.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.878 align:start size:97% position:3%
It would just be impractical
to try to get photographs

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.880
because the animals
are so unpredictable,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.348 align:start size:84% position:16%
they don't stick
around for very long

00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:25.317 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they would almost never
come over to a cage so,

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.719 align:start size:94% position:6%
you have to sort of be
out there in the open and,

00:16:27.719 --> 00:16:29.354
most times I'm diving alone,

00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:31.022
because I don't want
even one other person

00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:33.091 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the water that
might spook the shark.

00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:35.527
But sometimes I'll
have an assistant in

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
and sometimes he'll carry
just a little stick,

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.731
as sort of deterrent
if the animal gets

00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:42.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
a little too aggressive which
has happened a few times

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
but for the most part,
they don't do that,

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:47.606 align:start size:97% position:3%
they will come in and
check you out a little bit.

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:51.210
But these are animals
that are endothermic.

00:16:52.577 --> 00:16:54.613 align:start size:97% position:3%
Meaning that they can
generate heat in their body.

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.849 align:start position:0%
It was Brooke Runnette
actually at National Geographic

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.950 align:start size:81% position:19%
who termed the
phrase hot sharks.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
These are hot sharks because
they can generate heat

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.222 align:start size:94% position:6%
in their body and because
of that they can swim

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:06.557
into colder water and feed
on oilier fish and so forth.

00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:09.428
But the Mako is also one
of the fastest animals

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:10.829
in the ocean.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.832 align:start position:0%
A mako shark can swim at
bursts of over 45 miles an hour

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:16.034
under water, in fast bursts.

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
And you gotta remember,
that underwater,

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.604
the medium is much
thicker than in here

00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:21.140
so that's probably like swimming

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.573 align:start size:81% position:19%
a 100 miles an
hour or something.

00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:25.410
But extraordinary animals and,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.514
in San Diego I wanted
to try to hang out

00:17:29.514 --> 00:17:30.949
near Kelp Patties.

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:34.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
In the Kelp forest of
California, Kelp, Giant Kelp

00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:37.522
will often break off and mat
up and drift along the coast

00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:39.224
and its own little
ecosystem forms.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.226
We get little fish
and then bigger fish

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.529 align:start size:84% position:16%
and sometimes you
get Dorado, Mahi Mahi

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.996
and fish like that.

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:47.232 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I spent weeks out there
trying to get a picture

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
of a Mako near one and
that's where we see hunting.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.401
Didn't actually get em predating

00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:52.236
but I don't think
anything like this

00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:53.838
had ever been made before so,

00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:55.841
that was a kind of a
cool thing as well.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:59.644
But these are the moments
I dreamed about right here,

00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:02.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
when a big ol'
mako shark comes in

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.883
and bites the crap
out of my domeport.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:06.051
That's heaven.

00:18:07.485 --> 00:18:10.255
But you know I honestly try
to resist the temptation

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.457 align:start size:81% position:19%
of making scary
pictures of sharks

00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:14.492 align:start size:97% position:3%
because I really don't want
to perpetuate that myth

00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:17.028 align:start size:97% position:3%
and enough damage has been
done to sharks over the years.

00:18:17.028 --> 00:18:20.531
But by the same token I don't
wanna sort of portray them

00:18:20.531 --> 00:18:22.033
as something that they're not.

00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:24.002 align:start position:0%
I don't wanna show them as house
pets or give the impression

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:27.372
that they're cuddly and we
can go out and hug a shark

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.206
because they're not.

00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:29.440
They're real predators.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.410
So I think we have to
walk that fine line

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.882 align:start size:97% position:3%
and show them for what they
are but not over demonize them

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.350
for sure.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.587 align:start size:97% position:3%
And with the same story I
also wanted to spend some time

00:18:42.587 --> 00:18:44.089
looking at shark tournaments.

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
Because there's still a
lot of this thing going on

00:18:47.592 --> 00:18:50.895
where there will be these
monster shark tournaments

00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:52.064
held in various places.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.565 align:start size:84% position:16%
So this summer I
spent a couple of days

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:56.868
in Montauk New York where
they hold these tournaments

00:18:56.868 --> 00:18:59.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
for a couple of days and
they give prize money

00:18:59.303 --> 00:19:02.440
for the biggest shark killed.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.177
And often times it's
a mako or thresher.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:08.447
But you know, I think
that the time has past

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:09.982 align:start size:88% position:13%
for this kind of thing,
when you consider

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.317 align:start size:97% position:3%
that a 100 million sharks
are being killed every year,

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.286
I don't really think
there is a benefit

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.856
to sort of glamorizing
killing these animals.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.625 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the two days that
I was in Montauk,

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.694
I saw six sharks come in,

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:26.364 align:start size:97% position:3%
no I'm sorry 12, it was
six makos and six threshers

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:28.600
and every single one
of them was a juvenile.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.535
Every single one of them wasn't
even old enough to reproduce

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:34.839
and, I watched them drag
these things up on the dock

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:36.107
and sort of cut em up.

00:19:36.107 --> 00:19:37.509
And I saw all these
children, these kids

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.978 align:start size:84% position:16%
that were fascinated
with sharks.

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.881
But, I think it's
sort of unfortunate

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
that this is their
first seeing of a shark,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.619
looking like a slayed
dragon just laid there

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.889
and that the fishermen
were some sort of heroes

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.090
for doing this.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I have no problem
with fishing but,

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.428 align:start position:0%
I just think the time has passed
for this sort of treatment

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.696
of sharks.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.865
And I recognize that not
everyone will get to see

00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:03.068
a shark underwater,
probably the way

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:04.735
that they should be seen,

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:07.572
this amazingly majestic animal.

00:20:07.572 --> 00:20:10.609
We can appreciate lions and
grizzly bears and tigers

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.010
and so forth.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.277 align:start size:97% position:3%
But underwater these
animals are just slaughtered

00:20:13.277 --> 00:20:15.113
and often with little regard so.

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:17.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
My hope is that photography
can sort of move

00:20:17.982 --> 00:20:21.419
that forward a little bit in
terms of some appreciation.

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:23.087
And one of the other
things I wanted to do

00:20:23.087 --> 00:20:26.591
with this story,
with video actually

00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:28.760
was to show the speed of a Mako

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.428
attacking something.

00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:33.464
So with the grant from
the Geographic Society,

00:20:33.464 --> 00:20:35.733
I designed with my assistant

00:20:35.733 --> 00:20:37.369 align:start size:94% position:6%
at Woods Hole
Oceanographic, we designed

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:40.538 align:start size:94% position:6%
a tow camera system, I
found an industrial camera

00:20:40.538 --> 00:20:42.340
that shot at very high speed.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
I could shoot at
720 frames a second.

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.711 align:start size:84% position:16%
We built this tow
camera, and I worked

00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:49.181 align:start size:94% position:6%
with a New Zealand's
champion sports fisherman

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
who fished for marlin
and he would rig

00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:53.818
a mullet bait, type
of fish called mullet

00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:55.253
and trail it behind
the boat for marlin

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:57.455
but he said often times
Makos would attack it.

00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.689
So I was there for
a couple of weeks

00:20:58.689 --> 00:21:00.592
but I only got one day
where I could do it.

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I've got a two minute
video with no sound

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.897 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I'll just have a look
at that and show you,

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.966
this is the first time
this has ever been seen

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:12.137 align:start size:97% position:3%
of a Mako in high speed
attacking something, a mullet.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:23.414
Everything that you're
gonna see here happened

00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:25.216
in about four seconds.

00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:28.420
But we're shooting so fast
that we can play it back

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.022
at normal speed and
it's slow motion.

00:21:31.022 --> 00:21:32.891 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it was fascinating
to see this animal

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.759
after he latched on,

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:37.562
he sort of put his
pectoral fins back

00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:40.464 align:start position:0%
in a very hydrodynamic way
almost trying to use his weight

00:21:40.464 --> 00:21:42.567
and the speed to break it off.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.335
The boat was travelling
at about eight knots.

00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:47.438
And he had no trouble
off course firing up

00:21:47.438 --> 00:21:50.141
and going in and
grabbing that bait.

00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:51.810
But it was interesting
to see that behavior,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.212
I think researchers, I haven't
showed this to scientists yet

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:55.813
but I think they'll
be interested to see

00:21:55.813 --> 00:21:58.049
this form that the Mako assumes

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:00.652
once he's bitten into the prey.

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:07.826 align:start size:88% position:13%
Just a truly remarkable
predator for sure.

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.167
Going for a ride.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:22.106 align:start size:97% position:3%
They can sort of detach
their jaws like a Great White

00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:23.641
as well.

00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:25.043
I hadn't realized that but
you can see it coming out.

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:27.212 align:start size:94% position:6%
So pretty amazing
behavior from Mako sharks

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.547
shot at 720 frames
per second well,
