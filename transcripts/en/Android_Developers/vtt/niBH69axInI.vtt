00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.140
Hello.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.110
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to "This Week in

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.710
Android Development" on Monday,
October 7, 2013.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.270
An unfortunate incident
involving a mirror universe

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.030
prevented the broadcast of
"This Week in Android

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.630
Development" for the
last two weeks.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.640
But thankfully, my goatee-clad
evil twin is just as

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.480
passionate about making data
transfers more efficient,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.810
delivering the final two
episodes in the series,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.870
covering variable update
frequencies

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.740
and minimizing payloads.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.360
Undisturbed by the implications
of the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.970
intersection of multiple planes
of existence, Trevor

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.480
Jones also delivered a DevByte
on Network Service Discovery,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.540
while intern Daniel delivered
his final DevByte describing

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.960
how to expand cells
within list views.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.790
With alternative worlds already
colliding, Todd

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.360
Kopelman continues to offer
advice for mobile developers

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
with a slightly different
focus with his series of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.360
DevBytes covering Google Play
Game Services for iOS, with

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.380
episodes on using sign-in
buttons and introducing REST.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.080
Meanwhile, in New York and
London, Nick, Roman, and Adam

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.700
covered the onboarding
experience and collection

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.750
design in two all new episodes
of "Android Design in Action."

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.560
Back here in sunny Mountain
View, Todd and the Wolff Man

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.930
were back in action in "Game
On!" introducing management

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.510
tools and graphs.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.000
We also launched "Admin Tool and
Utilities for Google Play

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.310
Game Services." And for those of
you that prefer a good book

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.710
over watching TV, check out
this new guide to managing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.450
device awake state.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.510
In ecosystem news, we saw the
proportion of Android devices

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.830
running Jelly Bean nearly
hitting 50%.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.490
Coming up this week, Todd
continues his series helping

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.540
iOS developers get up to speed
on Play Game Services.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.040
And Bruno and Neto present a
very special edition of "Game

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.180
On!" in Portuguese.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.980
That's all for "This Week in
Android Development." Be sure

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.280
to check out this
week's Bytes.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.700
I'm Reto Meier, and I'll
leave you with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.160
these parting questions.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.300
You want to live fancy?

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.550
Live in a big mansion?

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.800
Party in France?
