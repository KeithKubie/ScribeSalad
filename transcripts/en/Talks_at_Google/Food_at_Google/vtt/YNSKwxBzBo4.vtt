ANDREW: All right.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.320
Good afternoon, everybody.

And I'm the cafe manager
here at the KitchenSync Cafe.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.550

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.450

as well as in San Francisco,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.090
She's a two-time author.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180
Her brand new book
is on shelves right

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.050
now, "A Girl and Her Greens."

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.930
She's the James Beard

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270

Chef" and "Iron Chef America."

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.895
Please, everybody join me
in welcoming Chef April

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:51.395
Bloomfield.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:52.698
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.165
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Hi, guys.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:56.121
Welcome, welcome.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.460
I appreciate you
taking your lunch break

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.190
to come watch me cook.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.080
And I just wanted to
quickly say thank you

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.099
to the team, Google
team over here,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.880
doing your-- we
have tasters today.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.165
So thank you guys for helping
organize everything today.

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:11.515
So a big hand for them.

00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:12.015
OK.

00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:14.540
So as you know, I've come
out with a brand new book.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.200
It's called "A Girl
and Her Greens."

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.050
I basically wanted to show
a different side of myself

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.710
from my last book.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.690
I want to show you my
love of vegetables.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.750
I love vegetables.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.580
I grew up eating them
when I was a little girl.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.120
I was eating peas, carrots,
things like parsnips,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.870
lots of potatoes, broccoli.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.940
I loved everything
about broccoli.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.990
All those kind of
Brassicas I really enjoy.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.964
And I wanted to show this
off in my book, "A Girl

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:41.630
and Her Greens."

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.080
So I'm going to make you
two recipes from the book.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.250
I've got one that I'm
about to show you.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.489
It's basically a smashed pea.

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.030
It's the best thing
you're ever going

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.212
to eat in your whole life.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:52.920
But then you're going
to eat the carrots.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190
And they're pretty good, too.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.430
So basically, just
a thing about peas

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.310
when you go buy
them at the market,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.000
try and find peas that are not
overstuffed in their shell.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180
So I'm going to pass
you a couple around.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.930
You can feel these
ones, the bigger ones

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.900
are bursting their
edges a little bit.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.460
So I'm just going
to open them up.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.190
And you can see how
they get square.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.640
Once they start to get square,
they get really starchy.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.790
So you're looking for peas that
don't have as much-- I don't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.310
know if you guys can see that.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.390
They don't have as
much pea to them.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.430
See how these ones are
all shoved in there.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.530
They get a bit starchy.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.260
These are going to
be nice and sweet.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.920
So I'm going to pass them
around so you can just

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.628
have a long look.

00:02:33.628 --> 00:02:34.400
Do you want to--

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.616
ANDREW: Sure.

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:36.990
APRIL BLOOMFIELD:
So try and find

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.365
peas that are just a good size.

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:42.270
And this is basically
an uncooked mushy pea.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.440
Everybody know what
a mushy pea is?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.960
Anybody been to England?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.460
Yeah.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.730
Have you had fish and
chips with mushy peas?

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.790
They're basically
like long-cooked peas

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.085
that are stewed for--
I don't know, well,

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:55.577
it depends who's cooking them.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:56.410
Could be really bad.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.035
But they're really
stewed from anywhere

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.850
for like an hour to 25 minutes.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.930
So in here, I've got some peas.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.530
It's not many.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.850
It's probably like a pound.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.170
A little bit of mint
and some garlic.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.380
We're basically making a pesto.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.960
OK.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.420
And a pesto just means paste.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.300
So I'm going to add some salt.
This will help flavor the peas.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.520
They'll bring out
some sweetness.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.900
I've got some
garlic, mint, salt.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.935
And I'm just going to
give it a little whiz.

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:25.060
And you can do it on Pulse.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.746
And you can either do this
really, really smooth.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:29.120
Or you can do it
a little mixture

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.510
of both smooth and chunky.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.120
It just depends on
personal preference.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.149
I'm going to make
mine nice and smooth.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.690
Just give it a little
whiz like this.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.950
Can you smell that mint?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.450
I can smell that mint already.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.585
Smells really springy.

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:49.390
This is the best thing after
being kind of holed up-- well,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.980
maybe not in
California-- holed up

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.720
in the winter in New York City,
and there's not a green thing

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.340
around.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.270
Having these poke up
through the ground

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.650
and seeing them at the
market, I don't know.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.360
I get really excited
about that kind of stuff.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.150
So the first thing in spring,
this is the best thing to make.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.570
In here, I just
put some Pecorino.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.935
It's a little aged Pecorino.

00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:14.020
So it has a little
complexity to it.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.970
And so it's a little bit funky.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.300
So it really just adds
something to the pea.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.430
It really just elevates
the whole mush.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.139
It looks good.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.180
I think I'm going to go
with some olive oil, too.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.160
Can you guys see this?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.020
There we are.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.711
Can you guys see this?

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:32.210
Yeah.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.900
OK, good.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.330
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.830
Very nice.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.705
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: OK.

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.403
So then actually, you
could put the olive oil in,

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:41.100
Or you could just use the bowl.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.617
But I'm just going to use the
bowl now that I got it off.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.200
I might not be able
to get it back on,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.825
so-- They're a bit
temperamental, things things.

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:51.950
You could do this in a
pestle and mortar, actually.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.050
It's quite fun.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.970
Anybody got a pestle
and mortar at home?

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.470
Yeah?

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.390
Just do them in small batches
so your peas don't just

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.211
fly all over the place and
you're trying to catch them.

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.600
A little bit of olive oil.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.310
That's a lot of olive oil.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.740
It's still healthier
than butter.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.800
I mean, come on.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.320
So just give that
a really good mix.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.490
And it'll just go a
little wee bit creamy.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.280
And then now you've
got all that fat.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.110
You've got a little bit
of the cheese in there.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.500
It's not too much.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.974
It's not overpowering
the peas at all.

00:05:26.974 --> 00:05:28.890
You've got some of the
olive oil, again, which

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.300
is slightly more fatty.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.840
You've got that sweet peas.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.120
So everything's going to
be quite heavy right now.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.860
So the way we balance
that out is just

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.050
a little bit of olive oil.

00:05:41.654 --> 00:05:43.320
So we're just going
to add a little bit.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.695
And we're just
going to taste it.

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:48.740
AUDIENCE: Are you
separately seasoning?

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.150
Or are you just using the
salt and the Pecorino?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.460
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: No, I
added a little bit of salt

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.760
in with my bowl.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.490
Somebody wasn't
paying attention.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:04.130
I was only-- [LAUGHING]
I'm just kidding.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.921
Too many nights at Tosca,
that's what it is, yeah.

00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:09.171
AUDIENCE: By the bar upstairs?

00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.171
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Right.

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.052
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:12.260
So I'm going to give a taste.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.930
It's always good to taste.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.830
So let's just-- it's good.

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.190
It's got some mint in there.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.390
So it's not too much.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.260
It's not overtaking the pea.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.540
It's got a little lemon.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.520
And so it's really
bright at the beginning.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520
But then you get this nice
salty, earthy, clean pea

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.630
flavor.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.527
And you can see how
creamy it's gone.

00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:39.360
And it's spreadable.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.330
It's a nice paste.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.700
So my next job is to do some
bruschetta, which is basically

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.890
just a tasted bread,
usually rubbed

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.990
with a little bit of
garlic and then finished

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.360
with some salt and
some olive oil.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.780
This is a nice San
Francisco sourdough.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.920
You guys make the best
bread, San Francisco.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.700
So you're very lucky.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.245
So just give it a good old cut.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.310
Get a nice little piece
for yourself like this.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.990
And then you can just
pop it on the grill.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.210
And actually, you can
take this quite far.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.340
I kind of like that
bitterness that you

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.020
get from a little bit
of the charred bread.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.370
I think it complements
the sweetness from the pea

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.130
really well.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.380
For breakfast, if I'm doing
a bit of toast and jam,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.350
I like to get a bit
more burnt edges on it.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.060
Because it compliments
that sweetness, too.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.840
But lots of butter, of course.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.270
You've got to have your butter.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.990
So just keep that on there until
it gets all nice and toasty.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.570
And you want to take
it quite crunchy.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.590
If you don't, it's just going
to kind of "bloop," drip off.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.600
And then it's going
to be in your lap.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.590
And everybody's going to
think you're a lazy eater

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.000
and you have no manners.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.880
So yeah, just kind
of toast that.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.555
Let it sit.

00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:02.350
Sometimes it's good to let
things just chill for a second.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.390
Not 20 minutes, but
just-- and then we'll

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.580
have another little taste.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.330
So you taste at the beginning,
middle, and the end.

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:15.315
Did you guys all see those peas?

00:08:15.315 --> 00:08:16.830
Did anybody get to taste?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.980
Did you taste one?

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.790
You should taste them, too.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.880
Sometimes they come with
their shells a little bit

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.440
more rough-looking.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.570
Some are nice and green.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.370
It doesn't mean that the peas
are any worse inside if they're

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.000
a little bit brown, like this.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.650
And taste.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.960
When you go to the market-- San
Francisco's amazing for this--

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.369
but always make sure
you taste stuff.

00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:42.789
And ask.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.590
Sometimes you get told off
if you just help yourself.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.850
I've been told off many times.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.490
Terrible.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.740
But always taste.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.080
Always ask to taste.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.800
San Francisco's really amazing.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.610
Because they actually
cut stuff for you.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.610
They kind of put it out.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.630
You get your little
toothpick and taste.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.480
So that's kind of fun.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.500
And give things a little smell.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.109
Touch things.

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:07.900
Have a little look.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.800
See where they're at.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.216
Because that's the
only way you're

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:14.040
going to get more experienced
on picking your vegetables.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.040
It's just like
buying a bit of fish.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.390
When you go to a fish market,
you want clear eyes, red gills.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.360
You want it to
look nice and firm.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.640
A little bit of slime around
the fish is important.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.690
It usually means that
it's freshly caught,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.030
it hasn't been out of
the water very long.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.320
And if it's
flat-looking, tired--

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.852
it's basically like picking a
handsome man, really, you know.

00:09:36.852 --> 00:09:40.970
It's got to look
pretty sexy, right?

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.290
Or a woman.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.660
Anyway, so this toast
is pretty much done.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.870
You see how I got these nice
dark, charred bits on there?

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.470
That's really going to
just elevate this dish.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.505
Oh, I need a plate to plate.

00:09:57.505 --> 00:09:58.004
Thank you.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.210
Give it a nice rub of garlic.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.520
Even though there's a little
bit of garlic in here,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.150
it's nice to just
layer those flavors.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.810
Thank you.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.710
Oh, and a bit of
arugula, please, too.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.490
Thank you.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.580
So it's nice to
layer those flavors.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.470
So this is quite
bulky and thick.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.880
So I'm just going to give it
a little bit more salt. Again,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.430
getting all those flavors
layered in is really important.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.110
And then I'm going to do
a really good, big lashing

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.480
of olive oil on the bread.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.960
Because again, it's quite bulky.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.725
You don't want this
dry piece of bread.

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:39.102
Thank you.

00:10:39.102 --> 00:10:40.060
AUDIENCE: There's that.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.060
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Great.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.030
Thanks.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:47.140
And then you just get a good,
healthy scoop of the pea.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.680
Pop it on the plate like this.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.816
And then just start
at the round end.

00:10:51.816 --> 00:10:52.690
I'm going to go more.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.930
Because I like peas.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.570
And just give it a good
old smash down on there.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.780
If some falls on the
plate, it's kind of cool.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.390
It looks like a little bit
of a garnish, doesn't it?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.580
That's our little
secret, just so you know.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.080
OK.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.500
So I'm going to
just garnish this.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.759
You can go extra mint.

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.550
You know what would be
really great on here

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.320
is some pea shoots,
little pea flowers.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.940
I'm using the arugula.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.920
It should be nice and spicy.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.450
If you're using
pea shoots, they're

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.370
normally quite nice and sweet.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.990
And just lightly
drizzle some olive oil.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.510
I did salt. Yes, did
a little bit of salt

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.150
and a little bit of
olive oil on top.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.480
And when you dress your
salads, if they're delicate,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.180
don't go in there like, "pff,"
like a bull in a China shop.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.220
You want to just gently dress.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.860
So the way I do it is I
either use these little two

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.100
fingers as a little claw.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.680
And I just gently
toss like this.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.670
Or I use, actually, the bowl.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.030
I just gather my
fingers up like this.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.682
And I gently push the
salad against the bowl.

00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:01.640
And then I let it drop.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.920
And so I kind of
do this movement.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.710
And it's usually
good for doing salads

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.080
so you don't get bruised leaves.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.530
And just arrange
it nice and fancy.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.590
Because then everybody thinks
you're sophisticated and smart.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.390
And then just a little
bit of olive oil.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.560
That's really easy, right?

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.740
All you have to do
is pod the peas.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.549
And I made that in like,
I think, five minutes.

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:31.840
But it was probably 10 minutes.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.550
But there you go.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.790
So that's that first dish.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.240
Do you guys like that?

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that looks great.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.135
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Good.

00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:37.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:39.430
How many people would
make that at home?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.174
It's so easy, right?

00:12:41.174 --> 00:12:43.090
So if you don't want to
just have it on bread,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.930
you know what's great is
if you boil a bit of pasta,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.440
you put some cream in,
maybe a little garlic,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.460
and then just toss
this through, or a bit

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.060
of Parmesan or Pecorino.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.450
You can use the Pecorino
If you don't have Parmesan,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:54.950
by the way.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.000
I forgot to say that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.640
And then just toss some
pasta all the way through.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.670
If you don't have mint,
you can use basil.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.140
All those things that you can
substitute that go really well,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.500
feel free to use them.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.000
OK.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.740
Next dish is another
favorite of mine.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.340
It's basically roasted
carrots with burrata.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.340
Roasting is sometimes quite
scary for people, right?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.152
Who likes roasting carrots
and veggies and-- oh,

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:24.360
you're all pretty good, then.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.859
Nice.

00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:25.960
It was just me, then.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.490
Oh well.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.420
The reason why I think
people are very fearful

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.000
of cooking veggies,
or not successful,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.670
is that sometimes they
cut them too small.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.940
So by the end of it,
they're all shriveled up.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.009
And there's no
substance to them.

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:45.550
And then other times
they roast them,

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.770
and they don't have any color.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.870
Because they're too small.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.070
Because then they're
going to overcook.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.153
And they're going to burn.

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:54.600
So keeping your vegetables
a little bit more chunky

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.270
allows you to be able to
get some more sweetness

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.650
and caramelization from
the carrot, or the veg,

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.990
without overcooking.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.140
So I like to just them
very gently in a pan.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.430
Just layer them up like this.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.750
Top and tail so you
can fit a few more in.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.280
You can throw some on
the top and stir them

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.730
around again, too, if you want.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.840
And then just let them go
on a medium to high heat,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.250
depending on what kind
of veggies they are.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.740
And then get a nice
little color on them.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.130
While they're
browning like this,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.030
I'm going to start my pesto.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.850
I'm just smash-mad today.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.060
I'm going pesto crazy.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.290
So I'm going to make
another little pesto.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.480
And I'm going to
use the carrot tops.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.805
How many of you knew that
you could eat carrot tops?

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.080
I only learned that like
a couple of years ago.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.060
So you're very, very
smart for knowing that.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.560
OK.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:02.340
So carrot tops, they're
exactly what they are.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.100
They're tops of the carrots.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.400
So these are nice.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.440
They're all structured.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.570
There's no blemishes
on them at all.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.100
And you could just basically
take off the tops like this.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.915
You don't want to
go too far down.

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:17.870
Sometimes they get a little
tougher towards the end.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:25.240
And then just pick them off
like this, leaving the stalk on.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.490
This one, even this,
this is tender here.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.720
So leaving this stalk
on right there is good.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.367
And just the same kind of
process, just pop them all in.

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:39.200
Did I drop a carrot?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.350
Oops.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.420
My poor little carrots
have dropped on the floor.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.200
OK.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.630
Look how nice that one looks.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.400
Look at that.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.760
Looks like a Christmas tree.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.940
I'm going to save that
for my garnish, I think.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.810
Maybe this one, too.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.460
Just pick them all off.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.300
Pop them in.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.030
I have some more here.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.295
Well, I did earlier.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.490
So just do a nice little
handful like this.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.030
These are nice.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.660
They taste like carrots.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.020
They're a little earthy, again.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.080
So these earthy carrot tops
go nice with the walnuts.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.030
So we're just going to
throw some walnuts in there.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.220
You can use almonds.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.030
You could use pine nuts.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.844
I don't really like
to taste-- uh, toast.

00:16:37.844 --> 00:16:38.510
I love to taste.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.440
I don't like to toast.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.910
The reason why I don't
toast is because I think

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.410
it makes for a cleaner pesto.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.950
Sometimes when you
toast the nuts,

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.000
they get a little bit dirty.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.715
And they can be a
bit too overpowering.

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:57.740
So not toasting the
nuts is a nice trick

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.890
to keeping your food fresh.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.339
A little bit of salt. I
want plenty of garlic.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.290
I like quite a lot of
garlic in my pesto.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.230
Basil.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.270
If you didn't have basil,
you could use tarragon.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.310
Or chervil is really cool.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.925
Chervil's like an underrated
herb, so some of that

00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:19.550
would be great.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.750
OK.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.130
So just give it a good old whiz.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.675
Again, you can have it chunky
or as smooth as you want.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.425
Smells good.

00:17:37.425 --> 00:17:39.300
And then I'm going to
go with some olive oil.

00:17:44.132 --> 00:17:47.460
And you could do it runny.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.975
Again, this in some
pasta would be great.

00:17:53.842 --> 00:17:55.430
I'm going to get it
a little smoother.

00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:09.060
I can't get it off.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.910
Oh well.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:11.610
I need a bowl.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.910
Do you guys ever have this
trouble when you do your work?

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.620
Where you're like--
I don't know,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.240
like something's not coming.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.977
I don't know.

00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:24.060
I don't know what the
equivalent of that would be.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.930
But I would be very
fascinated to know.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.614
AUDIENCE: Your laptop.

00:18:28.614 --> 00:18:29.780
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Oh, great.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.870
Good job.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.780
The laptop what?

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.634
AUDIENCE: If your
laptop crashes.

00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:33.490
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Oh, yeah.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.130
That would be
awful, wouldn't it?

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.940
Oh my goodness.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.040
That would be-- that's
just worst than this.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.880
[LAUGHS] Oh, no.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.690
What a nightmare.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.110
Is there somebody you can call
when you're-- oh, my gosh.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.700
What a nightmare.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.332
Oh, dear.

00:18:48.332 --> 00:18:51.300
So you can see this is really,
really nice and creamy.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:00.310
And it's really just going to
brighten up your dish nicely.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.550
So again, I'm going to
give it a little taste.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:08.430
I might just let it
down-- mm, it's good--

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.160
just so I can drizzle it.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.120
And it's really not going to
affect the flavor that much.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.198
It's just merely to-- are you
guys laughing at the olive oil?

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:20.837
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
just a lot of olive oil.

00:19:20.837 --> 00:19:23.170
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Well, you
know, olive oil tastes good.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.220
I know.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.440
I go through bottles and
bottles of olive oil.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.700
But that's why if
you want to do this,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.060
you've got to buy some of
those things if you can,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.450
like just an olive oil
that you really like.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.405
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a favorite brand?

00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:42.154
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Yeah,
I actually usually

00:19:42.154 --> 00:19:44.020
buy a Chilean olive
oil that's organic.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.270
Actually, I have a really
good relationship with them.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.485
It's called Olive.

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:51.885
Actually, they just changed
their name from Olave to Olive.

00:19:51.885 --> 00:19:52.760
And it's really good.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.301
And it's actually
not that expensive.

00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:59.400
You can buy it from Whole Foods
if you guys ever shop there.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.900
It's definitely a
delicious one to buy.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.380
And we buy Tuscan olive
oils, which are great.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.760
Because they're nice
and spicy and delicious.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.920
So I'll just give
them a little season.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.980
Just check them.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.731
See if they're
getting any color.

00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:20.140
You might not want to use
your fingers like this.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.431
You might want to use
a spoon or something.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:23.930
OK.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.550
So I'm just going
to let this chill.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.560
Looks pretty good, right?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.240
Yummy.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.740
OK.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.910
So I've got some
carrots that I did.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.420
So just so you can
see, because it's

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.770
going to take a long
time for them to brown.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.710
But you can see how delicious.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.380
They got really concentrated.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.060
You guys see that?

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.030
They've got a nice
little bit of color.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.691
And they're not too greasy.

00:20:47.691 --> 00:20:50.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.904
She's all like-- she's
too busy tasting.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.020
And I've got some yellow ones.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.380
You can see the color on
these, which are really nice.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.960
So actually, I wanted
pass them around

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.141
so you can actually see
how nicely cooked they are.

00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:10.890
So if you want to just
have a little poke.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.670
You can have a nibble,
too, if you like.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.616
AUDIENCE: Is there
thyme in this?

00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:15.532
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Yeah,
a little bit of thyme.

00:21:15.532 --> 00:21:17.076
So once they brown
a little bit, I'm

00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:19.700
going to just throw them in the
oven with a little bit of thyme

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.280
and a little bit of garlic.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.698
And that'll just very gently and
delicately flavor your carrots.

00:21:25.698 --> 00:21:27.925
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:27.925 --> 00:21:29.800
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: No,
I didn't peel the skin.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.174
And that's the
best thing, right?

00:21:31.174 --> 00:21:33.100
When you get
carrots that are not

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.174
too large or beets
that are not too big,

00:21:36.174 --> 00:21:37.340
you don't have to peel them.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.320
You can just throw them in the
oven, cook them with their skin

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.930
on.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.780
Saving yourself some work
when you've been working late

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.340
is really amazing.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.180
And it's just edible, right?

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.050
Why not?

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.160
Saves you some time.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.027
It's less waste.

00:21:58.027 --> 00:21:59.360
It's better for the environment.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.660
It's going all in your tummy.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.960
And you're satisfied and happy.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.460
OK.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.740
So I'm going to
construct this salad.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.048
But I need another plate.

00:22:09.048 --> 00:22:10.359
Sorry.

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:12.400
ANDREW: So what's the
equivalent in the vegetable

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.204
world of the nose to tail, snout
to tail, however you call it.

00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:19.370
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: That would
be a funny-looking pig,

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.840
wouldn't it?

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.673
ANDREW: Wouldn't it?

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.490
Yeah.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.210
I can't even think
about it, actually.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.360
Weird.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.920
But yeah, this would be it.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.990
This, cooking nose to tail, this
would be top to bottom or top

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.510
to tail.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.040
You could do it with beets.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.197
At The Spotted Pig,
and even at Tosca,

00:22:36.197 --> 00:22:37.780
we have an amazing
dish-- you probably

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.460
know that-- with the beets
with the tarragon pesto.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.540
And we use the beet greens.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.820
And we just lightly char them on
a grill so you get everything.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.560
We use the stalks, the leaves.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.950
We even leave the nice little
tail on the end of the beets.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.560
So you get this crunchy texture.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.550
Really amazing.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.280
So yeah, this is it.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.440
Using broccoli stalks-- do
you guys eat broccoli stalks?

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.610
Yeah, just using those up,
not throwing them away,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.670
just maybe peeling the
outer part of the broccoli,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.580
because sometimes
that's the toughest.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.900
So it's basically knowing
when to use something

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.360
and when not to.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.135
If something's
tough, peel it back.

00:23:19.135 --> 00:23:21.510
Because if it's tough, then
you're not going to enjoy it.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:27.010
But if it's tender and sweet and
beautiful, feel free to use it.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.650
OK.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:32.220
So when these come out
of the oven, again,

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.080
you've just concentrated
all that sweetness.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.240
You can see the theme.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.310
The carrots are nice.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.110
They should be a little bit
salty and a little bit sweet,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.740
a little bit herbaceous
from the earthy rosemary

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.515
and a little bit of the
garlic from the roasted garlic

00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:48.300
that you put in.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:55.260
I really just tap each carrot
with just a touch of lemon.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.720
Because again, the sweetness
you've concentrated.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.800
You've got some nice color.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.660
You've got all that flavor
rocking and working.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.502
Really take your
time to do this.

00:24:09.502 --> 00:24:10.960
Because you don't
want to miss one.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.240
Because then somebody might
get the one that's not dressed.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.910
And then they're not having
the same experience as you.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:22.020
So being nice and balanced is
really important, and thinking

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.320
about the other person, too.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.430
Again, just fresh olive oil.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.520
She's still on her phone.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.460
She's going to leave.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.043
She's going to be
like, what happened?

00:24:32.043 --> 00:24:33.360
[LAUGHS]

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.200
So just give it a
little light toss

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.750
in the remaining olive oil.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.710
And just arrange it.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.375
Look how cute.

00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:44.130
Do you see these
little crispy bits?

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.520
It's no point
chopping those off.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.230
I don't like it when
you go to a place

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.604
and it doesn't look like what
it's supposed to look like.

00:24:50.604 --> 00:24:52.940
I love keeping
things very organic.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:58.840
And if it's a carrot, make
it look like a carrot instead

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.330
of making these little squares.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.690
I love rustic, but
delicious food.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.390
OK So I've got that down.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.880
And I've got some burrata
which is from Italy.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.130
It's basically a mozzarella.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.550
So they make a mozzarella sack.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.730
And they shove it full
of sometimes cream

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.030
or creme fraiche and this thing
called stracciatella, which

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.520
is just shreds of mozzarella.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.570
So basically, it's got
this nice little coat.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.710
You guys can see it here.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.590
Nice little skin of
mozzarella on the outside.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.770
And then this lovely, oozy,
gooey, cheesy goodness inside.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.190
So I get really excited
about that kind of stuff.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.370
It's what makes my day.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.740
You just pick this up.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.671
It doesn't matter
if some oozes out.

00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:50.490
Just arrange it nicely
on the plate like that.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.270
And you get this contrast
between this lovely white cream

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.480
and then these beautiful
golden carrots.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.210
Let's take a look at
these, by the way.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.340
They're getting there.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.942
And you can speed
this process up.

00:26:05.942 --> 00:26:08.275
I'm a little scared of this
induction, just so you know.

00:26:10.762 --> 00:26:12.970
ANDREW: I see you don't like
to use a lot of utensils

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.874
in your cooking.

00:26:13.874 --> 00:26:16.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.670
Only when it comes
to the hot stuff

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.730
you really like to use utensils.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.771
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: I know.

00:26:19.771 --> 00:26:22.590
See, I'm using a spoon to
plate though, yeah, I don't.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.570
Anyway, so it kind of looks
like an egg, doesn't it?

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.070
All right.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.190
So I'm going to
save some of these

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.900
like I did just to put
on top as a garnish.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.730
You could put some fresh basil
in there, too, make it nice.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.320
Or tarragon, whatever you're
using, chervil, again.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.930
Just a little bit
more oil and lemon.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.820
I always do lemon first.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.870
I think it just helps the oil
not get too greasy on the leaf.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.197
And so it doesn't
make it as heavy.

00:26:58.197 --> 00:26:59.280
But you could just premix.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.240
In my "Girl and Her Pig,"
there's a recipe for lemon oil.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.230
And its 1 to 2, so 1 lemon
to 2 oil, which is nice.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.500
Just give it a little taste,
a little bit of a season.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.275
You could premix that and
then just dress it with that.

00:27:15.275 --> 00:27:17.376
Some of this lovely pesto.

00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:24.030
Just pop some of that on top.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.820
Don't be shy.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.160
We'll do another
couple of carrots.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.250
A little bit of this on top.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.157
These are nice.

00:27:36.157 --> 00:27:37.740
Because they've got
lots of structure.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:43.270
So you can just
daintily put them on.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.510
They don't all have to
be up the right way.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.402
There could be one
that's upside down.

00:27:48.402 --> 00:27:49.610
Gives it a nice little curve.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.065
You see that there?

00:27:52.065 --> 00:27:54.670
Nice little curve here.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.157
Put one here, maybe upside down.

00:27:57.157 --> 00:27:58.990
And then just finish
it with more olive oil.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.210
And that's basically the
burrata with the carrots.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.940
So now I'm going to
show you these carrots.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.464
Hopefully I haven't burned them.

00:28:09.464 --> 00:28:10.630
So this is good.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.780
We can just throw
them in the oven now.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.030
Just give them a little shake.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.570
See the color
you've got on there?

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.320
So now you can just do
these in a medium oven.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.580
And then you don't have to
worry about getting the color.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.000
Because you've already done it.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.500
So all you've got to do is just
pay attention to how they're

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.400
cooked.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.510
And whether they're crunchy
or soft is dependent on you

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.745
and what you like, really.

00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:38.641
A bit more.

00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:39.140
OK.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.100
And then just throw
them in the oven.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.066
And these will take
about 10 minutes to cook.

00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:46.440
And again, you can get the
color a little bit more faster

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.470
if you'd like.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.400
And use a heavy-bottom pan.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.390
Use a pan that's thick on the
bottom, not like a thin pan.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.120
Because this'll
help all the sugars.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.990
Whatever you're cooking, whether
it's searing meat or cooking

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.140
vegetables, it'll bring the
sugars out at a slower rate

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.840
than if you use a thin pan.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.090
And it's more even.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.710
So a good pan's really
important to get great food.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.330
That's it.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.430
That's my little
two dishes here,

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.310
the smashed peas
with the arugula

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.050
and the burrata with
the carrot top pesto.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.400
Thanks for coming, guys.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.650
I hope you're going to get
to eat your little nibbles.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.216
And we're going to do a Q&amp;A.

00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:27.120
ANDREW: All right.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.252
Anybody have any questions?

00:29:29.252 --> 00:29:30.710
AUDIENCE: What
restaurants will you

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.115
visit in San Francisco
besides Tosca?

00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:34.990
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.980
I'm only here on
a fleeting visit.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.470
Because I have to go on to LA.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.690
But yeah, I'll probably
just spend my time

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.550
at Tosca, which
is the best thing.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.190
I love Tosca.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.590
And I need to be
in my restaurant.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:49.051
So yeah.

00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:50.050
ANDREW: Right over here.

00:29:52.114 --> 00:29:53.572
AUDIENCE: When you
were growing up,

00:29:53.572 --> 00:29:56.710
did you always like vegetables?

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.950
Sorry, two parts.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.530
And then also, what were
your biggest influences

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.455
with vegetables growing up?

00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:03.330
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: OK.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.330
So yeah, I loved
veggies growing up.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.070
My Nan, actually, was the
best cook in the family.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.380
And we always used to go
round to have a big roast

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.490
dinner, a big roast lunch.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.862
And she was amazing.

00:30:16.862 --> 00:30:18.320
She would get all
her mise en place

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.300
in little pots on the stove.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.000
She'd have her peeled
potatoes covered in water.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.320
She'd have her parsnips in a
pan ready to go in the oven.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.630
And that was very inspiring.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.990
She was very organized.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.700
But yeah, I loved
roasted carrots.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.220
I loved carrots.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.260
I love potatoes.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.590
I think I must have some
Irish in me somewhere.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.870
I'm slightly obsessed
about potatoes.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.800
But peas, I love peas.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.240
Parsnips.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.680
Parsnips were a little bit more
difficult. But I did eat them,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.810
just because they were
a bit more floral.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.355
But I worked in a restaurant
called The River Cafe where

00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:58.370
I really got to
experience things

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.880
like parsnips and celeriac or
fennel, that a lot of people

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.687
don't like.

00:31:02.687 --> 00:31:04.520
Because I think they
struggle with that kind

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.002
of floral, aromatic
flavor that they have.

00:31:08.002 --> 00:31:08.710
And I don't know.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.090
They really just opened my eyes.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.240
And I fell in love with
that type of vegetable

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.640
at that restaurant.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.005
And so I think you can kind
of see that come through

00:31:18.005 --> 00:31:19.370
in the book.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.754
Yeah, I reference The River
Cafe quite a lot in this book.

00:31:22.754 --> 00:31:24.170
AUDIENCE: It's a
great restaurant.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.520
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: It's amazing.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.000
I'd still be there
now, I think, probably.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.500
Yeah.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.190
ANDREW: What's next?

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.606
You have five
amazing restaurants,

00:31:34.606 --> 00:31:35.840
a couple of great books.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.200
What's coming up?

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.720
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: What's next?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.510
That's a good question.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.520
I'm actually working
on a burger concept

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.330
right now that's all going to
be wood-grilled, just a really

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.140
great ale wood-grilled
burger with locally

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:56.390
sourced beef, which we'll
grind in-house ourselves.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.980
Yeah.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.940
Thank you guys.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.691
Thanks for coming.

00:31:59.691 --> 00:32:00.440
ANDREW: All right.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.280
Thanks a lot, guys.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.640
So there are books
for sale in the back.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.571
And so please feel
free to buy a book.

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:08.320
And she'll be signing
books right up here.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.050
APRIL BLOOMFIELD:
Yep, definitely.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:09.330
ANDREW: OK.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.090
Cool, thank you.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.390
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Great.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.290
Thanks, guys.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.340
[APPLAUSE]
