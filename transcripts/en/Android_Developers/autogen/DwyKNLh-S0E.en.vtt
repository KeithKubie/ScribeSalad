the kind of list and that's one reason
why<00:19:38.169><c> I</c><00:19:38.200><c> think</c><00:19:38.289><c> it</c><00:19:38.499><c> has</c><00:19:38.649><c> to</c><00:19:38.799><c> have</c><00:19:39.190><c> that</c><00:19:39.429><c> added</c>

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:39.609 align:start position:0%
why I think it has to have that added
 

00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:42.329 align:start position:0%
why I think it has to have that added
value<00:19:40.349><c> it</c><00:19:41.349><c> has</c><00:19:41.559><c> to</c><00:19:41.679><c> be</c><00:19:41.739><c> something</c><00:19:42.099><c> that</c><00:19:42.129><c> kind</c>

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:42.339 align:start position:0%
value it has to be something that kind
 

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:43.259 align:start position:0%
value it has to be something that kind

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:11.420 align:start position:0%

the midterm or the next goal would be

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.580 align:start position:0%

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
kind of headsets on and so on but again

kind of headsets on and so on but again
I<00:23:31.460><c> think</c><00:23:31.490><c> it</c><00:23:31.730><c> just</c><00:23:31.760><c> comes</c><00:23:32.000><c> down</c><00:23:32.179><c> to</c><00:23:32.480><c> kind</c><00:23:32.570><c> of</c>

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:32.659 align:start position:0%
I think it just comes down to kind of
 

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:34.269 align:start position:0%
I think it just comes down to kind of
like<00:23:32.840><c> what</c><00:23:33.049><c> are</c><00:23:33.080><c> the</c><00:23:33.260><c> applications</c><00:23:33.860><c> going</c><00:23:34.130><c> to</c>

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
like what are the applications going to
 

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
like what are the applications going to
be<00:23:34.429><c> and</c><00:23:35.210><c> I</c><00:23:35.299><c> think</c><00:23:35.360><c> you'll</c><00:23:35.570><c> probably</c><00:23:35.659><c> begin</c><00:23:36.139><c> to</c>

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:36.289 align:start position:0%
be and I think you'll probably begin to
 

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
be and I think you'll probably begin to
see<00:23:36.440><c> a</c><00:23:36.470><c> you</c><00:23:37.250><c> know</c><00:23:37.370><c> they</c><00:23:38.330><c> are</c><00:23:38.510><c> finding</c>

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:39.169 align:start position:0%
see a you know they are finding
 

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.899 align:start position:0%
see a you know they are finding
different<00:23:39.440><c> areas</c><00:23:40.130><c> which</c><00:23:40.370><c> it's</c><00:23:40.580><c> really</c><00:23:40.789><c> good</c>

00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:40.909 align:start position:0%
different areas which it's really good
 

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:42.460 align:start position:0%
different areas which it's really good
at<00:23:41.059><c> so</c><00:23:41.179><c> I</c><00:23:41.210><c> think</c><00:23:41.450><c> it</c><00:23:41.570><c> has</c><00:23:41.750><c> lots</c><00:23:42.350><c> of</c>

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
at so I think it has lots of
 

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.779 align:start position:0%
at so I think it has lots of
applications<00:23:42.889><c> for</c><00:23:43.190><c> kind</c><00:23:43.370><c> of</c><00:23:43.399><c> business</c>

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:43.789 align:start position:0%
applications for kind of business

00:23:59.980 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
general public much more exposure to it
 

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.180 align:start position:0%
