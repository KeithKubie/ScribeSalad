00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.890
A circle with area
81 pi has a sector

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.221
with a 350-degree central angle.

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.470
So this whole sector right
over here that's shaded in,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.800
this pale orange-yellowish
color, that

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.450
has a 350-degree central angle.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.850
So you see the central angle,
it's a very large angle.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.710
It's going all the
way around like that.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.090
And they ask us, what is
the area of the sector?

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.730
So we just need to realize
that the ratio between the area

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:41.570
of the sector and the
total area of the circle.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.390
And they tell us what
the total area is.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.990
It's 81 pi.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.440
And 81 pi is going to
be equal to the ratio

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.310
of its central angle,
which is 350 degrees,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.800
over the total number of
degrees in a circle-- over 360.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.270
So the area of the sector
over the total area

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630
is equal to the degrees
in the central angle

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.020
over the total
degrees in a circle.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.090
And then we just can
solve for area of a sector

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.220
by multiplying both
sides by 81 pi.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.450
81 pi, 81 pi-- so
these cancel out.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.500
350 divided by 360 is 35/36.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.376
And so our area, our sector
area, is equal to-- let's see,

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:37.630
in the numerator, we have
35 times-- instead of 81,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.310
let's see, that's going
to be 9 times 9 pi.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.680
And in the
denominator, I have 36.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, that's the same
thing as 9 times 4.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.250
And so we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.400
both by 9, and so we are
left with 35 times 9.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.140
And neither of these
are divisible by 4,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.220
so that's about as
simplified as we can get it.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.740
So let's think about
what 35 times 9 is.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.130
35 times 9, it's going to be 350
minus 35, which would be 315,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.810
I guess.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.910
Did I do that right?

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.690
Yeah, it's going to be 270 plus
45, which is 315 pi over 4.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.856
315 pi over 4 is the
area of the sector.
