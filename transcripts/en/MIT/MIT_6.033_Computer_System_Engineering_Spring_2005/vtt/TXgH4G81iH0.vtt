00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.890
class -- In the last we
lecture traditionally

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.772
we bring in a guest
lecturer to tell us

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:10.066
of their perspective
on complex systems

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.176
and it is with great pleasure
to welcome Hal Albelson.

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:18.296
A professor here at MIT
for many years, some of you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.040
might have already
taken classes from him.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.100
And what he is going
to talk about is

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.920
a topic we've touched upon,
but not in particular detail,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.900
in the first two lectures.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.016
In particular the interaction of
technology and complex systems

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:34.766
with law and social issues.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.136
Hal: Ok, thanks.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.420
Okay hi.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.626
Hari asked me to talk about
complex systems, which

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:46.660
is kind of what you've
been studying all semester.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.856
Today I want to
give you of a hint

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:52.150
of another kind of complexity.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.260
You have been doing the
technical infrastructure

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.100
for essentially what has
become the information age.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.540
But the information age...

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.340
You gotta turn off the mic.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.580
But the information age has
just changed the world immensely

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330
over the last 20 years
and has run smack

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.920
into another kind of complexity.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.180
And that's the complexity of
how the stuff that we have all

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.140
built as computer scientists
and engineers has created

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.700
these enormous stressors
in the way people

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.280
think about the legal structures
and the regulatory structures,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.479
the way people deal
with the world.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.560
And why would you guys know, from
being a source of it,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.700
know that it's a problem?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.220
But in order to make use of that...

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.600
you have to understand that
suddenly you're dealing with

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.140
the real world.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.560
It's not just problem sets
or it's not just little

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.540
theoretical issues of protocols
or how authorization works.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.714
It is real impact
on people's lives.

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:06.630
And you run into people
who think differently.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.003
And, in particular,
you are going

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.120
to have to learn to think
about how lawmakers and the law

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.840
and lots of other
institutions deal with this.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290
This lecture, if
you like, is partly

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.880
a bit of an advertisement
for 6.805 which, of course,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.060
I teach in the fall.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.390
And what 6.805 really is
about is empowering you.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.760
What you have to understand
is by having taken

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.790
the courses you taken
like 6.033, you now

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.737
know more about the
information architecture

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.820
that makes the world work.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.329
And all but the most minuscule
part of humanity.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.079
And that can be a
way to have impact,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.920
but only if you understand
how that impacts

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.550
the regulatory structure.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.310
Just to give you a tiny example,
about two weeks ago the MBTA

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.460
put out for comments, their
new privacy policy which

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.950
was stimulated by the fact
that the MBTA is planning

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.860
on instituting a new fare
system that uses RFID tokens.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.250
And one of the things
that went into that policy

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.240
is a whole bunch of criticism by
a student project team in 6.805

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.930
last fall who worked with
the state senator who

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.730
was getting on the MBTA's
case about not having

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.000
adequate privacy regulations.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.740
So this bunch of MIT
students essentially

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.329
wrote the privacy
regulations that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.451
are now being sent
out to the public

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.700
in the State of Massachusetts.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.300
That's a tiny example
of the kind of thing

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.241
that you are now prepared to
do better than almost anybody

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:53.990
else in the world.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.579
What I am going to
talk about today

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.780
is how these new architectures,
the ones you've been studying,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.992
as you've already
seen, what happens

00:04:06.992 --> 00:04:08.700
when you have a big
complex architecture,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.741
you have to think about
interactions of protocols

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:13.950
and their standards and
their enormous unintended

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.337
consequences of things
fitting together.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:18.670
That's what you've been doing,
for lots of the semester,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.988
is using understanding that.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.529
But today I want to
talk a little bit

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.000
about how the same thing happens
with the legal architecture.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.020
There are protocols,
there are standards

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.470
and there are enormous,
enormous unintended consequences

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.740
of people working on different
parts of a complex system.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.420
Well, I am not going to
talk about privacy today.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.010
That is a thing that
the fall course does.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.650
Today I want to talk about
regulating speech, you know,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.670
speech, images, sounds,
the way that society

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.150
thinks about that
and sort of the mess

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.360
that the Internet has
created around that.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.690
And so we can take like
the simplest picture.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.240
There is the Internet and
there is a source some place

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.220
and there is a
destination some place

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.740
and then there is this cloud
that is the Internet that they

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.170
are communicating with.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.620
And that is the stupidest
simplest picture.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.170
You guys know infinitely
more about this picture.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.330
Just to unpeel the very
first level of that.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.100
You know that both the source
and destination are probably

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.577
connected to the Net using
an Internet service provider.

00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:32.159
And then, of course,
inside that cloud

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.050
that is all sorts of stuff.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.840
There are Cisco switched
and hubs and phone companies

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.340
and all sorts of
things translating.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.230
You can fill out the complexity
of that picture right now,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.540
but let's stay even
at the simple one.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.140
Suppose something
is happening there

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.360
that somebody doesn't like.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.909
Somebody is downloading
copyrighted music or something

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.940
and the recording
industry hates that.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.660
Somebody is sending threatening
letters to somebody else.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.660
Somebody is doing
gambling at a place where

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.910
you're not supposed to gamble.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.050
Something that
somebody doesn't like.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.990
And let's think
about we, society,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.420
would like to figure out how you
can stop that or make it happen

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.840
less by imposing regulation.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.890
And the question is in
any of these transactions

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.610
there are all sorts of places
that you can impose regulation.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.630
You can go to the source
and you can say, hey,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.750
stop sending that pornography.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.600
You could go to the
destination and you

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.890
would say, hey, stop pulling
down that copyrighted music.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.340
You could go to the ISPs.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.790
I am sure nobody here has
ever downloaded copyrighted

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.160
music over the Internet.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.560
But you can imagine the RIAA
going to MIT and saying, hey,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.700
MIT, you are the ISP
for this connection,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.330
you put a stop to it.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.570
You can even imagine
somebody going to the cloud.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.040
You can imagine congress
passing a regulation,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.780
or maybe you can imagine it, but
unfortunately a lot of congress

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.200
can imagine passing a regulation
that says something like, hey,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.090
let's change those Cisco routers
so that they won't pass along

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.520
copyrighted information
without permission.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.909
And everybody
here, hopefully you

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:37.461
are shrinking in
horror because you

00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.460
know about things like
the end-to-end principle,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.760
and you say oh, my
God, that violates

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.997
the end-to-to principle in
a horrible, horrible way.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.580
But you don't think
people in congress

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.740
know about the
end-to-end principle.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.650
They need people like you
guys to explain it to them.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.500
That is the kind of thing that
you can become empowered to do.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.000
Within that context, let's
think about controlling

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.590
what people can say and how
people can express themselves

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.674
in words or music or
images or whatever.

00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:11.090
Somebody comes
down and says, hey,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.850
stop doing that, you really
shouldn't post that thing,

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.230
it is bugging somebody to hell.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:25.797
And you say oh, no, because
I've got freedom of speech.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.130
Let's look at freedom of speech.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.330
Where does freedom of speech
come from in this country?

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.690
The First Amendment.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.659
This country has
the First Amendment.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:42.390
Congress shall make no law
respecting the establishment

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.430
of religion, or abridging the
freedom of speech, dot, dot,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.710
dot, dot, dot.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.710
So let's spend a little
bit thinking about that.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:57.870
What does it mean when it says
congress shall make no law?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.765
Who is Congress?

00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:01.640
Congress is congress.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.310
Who else is restricted
by the First Amendment?

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.010
Is the State of
Massachusetts congress?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.960
When the State of
Massachusetts passes

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.360
a law that says you may
not post this certain kind

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.950
of information, you may not
post harassing information

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:25.189
on the Internet, well,
let me be more precise,

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:27.230
could they do it within
the confines of the First

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.730
Amendment?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.359
We know that
congress is congress.

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:35.900
How about the State
of Massachusetts,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.050
are they congress?

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.970
It actually turns out the
State of Massachusetts

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.090
is congress for the
First Amendment.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:54.210
The Constitution is
the law of the land.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.840
The Constitution
says what it says.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.490
It says congress cannot do it.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.882
And the Supreme Court
has interpreted congress

00:10:01.882 --> 00:10:03.340
to mean the State
of Massachusetts.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.830
How about if the City of
Cambridge passes a law that

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.470
says you cannot send
these kinds of things?

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:16.300
Well, it turns out the
City of Cambridge is, too.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.490
It turns out the First Amendment
covers most governmental things

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.270
in the US.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:20.950
How about MIT?

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.440
Could MIT, for example,
have a rule that says that?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.930
Can there be an MIT
regulation that says that?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.450
How many people
think there could be?

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.750
And, by could, I mean without
violating the Constitution.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.360
How many people think
MIT could do that?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.179
How many people
think MIT cannot?

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:55.720
You go and take them to court
and say it is unconstitutional.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.810
How about UMass Boston?

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.710
Could UMass Boston
have a regulation

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:12.570
like that without violating
the First Amendment?

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.320
What do you think?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.611
How many people think it could?

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.480
How many people
think it couldn't?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.950
How many people have no idea?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.190
Well, sort of have no
idea is the right answer.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.230
But it kind of turns out that
this language actually comes

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.640
exactly from a policy at
the University of Michigan

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.900
ten years ago which was
struck down by the court.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:46.860
That was, whatever we call
these things, harassment policy

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.509
or something.

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:49.300
That was actually struck
down by the court.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.799
And what the judge said was,
look, this might be a good idea

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:53.720
and we might like it,
but in this country

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.270
government institutions
like by extension

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.860
of the State of Michigan and
the University of Michigan

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.485
are constrained by
the First Amendment.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.854
MIT is not.

00:12:07.854 --> 00:12:09.770
We can argue whether or
not it is a good idea,

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.840
but it is not unconstitutional
for MIT to do that.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.100
Now, you might ask
do you guys have

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.390
less solid guarantees
of freedom of speech

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.181
than students at UMass Boston?

00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:25.055
Well, yeah, probably.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.000
There are lots of
things that congress,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.360
and by the extension of
congress, cannot prohibit.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.180
But what are some things
that congress can prohibit?

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.980
What are some kinds of speech
or images or things that you

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.380
actually can have laws against?

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.040
What do you think?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.160
Are there any limits
to this at all?

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.660
What do you think?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.800
Is there any kind of thing
that you have limits?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.020
Student: Yelling fire in a public theater.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.420
Student: Something that is
truly very dangerous.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.660
This is about speech.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.680
This is not about actions.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.660
Are there kinds of speech
or images of things?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.820
Child pornography.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.770
We cannot actually possess child
pornography in this country.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.460
We will get back to
that in a second.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.180
Anything that can be defined
as interstate commerce?

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.911
No, that just means you
cannot reregulate it.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.160
I am asking what are some
examples of stuff you cannot

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.260
post on the Internet.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.860
Libel or slander.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.310
There is a whole bit of
that copyright infringement

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.080
we talk about.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.050
How about pornography?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:50.030
You get in trouble for posting
pornography on the Internet.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.540
Can that be prohibited
under state law?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.960
It turns out it depends what
you mean by pornography.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.370
In fact, if we
sort of elevate up

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.650
from pornography to
what is normally called,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.320
you know, pornography
is bad, but really bad.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.820
The word for really bad
in US law is obscenity.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.962
And it turns out, well,
let's see if you know.

00:14:13.962 --> 00:14:16.170
Do you think there is a
legal definition of obscenity

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.860
or is it like hey, it
is really bad stuff?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.840
How many think there is a
formal legal definition when

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.340
the court looks at something
and says it is obscene?

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.076
And how many think it is
like really bad stuff?

00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:33.200
The first people are right.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.810
There actually is,
in this country,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.480
a legal definition of obscenity
which was established in a case

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.280
called Miller v.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.030
California in the `70s.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.185
And it says this is the
definition of obscenity

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:45.060
according to the law.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.220
It is called the Miller Test.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.240
It says something is
obscene if it satisfied all

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.060
of the following three things.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.060
A three have to be true.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.440
The first one is that it
depicts sexual activity

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.690
in a patently offensive way.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.540
So like it is not
an anatomy book.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.792
That is sort about
what the stuff is.

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:10.500
The second one is how
people react to it.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.630
It is a very interesting test.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:25.510
It says would the average person
applying contemporary community

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.760
standards find that that appeals
to the prurient interest?

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.200
It is sort of saying it is
not the extreme guys that

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.050
are really sensitive
and it is not

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.080
the guys who will just
tolerate everything.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.050
It is the average person
applying contemporary community

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.990
standards.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.780
And then the third one is,
what people used to say,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.080
utterly devoid of any
scientific, literary, artistic

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.910
or political value.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.000
That is sometimes called
the Slap Test in law.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.010
So there is a thing
called obscenity.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.810
And, according to the
law, the Supreme Court,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.930
actually in the Miller case,
found it constitutional

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:07.679
for there to be laws against
transmitting obscene material,

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.720
and somebody said it,
before interstate commerce.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.380
So interstate commerce
is not prohibited

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:26.280
but it is the hook by which
you can prohibit something.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:41.660
So it is 1994 and Robert
and Carlene Thomas

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.230
have a cute little
family business

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.050
in Milpitas, California.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.380
And what they do is run a
thing called the Amateur Action

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.050
Bulletin Board system.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.880
Back before we had
Internet and ISPs,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.060
people had these bulletin
boards you would dial up.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.598
They ran the Amateur Action
Bulletin Board system.

00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:08.579
And they distributed
from that, well,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.960
stuff that you wouldn't show
around in polite company.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.190
In fact, their logo
was we are the nastiest

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.800
place on earth in 1994.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.530
Well, two years
ago, 1992, they got

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.926
raided by the Milpitas
police who said, God,

00:17:27.926 --> 00:17:29.260
you've got all this smut around.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.000
We are going to close you down.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.830
They protested.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.130
The police looked at it and
said, well, it is bad stuff

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.450
but it is not obscene by
the standards of Milpitas,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.980
California, we will
leave you alone.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.560
Now we are back in 1994.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.030
There is a knock on
the door and in come

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:58.135
the Milpitas police accompanied
by the US Postal Inspectors.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:08.400
And Robert and
Carlene are accused

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.010
of transmitting
obscene material using

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.000
a means of interstate
communication, namely

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.200
a computer and a modem
and a phone line,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.780
to transmit obscene
materials interstate.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.590
And they are accused of
transmitting them interstate

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.150
to David Deremer.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.410
Who is David Deremer?

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.950
They don't know who this guy is.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.990
It turns out that David
Deremer is a postal inspector

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.655
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.390
And he gets a complaint from
somebody in Western, Tennessee

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.680
saying there is this awful
smut on the Internet,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.090
can't the US Postal Authority
do anything about it?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.300
He takes his
computer and dials up

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.350
Welcome to Amateur Action
Bulletin Board, the nastiest

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.250
place on earth, and here are
some titillating little pieces

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.800
of stuff that you
can get from us.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.030
But, if you really want the
good stuff, send in $55,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.010
register and join.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:25.580
He sends in his phone number,
addressed and an assumed name

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.500
with his $55.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.810
A couple days later
he gets a call

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.150
from Robert Thomas saying hi,
thanks for your $55 bucks.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.210
Here is your password,
good to town,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.200
have fun, welcome to the
nastiest place on earth.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.800
So he downloads
some stuff and then

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.810
files a complaint against them
because of this transmission

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.444
of this material interstate
from Milpitas, California

00:19:51.444 --> 00:19:52.360
to Memphis, Tennessee.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.740
The police come, they
arrest the Thomas's,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.420
they impound all
their stuff and go

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.030
on trial before a jury
in Memphis, Tennessee

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:15.820
which convicts them of
transmitting material that

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.050
is obscene by the community
standards of Memphis,

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.000
Tennessee, which are
different from the community

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.720
standards of
Milpitas, California.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.480
So what do you think of that?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.240
Do you think that is OK?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.900
Student: I think it should have been judged
by [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.600
You think it should go by
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], right?

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.600
Who standards should this follow?
Is this Tennessee ? Is this...?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.920
What do you think?

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.720
Student: It is similar to
what happens if

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.920
Hal: Right, so that's the question.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.320
If you go and commit an atrocity
in another country, right?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.740
Is Thomas in Tennessee

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.800
or is he in California,
that is the question.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.880
He appeals. They appeal their
conviction and they lose.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.980
And the judge
basically says, well,

00:20:58.984 --> 00:21:00.400
I don't quite want
to decide this,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.235
but notice dumdum that you
had the guy's phone number

00:21:04.235 --> 00:21:06.110
so you knew where he
was when you called him.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.530
So you should have been
aware that this stuff was

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.320
going to Memphis, Tennessee.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.310
Three years in jail under that.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.387
Let's move away from pornography
or obscenity for a minute.

00:21:21.387 --> 00:21:22.970
Here is another thing
that is illegal.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.740
It is illegal to
traffic in that stuff.

00:21:30.327 --> 00:21:32.160
It is illegal to traffic
in that stuff, that

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.680
is Hitler's something birthday
commemorative stamp, in France.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.070
It is OK in the US,
but in France it

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.970
is illegal to traffic
a Nazi memorabilia.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:50.430
And in 2000, this is
on the Yahoo Auction,

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:56.150
actually this page isn't up
anymore, some people in France

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:03.900
filed a lawsuit against Yahoo
for allowing people in France

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:09.580
to connect to Yahoo in the US
and order Nazi memorabilia.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.700
And that case...

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.770
You might want to compare that
with the Amateur Action Case,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.520
but that case is still going on.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.782
It has gone back and forth.

00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:24.240
It is widely
complicated because it

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.710
involves international law and
French courts and US courts.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.150
It is still going on since 2000.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.300
There is an article that
came out two weeks ago

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.750
that talks about this case being
argued in front of the Ninth

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.610
Circuit in California.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.290
Enormously complex
stuff because what

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.640
does this stuff mean in a world
where distance is meaningless?

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.150
I mean you guys know there are
McDonald's in Missouri where

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.250
you drive up to this window
and you put in your order

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.460
and there is a camera and
you say what your order is.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.780
And then you drive around
and you pick up your stuff

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.490
at the kitchen.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.260
There are McDonald's in Missouri
where that transaction from you

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.270
ordering it goes to a
McDonald's call center

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.280
in Colorado which
pieces the thing

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.712
together, sends it back to
the kitchen at the McDonald's

00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:19.670
you are at in Missouri.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.770
And, by the time you drive
around the McDonald's

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.330
to pick this thing up,
your order is ready.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.630
And, because this call
center in Colorado

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.046
does a whole bunch of them and
has people who are trained,

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:32.570
it is cheaper for
McDonald's and faster

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.440
to route this
transaction from Missouri

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.982
to Colorado in the time you
are driving around the building

00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:41.440
than it would be if they ran
the thing through the kitchen.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.023
You have to ask, in
a world like that,

00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:46.170
that's the world that we are
all making with the Internet.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.910
And what do these laws mean?

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.800
That is a little
bit about obscenity

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.110
and contemporary standards.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.200
In 1995, most people
in this country

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.750
were barely aware that
there was an Internet.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.050
And the way most
people in the country

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.760
learned in 1995 that
there was a thing

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.620
called the Internet
was this way.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:25.280
That is Time Magazine
from July 1995.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.030
You guys think it is funny.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.140
Time Magazine teaching
people about the Internet.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.020
Sex is everywhere these days,
in books, magazines, films,

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.990
television, music videos
and bus stop perfume ads.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.310
Americans have become so
endured to the open display

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.357
of eroticism and the
arguments for why

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:46.440
it enjoys special status
under the First Amendment

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.410
that they hardly
notice it is there.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.110
But something about
the combination

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.280
of sex and computers seems
to make otherwise worldly

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.760
wide adults a little crazy.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.470
And if you think
things are crazy now,

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.740
still quoting from
the article in 1995,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.960
wait until the politicians get
hold of a report coming out

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.510
this week.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.320
A research team at
Carnegie Mellon University

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.660
has conducted an exhaustive
study of online porn.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.860
Who is downloading it?

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.350
What turns them on?

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.630
And feelings are
sure to pour out.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:28.530
And, low and behold, published
a study about online porn

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.100
where they carefully
studied the habits

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.690
of average Americans,
who I think

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.199
were CMU undergraduates,
using Usenet.

00:25:39.199 --> 00:25:40.990
And they found out
interesting conclusions.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.700
One is they found out that
Robert and Carlene were

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.940
actually doing really well.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.960
They were pulling in
over $1 million a year

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.080
in their business
out in Milpitas.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:58.497
And the other is 83.5% of
all images posted on Usenet

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.040
are pornographic.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.360
June 26, 1995, Senator
Charles Grassley,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.100
who is still in the
senate, right up

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.820
on the floor of the senate, Mr.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.730
President, there is an
article from Time Magazine

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.340
and an article that I
ask unanimous consent

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.871
to have printed in the
Congressional Record.

00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:17.370
Mr.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.995
President, this
morning I want to speak

00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:21.890
on a topic that has received
a lot of attention around here

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.390
lately.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.270
My topic is cyber porn.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.770
Mr.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.680
President, Georgetown University
has released a remarkable study

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.660
conducted by researchers of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.500
This study raised
important questions

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.170
about the availability and
the nature of cyber porn.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.260
The University surveyed
900,000 computer images.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.530
Of these 900,000, 83.5% of
all computerized photographs

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.980
available on the Internet
are pornographic.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.240
I want to repeat that, 83.5%,
these are all on the Internet

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.170
and are pornographic according
to the Carnegie Mellon study.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.740
I believe congress
must act and do so

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.640
in a constitutional manner
to help parents who are

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.240
under assault this day and age.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.280
There is a flood
of vile pornography

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.070
and we must act now to
stem the growing tide.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:19.660
And, indeed, congress acted and
passed a law the Communications

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.260
Decency Act.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.620
Which basically said

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.580
that anybody who...

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.740
You want to look at
the words of this,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.080
they are quite
important

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.330
who makes available
to someone

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:37.910
under the age 18 years
things that are patently

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.280
offensive measured by
contemporary community

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:48.950
standards, dot, dot,
dot, or allows -- knowingly

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.650
allows a telecommunications
facility to be used

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:57.980
for that purpose shall
be fined under title 18

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.300
or imprisoned for not
more than two years.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.440
It's called the
Display Provision

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.880
of the Communications
Decency Act passed into law

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.690
at the beginning of 1996.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.870
And notice what it is doing
in terms of our picture.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.630
It is saying there is
bad stuff going on.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.860
Who can get hammered?

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.920
The person sending it?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.500
The ISP who knowingly
makes that stuff available?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.575
Cisco who is
building the routers?

00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:30.075
Maybe.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.590
This became part of US law.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:42.190
They also added another thing
that was kind of interesting.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.450
They added a thing
called the Good Samaritan

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.220
Provision of the Act
which says nobody

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.390
who is an ISP, that was to
help these poor guys who were

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.880
feeling very nervous, nobody
who is an ISP shall be treated

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:01.600
as the publisher of bad
stuff if the information came

00:29:01.617 --> 00:29:02.450
from somewhere else.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.158
And I will come back
to that in a minute.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.180
Why did they add that?

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:18.460
Well, it is 1990 and
there is a bulletin board

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.340
system called CompuServe.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.740
Is CompuServe still around?

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.650
Does anybody know?

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.600
It got bought by AOL?

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.080
CompuServe was one
of the early ones.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.510
And CompuServe had
a bunch of B boards.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:39.331
And they had a thing called
Rumorville or someone was using

00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:41.580
CompuServe to post a thing
called Rumorville which was

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.160
part of their journalism forum.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.660
Another guy named Robert
Blanchard starts up

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.430
another online publication
called Scuttlebutt,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.500
and it was designed to
compete with Rumorville.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.480
Rumorville then
starts publishing

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.549
defamatory statements about
Blanchard and Scuttlebutt.

00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:07.590
The whole this is a scam.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.298
They are no good.

00:30:08.298 --> 00:30:11.310
They rip off their stories by
copying them from Rumorville,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.370
dot, dot, dot.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.090
And Blanchard goes
and sues CompuServe.

00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:25.120
You guys are letting
this stuff happen.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.220
It is hurting my business.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.900
Now, what is he suing them for?

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.370
He is suing them under
a law called defamation.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.240
Another little piece of law.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.490
This is another thing that
you can get in trouble for.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:42.490
Defamation is something, again,
all three things, is false,

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:48.680
you communicate to somebody
else and causes damage.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.230
There are two kinds
of defamation.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.830
There is the stuff that you say
which is slander and the stuff

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.860
that you write that is libel.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.660
So Blanchard goes and sues
CompuServe for defamation.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:08.160
And it is one of the basic first
rulings on Internet defamation

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.950
law, Cubby v.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:09.910
CompuServe.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.250
The judge basically says
tough, CompuServe is just

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.507
like a bookstore and they
have some books there

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:18.590
and they don't really know
what is in those books.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.250
You cannot really hammer them
for what is in their books.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.590
They neither knew
nor had any reason

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.960
to know what was in that stuff.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:37.350
Go sue Rumorville but
CompuServe is off the hook.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.280
In terms of our
picture of regulation,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.920
the court is saying for
defamation it is that.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.660
What is it?

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.240
Question? [unintelligible]

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.960
Student: Why didn't they consider the
destination [unintelligible]

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.720
Hal: Well, there are some
poor innocent people.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.590
You.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.756
You're sitting there, you're
logged into CompuServe,

00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:03.660
you read some awful
thing about Rumorville,

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.480
she is supposed to
get hammered for that?

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.260
Yeah, this is

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.790
other people who are just sort
of knowing that the source was

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.560
coming from there.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.740
That was 1990, five years later.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.642
Five years later the
Internet is growing.

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:26.100
There is concern
about pornography.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.010
It is not only the uber geeks
who were using CompuServe,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.620
there was a company
called Prodigy.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.410
Prodigy still exists.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.860
Prodigy was a bulletin board.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.840
They advertised themselves
as a family friendly service.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.310
Hi, guys, there
is this Internet.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.970
You can join Prodigy.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.140
It is kind of safe
for your kids.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.490
And the way they did that
is they had chat rooms

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.240
and hired people to
moderate their chat rooms,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.500
and if any bad stuff happened
the moderator would cut it off.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.060
So Prodigy is running the
family-oriented B board

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.720
service.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.780
And there is a company that
is an investment banking

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.180
place called Stratton-Oakmont

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.100
and they are about to
make a new offering.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.200
And somebody on one of the
Prodigy bulletin boards

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.550
starts publishing stuff
about Stratton-Oakmont.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.220
They don't know who
this somebody is.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.740
It is anonymous.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.370
But Stratton-Oakmont is
a bunch of crooks.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.260
The president was in jail.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.420
This offering they are
going to do is a fraud.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:34.020
And Stratton-Oakmont
goes and sues Prodigy

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.570
because whoever was
posting it was anonymous.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:42.700
They go sue Prodigy, and
Prodigy says hey, guys,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.660
we went through this.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.350
This is Cubby v.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.367
CompuServe all over again.

00:33:46.367 --> 00:33:48.700
Go find the people who are
doing it, get on their backs,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.460
we are clean.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:58.280
And the New York State
Court of Appeals say uh-uh,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.090
you're not the same because
you are moderating those chat

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.200
rooms.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.179
You are taking responsibility
for what is being said there.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:14.310
Therefore, you have
liability because you

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.310
are doing the moderation.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.820
You, in fact, are libel as
the publisher of that stuff

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:28.020
because you are controlling it.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.400
It is quite comforting
for freedom of speech

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.770
to let ISPs get off the hook.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.010
In response to this,
every university lawyer

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.230
at any place that
had an Internet

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.380
went to the
administration and said

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.600
hey, guys, don't control
what the students are doing.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.780
Whatever you do don't control
it because, as soon as you do,

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.980
you are liable.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.500
It certainly happened at MIT,
and I assume very place else.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.710
But what is it doing in
terms of our picture here?

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.680
Our poor ISPs who
were off the hook

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.045
now get targeted
in a way big-time.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.220
Coming back to the
Communications Decency Act,

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.512
why was there that Good
Samaritan Provision?

00:35:21.512 --> 00:35:23.970
Well, congress was sitting
there saying well, gee, not only

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.950
do we want to regulate
pornography and stop that

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.230
but we really would like
the ISPs to help us.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.760
We would like them to
filter this stuff out.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.200
So it is the policy, and
this is part of the law,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.450
of the US that there
should be filtering.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.480
And we want to encourage parents
and ISPs and everybody to keep

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.000
this smut off the network.

00:35:45.006 --> 00:35:47.130
On the other hand, that
was right after the Prodigy

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.530
decision.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.160
And all the ISPs said
hey, wait a minute,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.150
that's not going to work.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.200
So they passed this
Good Samaritan Provision

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.117
which was trying to let
them get off the hook.

00:35:59.117 --> 00:36:01.366
It is actually a little bit
more complicated than that

00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:03.970
because this had to do with the
republicans and the democrats

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.760
and stuff that got worked out
in committee and different bills

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.560
of which pieces were taken from
other bills and put together.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.300
Winston Churchill
once said that anyone

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.690
who likes sausages or law
should never watch either

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.920
of them being made.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.610
And the Communications Decency
Act is a little bit like that.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.434
Well, the law got
passed in February 1996.

00:36:31.434 --> 00:36:33.350
The whole civil liberties
were all going nuts.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:37.330
Everybody who was looking
at Internet law went nuts.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:41.230
If you take 6.805
there is a long story

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:45.250
about what eventually turned out
to be a major, major decision

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.600
in First Amendment law,
which I won't go into here,

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.560
but the net result was
the Supreme Court decided

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.780
that the Display Provision of
the Communications Decency Act

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.840
was unconstitutional.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.040
Right, and they said...

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.060
they said why? The community
standards are too broad.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.630
If you apply that it means
the standard of the most

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.490
restrictive community
will start replying

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.960
across the whole country.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.430
And it turns out
the government can

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.850
pass laws to protect
kids access to stuff,

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.970
but they say in this case, by
this desire to protect kids,

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.050
you are restricting
adults from what

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.330
they should be able to get.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.010
Anyway, a long, very, very
important First Amendment

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:45.220
decision, Reno v. ACLU.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.780
The Supreme Court ruling came
down and everybody was happy,

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.890
civil liberty groups,
everybody jumped up and down

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:57.111
and said the Internet is a zone
of free speech, which brings us

00:37:57.111 --> 00:37:57.611
to Ken.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.820
We are back in 1995.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.620
It is April 19, 1995.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.220
We just went through
the tenth anniversary

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.980
of a really horrible
thing in US history.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.880
Does anybody know what it is,
almost exactly ten years ago?

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:34.580
The bombing of the courthouse in
Oklahoma City, April 19, 1995.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.530
I guess you guys remember that.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.640
About a week later
appears on AOL

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:50.220
an announcement that says hey,
naughty Oklahoma t-shirts,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:55.970
visit Oklahoma, it's
a blast and lots

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.240
of cruder things about
referring to the kids who

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.330
had been killed in that
bombing and all sorts of stuff.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:07.260
Visit Oklahoma, it's a blast,
call Ken for naughty Oklahoma

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.360
t-shirts.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.170
And there in the message
is the phone number

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:18.310
of Ken Zeran who is just a
guy who lives in Seattle.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.380
Well, lots of people call Ken.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.860
They call him angry and upset
with obscene phone calls,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.060
threatening phone calls.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.060
He says he doesn't know
anything about this.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.900
What the hell are you doing?

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.420
They tell him about
this thing he did.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.560
How could you possibly
do that, you bastard?

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:42.070
So he calls AOL and says come
on, I didn't put this up.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.490
It has this stuff that
has got my name on it.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.240
Take it down and
publish a retraction.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.400
Mr.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.600
Zeran, we sort of have
to look into this.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.700
And you have to understand
that we don't actually

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.970
know who had this account
because they are anonymous.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.520
And it is not our policy
to publish retractions,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.640
but we will sort of do it.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.290
And maybe we will turn off
the account and check into it.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:10.600
The next day more slogans.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.840
Naughty Oklahoma,
we have t-shirts,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.120
we have bumper stickers.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.050
Visit Oklahoma, it's
a blast, call Ken.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.970
And, by the way, there is a
real demand for these things

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.620
so if you call and the line is
busy make sure you call back.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.680
By April 30th Ken Zeran is
getting an abusive phone call

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.015
every two minutes.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.260
May 1st, KXRA, a local
Oklahoma radio station

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.140
says you know what is
going on in Seattle?

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.360
There is this guy who is
publishing stuff selling

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.510
t-shirts making fun of our
kids who died in the blast

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.890
two weeks ago.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.431
His name is Ken Zeran.

00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:58.430
Why don't you tell him
what you think about him?

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.340
Here is phone number.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.173
Here is his address.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.960
The police are guarding
Zeran's house now.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.090
Well, Zeran finally
gets in touch with KXRA

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.140
and they publish
the announcement

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.180
that it is a mistake.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.770
They broadcast a
retraction of that.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:24.450
And by the end of May
Zeran is down to only 15

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:28.290
threatening phone calls a day.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:34.030
So over the next months he
gets a lawyer and sues AOL.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.590
He says you guys are negligent.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.430
I called you about this
thing, it was causing me harm,

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.540
it was on your thing,
you did not take action,

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.040
it took a real long time for
them to shut off these accounts

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.060
and you guys are
guilty of negligence.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:57.760
And AOL's lawyers go hey, hey.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.360
The Supreme Court...

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.600
Well actually, the law hadn't
been struck down by then.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.960
They go hey, hey hey.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.750
Look at this provision that
congress has passed into law.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.560
I don't care what
you said we did.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.030
We didn't provide
that information.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.928
We have no liability for it.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.720
And the court agrees with them.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.210
And it turns out, by the way,
that when congress struck down

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.370
the Communications Decency Act,
they struck down that Display

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.250
Provision.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.560
But there is nothing
unconstitutional about that.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.600
You can argue whether or
not it is a good idea,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.558
but there is nothing
unconstitutional about it.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.440
This thing is still
part of US law.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.520
You had a question.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.700
Student: [unintelligible]
...1996.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.060
Hal: What was it? Was it struck down?

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.280
Student: The one with the lawsuit...

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.720
Hal: The lawsuit was actually
at the beginning of '96.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.420
It sort of went through
this whole thing.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.980
It took him...

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.280
I think it was the
beginning of 1996

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.940
because there was
a lot of arguing

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.192
going back and forth with
AOL between when it was done.

00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:08.150
It took several months.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.280
So AOL says I don't care if
we are negligent, we are free.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.930
It is not our problem.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.690
It gets worse.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:26.660
2001, Jane Doe, in
an anonymous lawsuit,

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:33.300
sues AOL on behalf of her
teenage son, John Doe.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.360
It is anonymous.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.840
They are protecting him
because he is a minor.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.390
And she is suing AOL.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.340
She lives in Florida.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.180
It turns out there was a guy
named Richard Russell, who

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.615
by that time was
in prison, as you

00:43:44.615 --> 00:43:45.990
will see for
obvious reasons, who

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:56.930
advertised on AOL to find kids
who would come to his house.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:00.310
And he filmed them
in pornographic acts,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:04.560
including Jane
Doe's son, John Doe.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.870
And sold this stuff over
the Internet on AOL.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:15.320
Jane Doe sues AOL,
you guys are making

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.880
money from trafficking
in child pornography,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.290
in pornographic
pictures of my son.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.830
Now we're talking
child pornography.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:32.780
AOL says hey, hey, the Good
Samaritan Provision, title 19,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.980
section 230, we are not liable.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.330
This is 2001.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:42.960
This bounced around in the
courts for about three years

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.400
and finally went to the
Florida Supreme Court.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:50.600
And the Florida Supreme
Court agreed with AOL.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.130
It ain't the greatest thing man,
but that is what the law says,

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:58.220
you are not liable as
an ISP if you are not

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.180
the provider of
that information.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.250
That is a two to one decision
in the Florida Supreme Court.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:09.810
The minority opinion by Judge
Lewis, the guy just went ape.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:13.080
He said this is nuts.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:18.140
How could it conceivably have
been the intent of congress,

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:23.840
in a law that was motivated
by protecting kids

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.040
from pornography
on the Internet.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.060
How could it conceivably been
the intent of congress

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.900
that a consequence
of that law is now

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.620
that somebody who is
trafficking in child pornography

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.860
is actually immunized?

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.740
But that is the current
state of the world.

00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:43.040
And you see what it comes from.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.140
It comes from looking at
this very complex system

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.220
of regulations and the
interaction between First

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:53.910
Amendment Law and
defamation law and the fact

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.770
that you can apply regulations.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.400
You want to partly
immunize those ISPs,

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.970
but you don't want
to let them off free.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.490
And you end up with
exactly the same kinds

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:11.710
of unintended consequences
that happen whenever you

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.120
monkey with any complex system.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.520
It is not a whole lot different
from the kind of stuff

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.200
you have seen on
the technology side

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.241
when you are talking about
how the technical base

00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:21.664
of the Internet works.

00:46:21.664 --> 00:46:22.830
So where does that leave us?

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:28.450
Well, I guess in
terms of the law,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:35.610
it kind of leaves us there in
a very, very confused state.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.560
And getting more
and more confused

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.660
because what has
happened recently,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.880
this whole thing is now
mixed in international law.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:52.030
If you go search
on Google for stuff

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:54.730
from the Taiwan
Ministry of Defense

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.760
you will find that in the US.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.340
Will you find it in China?

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.370
No.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.100
Google China has a
different search.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.230
Will you find it
if you somehow are

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:09.080
able to log into US
Google from Beijing?

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.170
Yeah, you would see it.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.530
What kind of liability is there?

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.780
You're personal liability
with the Chinese government,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.200
is it Google who is going to
get hammered in their trade

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.960
agreements in terms of China?

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.580
We don't know.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.496
What is going to happen
with France and Yahoo?

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.000
This whole picture has
become even much, much

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.490
more complex as a consequence
of all of us engineers making

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:34.360
this Internet which
has effectively

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.900
made distance vanish.

00:47:39.404 --> 00:47:40.570
So where does that leave us?

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:46.750
It leaves us with you, I
guess, and where I started.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.970
You guys have
enormous power that

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.250
comes from the stuff you
have learned in this course.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:58.030
You have the ability to
go out and really, really

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.840
influence the world
by making stuff,

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.830
by explaining to people
stuff they don't know,

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:11.000
like the end-to-end
principal is one.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.480
And it is really a
question of would you

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.750
like to grab that power
and take advantage of it?

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.330
But, in order to
do that, you need

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.720
to understand this other
piece of the world.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.220
OK.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.950
Thank you.
