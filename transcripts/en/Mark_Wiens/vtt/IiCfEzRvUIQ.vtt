00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:02.524
- Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:05.995
I am in Quezon City, and
this is part of metro Manila.

00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:08.557
And today I'm going to
be meeting up with Reby,

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:10.421
who is a friend of mine.

00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:13.743
We go way back, and she
loves to eat as well.

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:16.920
So we're gonna do some eating
today around Quezon City.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.213
Reby should be here soon,
and we're gonna start eating.

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:21.796
(upbeat music)

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.508
So we're at the University
of the Philippines.

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:28.844
Is this like a food court,
or is this a student center?

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:30.286
- This is like a student center, yes.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:34.440
You can do photocopies
here, and then eat as well.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.885
Get everything done.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.386
- Oh, and we're going
to a legendary stall,

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.179
which is called Rodic's.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.098
They do have a,

00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:44.463
a series of different
Filipino dishes to eat,

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:46.861
but I think almost
everybody who comes here

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.649
eats the tapsilog, right?

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.583
- [Worker] Yeah.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.427
- Okay, so we ordered tapsilog.

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:53.215
And it comes with rice.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:56.512
The actual meat is called tapsi?

00:00:56.512 --> 00:00:57.608
- Tapa.

00:00:57.608 --> 00:00:58.441
- Tapa.

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.180
- Tapa, which is from carabao's meat.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.028
- Okay, and it's cured in vinegar, right?

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.944
- [Reby] Vinegar and soy sauce.

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:05.777
- Vinegar and soy sauce.

00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:07.404
It's cured in vinegar and soy sauce,

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:09.348
then they serve that
over rice with an egg.

00:01:09.348 --> 00:01:13.787
So it's a complete, especially
makes a good breakfast.

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.413
It's just three parts, right?

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:17.989
Rice on the bottom, then tapa

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.159
and the fried egg on top.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.001
And you can see that's a
beautiful looking fried egg there.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.978
I think they've just fried it on one side,

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:28.377
so it's kinda juicy still, half-cooked.

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:30.235
So Reby douses hers all in vinegar,

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.425
but I'm gonna just taste it first.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.421
- [Reby] Go for it.

00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.754
- To taste the flavor of the tapa before

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.604
adding the vinegar, but I know
I'll need the vinegar too.

00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:43.023
And actually, this is made with carabao,

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:45.106
which is a water buffalo.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:49.077
It's a little bit sweet and sour.

00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:50.220
- Yeah.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.423
- Sweet and sour and salty.

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:52.465
Yeah, it will be good with that extra

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:53.931
dimension of sourness.

00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:55.779
I'm gonna douse it in vinegar as well.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:56.767
Do you need more vinegar?

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.637
Do you want me to?

00:01:58.637 --> 00:01:59.541
Lots?

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:01.208
- [Reby] Keep going.

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:03.410
I'm good, thanks.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.884
- All right, I'm going in for the yolk.

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:08.717
Oh, oh, that's what makes it good.

00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:11.561
Okay, yolk,

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:14.096
and everything.

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:20.475
Oh yeah.

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.128
With the extra vinegar, it's really good.

00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:25.506
It almost tastes like beef.

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:29.124
Maybe just with a little bit
of a more meaty taste to it.

00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:30.764
Just finished with that tapsilog,

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:32.221
and I've just read that
they've been making

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.478
that same recipe since 1949,

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:36.478
so it's a proven recipe.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.510
- Cheese, avocado or mango?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.932
- [Mark] Cheese?

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:43.077
- Cheese ice cream.

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:44.865
- [Mark] Oh, I gotta have
some cheese ice cream.

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:46.007
- You never had that?

00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:46.840
- [Mark] I don't think so.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.673
- What?

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:48.506
- [Mark] I've never had cheese ice cream?

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.479
- Cheese, yeah.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.794
- [Mark] Okay, one avocado and one cheese.

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:54.247
Wait, do you get two scoops or one scoop?

00:02:54.247 --> 00:02:56.241
- [Reby] No, you have to tell
them if you wanna mix it,

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.109
it's cheese and avocado,
or do you want just--

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.159
- [Mark] Cheese and avocado.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.629
- [Reby] Is that one cheese and avocado?

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.228
Which cone do you want, the waffle cone

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.061
or just the normal one?

00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.315
- [Mark] Just the normal.

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:07.648
- [Reby] Cheese and avocado.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.022
- [Mark] Are you getting all cheese?

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:18.002
- [Reby] Just cheese, yeah.

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:18.835
- [Mark] You're all cheese?

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:19.668
- Yeah.

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:20.501
(laughter)

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.492
That's my favorite.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.167
- And I can honestly say,
this is gonna be my first time

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.300
to ever have cheese ice cream.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.800
Okay, on the top is the avocado ice cream.

00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:35.235
Yeah, that tastes like
avocado, and creamy and sweet.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:36.745
But I'm really more interested to try that

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:38.598
cheese ice cream, which is on the bottom,

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:42.431
so I'm gonna have to dig
from the bottom here.

00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.875
- [Reby] Did you get a cheese bit?

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.330
- No, I don't think I got a cheese bit.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.538
They actually have cheese pieces in it?

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:54.288
- Yeah look, hold on.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.120
Let me dig into mine.

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:00.256
- [Mark] It is a little bit salty.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.571
It's kind of a mild cheese flavor.

00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:04.321
- See those two bits?

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:06.841
They're little bits.

00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:08.273
- [Mark] It's actually little cheese?

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:11.307
- Yeah, they're scattered in there.

00:04:11.307 --> 00:04:15.804
- They have little bits
of real cheese in it.

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:17.524
Oh yeah, I got one.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.357
I got one.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.966
Yeah, that is definitely cheese.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:25.928
It's a little bit salty.

00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:27.761
It's sweet and creamy.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:29.501
And,

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:33.049
that's cheesy ice cream for you.

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:38.973
Oh that's cheese.

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:44.187
- [Reby] Cheese with, does
it look like sugar, I think.

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:45.225
- [Mark] Is it sugar too?

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:46.058
- [Reby] Mmm-hmm.

00:04:46.058 --> 00:04:47.328
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.040
- [Mark] Right next to
the ice cream stall,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.826
there's a corn stall.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:51.897
What is the name of this corn?

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:53.285
Oh cheese corn, it's
just called cheese corn?

00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:54.118
- [Reby] Cheese corn.

00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:55.487
- [Mark] Okay.

00:04:55.487 --> 00:04:57.126
So she has the corn boiling,

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.943
and then she has some that's already been

00:04:58.943 --> 00:05:00.410
chopped off the cob.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.258
And she puts it into a cup,

00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:05.232
and then just tops it, layers it

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:07.184
with cheese, cheese powder.

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:09.601
It's cheese powder and sugar.

00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:15.023
- My favorite.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:15.856
Try it.

00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:17.773
- All right, thank you.

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.552
It's pretty sweet, yeah.

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:24.885
It's very sweet.

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:27.408
And then it does have that

00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:30.613
kinda imitation cheese flavor to it.

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:33.236
The cheese powder flavor to it.

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:35.819
(upbeat music)

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.849
We're going to a place
called Mang Larry's,

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.738
which is legendary
throughout all of Manila

00:05:43.738 --> 00:05:45.762
and especially on campus,

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.179
for serving Isaw.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:52.117
Which is probably one of the most famous

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:54.617
of all Filipino Manila street foods.

00:05:54.617 --> 00:05:57.207
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:57.207 --> 00:06:01.374
- [Reby] Just the chicken,
and the pork intestines.

00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:07.063
- And actually we're
here right as they open

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:08.866
at 11 a.m., so we're here kinda early,

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.953
and I know this place is much much busier,

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.956
and a lotta people come more
in the afternoon or evening.

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.719
That's when it's most popular to eat.

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.486
But luckily, they've just opened,

00:06:17.486 --> 00:06:19.869
and I guess we'll be
first eating here today.

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:21.903
So we ordered up just
some chicken intestines

00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.405
and some pork intestines.

00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:26.333
Just throws it onto the really
scorching hot fire grill,

00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:27.901
and they're just gonna, they're just gonna

00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:30.371
like toast over those coals.

00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:31.835
It takes just a few seconds to grill

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:33.563
because they grill it on such a hot fire,

00:06:33.563 --> 00:06:36.480
and then they put it into
a little brown paper bag.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.704
I got 10 skewers of Isaw, which
is the chicken intestines.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:41.532
And one thing you gotta check out

00:06:41.532 --> 00:06:44.338
is the, the size, the magnitude,

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.186
of this jug of vinegar.

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:48.265
This is, so the vinegar is full right now.

00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:50.833
You can see all the chilis
at the top here of this jug.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:52.995
And we're here at the
very beginning of the day,

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:54.206
right as they're opening.

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:57.134
But you know that they plan
for the amount of vinegar

00:06:57.134 --> 00:06:59.035
that they're gonna use for the entire day.

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.278
So they're gonna use this entire vinegar.

00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:03.494
That tells you how many
people are gonna come here

00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:05.562
when it gets busier later in the day.

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:07.729
You can grab a little cup.

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:10.653
Should I put this in
or put the Isaw inside?

00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:11.773
- [Reby] Put the Isaw first.

00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:13.136
- [Mark] Put the Isaw first?

00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:14.366
All right.

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:15.213
- [Reby] Need help?

00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:16.963
- [Mark] Oh yes please, thank you.

00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:19.634
I'll put a few of them in here.

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:21.603
Oh, oh, oh, those are beautiful,

00:07:21.603 --> 00:07:24.186
just coiled up onto the skewer.

00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:26.615
Coiled up onto the skewer,

00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:29.038
you can see those grill marks on there,

00:07:29.038 --> 00:07:30.530
and stick this into the cup.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.552
And then, you turn on
the spigot of vinegar.

00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:36.092
Oh yeah.

00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.876
You wanna really soak it in the vinegar.

00:07:37.876 --> 00:07:39.046
- [Reby] Yeah.

00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:41.290
- [Mark] Vinegar is one
of the ultimate condiments

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.640
in the Philippines.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.630
And not only do they like, like,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.323
sprinkle on a few drops of vinegar,

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:48.938
but they like to soak things in vinegar.

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:50.855
So when you eat Isaw, you actually get

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:52.304
a whole cup of vinegar, and you can just,

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:56.064
just let those intestines
absorb all of that vinegar,

00:07:56.064 --> 00:07:57.231
chili vinegar.

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:01.142
Oh wow.

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.442
Those are delicious.

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:07.277
It's amazing.

00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:08.607
- I've never had this before.

00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:09.930
That's actually good.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.388
- It's amazing.

00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:13.072
They're completely clean.

00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:15.322
They have a very wonderful,

00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:17.921
smoky charred flavor to them.

00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.403
And then they're also very not,

00:08:19.403 --> 00:08:20.236
they're not really chewy.

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:22.340
They're very tender actually.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.967
I'm gonna scoot this guy,

00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:29.134
because I wanna, I wanna get
some more of that vinegar.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.664
They're really really good.

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:34.382
As you keep on eating, you
can grab more from the bag

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:37.765
and dunk them, to let them
marinate in that vinegar.

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:41.098
I think I can one bite this whole thing.

00:08:48.447 --> 00:08:50.253
Just don't skewer yourself.

00:08:50.253 --> 00:08:51.963
And then next up, you
just wanna taste this,

00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:53.467
the pork intestines.

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:55.690
Oh, and this has been sitting
in the vinegar for a while,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.952
so you can feel how it's heavy.

00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:59.952
It's just absorbed a lot of vinegar.

00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.966
I like pork intestines.

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:06.921
These are definitely a lot chewier,

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:11.088
and have a lot more of a
stronger taste, that's for sure.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:13.703
That was absolutely delicious.

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:16.452
I like the chicken better than the pork.

00:09:16.452 --> 00:09:18.135
The pork have a little
bit of a stronger taste

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:19.007
and are more chewy.

00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:21.408
The chicken are very neutral
tasting and just taste like,

00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:22.961
they're like natural little

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:25.448
skinny tubes of sausage.

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:27.023
That's the type of snack
that you could just keep on

00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:29.285
eating nonstop and you could just rack up

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:31.927
a whole pile of empty skewers
before you even know it.

00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:34.510
(upbeat music)

00:09:40.824 --> 00:09:44.332
We drove over to, this is
a market in Quezon City.

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:45.371
What's the name of this market, Reby?

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:46.663
- [Reby] Lagro.

00:09:46.663 --> 00:09:47.496
- What?

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:48.329
- [Reby] Lagro Market.

00:09:48.329 --> 00:09:49.162
- Ladro?

00:09:49.162 --> 00:09:49.995
- Lagro.

00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:50.919
- Lagro Market.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.472
It's a big and busy market.

00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:53.712
- [Reby] Very busy.

00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:55.971
- And very very local.

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.590
So there should be some good
street food at this market,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.191
and some things to try here.

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:01.121
It's like a half a chicken or something.

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:01.954
We can order half a chicken.

00:10:01.954 --> 00:10:02.787
- [Reby] A whole or a half?

00:10:02.787 --> 00:10:03.652
- [Mark] We can order a half.

00:10:03.652 --> 00:10:04.642
- [Reby] Okay.

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:07.225
(upbeat music)

00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:27.999
- It didn't take us long to find some

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.246
amazing looking street food at the market,

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:32.506
and this is rotisserie chicken.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:35.089
I love this rotisserie, it's
like a homemade rotisserie,

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:36.683
and this is the owner here.

00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:38.932
It's called Kuya Abe.

00:10:38.932 --> 00:10:41.349
What is it called in Tagalog?

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:44.967
- Lechon manok.

00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:46.043
- [Mark] Lechon manok.

00:10:46.043 --> 00:10:48.376
Which is like roast chicken.

00:10:49.317 --> 00:10:52.026
And this is one of the coolest rotisseries

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.171
I have ever seen.

00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:54.754
Oh, this is such a,

00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:57.837
that's amazing.

00:10:57.837 --> 00:10:59.664
- [Owner] And they turn this on.

00:10:59.664 --> 00:11:01.629
- [Mark] So it's connected by power?

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:02.526
- Yes.

00:11:02.526 --> 00:11:03.389
- [Mark] Okay.

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:04.233
Did you make it?

00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:05.344
- [Owner] Yes, I make it.

00:11:05.344 --> 00:11:06.728
- [Mark] Very nice.

00:11:06.728 --> 00:11:08.862
- It's not expensive to make this.

00:11:08.862 --> 00:11:10.975
- But it's so creative.

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:13.571
And it works, it functions so well.

00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:16.258
And that keeps the chicken
rotating all the time.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:17.772
- [Owner] All the time.

00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:19.920
- I cannot wait to taste
this chicken right now.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.855
- If you want to make this,

00:11:20.855 --> 00:11:24.016
I will teach you how to make this.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.281
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:26.894
Maybe I can make one in Thailand.

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.125
- Ah, nice.

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.205
- [Mark] For roasted chicken.

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.781
- Yes.

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:31.619
Okay, thanks.

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:33.039
- [Mark] Okay, thank you.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:35.737
The beauty of it is that, the skin.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.395
Look at that skin.

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:40.074
It's just like pure golden,

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.460
that color is wonderful.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.293
Golden blackened skin.

00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:51.203
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mmm-mmm.

00:11:51.203 --> 00:11:52.636
- That's good.

00:11:52.636 --> 00:11:53.843
- Very very nice.

00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:54.676
Oh, it's very flavorful.

00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:56.344
It has a little bit of a,

00:11:56.344 --> 00:11:58.677
like, salty and sweet glaze,

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:01.821
on it, plus maybe some pepper?

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.308
- It's already marinated.

00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:05.983
- [Mark] What's inside of the chicken?

00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:06.816
- Plenty.

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:07.649
Sugar,

00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:11.586
soy sauce.

00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:15.979
- [Mark] It's very very fragrant.

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.839
What do you put inside of the chicken?

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.429
- Lemongrass.

00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:22.287
- Lemongrass.

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:24.014
- Lemongrass, yes.

00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:26.623
- So there's lemongrass.

00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:29.495
There's lemongrass inside of the chicken.

00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:30.561
Can you taste the lemongrass flavor?

00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:31.394
- [Reby] Mmm-hmm.

00:12:31.394 --> 00:12:34.263
- [Mark] I can taste the
lemongrass, it's very good.

00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:35.198
- Nice.

00:12:35.198 --> 00:12:36.505
- Very flavorful.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:38.619
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:38.619 --> 00:12:40.110
- It's not expensive.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.527
Not like that, the other one.

00:12:45.455 --> 00:12:48.454
- Okay, thank you very much.

00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:49.883
That was very very good.

00:12:49.883 --> 00:12:51.633
Very good, thank you.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:55.103
That is absolutely awesome.

00:12:55.103 --> 00:12:57.588
And not only is the grilled
chicken, the roasted chicken

00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:00.135
really good, but the,

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:02.013
the restaurant, little
street food stalls like that,

00:13:02.013 --> 00:13:04.127
just make me so excited.

00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:05.624
They get me so pumped.

00:13:05.624 --> 00:13:08.541
Because even the method of cooking,

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:13.150
it's so innovative and so
creative, really cool spot.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.983
What is your name?

00:13:13.983 --> 00:13:14.816
- Sophia.

00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:16.069
- [Mark] Sophia?

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:17.589
Very nice to meet you,
very nice to meet you.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.894
What's your name?

00:13:18.894 --> 00:13:19.727
- Jomande.

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:21.836
- [Mark] Joman?

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:22.669
- De.

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.502
- De.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.919
Nice to meet you.

00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:30.968
Oh what a great market already.

00:13:30.968 --> 00:13:33.551
(upbeat music)

00:13:34.387 --> 00:13:36.125
You kind of come down a flight of steps,

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.520
and this is the fresh wet market area.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.562
You can see all the
meat, all the vegetables,

00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:44.181
and I always love walking
around fresh markets

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:45.241
in any country I visit.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.547
You get a really sense of the ingredients

00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:51.713
that go into the Filipino
cooking and the local food.

00:13:51.713 --> 00:13:54.296
(upbeat music)

00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:59.601
That fresh wet market was fantastic.

00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:01.884
Now we just crossed over the street,

00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:04.614
and walking around is
getting me very thirsty.

00:14:04.614 --> 00:14:07.364
I'm ready for something to drink.

00:14:08.778 --> 00:14:12.445
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.523
All around the world,
especially in tropical locations

00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:30.940
around the world,

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.675
getting a fresh coconut and
drinking a fresh coconut

00:14:33.675 --> 00:14:34.785
is one of the most refreshing things

00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:36.952
you can possibly drinking.

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:41.552
And so, in the Philippines
it's called buko, right?

00:14:41.552 --> 00:14:44.126
It's called buko, which
is a fresh coconut,

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:45.744
and just drinking the water.

00:14:45.744 --> 00:14:48.709
They have just a mound, a stack.

00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:50.187
These coconuts are giant as well.

00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:51.418
They're huge coconuts.

00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:54.066
We've all got coconuts to drink here.

00:14:54.066 --> 00:14:55.566
Whoa, that's huge.

00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:58.143
Thank you.

00:14:58.143 --> 00:14:58.976
Okay.

00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:04.747
Oh.

00:15:04.747 --> 00:15:06.261
Oh yeah.

00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:08.041
The most natural of all,

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:09.471
oh it's so good.

00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:10.622
This one is quite, a little bit sour.

00:15:10.622 --> 00:15:14.083
Not too sweet, but just
extremely refreshing.

00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:17.713
And you can just, you actually
taste those electrolytes

00:15:17.713 --> 00:15:20.129
that your, all that nutrients,

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:23.432
that your body is intaking
while you're drinking this.

00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:25.341
No, I'm just joking about that, but,

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.674
it is quite healthy and very nutritious.

00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:37.590
Then once you finish your coconut,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.330
they take it and they
just cut it right in half,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.525
hack it right in half and
then just scrape out the meat.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:43.693
This one is a young coconut,

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.335
so she just kinda, it's almost like little

00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:48.168
strands of coconut, fresh coconut.

00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:52.772
Oh.

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:55.053
Oh that just melts in your mouth.

00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:56.720
That's really young.

00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:00.420
It's sweet and rich but not,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.002
like because it's so
young, it's very soft.

00:16:03.002 --> 00:16:04.913
Coconuts are one of the,

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:08.399
the ultimate natural wonders of the world.

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.982
(upbeat music)

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:14.741
We're walking through the non-food section

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:16.177
of the market now.

00:16:16.177 --> 00:16:17.780
There's just like an
abundance of everything

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.423
you can possibly imagine, from shoes,

00:16:20.423 --> 00:16:23.854
to slippers to rings to DVDs to pants,

00:16:23.854 --> 00:16:27.019
to kids' things and umbrellas and pots,

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.115
and then there's rice stalls.

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.212
Raw rice in between everything.

00:16:32.212 --> 00:16:34.129
There's an abundance of colors

00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:36.731
and things to buy within this market.

00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:40.398
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:45.170
- [Reby] I forget what
kinda mango this is.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.214
Indian mango.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:50.192
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:50.192 --> 00:16:52.413
Ah, this is Indian mango.

00:16:52.413 --> 00:16:55.381
And we usually just have this

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.298
with some shrimp paste,

00:16:58.379 --> 00:16:59.939
and just eat it just like that.

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:00.772
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:17:00.772 --> 00:17:02.177
And so he has just cut up the mango,

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:03.503
and it's just sitting in water?

00:17:03.503 --> 00:17:04.560
- [Reby] In just water, yeah.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.407
- [Mark] All right.

00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:06.509
You grab a mango.

00:17:06.509 --> 00:17:08.140
And it's almost kinda,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.409
it's kinda hollowed out in the center

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:10.689
because that's where the seed is.

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:14.247
So it makes like a natural indentation

00:17:14.247 --> 00:17:18.657
in the mango, and then he adds
in the shrimp paste sauce,

00:17:18.657 --> 00:17:21.298
which in Tagalog is called (foreign word).

00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:24.394
And it's like a mango, a green mango

00:17:24.394 --> 00:17:26.913
on a stick with shrimp paste.

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.663
This looks delicious.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.458
I just got some shrimp paste on my nose

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:34.958
Oh that's amazing.

00:17:35.822 --> 00:17:39.033
Oh what a beautiful contrast.

00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:41.003
The mango is really good, and it has a,

00:17:41.003 --> 00:17:43.214
very sour and very crisp.

00:17:43.214 --> 00:17:45.990
And then the shrimp paste is,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.941
it's a little bit, yeah, it's fishy

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.951
because it's fermented shrimp paste

00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:52.586
or krill, it could be krill.

00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:53.710
And then it's salty.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.917
That really contrasts the sour,

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:57.784
sour crispness of that mango.

00:17:57.784 --> 00:17:59.140
Oh I love that.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.307
That is a winner of a street
food snack right here.

00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:08.646
This is one of my favorite
street food snacks so far

00:18:08.646 --> 00:18:09.566
in the Philippines.

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:11.508
That was so absolutely good
I had to get another one.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.425
I couldn't stop at one.

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:20.082
Oh, and by the way this time, oh yeah.

00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:23.619
That does have a little bit of
a sharper spicy flavor to it.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:25.608
We didn't know at first,
but he has two types

00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:27.966
of the shrimp paste.

00:18:27.966 --> 00:18:29.466
One is more spicy.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:33.334
The more spicy one, add
some chilis to this,

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:36.344
that's the only thing
that could make it better.

00:18:36.344 --> 00:18:37.911
Oh and here are the mangoes.

00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:39.744
Can I see the mangoes?

00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:44.314
This is the type of mango he's using.

00:18:45.234 --> 00:18:47.222
It's almost a circle-shaped mango.

00:18:47.222 --> 00:18:48.889
Thank you very much.

00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:53.834
That was delicious.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:58.441
But it's the type of mango
that does make your teeth hurt.

00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:00.191
Because it's so sour.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.323
Hi.

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:13.397
Oh that looks good.

00:19:13.397 --> 00:19:14.840
Oh, curry.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.572
(speaking foreign language)

00:19:18.572 --> 00:19:20.174
Coconut, oh that looks awesome.

00:19:20.174 --> 00:19:22.189
We have stopped at a very small little

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:25.562
roadside street food
restaurant, a canteen.

00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:28.506
And this place, actually
they serve halal Muslim food.

00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:31.099
It's a little bit different

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:34.348
from the typical Filipino
spread of dishes.

00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:36.931
(upbeat music)

00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:48.898
This is just a place we
were just walking past

00:19:48.898 --> 00:19:52.182
and the food looked good,
so we just stopped here.

00:19:52.182 --> 00:19:55.432
We got some fish curries,
we got some chicken adobo,

00:19:55.432 --> 00:19:56.934
we got some beans,

00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:59.578
and a vegetable and coconut milk.

00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:00.475
All right.

00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:02.495
So this is a restaurant
where you just come

00:20:02.495 --> 00:20:03.735
and you pick and choose,
or a street food stall

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.484
where you just pick and choose.

00:20:05.484 --> 00:20:09.043
You have to lift the lid of
the pot to see what's inside.

00:20:09.043 --> 00:20:10.774
And then you just choose
whatever you like.

00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:12.774
Oh, another thing I should just explain

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:15.382
is that they put the
plastic bags over the plate

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.752
so then they don't need
to wash the plate, right.

00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:18.415
So then they just throw away,
when you're done eating,

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:19.907
they just throw away the plastic bags,

00:20:19.907 --> 00:20:23.196
then they can just use the plate again

00:20:23.196 --> 00:20:24.743
and just re-cover it.

00:20:24.743 --> 00:20:28.970
So although that is kind
of a lot of plastic bags,

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.337
it does ensure that you have a clean plate

00:20:31.337 --> 00:20:33.513
when you're eating, so.

00:20:33.513 --> 00:20:35.593
That's very common in the
Philippines that they do that.

00:20:35.593 --> 00:20:36.977
What should we start with?

00:20:36.977 --> 00:20:40.119
- I wanna start with,
chicken with a coconut.

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:42.476
- Yeah, that one is one
I really wanna try also.

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:44.745
That's like dried,

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:45.996
do you think it's dried coconut?

00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:47.345
- [Reby] I think so, right.

00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:49.845
- [Mark] Or is it just
like desiccated coconut.

00:20:49.845 --> 00:20:51.647
That's chicken, there's coconut and then

00:20:51.647 --> 00:20:55.480
there's also pieces of
chili in there as well.

00:20:56.702 --> 00:20:59.447
Just gonna take a piece of that chicken.

00:20:59.447 --> 00:21:01.197
Oh the chili's, yeah.

00:21:02.036 --> 00:21:03.524
- [Reby] You can have the chili.

00:21:03.524 --> 00:21:04.357
- Okay.

00:21:05.216 --> 00:21:07.196
All right, mix this with the rice.

00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:08.363
Oh that chili.

00:21:17.869 --> 00:21:19.062
Oh that's,

00:21:19.062 --> 00:21:20.932
that is fantastic.

00:21:20.932 --> 00:21:25.109
That is just pure, like
shredded old coconut,

00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:26.730
so it has a

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.772
a very meatiness to it.

00:21:28.772 --> 00:21:31.155
And that is spicy with those chilis.

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:32.606
It's also kinda peppery.

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:33.775
- [Reby] I got a nice pick,

00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:35.861
even though I didn't get chili.

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.394
- [Mark] These are red beans,

00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:40.227
cooked in like a stew with onions.

00:21:41.182 --> 00:21:44.099
- I don't think I've ever had this.

00:21:49.449 --> 00:21:52.032
- There might be some
coconut in there, too.

00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:53.449
Maybe, maybe not.

00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:55.524
- I'm not sure.

00:21:55.524 --> 00:21:58.724
- It has a little bit
of a fruity taste to it.

00:21:58.724 --> 00:22:00.644
And then that's just a good,

00:22:00.644 --> 00:22:01.688
beans are always wonderful.

00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:04.295
That's just a good like bean stew.

00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:05.990
You can taste all those
onions that have been cooked

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.094
down in there as well.

00:22:07.094 --> 00:22:08.013
All right, fish curry.

00:22:08.013 --> 00:22:11.430
There are chilis in here too, and onions.

00:22:14.562 --> 00:22:16.238
I'll add a little bit more of that.

00:22:16.238 --> 00:22:17.411
Do you think that's coconut milk?

00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:18.287
- [Reby] I think so.

00:22:18.287 --> 00:22:20.355
- Looks a little bit watery,

00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:22.855
but I think it's coconut milk.

00:22:25.325 --> 00:22:27.409
Oh that's wonderful.

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:29.579
It is coconut milk, but
it's kind of watery.

00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:33.015
It's not like very very thick, rich.

00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:35.606
And then, the fish is actually,

00:22:35.606 --> 00:22:37.722
the fish tastes quite fresh.

00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:40.323
And it's kinda silky smooth,

00:22:40.323 --> 00:22:42.506
and then I got a chili in
that bite and some onions.

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:43.893
- That's spicy.

00:22:43.893 --> 00:22:47.844
- [Mark] The next dish is
vegetables in a coconut milk.

00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:49.583
There's green beans in here, long beans.

00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:51.083
There are pumpkin.

00:22:54.324 --> 00:22:55.671
- [Reby] Ooh, there's squash.

00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:56.879
- [Mark] Oh is that squash or pumpkin?

00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:57.712
- [Reby] It's squash.

00:22:57.712 --> 00:22:59.818
- [Mark] It's squash, okay.

00:22:59.818 --> 00:23:01.171
There's squash in there.

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:03.635
Yeah, a piece of squash.

00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:05.597
A piece of squash, I'm going
for a piece of squash as well.

00:23:05.597 --> 00:23:06.658
Oh and there are some chilis

00:23:06.658 --> 00:23:08.461
floating around in the bottom as well.

00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:09.294
All right.

00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:17.431
That's just a,

00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:20.434
a mix of vegetables all wrapped up.

00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:23.034
It's kind of like a cross
between a soup and a sauce.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:24.284
But more soupy.

00:23:25.163 --> 00:23:27.362
And again, it's coconut milk, I think,

00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:28.607
but it's very light.

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:30.278
It's not like a very
rich thick coconut milk.

00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:33.413
It's more of a, a soupy
watery coconut milk.

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.049
Which gives it a,

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:37.059
kind of a light and refreshing flavor.

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:40.892
And the last dish we got
is the chicken adobo.

00:23:41.949 --> 00:23:44.116
That was that adobo sauce.

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:47.791
Are those all onions in there?

00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:48.978
Oh, there is some chilis,

00:23:48.978 --> 00:23:50.093
there are some chilis in there.

00:23:50.093 --> 00:23:50.926
Excellent.

00:23:53.737 --> 00:23:54.570
- [Reby] This is awesome.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.820
They have these everywhere.

00:23:58.409 --> 00:23:59.242
- Oh yeah.

00:24:01.825 --> 00:24:03.267
That's pretty salty.

00:24:03.267 --> 00:24:04.100
And,

00:24:05.058 --> 00:24:06.939
you can really mostly just taste the soy.

00:24:06.939 --> 00:24:09.378
I don't, it's not very sour
like some other versions

00:24:09.378 --> 00:24:12.188
of adobo that I've had, mostly just salty.

00:24:12.188 --> 00:24:13.933
So it can really range,
adobo, from sour to less sour?

00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:15.171
- Oh yeah, definitely.

00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:16.004
- Okay.

00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:17.817
- And there's even,

00:24:17.817 --> 00:24:22.725
in some regions where adobo
is dry, there's no sauce.

00:24:22.725 --> 00:24:23.558
- Okay.

00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:25.672
- So it really varies on
which region it's coming from.

00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:26.505
- Okay.

00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:30.019
Everything is good.

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:31.637
But, I've really gotta give it up

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:34.490
for that chicken with
the shredded coconut.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.903
And we were just talking with the owner,

00:24:35.903 --> 00:24:38.601
and this food is from the
south of the Philippines,

00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.749
in Mindanao, the island,

00:24:40.749 --> 00:24:42.956
what was the name of the region?

00:24:42.956 --> 00:24:44.115
- I'm gonna get it wrong.

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:47.782
(speaking foreign language)

00:24:51.197 --> 00:24:52.222
- Marawi.

00:24:52.222 --> 00:24:53.055
- Marawi.

00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:56.939
- Okay, so the region of
this food is from Marawi.

00:24:56.939 --> 00:24:57.801
- In Mindanao.

00:24:57.801 --> 00:24:58.806
- In Mindanao.

00:24:58.806 --> 00:25:03.766
So it does have some similarities
with Indonesian food.

00:25:03.766 --> 00:25:07.208
The taste, with Indonesian
food or even Malay,

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:09.240
Malay Peninsula food.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.238
It's really really good.

00:25:10.238 --> 00:25:12.469
I like it, I like the
extra chilis in there,

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:13.944
and the coconut milk.

00:25:13.944 --> 00:25:15.743
And she did say there's also
coconut milk in the beans?

00:25:15.743 --> 00:25:16.576
- [Reby] Yes.

00:25:16.576 --> 00:25:17.877
- There is, so it does
have a coconut milk taste,

00:25:17.877 --> 00:25:19.960
if you taste those beans.

00:25:23.092 --> 00:25:25.794
Yeah, it's like an aftertaste
of coconut milk for me.

00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:29.461
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:33.502 --> 00:25:35.664
That was absolutely delicious.

00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:37.460
What a stunning meal.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.052
And I am pretty full after that meal.

00:25:40.052 --> 00:25:44.021
Oh, this has been a fantastic
food tour in Quezon City.

00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:47.253
I'm gonna go ahead and end
this Quezon City food tour

00:25:47.253 --> 00:25:48.782
in metro Manila.

00:25:48.782 --> 00:25:51.273
I wanna say a big thank you to Reby

00:25:51.273 --> 00:25:52.796
for showing me around,

00:25:52.796 --> 00:25:55.046
for eating with me as well.

00:25:56.016 --> 00:25:57.148
That was a lotta fun.

00:25:57.148 --> 00:25:59.066
- Thanks, I'm so full.

00:25:59.066 --> 00:26:00.392
- I think my favorite thing,

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.152
okay, that last meal that we just had,

00:26:02.152 --> 00:26:05.396
that Mindanao food was excellent.

00:26:05.396 --> 00:26:06.895
The Isaw was good.

00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:09.748
- Yes, my first time eating it.

00:26:09.748 --> 00:26:11.828
- Your first time eating it, cool.

00:26:11.828 --> 00:26:13.355
And now she's a convert, she loves it.

00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:14.317
- I do.

00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:16.190
- And also probably the
most fascinating thing

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.259
of the day was that rotisserie chicken.

00:26:18.259 --> 00:26:19.267
I loved it.

00:26:19.267 --> 00:26:21.078
I loved that homemade rotisserie.

00:26:21.078 --> 00:26:22.975
But that was a lot of good food,

00:26:22.975 --> 00:26:24.691
and just good to hang out.

00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:28.139
And especially I enjoy this local market

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:29.409
here in Quezon City.

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:31.099
Thank you all again
