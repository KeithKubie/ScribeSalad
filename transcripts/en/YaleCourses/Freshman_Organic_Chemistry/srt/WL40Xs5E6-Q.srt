1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay,
let's get started.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,180
So last time we looked at uh,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,220
methane and ammonia and saw something
interesting about molecular orbitals,

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,660
we could give them the same name
as atomic orbitals. That is, if we,

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:23,661
and especially if we look at a low
electron density contour of the molecular

6
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,554
orbitals,

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
we see that what it looks like is an Adam
where the nucleus is split into pieces

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,540
right now that splitting into pieces
dis changes the potential energy for the

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,030
electron.
So you expect that to distort the orbital.

10
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,930
The electrons will move in the directions
that pieces of the nucleus of gone.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,480
But then in addition to potential
energy control in the shape of orbitals,

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,490
kinetic energy also does, and that's
the same thing as it is in an Adam.

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,850
You have a thing with no nodes thing with
one node a and when you have one node,

14
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,990
you can have either a spherical node
or a planer node, and the plane,

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,360
there can be three planar nodes. So two
s and three two p's. You have the same,

16
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:11,830
the same,

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,260
exactly the same considerations apply in
a molecular orbitals and atomic orbital.

18
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,340
You have the kinetic energy, which comes
with curvature, which comes with nodes.

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,260
Now as you split the, the nucleus up
and pull pieces in different directions,

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,220
it doesn't have the same symmetry it had
when it was all together in the nucleus

21
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,220
as spherical kind of symmetry.
So the nodes get distorted,

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,050
but still you can see them there.

23
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:39,051
And we saw them last time and went through
all the occupied and vacant valence

24
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:44,091
orbitals of ammonia and methane and saw
how they looked like atomic orbitals.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,330
This not surprisingly,
because it's so fundamental,

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,530
the potential energy to kinetic
energy applies to every system.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,240
It applies to you, viewed
as a single atom, right?

28
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:01,020
With a Zillion electrons.
Okay. But anyway,

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,380
but pieces of moved around. So
the, so the orbitals change,

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,190
we'll look at a more at
two more complicated cases
and then we'll get onto a

31
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,020
different way of looking at bonding.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,710
So we'll look at ethane and
methanol and we use, uh,

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,570
W I didn't tell you last time explicitly
where I got the molecular orbitals from.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,060
I got them from my laptop.
There's a program,

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,300
that particular one is called
Spartan that I use. And it,

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,150
it calculates what molecular orbitals
look like using approximate molecular

37
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,930
orbital. That is, uh, uh,
Schrodinger equation kind of theory.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,090
Okay? So let's just look at the
ones of ethane and methanol. Now,

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,600
both of these have seven
pairs of valence electrons.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,170
There are also a core electrons.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,140
And if we were looking at the
orbitals for all the electrons,

42
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:53,080
we didn't include those and
exactly how we're going to, uh,

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,800
count those.
You could do it one way or the other,

44
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,220
whether you consider the core electrons,
the one that's electrons,

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,560
just be part of the nucleus and then
treat the rest as the electrons you're

46
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,060
interested in, or whether you, uh,

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,710
whether you want to count the core
electrons to, you can do it either way.

48
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,150
But what you analogize,

49
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,630
the what depends on whether you count
them as part of the Nuclei airport.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,380
It's only how we're going to compare
these molecular orbitals to the atomic

51
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:21,460
orbitals of are gone,
which has also seven electron pairs.

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,730
Okay? So, so there's, uh,
the two s orbital. I'm going
to start with that because,

53
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,270
because I'm going to pretend that that
red part is the core, that there's,

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,900
there's a one s which is core electrons.
But in this case,

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,000
here's my pedantic note on this subject,
which I just added. So if you have to,

56
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
before we had just one heavy Adam
carbon and methane nitrogen in ammonia,

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,220
right? So there was one, one s orbital.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,830
Right now we have two heavy atoms,
carbon and carbon, and methane,

59
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,230
carbon and oxygen,
and methanol.

60
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,410
So they're too heavy atoms and
therefore to a boring core orbitals.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,630
So for purposes of making analogies,

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,980
we'll use the atomic one s orbital,
uh,

63
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,930
of the Adam that were
analogizing things to,

64
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,310
to stand for all the molecular
core orbitals. You can do
it any way you want to.

65
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,930
We're not really interested in that.
We're interested in the valence Arbuckle.

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,030
So whether I start with the one s or the
two s depends on how I'm handling the

67
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,860
core electrons is not a big deal.
Anyhow,

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,860
let's pretend it's the two s of Argon
here and we're going to compare it with

69
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:34,780
this lowest valence level
molecular orbital of, uh,

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,770
of ethane.
Now we can wrote,

71
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,820
as I do this on the left side of the,
of the pictures,

72
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:47,821
I'm going to show one view
and then because it's more
complicated than a methane

73
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,200
and methane and ammonia,

74
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,620
where I'm going to also show a
picture rotated by 90 degrees.

75
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,510
So I'm going to rotate around that axis.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,930
And on the right I'll show a different
view of the same orbital. Okay?

77
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,590
So that's the lowest valence
level molecular orbital of ethane.

78
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,300
And it's not very exciting.
It's just a distorted sphere.

79
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,750
And you can see the way in which is
the store to this distorted vertically

80
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,030
because the two carbons are pulled apart.

81
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,400
So it's got sort of a narrow waist to it.

82
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,510
And then it's pulled out
where each of the protons, uh,

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,310
left the Middle Adam to, to come
out and, and be hydrogens. Okay.

84
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,780
Now if we look at, at a methanol,
it'll be a little different.

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,640
Can you anticipate how it might be
different if on the bottom we'll have ch

86
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:38,560
three again, but on the top instead of
having ch three we're going to have o h.

87
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,860
How do you think it might be
different in the way it looks?

88
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,830
It might be skewed more
towards the, Ooh, Jesus.

89
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,670
Okay,
so oxygen has a bigger nuclear charge,

90
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,070
so that's going to pull the lowest
energy orbital toward the oxygen.

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,470
That'll be one thing. We expect it
to be big, bigger, a top heavy. Okay.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,830
What else about how the top,
we'll look.

93
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,050
How will it be different from
if it were a ch three yeah,

94
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,680
I can't hear very well.
Oxygen has lone pairs.

95
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:16,700
Now how is that going to change thing or
another way of saying the same thing as

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,870
has only one hydrogen up there. How's
that going to change it do you think?

97
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,490
Can speak, you have to speak up.
It's not going to be a symmetrical.

98
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,010
Which way is it going to be distorted?
To be unsymmetrical,

99
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,640
you have to speak up
toward the electron pair to just say,

100
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,500
I couldn't hear away from hydrogen.
Well,

101
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,030
how about the Proton goes out?

102
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,300
Does it bring electrons with it or
does it repel electrons? The Proton

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,730
speak up. It pulls. So it should
distort toward the hydrogen.

104
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,720
So here's what it looks like,
right? The top, it's top heavy,

105
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:57,560
as Angela said, and it's
distorted out toward the hydrogen.

106
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,900
There are no protons
pulling it to the top left.

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,810
And you see the same thing end on
there at the, uh, on the right. Uh,

108
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,970
okay. This is the next door
battle. What does that look like?

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,510
Obviously you can peak
in the middle and see,

110
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,800
it's obviously a two PZ orbital
with the node across the middle.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Okay. In both cases, now the,
the, the ethane cases symmetrical,

112
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,100
the other cases unsymmetrical.
Why is it unsymmetrical?

113
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,870
Because the first orbital pull
the electrons to the top, right?

114
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,810
So the next in the next door battle,

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,020
electrons aren't going to want to be at
the top so much because they're going to

116
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,610
be repelled by the other electron.

117
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,060
So there'll be more toward the bottom
because the first ones went to the top.

118
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,260
Okay. Uh, okay. Then here's, here's a,

119
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,180
here's the next door. But you can see
there their energies marching up here.

120
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:55,181
The lowest one was asked then to PCT
and how to p x a law if we define the

121
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,230
horizontal axis here on the
left is the x axis. So again,

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,560
it's what you expect and it's pulled out
stretched vertically from being a dumb

123
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,790
bell by where the nuclei went.
Uh,

124
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,200
and here's a two p y which we can see
more clearly on the right perpendicular to

125
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,840
the two px. Okay. And, um,

126
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,260
notice obvious that it's
obviously so that the,

127
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,340
the methanol orbital will be less
symmetric in all cases than the one for,

128
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
for ethane.

129
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,070
But still we can recognize the
nodes because they must go that way.

130
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,170
It must be a no nodes,

131
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,910
one node of three different
kinds and so on. Okay.

132
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:42,911
Now this is three s you notice it has
the node that we don't see the one that's

133
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,240
down near the nuclei, right? In fact,

134
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:51,080
two nodes down near the nuclei,
one for each of the heavy atoms,

135
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,340
but then this now has another,
uh,

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,150
spherical or approximately
spherical nodes.

137
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,820
So we have that extra red lump
in the middle. On the top.

138
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:03,570
We're blue in the middle.
Just just to review.

139
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,810
What's the difference between red and
blue on the top of the computer decided to

140
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,870
draw it with red in the middle on the
bottom and decided to draw it with blue in

141
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,700
the middle. What do, what do
those colors mean? Yeah, Kathy.

142
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,480
They mean positive and negative.
So which one is right?

143
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,210
Should it be positive in the
middle or negative in the middle.

144
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,770
Positive as a guest.
Wilson would you say why not?

145
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,530
Not really positive or negative. It's
just a different phase. Yeah, it's,

146
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
it's the sign of the wave function,

147
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,630
but you can multiply the wave function
by minus one any constant and it's just

148
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,710
as good as bad as before.

149
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,850
So it's arbitrary and the computer
was arbitrary and choosing the colors.

150
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,660
Okay. I think there's actually a function
that I could've changed that if I had

151
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,400
thought to do so.
So they'd be the same.

152
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:58,320
But actually it tells a story if I
leave them different. Okay. So here's,

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,470
here's the next one. Now this
is, if you look on the left,

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,420
now it's more clear where the
nodes are that that's a d, F,

155
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:06,510
z orbital.

156
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
The name x z means that the product of
x and z appears in the wave function,

157
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,650
right?
So when both x and z are positive,

158
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,580
then the product is positive
on the top right? Red,

159
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,920
right when the,
when x is negative and Z as positive,

160
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,390
the top left, it's negative,
the product. So that's why,

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,500
that's why it has the name x,
Z. Okay? And there's D, Y, Z,

162
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,900
which you see on the
right turn 90 degrees.

163
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,660
And here's the Dz squared,

164
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:47,390
which is that thing that has a donut
that goes around the middle, right? What?

165
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,090
It's hard to see the donut. Can
you see it? It's blue on top.

166
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,760
You can easily see the
red on the top left,

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,740
which is the what's blue in the middle,
right? The sign has changed, right?

168
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,850
But the doughnut is highly distorted
because as you go around first,

169
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,610
Proton on the top pulls it up than a
proton in the bottom, pulls it down,

170
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,430
then up down.
So it's like a crown.

171
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,730
That donut has been made
into a crown around the end,

172
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:15,870
right by the protons pulling it that way.
Okay.

173
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,500
Then here's a the the three peasy.

174
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,840
So it has the horizontal nodal plane,

175
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,940
but also it has a spherical node,
which you can see in either picture.

176
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:31,770
Really. Okay. Then here's
the three p why orbital,

177
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,450
which again has that spherical node,

178
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:38,100
but now the Planar node or approximately
planar node is vertical instead of

179
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,580
horizontal. So that, so let's
say on the top right there,

180
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,000
you have red on the right
and blue on the left,

181
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,080
there's a vertical node over which
changes sign going right to left.

182
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,930
Or here's the three p x,

183
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,250
or here's the three d x,
y,

184
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,860
which you don't see so well here, a o l
a but if you turned it down you would,

185
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:07,210
and here's the three d x squared
minus y squared, which again,

186
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,680
to see it,
well you have,

187
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,990
you'd have to turn it and
here's the four f orbital.

188
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,910
So you can see,

189
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,380
especially say on the in the top ones
compared with the atomic orbital that it's

190
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,490
exactly the same general pattern of nodes,
slightly distorted.

191
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,560
And incidentally, the, the uh, member,

192
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:32,350
all the n equals whatever n equals three.

193
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,840
All the orbitals had
the same energy before.

194
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,330
Now they don't have all the same energy.

195
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,320
Notice that they all have
different energies. None of
them are degenerate. Why?

196
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,880
Because that if you
broke the nucleus apart,

197
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,390
how stable a thing that
has that general shape,

198
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:51,940
like a dumbbell or a
cloverleaf or something,

199
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,730
how stable the electrons are in those,

200
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,740
in those lumps depends on whether
a proton got pulled into the lump.

201
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,670
If there happens to be a proton
in the lump where kinetic energy,

202
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:07,720
the node pattern wants it to be,
then that'll be unusually stable.

203
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,310
If the protons had been pulled someplace
where there is a node because of

204
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:15,130
kinetic energy,
then it won't be stabilized.

205
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
So that breaks the degeneracy
of these different,

206
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,050
different patterns that have
the same number of nodes.
That depends on where the,

207
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,520
how the potential energy changed. Okay.
Now, just finally and very quickly,

208
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,270
I want to look at one flouro ethanol,
which is a molecule that would have,

209
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,420
I think, no stability at all, but
you can put it into the, I mean,

210
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:37,060
as a practical matter,
you're never going to put it in a bottle,

211
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,570
but you can easily put it into the
computer and calculate what its molecular

212
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:44,380
orbitals would look like. And I did
it to show you something that's very,

213
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:49,240
very unsymmetrical and has Adam's
a very different nuclear charge.

214
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,320
Okay, so what will the very, very,

215
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:57,970
very lowest orbital look like,
do you think? For this thing,

216
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,910
it has, uh, a fluorine and oxygen,

217
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,300
two carbons and five hydrogens.
So what do you,

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,190
if you were an electron and you had
that set of nuclei arranged this way,

219
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,000
where would you want to go,
Elizabeth? Very nice. The left,

220
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:17,350
especially around the three. Now, what
would the very, very, very lowest,

221
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:21,850
and it should be more toward the left and,
and really close to the flooring.

222
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:26,851
It would be a one s orbital and mostly
on fluorine because that's where most of

223
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:30,790
the protons are, the most concentrated
Proton. So let's look, there's,

224
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
there's a smaller scale ball model so
that we can see really small orbitals and

225
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,770
there that's,
you're absolutely right.

226
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,560
It's the one s or it's
essentially the one s orbital.

227
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,480
A fluorine is the very lowest orbital.

228
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,730
What would be next if you were
suppose this was, you came up in,

229
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:53,090
this seat was already taken. Now where
would you go? The next electron, Zack.

230
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,150
Oxygen to the oxygen cause that's the
next highest concentration of protons.

231
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,480
And next,
where are we going next?

232
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,560
Steve, what do you say that the
one s of fluorine has taken?

233
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,830
The one s of oxygen is taken.
Where are we want to go next?

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Pardon me. Oh, which carbon?

235
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,503
Why

236
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,940
and what does the proximity
have to do with it?

237
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,460
That the proximity means that the,
the, that the electrons that are on,

238
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:36,300
that Adam will have been drawn toward,

239
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:37,980
and we'll talk about this more later.

240
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,250
We'll have been drawn toward
the fluorine and the oxygen,

241
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,960
therefore that Adam will have fewer
electrons are lower electron density.

242
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,450
Right? Therefore, it's a better place
for other electrons to go. Okay.

243
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,130
So you'd expect the next one to be the
middle of carbon. Right. And finally,

244
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:58,170
of course,
it's going to be the second carbon,

245
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,640
the one that's remote from the
electronegative high nuclear charge Adams.

246
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,710
Okay. Now, now we've done all the one
ss, so we can look at what's interesting,

247
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:10,980
the valence or, but also the ones that
are going to be involved in bonding.

248
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:15,760
These don't have anything
to do with bonding. Okay. So
there's the first one. Does,

249
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:19,800
uh, uh, uh, Russell told me
something about the shape of
this. Does it surprise you?

250
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,580
Yeah,

251
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,580
it has no nodes except it actually has
little nodes down near the nucleus cause

252
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:32,580
it's actually more like a two s
orbital in that respect. Okay.

253
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:33,990
Because of the core electrons.

254
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,020
So it has tiny nodes that we
don't see around the nuclei,

255
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,480
but it has no nodes within the valence
big orbitals that we're looking at.

256
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:47,370
So it's like an s orbital.
Right. And it's big where the,

257
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,990
where the nuclear charge as big as
you say. Okay. What's the next one?

258
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:52,824
Gonna look like?

259
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,143
Any ideas?

260
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,200
Pardon me? Toward the oxygen.
Will it also have no nodes?

261
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,170
No. The next highest
orbital has to have a node.

262
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,070
Where do you think the node will be? What
orbital would that look like? Sort of,

263
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,440
it'll be highly distorted. But what
if this is the s orbital? Right?

264
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,580
What's gonna be next?

265
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,420
Oh,
Elizabeth.

266
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,550
It's as if it switched. But
with the Planar node. Let's see.

267
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,000
Right, right. So the first one
was, you were right, Russell,

268
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:40,260
that this one should be big on oxygen, but
notice that, hey, it's like a p orbital.

269
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:44,190
It has that horizontal node
because it's higher kinetic energy.

270
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,840
Okay. And then this one
that's on the carbons, right?

271
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,760
Mostly, but it's a p why it
has a vertical node. Right?

272
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:58,200
So it's negative, say on the fluorine
and oxygen and positive on the carbons.

273
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,820
Or if we rotate this one
around a horizontal access
to look at it from the side,

274
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,600
it looks like that. And you can see
that it's a p y kind of orbital.

275
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,650
Well, Elizabeth,
technically pure business,

276
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,120
right? We are. We're just
saying there are, now

277
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,200
there are analogous to p orbitals
because it has to be the same.

278
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,760
The orbitals must go in order
of the number of nodes, right?

279
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:24,950
So the same thing as in
an Adam or into molecule.

280
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:28,700
You go from no nodes to one node and
there are three ways of getting one node

281
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:33,701
spherical or distorted sphere planes
or distorted planes if the nuclei are

282
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:39,110
pulled around, so on. So they're, they're
really very much likely atomic orbitals.

283
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,660
Okay.
Or this one.

284
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,370
Now that's an interesting one
because that's like a hybrid orbital.

285
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,760
It looks like the orbital up here.
It's a mixture of s with p.

286
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,860
Everybody see how that is.

287
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:55,430
It's a big sort of blue lobe on the
top and a small red wood on the bottom.

288
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,190
And also the next one is the other one,

289
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,230
the hybrid that points
the other direction.

290
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,010
Another combination of the
s and p that points down.

291
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,830
Okay. And then this one, it
looks like d x, y again, right?

292
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:14,470
It's sort of a cloverleaf with two nodes.
Okay.

293
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:18,010
So that's all I want to do with that
and we won't go any further with it.

294
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,310
This is just an interesting
way of looking at how,

295
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
how molecular molecular orbitals are
really just like atomic orbitals and have

296
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,190
energies for the same reason,

297
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,090
except the potential energy gets screwed
up by breaking the nucleus and pulling

298
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:34,650
pieces around, but in an
understandable way. And the,

299
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,490
the nodes get distorted
because of this. Okay. Now, uh,

300
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,470
now we're getting into really the w w
we just looked at this view of at the

301
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,090
single United atom view,

302
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,780
but the other view is the one that's
going to be more generalizable.

303
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,680
And that's the one where we
looked at bonding, right?

304
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,450
So you have to probe a little harder to
get a qualitative understanding of what

305
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,650
chemical bonds are.

306
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,910
And that's where we're going to do now
by choosing a higher contour it with

307
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:08,320
which to look at a molecule.
Now, true molecular orbitals,

308
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,910
to the extent that orbitals
are true altogether, why
aren't they true altogether?

309
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,050
Why aren't orbitals true altogether?

310
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,343
Yeah.

311
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
Does he have many electrons? You can't
have independent electrons, right?

312
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:29,610
You can't have orbitals but
we're approximating thing
by orbitals trying to take

313
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,840
or electron interaction into account
in a sort of a lefthanded way by

314
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,000
self-consistent field
or something like that.

315
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,960
Because it's much easier if we can
divide the whole into a bunch of parts,

316
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,610
each of which we can understand.

317
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,520
So to the extent that
molecular orbitals are true,

318
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:49,120
the kinds of things I've just been
showing you calculated with laptop, uh,

319
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,800
they extend over the whole
molecule. They're not local, right?

320
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,790
Except like the one s of
fluorine was local, right?

321
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,730
But mostly they're there
go over the whole molecule.

322
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,970
But bonds are thought of and has have
always been thought of as interaction

323
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,870
between pairs of Adams.

324
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,200
So we want to divide things
completely differently.

325
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:15,940
And look at the bonds now at Pairwise Llc,

326
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,790
a Oh molecular orbitals.

327
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,910
Now what's an Lca?
Oh,

328
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:26,620
it's a sum or a linear combination,
right?

329
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,180
A weighted sum of atomic orbitals.
So here's an example,

330
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,370
PSI, which is an orbital. What's that?

331
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:37,720
A function of position of what?
One Electron.

332
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:41,710
So it's a function of x one y one Z one
we're talking just about electron one.

333
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,900
So the wave function for electron one we
say is one over the square root of two

334
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,560
times one atomic orbital plus
another atomic orbital right?

335
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,550
Now, have you ever seen adding
orbitals like that before?

336
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,450
That's what hybridization is.
We added an s and P,

337
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,830
but this is different because
when we added SNP before,

338
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,840
they were on the same nucleus and we
did it to get a new orbital for that

339
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:15,460
particular nucleus for that Adam,
right to distort it one way or the other,

340
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:18,040
for example, or to rotate
a p orbital. Right?

341
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,110
But this is very different because we're
adding orbitals that are on different

342
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:26,890
nuclei. A nucleus, a a nucleus. Be.

343
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,330
See the difference

344
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,320
adding is just the way functions are
numbers. We just add the numbers.

345
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,720
But in the first case,
hybridization,

346
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:42,490
those two functions were on the same
nucleus. Now they're on different nuclei.

347
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,370
What? We're heading together. Okay.

348
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Now why is it sensible to think that you
might get pairwise molecular orbitals

349
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,550
that can be expressed like this?

350
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,990
How do you interpret an orbital Corey?

351
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,560
What good is an orbital?
What do you use it for?

352
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,643
Yeah,

353
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,420
but what?
So what do you use it for?

354
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,363
Great.

355
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
And how do you get probability
from the wave function?

356
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:19,490
You have the wave function. How do you get
the probability density? You Square it.

357
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,390
So do you see why we have a one
over the square root of two in this

358
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,240
plus when we square it,

359
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:30,890
that's going to be a half and we're
going to get a half of atomic orbital,

360
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,820
a squared and of atomic orbital B squared.

361
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,500
So it's a half of each of them.

362
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,500
That's why they have the one over
the square root of two. So let's,

363
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,430
let's go on with this.

364
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:45,431
Suppose we have a hydrogen molecule
and suppose that the nuclei at a great

365
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,170
distance from one another so far,

366
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:51,980
they don't interact or
negligible interaction.

367
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,360
They're very far apart.

368
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,470
What would you expect the
one elect the lowest energy,

369
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,810
one electron wave function to look like?

370
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,350
The one possibility is that the electron
could sit exactly halfway between the

371
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,730
two nuclei. Right. Is
that a reasonable place?

372
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:14,150
Is that the low energy place for
it to be? Lucas, what'd he say?

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,610
The attic probability density
there is not the greatest thing.

374
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,460
Why not? Why shouldn't
the electron sit? Right?

375
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:27,220
It's the two nuclei are this far apart.
And I don't mean to angst terms apart.

376
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,470
I mean two meters apart.
There's a proton here in a proton here.

377
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,160
Is the electron most likely to
be here and halfway between? No.

378
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,790
Where would it be most likely
rolling year to one of the two atoms.

379
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,870
And which of the two,

380
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,160
suppose you took the long view,

381
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,870
suppose you averaged it over,
uh,

382
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,720
18 zillion millennia time average.

383
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:58,670
Sometimes it would be near this one.
Sometimes it would be near this one. Okay.

384
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,680
What would it be if you
took a really long view?

385
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,550
Both and half here and half here.

386
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,760
So the wave function,
when you square it,

387
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:13,220
you want it to be half looking like
this Adam and half looking like this,

388
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,670
Adam. Then you see the
time average, right?

389
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:20,330
It might take a long time to achieve
that average because it take a long time

390
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:24,950
for the electron to tunnel two
meters. Right? But in the very,

391
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:28,160
very long time it would look like that.
So we know what we want it to look like.

392
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,370
What we want is that
the probability density,

393
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:35,780
the square of this one electron wave
function should look half of the time,

394
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,120
like the atomic orbital,

395
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,920
a squared and half of the time like atomic
orbital B squared. So on time average,

396
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,070
it's half of one and half of the other.
Everybody with me?

397
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,890
So that's what the s yeah,
Nate.

398
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,620
Well, because I'm telling
you what it looks like.

399
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,850
It's got to look half like
this and half like this, right?

400
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,730
So the square of it has to be this.

401
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,620
So all we have to do to find
the wave function is what
if we know what square is?

402
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,230
All we got to do is take the square root
and we've got the wave function. Bingo.

403
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,610
There's the square root,

404
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,890
right? So that is a reasonable
way to write the wave function.

405
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:26,490
One over the square root of
two times atomic orbital,

406
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:29,580
Aa plus atomic orbital be clarity.
You have a question?

407
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,060
Just like a bracket is two things.

408
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:46,061
Inside the sprouts you have four things
that come out of distributing 100 you

409
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,230
can't just put the squares.

410
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,510
Okay, now Clara, you're
going to help me out.

411
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,160
How big is that? That's a number.
It's the product of a top. What?

412
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,220
Atomic orbital a assigns numbers
everywhere in space. Everywhere in space.

413
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,880
Atomic orbital be assigns
numbers everywhere in space.

414
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,830
So at some point in space,

415
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,100
atomic orbital be assigns a number and
atomic orbital a assigns a number and a

416
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:24,050
times B is the product of those two
numbers. How big is that product?

417
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,490
How big is atomic orbital?
A here?

418
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,210
This a meter away from the
Proton. Great. And how,

419
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,110
how big is the atomic orbital be there?
Great.

420
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
Now how big is atomic
orbital a here? Great. Okay,

421
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,970
so now how big an error do we
make if we neglect a times B,

422
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,550
where do we make an error?
Do we make an error here?

423
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,970
Do we make an error here? Do
we make an error here? Yes. No,

424
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,740
we make an error. Yeah, sure enough,
we make an error. How big is the error?

425
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,750
Uh, it's, it's negligible.
Does, it's a great distance.

426
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,350
Okay,
so at great distance we can forget that.

427
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,500
So now it's easier to take
the square root, right?

428
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,003
Okay.

429
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,240
The Old Fox up here,
Huh?

430
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,913
Okay.

431
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,330
Okay.

432
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,950
Now your problem is what happens if
h two is that the bonding distance,

433
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:35,810
what if they're only an onstream apart?
Now there should be a problem, right?

434
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:40,640
Because because a times B is not going
to be negligible everywhere. Now,

435
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,330
okay, so now that's going to come
back. So now we got an error, right?

436
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,020
Or do we?
Let's think what that does.

437
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,820
Okay,

438
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,500
so if we approximate the molecular orbital
as a sum of atomic orbitals this way,

439
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,710
then it looks very good near
the nuclei because near a,

440
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,580
it looks like a near B,
it looks like B.

441
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,260
And if we want a square it to find
the electron density we do at this at.

442
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,070
But if we then subtract what the
Adams would give for electron density,

443
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:26,051
now what does this remind you of where
we look at the total electron density and

444
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:30,740
subtract the Adams? This.
So we're actually looking
for the difference density.

445
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,220
Everybody with me on this.
So we're going to subtract the Adams,

446
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,450
which is one half a squared
and a half B squared, right?

447
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,540
If we subtract, what do we get? What
we get for a difference density,

448
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,320
we get a times B.

449
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,870
So we get the difference.
Electron density,

450
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
which is due to overlap.
And what do I mean by overlap?

451
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I mean that is only important in regions
where both of them have a finite value,

452
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,700
right? The product of a and B is
negligible. If a is zero, it's negligible.

453
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:11,070
If B is very, very small, right?
So it's only where they overlapped,

454
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:15,790
the two functions have simultaneous
values that you care, okay?

455
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,650
Now that thing,
the thing that's that the bonding,

456
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,880
the difference,
density is really a byproduct.

457
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,000
That's a little bit of a pun
because it's a product, right?

458
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,630
But it's a byproduct of squaring the
sum of what player didn't like about it.

459
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,350
So the very thing you didn't like is
what's going to give rise to bonding

460
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,440
density in that.
Neat.

461
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,530
Okay? But notice that here
we're multiplying a times B,

462
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,850
but this is completely different instance
of multiplying from what we had before.

463
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,631
Right?

464
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:56,830
Before we multiplied two orbitals to
try to get a two electron wave function.

465
00:30:56,831 --> 00:31:00,490
This has nothing to do with this because
both of these are functions of the same

466
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,091
electron.

467
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:06,091
It's like one electron that we're
squaring here that so this a times B,

468
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,990
this product is overlap
comes from the squaring.

469
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,370
It was when we squared it
that we got that. Okay.

470
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,880
Now, because we have this extra
term, we have not only one,

471
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,750
half a squared plus B squared,
which would sell,

472
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,260
what would the probability of that,

473
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,670
what's the probability of a squared summed
over all space or integrated if it's

474
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:35,671
normalized and this one and what's this
whole quantity one because of the half,

475
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,840
but actually we've got bigger than that,
right?

476
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,080
Because we added the overlap term to it,
right?

477
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,150
So it's actually not going to be a half.

478
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,370
It'll have to be something
a little less than a half.

479
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,210
So that will sum up to one if
we want to normalize it. Okay,

480
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,930
so they're going to be those
less than a half's there. Okay.

481
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,180
Now what does that do? That
shifts electron density, right?

482
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:05,980
We're taking electron density away from
where the nuclei are from a square and

483
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:09,130
be square,
and where is the electron density going?

484
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,820
Because we're using less than
a half to begin with, right?

485
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:16,030
We're taking electron density away.
There's going to be,

486
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,260
we're subtracting more than was
there at the beginning, right?

487
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,440
Which means that we're going
to have negative electron
density in the difference

488
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,280
map. Electrons are going away from
the Adams. Where are they going to?

489
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,290
Into the region where there's overlap,
right?

490
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,410
So they go away from there
into the overlap region.

491
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,160
So this is just like what we
were seeing with X-ray. Okay?

492
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,420
So that overlap the a times B
term is what creates bonding.

493
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,830
And we've seen this before.
Remember when you have wells far apart,

494
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,870
the the wave function is a sum of the
two. We saw this in one dimension, right?

495
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,260
But if they come close together, you get
a wave function that looks like that,

496
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,250
which we looked before just from the
point of view of the energy and saw that

497
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:04,340
that would stabilize the particle
because it's got less curvature,

498
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,320
less kinetic energy,
right?

499
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,270
But also the electron density
grows in the middle, right?

500
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:14,870
So from the point of view of the
electron distribution, that was whole.

501
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,200
That was the glue holding
the atoms together.

502
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,060
So it's held together both because the
energy goes down and because you put this

503
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:27,830
glue in the middle, which is what
causes the energy to go down. Okay?

504
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,920
So that's bonding.
And remember we also had this,

505
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,770
so as the energy went up in the middle,

506
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:37,070
when the energy is lower here
than it was in the atoms apart.

507
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,320
So you the the,
so the nuclei push one another apart.

508
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,440
Now without the glue in the middle.
And that was anti-bonding.

509
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,130
So we've seen it before in one dimension,

510
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:49,760
but it's true in three dimensions as well.
Now let's think about this again.

511
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,140
So here's, here's a, here's Adam a. Now,

512
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,190
where is the square of
that function significant?

513
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,760
Is that significant there? No. Is it,

514
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,830
is it significant there? Yeah, it's a
little bit significant. At least there's,

515
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,180
how about there?

516
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,430
A little bit, right? Okay.

517
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,980
Now suppose we have another
atomic orbital there.

518
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:22,250
Now where is the product
significant of a Times B.

519
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,420
Okay. So is the product a
times B significant there?

520
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,470
No. Uh, is it significant there?

521
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,210
Nick? What do you say? Why not

522
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,680
speak up small?
What's very small?

523
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,820
The value of a no, no. The value of a,

524
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:53,610
there is something we said that before
when we were looking only a day.

525
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:58,020
It's not very big, but
there's a significant value.
But how about the product,

526
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,920
Josh?
The value of B is very small there.

527
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:06,240
So the product is going to be very
small. How about, how about there?

528
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,410
Oh, now they're equal in there
halfway between their equal.

529
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:15,330
So both of them are a little bit small,
but their product is still significant.

530
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,290
Right?
Only in this region where they overlap.

531
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,800
Is that product significant?
Okay.

532
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,390
So at the center notice that
a, the Cya, the numbers,

533
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,660
Cya signs and the numbers.
Ib Siberia signs are the same number.

534
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,960
So two times CYA CIB is as large
as CIA squared plus diabetes,

535
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,580
right? Cause CIA time CIB
is the same as Cya squared.

536
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,900
So the electron density is nearly doubled
in the middle from what it would have

537
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,670
been if it had just been to Adams.

538
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,070
So that's the region of significant
overlap and that's what we care about.

539
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:54,750
So the overlap,
integral,

540
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,140
summing this product or
integrating it over all that space,

541
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,740
that's a certain density, right, that
we squared in order to get that right.

542
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:03,060
That's part of the density.

543
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,430
So we some that did the density that
comes from that product overall,

544
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,120
uh, space, and that's
called the overlap integral.

545
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,230
If the atoms are very far apart,
the overlap integral is essentially zero.

546
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,860
If the Adams are close together,
the overlap orbital will be finite.

547
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,840
And the better the, the, the
more the orbitals overlap,

548
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,870
the bigger the overlap integral obviously.

549
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,870
So that and that majors,

550
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:35,871
the net change that arises on bonding the
difference density as we've just seen.

551
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,250
Now,
let's look at some,

552
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,880
some practical exam or not with
some theoretical examples here.

553
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,920
So let's look at, uh, at, uh, uh,

554
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,970
the total electron density as
calculated for two w adding two,

555
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:55,020
one s orbitals of hydrogen at the
appropriate distance for h two, right?

556
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:59,970
This was done 40 years ago and published
in the Israel journal a chemistry. Okay.

557
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:01,890
Now, and here's, so on the left,

558
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:05,430
we have the total electron density that
you'd calculate from that very simple

559
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,670
thing. One over the square root
of two a squared, a plus B,

560
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,360
one of the squares do a plus B, and
you square it, you get the density,

561
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:17,100
and that's the density contour debt
0.025 electrons per cubic, uh, uh,

562
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,760
uh, a zero the unit of distance. Okay.

563
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,760
Now on the right is
the difference density.

564
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,440
So from that thing on the left,
we've subtracted the atomic orbitals,

565
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,000
the atomic electron densities,
and you see exactly what you expect.

566
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,180
It builds up in the middle where there's
overlap and it at the expense of the

567
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:42,810
Adams. You know, Russell? Oh,

568
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:47,130
uh,
I think it's the h two molecule.

569
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm sure. I'm sure it's the age too. I'm,

570
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,930
they aren't so fantastically different
because the two electrons are in the same

571
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:00,000
orbital.
Two electrons can be in the same orbital,

572
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,730
so one will be twice as big as the other.
Qualitatively,

573
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:05,910
they'll look very similar.
And I think this is the h two molecule,

574
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,230
but it might be the eye on, I'm
not sure. Okay. Uh, at any rate,

575
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:13,480
the contours on the right
are much smaller. Remember,

576
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,230
different density is much
smaller than total density.

577
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,360
So what you see is that it's contoured
at 0.04. So you have one, two,

578
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,580
three, four, five contours.

579
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,820
So you get up in the middle to 0.02
electrons per cubic [inaudible].

580
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,290
That's how much bonding has
changed things at the maximum.

581
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,850
Okay. Now the energy that's
calculated with this very, very,

582
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,780
very crude wave function,
just one half,

583
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,380
one of the square to two times the
sum of the two atomic orbitals,

584
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:52,530
the energy you calculate that
is 92.9% of the true energy.

585
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,170
That's pretty darn good,
right?

586
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,750
But almost all of that energy that you
calculate was already present in the

587
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:05,350
separate atoms, were not interested
in the energy of the separate atoms,

588
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,230
were interested in how much it
changes when you make a bond,

589
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,380
which is a small difference
between large numbers.

590
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,770
So it turns out that although we're
within 7% of the true total energy,

591
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,260
this simple model only calculates about
50% of the change in energy that came

592
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:25,840
from putting them together,
right? Which is much smaller.

593
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,690
Okay,

594
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,690
so high accuracy is required to calculate
a correct value of the bond energy.

595
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:37,180
The simple thing won't do it well.
It gets, it's in the right direction.

596
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:42,180
You're halfway there so it's
pretty good start, right? But uh,

597
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,360
to do the difference as in the same
way you needed high precision to do Xra

598
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,270
difference maps,
you need better orbitals than this.

599
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,310
If you want to calculate
good bond energies,

600
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,440
so you need to make the orbitals
better. Okay. Now that, so,

601
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:01,441
but already we can take heart that the
very crude just model shows most 52% of

602
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:07,351
the energy of the bond and it shows the
electron density building up by 0.02

603
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,960
electrons per cubic bor radius.

604
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,320
And what we saw qualitatively it was there
was a shift from the Adam to the bond

605
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:19,210
of electron density.
Okay.

606
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:24,211
Now we can adjust the molecular orbital
to get a better approximation of the

607
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,504
truth thing.

608
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,100
How will we know when we've adjusted it
and it's gotten better if we adjust it

609
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:33,370
and get a lower calculate,
a lower average energy?

610
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:37,640
I should have said the lower average
energy because if we don't have a true way

611
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,840
function, we get different
values for the total energy.

612
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,280
The kinetic won't exactly offset the
potential as you move from place to place,

613
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,010
but then if you get the
lowest average energy,

614
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:53,370
then that is by definition almost more
realistic because you can easily prove

615
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,900
that the true energy is
the lowest possible energy
that makes a certain amount

616
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:06,220
of sense. The lowest possible
calculated energy is the true energy.

617
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,600
So if you change your wave function
and get a lower average energy,

618
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,270
you're closer to the truth.
Okay?

619
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,130
That's called the variational
principal. Okay, so here,

620
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
here we've changed the form of the wave
molecular oracle and how did we change

621
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:26,440
it? What is a one? What does a
one s orbital look like? Kate,

622
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,050
do you remember the form
for a one s atomic orbital?

623
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,370
I can't hear it. It's
Angola. It's a sphere.

624
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:38,780
How does it change as you go out? Do
you remember? How does it depend on row?

625
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,230
The same way they all depend on row.
Anybody remember

626
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,420
either the minus row,
so it falls off exponentially.

627
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,700
At a certain rate and that rate,

628
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,810
how fast it falls off is determined
by the nuclear charge. Okay? Now,

629
00:41:56,811 --> 00:42:01,640
one way to change that shape would
be change how fast it falls off,

630
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,170
right? It wouldn't be
correct for the Adam anymore.

631
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,370
We've already got the correct
solution for the atom,

632
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,590
but we could change the shape
of the thing by changing that x,

633
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,920
the how fast that exponent falls off.

634
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,250
And we could have very that in
the molecule using one half,

635
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,500
one of the square to, to
a squared plus B, right?

636
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,380
But those a plus B are no
longer true atomic functions.

637
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,170
There are a little fatter,
a little skinnier, okay?

638
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,850
And we can change how fat or skinny it
is until we get the lowest molecular

639
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:36,650
energy. See that? That's a way you
can vary it and find the best value.

640
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,680
And that's what was done here
to optimize the exponent.

641
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,280
And now you've got a total electron
density that looks essentially the same as

642
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:47,600
it did before. And if you look at the
difference density, how has it changed?

643
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,330
If you do this first,
notice that the energy got lower.

644
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,010
We're now to 73% of the
lowering of the bond energy.

645
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,230
So the total energy has gotten lower,
it's better.

646
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,630
And how is the electron density changed?

647
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:09,010
It got higher in the middle because what
we did was spread the exponent out a

648
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:12,800
little bit so you had more
overlap in the middle. Okay,

649
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,240
so this wouldn't have been good for
the single atom to spread it out,

650
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,320
but it gives a better function for the
molecule and it's still very, very simple.

651
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,560
And what you see it did is it increases
the bonding density and the bonding

652
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:31,490
strength. You get a larger shift
from the atoms to the bond. Now,

653
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,520
how else could you change the shape of
the atomic orbital in order to increase

654
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:42,020
the overlap some way other than making
a single exponential and having to get

655
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:44,700
fatter or thinner?
Can you think of some other way here?

656
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:49,190
Or you have an atomic orbital a sphere
and you want to change its shape so that

657
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:53,150
it overlaps better over
here, right? How could,

658
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,180
how could you change the shape of an
atomic orbital without doing really gross

659
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:00,650
damage to it?
Right.

660
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:04,280
Making it a cube or
something like that or align,

661
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,690
how could you change it?

662
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:09,920
So it looked pretty much still like an
Adam did as a lot of the virtues of the

663
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:12,590
atom. But it's shifted over here. Sam

664
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,160
can't hear. Yeah. How, how,

665
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:25,220
how am I going to write a function that
allows the electrons to shift in the

666
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,900
direction I want them
to. Lexi hybridize it.

667
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,590
We could hybridize the shift the
electron. So that's the next one. So uh,

668
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,780
so here we're going to,
instead of this,

669
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:41,220
we're going to hybridize it now
this particular calculation did the

670
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,840
hybridization and also did a little
self-consistent field calculation and the

671
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:50,841
hybridization left at 96.7% one s so
essentially it's still normal one s

672
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:53,574
orbital,

673
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,580
but they added 0.6% of two s which
expanded it a little bit cause two ss goes

674
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:05,850
further out than one s and
they added 2.7% have to pee.

675
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,290
Now why was there much but it was
two p much more helpful than two s

676
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,500
Lucas.
Yeah.

677
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:18,990
So it takes density from one side
and shifts it to the other. In fact,

678
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:23,280
this is precisely what
we saw before. Uh, um,

679
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,910
notice what it, what it did was, uh,

680
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,360
how much it includes increased the density
in the middle and notice now it's not

681
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,280
taking electron density
away from the nuclei,

682
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,600
which was a good place for electrons
to be. Where does it take it away from

683
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,520
out beyond the nuclei and
shift it to the middle.

684
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,630
So even before when it was an Adam
and a certain, here's the nucleus,

685
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:51,870
a certain distance out here and
a certain distance out here,

686
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:54,510
we're the same in energy for that,
Adam.

687
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,050
Now we've taken it from a place which
is which out here and put it here.

688
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,230
Right? Great idea. Well done Lexi.

689
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,480
So there's what it looks like.

690
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:09,990
You remember that's a 100%
one s it looks like that.

691
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,460
And if you change it to be hybridized
that way with Adam in a box,

692
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,300
it looks like this, right?
It's not much shift,

693
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,190
but it shifts from the left to the
right. Okay. And gives better overlap.

694
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,960
Okay. And, and, uh,

695
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,980
but it requires the Adam to be a little
bit less happy as an Adam because it's,

696
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,270
it's partly two s and two p. Now the
electrons are further from the nucleus,

697
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,840
but you make up for that by
having a better bond, okay?

698
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,550
Now notice that didn't change.

699
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:45,840
The energy very much went from 73% to 76%,

700
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,210
right?
We were already about the right energy,

701
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,200
but it changed the density a
lot to be what we want it to be.

702
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,610
Okay?

703
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,930
So there's a much bigger shift and it's
now from beyond the nucleus into the

704
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:01,260
bond, right? Uh,

705
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,700
and now we're going to do the
last thing we've done SCF already,

706
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,570
but now you have to do a higher level
calculation. That'll do correlation.

707
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:11,760
Take the correlation of
the electrons into account.

708
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,700
And if you add some correlation
calculation to this,

709
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,140
you now get 97,
90% of the bond.

710
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,260
If you did complete correlation,
you'd get 100% of the bond.

711
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,670
What does it mean to do a calculation
with complete correlation?

712
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,700
It means you don't have an error anymore.
You've raised,

713
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,440
used the really good calculation.

714
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,030
So already at this level that was
done 50 years ago, almost, uh,

715
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,090
you get 90% of the bond
and the bond density.

716
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,250
Notice what about the electron density?

717
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,610
It hasn't really changed all the,

718
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,730
all that happened was that the
electrons kept apart from one another,

719
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,800
but the average density was the same. So,
so already with just that hybridization,

720
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:59,100
we got very close to the truth in electron
distribution and three quarters of

721
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:03,460
the way to the truth in how strong a
bond is. So not a bad approximation.

722
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:06,820
So hybridization to give better
overlap is a great thing.

723
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:10,540
So the density wasn't changed,
but you've got a much better energy.

724
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,850
And how so? Because the electrons
kept apart from one another.

725
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,760
When you allow correlation.
Okay,

726
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,090
so here's a pairwise atomic orbital,

727
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,020
less than one half the square w one
of the square to two times a plus B.

728
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:29,020
And you can use hybridized orbitals.
And the virtues are,

729
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:33,340
it's very easy to formulate it to
understand. And it looks like Adam's,

730
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:36,200
especially when you get
down near the nuclei, uh,

731
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,940
and that you don't want that to change
because that's the main event for

732
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:40,631
electrons.

733
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:44,680
You get much more energy forming Adams
as we saw before than you do making,

734
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,510
making new bonds once you have
the Adams already. Uh, okay.

735
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,170
It builds up electron density
between the nuclei through overlap,

736
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:56,100
which is the source of bonding.
It's smooth,

737
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,070
smooth sy to lower the kinetic energy.

738
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,400
And then there's a pedantic footnote
here that actually there's a thing called

739
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:08,710
the varial Theorem,
which I'm not going to stress you with,

740
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,100
but that's that little bit
of there happens to be true,

741
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:16,330
but still we have the proper I
understanding of what's going on.

742
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,400
Uh, hybridizing aos provides flexibility
that gives you better overlap.

743
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,560
And if you use all the h like atomic
orbits, you have perfect flexibility.

744
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:30,150
You could make any shape
you want. Okay? But,

745
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,720
but we're going to keep it simple.

746
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,810
Use only s two s and two p orbitals to
hybridize because that'll give you most

747
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:37,571
of the way there.

748
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:41,170
And it's much simpler rather than to
try to mix five [inaudible] four bubbles

749
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:45,910
into it also. Okay. So that's
great. And when we square it,

750
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,910
we get this, which has the
overlap part that helps us out.

751
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,830
We have the Adams plus the bond, which
is the overlap, that product part.

752
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:54,940
Uh,

753
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,940
but we could have done the same thing
to get the same product as far as the

754
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:04,780
Adam's go. If we'd used a
minus sign instead of a plus
sign and combining things,

755
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,860
although then we would have changed
the sign of the overlap thing,

756
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,550
it would become minus. So we would
change it from being greater than,

757
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,810
less than to being greater than in order
to have it be normalized at the bottom.

758
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,300
Right. And that's the ante bonds. So we
get both the bond and the anti bond, uh,

759
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:27,220
by doing this. And now we're going
to go on next time to overlap,

760
00:50:27,221 --> 00:50:30,550
which we've already introduced.
And also the concept of energy match.

761
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:33,370
And when you put these two together,
you'll really understand bonding.
