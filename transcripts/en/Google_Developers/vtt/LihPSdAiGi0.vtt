[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.480
SHENAZ ZACK: A very,
very warm welcome

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.580
to all you amazing ladies.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240
On behalf of Google, I am
really excited to be here

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
to celebrate all you strong,
passionate, and persevering

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.330
women, along with
Women Techmakers,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.980
and their global vision
of providing visibility,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.130
community, and resources.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.010
And I truly appreciate you
spending your Saturday with us

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.190
away from your family.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.520
I know it's not easy,
definitely for me, sneaking out

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.645
of the house on a Saturday.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:35.940
So thank you.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.930
This is our fourth year of
hosting our global event series

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
in celebration of International
Women's Day, where

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.510
we celebrate women's
achievements and campaign

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.490
for gender equality.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.800
This year's theme for
International Women's Day

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560
is Telling our Story.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.560
So I'm going to lead by
example and tell my story.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.900
My story has a couple of
interesting sharp turns.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
So let's go through that.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
I grew up on a small village
called Gholvad in India,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.080
on an orchard.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.510
It's around three and a
half hours from Mumbai,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.760
on the western seaboard.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.860
My first exposure
to computers was

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.320
when I was in my sixth
grade, when my family bought

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.110
a PC, first PC for our house,
for their trucking business.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.830
And I spent hours
tinkering on it.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.450
Little did I know
that I would end up

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.120
in Silicon Valley working
for one of the leading tech

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.496
companies in the world.

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:29.610
Our village and our neighboring
town had only one college.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270
So at the age of 15,
I moved to Bombay

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.980
to continue my education.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060
And actually, that's where
I first realized and learned

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270
about gender bias, as I was the
only girl in my class for two

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.390
years studying electronics.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.630
I finished my graduation,
went on to do my MBA.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.900
I joined BMG in India
and had to launch albums

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.780
from international artists
like Whitney Houston, Prince,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.880
in the Indian market.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.950
Fast forward a few years.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.110
Myself and my dog--
yes, you heard me right,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.310
my dog, literal dog-- moved
to beautiful California,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.900
and where I became a
prisoner of paradise.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.759
And I called myself that
because I was on an H- visa.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.580
I was in this land of
opportunity with tons to do,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.060
but I couldn't work because
I was on an H-4 visa.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.950
I wasn't going to
let that stop me,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.860
so I decided to pursue
my passion of filmmaking.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.720
And I joined community
college, and I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.990
started interning at local
organizations like Channel 4

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.870
KRON and KKUP 91.5 FM, which
is the only listener-supported

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.510
radio station in the
entire United States.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.700
I started working with
them and later on joined

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.170
their board of directors.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.350
But again, I was the
only woman of color.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.800
Then, I followed my heart and
joined an Oscar-nominated, Emmy

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.110
award-winning production
house in the Bay Area

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.470
called Concentric Media,
where I edited and co-produced

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.760
a documentary about
AIDS in Ethiopia.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.570
And at that time, I
realized that technology

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.460
had a lot to offer
in this industry,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.090
in the filmmaking industry.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.860
And there's a lot
that could be done.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.460
So I started knocking on
Google's door, especially

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.080
Google Video.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.550
I got a job as a temp worker,
reviewing approximately 7,000

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.870
videos a day.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.980
That part of my brain?

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.170
Locked away and thrown.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.000
I don't want to ever go there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.620
But I had a break in my career.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.042
I didn't have a US degree.

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:21.500
I had to start
somewhere, and I was

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.660
willing to start at
the bottom of the pole.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.600
But thanks to amazing
and supportive colleagues

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.510
at Google, I became
a full time Googler,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.290
and I transitioned to
product management,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.960
which is what I wanted to do.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.200
And I am proud to say that I
have been at Google for over 10

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.910
years now.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.010
So today, as I stand
in front of you,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.680
I'm humbled and
honored to introduce

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.170
an amazing line of
speakers and workshops,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.260
and so I urge you all
to share your stories,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.450
to inspire other young women.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.640
At Google, difference
is our value.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.460
And you can see
that from my story.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.870
A diversity of
perspectives and ideas,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.880
whether by gender, race, sexual
orientation, neurodiversity,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.110
or a combination of them, lead
to a much better workplace,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.050
to better decisions,
much more creative ideas,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.690
and most important,
building better products,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.650
because our products are used by
people from all walks of life.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.430
So we at Google want to help
the entire tech industry become

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.600
more inclusive and accepting
by inspiring young students

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.580
to join computer science.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.800
We want to create
an industry where

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.970
people can pursue their dreams,
build impactful technology,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.570
and become leaders.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.150
So I mentioned Women
Techmakers a couple of times.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.490
And if you're wondering,
what is Women Techmakers,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.330
it's Google's global program
for women in technology.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.060
It was kicked off in 2012 by
then-VP Google[x], Megan Smith,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.400
and is now led by
Natalie Villalobos,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.320
who is our amazing
leader right now,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.770
and a global team of Googlers.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.270
Yay!

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.361
Off to Natalie.

00:04:56.361 --> 00:05:00.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.800
And an amazing team
of Googlers who

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720
are passionate about
empowering women

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.190
in technology to increase
visibility, community,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.170
and resources.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.620
60,000 women, in person, are
influenced by Women Techmakers,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.920
as they not only host
this event but also host

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.200
Google I/O and Grace Hopper.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.870
It also has a membership
program to offer

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.290
you curated resources and
community based on your career

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.370
level.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.860
They also have a
Scholars Program

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.400
which supports women
to obtain CS degrees.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.450
And there is an
incredible amount of work

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.680
that goes in from 320
volunteers who around the world

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.930
are developing diverse
and inclusive ecosystems.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.930
You can always learn more
about Women Techmakers

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.550
at womentechmakers.com.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.810
Telling our story.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.470
This is the team
we are celebrating.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.090
And I already told you my story.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.670
I hope it inspired
some of you, or I

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.460
hope it inspires some kids.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.190
But this is selected
as a rallying cry

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.750
to have each of us
become more visible,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.150
which is definitely needed
at this point of time.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.870
We need to still tell our
story to become more visible

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.870
and ensure our unique
contributions to this industry

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.950
are being known.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.430
So please, all of you
share your story today

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.170
and listen to other stories.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.010
And also, amplify that by
sharing it on social media with

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.110
the hashtag #wtm17.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.947
Diversity in technology.

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.530
When you hear that
term, sometimes you

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.110
only think United States, but
as you look at this global map,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.100
women around the world
are coming together

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.220
to increase the visibility,
community, and resources

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.850
to enable more women
to join the industry.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.340
And that's why across
March and April,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.950
Women Techmakers will be
hosting 15 global summits,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.060
over 140 community meetups.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.950
And we believe in
supporting communities

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.100
wherever they are,
so on April 7,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.080
we will be hosting a summit
in Sydney, Australia.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.830
And today, three summits
are taking place.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.720
One in Seattle, New
York's already kicked off,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.420
and we are off.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.980
And so we encourage and
empower women to see--

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.190
it's so good to see all of you
over there in the audience.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.120
And again, please share your
stories and hashtag them

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.060
#wcm17.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.210
