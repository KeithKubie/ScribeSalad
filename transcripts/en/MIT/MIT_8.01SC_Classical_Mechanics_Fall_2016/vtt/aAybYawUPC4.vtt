00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.390
Newton's second law
states that the sum

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.580
of the forces on an object
is equal to the acceleration

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.220
of that object times the mass.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.670
But what if instead this
object is actually two objects?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.880
Do I now need to consider
the forces that are acting

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.070
between each of these parts?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.400
Or what if I consider
the object to be made out

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.650
of even smaller parts?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
I can take it down to
its smallest components

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650
and consider the
interactions between all

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.020
of the atoms in the object.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
This seems like an
overwhelming number of forces

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.030
that I'm going to need
to calculate just to find

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.520
the force on this object.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.440
But I never seem to
calculate this many forces.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.450
Why is that?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.820
All of these forces between
the atoms in the object

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.190
cancel out because they are
Newton's third law pairs.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.610
If both objects are within
the system-- since a Newton's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.910
third law a pair
of forces is equal

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.010
and opposite-- the total
force is just zero.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
We call these internal forces.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.550
That is, forces that are acting
between a pair of objects that

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.820
are both within our system.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.560
On the other hand,
external forces--

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.420
forces that act on an object
within the system by an object

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.646
outside the system-- are
what we need to consider

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:18.480
for our calculation.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.550
We could be more precise
about Newton's second law

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.039
and say that the total
external force on the system

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.960
is equal to the system's
acceleration times the system's

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.460
mass.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.430
Let's look at an example of
how the selection of a system

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.680
will affect the forces
that we need to consider.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.560
I have three blocks.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.610
I'll call them one, two, and
three, and a force that's

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.100
pushing block one to the right.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.110
We'll first take a minute
to look at notation.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.180
We will write the forces as F12.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.040
And this means that it's the
force exerted by an object

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.640
one acting on an object two.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.380
In this example, I have pairs
of forces between each block.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.940
The interaction between
blocks one and two.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.579
And the interaction between
blocks two and three.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.180
Let's look at the internal and
external forces on the system

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.190
if my system is made up of
block one and block two.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.750
I have this external
pushing force-- F

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.640
external-- that's acting from
the external pusher on block

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.120
one.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.160
Blocks one and two are
interacting with each other.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.960
But these are both
within my system.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.890
So these are internal
forces that I do not

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.610
need to worry about.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.520
And finally block two,
which is within my system,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.340
is interacting with block 3,
which is outside my system.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.630
The external force
here is the force

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.860
that is acting from
block three on block two.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.190
Now we know that
the two forces that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.240
are relevant to calculating
the motion of the system

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.540
are the external
pushing force and F32.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.990
If my system is instead made
up of blocks one and three,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.940
block two is now part of
the extremal environment.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.300
Can you figure out what the
internal and external forces

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.800
are?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.760
In this case, the external
forces to the system

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.310
are the external pushing force
F external, F21, and F23.
