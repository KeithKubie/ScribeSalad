00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.560
Thank you Ms. Akana for coming by the office today.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.420
For the chance to interview for a Fortune 500 Company?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.040
Thank you Mr. Wang.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.380
Well, my first question has to be:  Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.340
Hopefully doing your job.  Haha!

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.340
That's a good one!

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.100
Cocky.  I like it.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.240
What about 6 years?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.360
Oh, I did not see that question coming.  Uhm.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.760
Well, I'm going to be optimistic here and say

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.640
on the cusp of upper management.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Being groomed to take over by company president.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.820
Mmm.  Interesting.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.100
How about 30 years?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.440
Uh, well I would be 56 at that point.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.980
Ready for retirement.  But hopefully with a good health regimen

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.260
and an active lifestyle

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.800
and in an advanced state of medicine I'll be well enough to pursue my new calling,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.940
motivational speaking.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.880
Gotchya.  Well you know what your resume is great

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.900
and your qualifications--

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.860
How about 100 years?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.500
Well, sir.  I would probably be dead in 100 years.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.860
Most likely from the cancer that runs in my family.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.420
That's fantastic.  How about 1,000 years?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.920
Sir, I don't see how that's relevant--

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.380
Where do you see yourself in 1,000 years?  Do you want this job or not Ms. Akana?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.920
Answer the god damned question!

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.400
Wong Fu Productions will develop the ability to revive dead

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.920
human tissue as means of providing enough soldiers for their continued evolvement

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.720
in a still war-stricken Middle East.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.960
The program would make me its first test subject.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.520
I would become an immortal cyborg.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.480
Fascinating.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.120
How about 1 million years?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.640
Sir I can't know--

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.460
1 million years!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.340
Humanity ending war over water is inevitable, with our destructive species extinct

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.040
the Earth can sustain itself from that much longer but ultimately

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.080
it will be obliterated by meteor E-1779 or our sun going supernova.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
Cyborg or not, I would be destroyed.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
There will be nothing left.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.240
The Earth, a lifeless hulk.  Blasted into nothingness

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.320
by a cataclysmic galactic event taking your half human half machine remains with it?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980
There's just no room in this company for that kind of negativity.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.120
Th-thank you for your time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.840
Another one down, huh boss?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.820
You ever gonna find an applicant you like?

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.560
You know what? I'm not even trying to hire anyone.  I'm just collecting ideas for my Sci-Fi novel.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.320
*chuckles*

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.540
That's so like you.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.320
You wanna co-write this with me?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.860
What about a crazy half-squid half-tarantula?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.360
There's like some erotic aspects that we could work on.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.060
You sick fuck.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.700
*laughs*
