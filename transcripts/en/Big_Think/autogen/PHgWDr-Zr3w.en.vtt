the research shows and there literally
 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.969
the research shows and there literally
are hundreds of studies on self

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979
are hundreds of studies on self

are hundreds of studies on self
affirmation and most of this was work

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709
affirmation and most of this was work
 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.580
affirmation and most of this was work
done by Stanford psychologists led by

when people self affirm it is the
 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.199
when people self affirm it is the
simplest exercise it really is one what

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209
simplest exercise it really is one what
 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.330

and it allows them to perform much

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
and it allows them to perform much
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.449
and it allows them to perform much
better in a stressful task so somebody

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459
better in a stressful task so somebody
 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.669
better in a stressful task so somebody
made self affirmed and write about why

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679

you know family matters to them and then
they go take a really hard math test not

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030
they go take a really hard math test not
 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.520

only are they less stressed out they
 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.680
only are they less stressed out they
actually do better on the math test now

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
actually do better on the math test now
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.449
actually do better on the math test now
what's funny about it is it's not

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459
what's funny about it is it's not
 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.359

it has nothing to do with math the self

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
it has nothing to do with math the self
 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590
it has nothing to do with math the self
affirmation can have nothing to do with

affirmation can have nothing to do with
math why does it work

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
math why does it work
 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.570
math why does it work
it works because when we are reminded of

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580
it works because when we are reminded of
 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.260
it works because when we are reminded of
who we really are it's okay to not be

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270

in both Indian and American call centers
 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.090
in both Indian and American call centers
those employees who did that orientation

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100
those employees who did that orientation
 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.540
those employees who did that orientation
as opposed to a general orientation

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550
as opposed to a general orientation
 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.690
as opposed to a general orientation
stated the job longer were happier and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
stated the job longer were happier and
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.699

only a day so it's pretty amazing okay
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.729
only a day so it's pretty amazing okay
so you self affirmed now you know who

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739
so you self affirmed now you know who
 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.360
so you self affirmed now you know who
you are the next part is really how do

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370
you are the next part is really how do
 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.910
you are the next part is really how do
you access that in your sort of day to

these big challenges you're naturally
 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.390
these big challenges you're naturally
expressing who you really are

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400
expressing who you really are
 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.830

family who you really are when you get

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640
family who you really are when you get
 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.880
family who you really are when you get
into those stressful situations the last

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890
into those stressful situations the last
 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.620
into those stressful situations the last
thing you're thinking about is I need to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
thing you're thinking about is I need to
 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.180
thing you're thinking about is I need to
make sure that I show them exactly who I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190
make sure that I show them exactly who I
 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.930
make sure that I show them exactly who I
am and so instead showing them who you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
am and so instead showing them who you
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.720
am and so instead showing them who you
are becomes very threatening and you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
are becomes very threatening and you
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.330
are becomes very threatening and you
know that wall goes up and now you can't

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340
know that wall goes up and now you can't
 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.460
know that wall goes up and now you can't
access those things even if you want to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470
access those things even if you want to
 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.680
access those things even if you want to
you can't access them because you're in

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
you can't access them because you're in
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.420
you can't access them because you're in
kind of fight-or-flight mode so the it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430
kind of fight-or-flight mode so the it
