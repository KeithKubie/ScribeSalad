simply a studio but there's some kind of
research in some kind of a project and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
research in some kind of a project and
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.750

the kinds of interaction that it makes
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130
the kinds of interaction that it makes
possible but especially I'm interested

interaction is not the interaction that
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120
interaction is not the interaction that
the architect designs for now but what

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
the architect designs for now but what
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219
the architect designs for now but what
interaction might take place when the

current user and the current architect
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.109

and so on and I think you do that in
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.420
and so on and I think you do that in
your work but you also do that almost

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
your work but you also do that almost
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.000
your work but you also do that almost
diplomatically by by working at the

as oozing virtue I think there was not a

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769
as oozing virtue I think there was not a
 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.979
as oozing virtue I think there was not a
more virtuous person ever spoke in this

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
more virtuous person ever spoke in this
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.620
more virtuous person ever spoke in this
room and and also an elegant person and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
room and and also an elegant person and
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.780
room and and also an elegant person and
and I think that the the there is also

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
and I think that the the there is also
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.370
and I think that the the there is also
something about the way the world is

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
something about the way the world is
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.699

and in the sixties they tried out the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
and in the sixties they tried out the
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.410
and in the sixties they tried out the
idea that there that and this applies to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
idea that there that and this applies to
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.850

architecture that an ethically
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.470
architecture that an ethically
responsible architecture would also be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
responsible architecture would also be
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.440
responsible architecture would also be
an elegant architecture and I think the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
an elegant architecture and I think the
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.890

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.519
different people homeless people who now
know how to make a door who now know how

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:10.529
know how to make a door who now know how
 

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:12.199
know how to make a door who now know how
to make a window and they're able to

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:12.209
to make a window and they're able to
 

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:14.509
to make a window and they're able to
take those skills elsewhere so the

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519
take those skills elsewhere so the
 

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:16.340
take those skills elsewhere so the
impact of this project is less about its

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.350
impact of this project is less about its
 

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.740
impact of this project is less about its
form and more about its it's a mode of

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:18.750
form and more about its it's a mode of
 

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.740
form and more about its it's a mode of
becoming and these are just some some

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:21.750
becoming and these are just some some
 

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.619
becoming and these are just some some
other shots I expect this will be

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:23.629
other shots I expect this will be
 

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:25.850
other shots I expect this will be
published before the end of the year if

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860
published before the end of the year if
 

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.949
published before the end of the year if
everything works out well very simple

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959
everything works out well very simple

everything works out well very simple
low-tech sort of solution but the

low-tech sort of solution but the
 

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.610
low-tech sort of solution but the
detailing was quite a rigorous and

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620
detailing was quite a rigorous and
 

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.929
detailing was quite a rigorous and
challenging exercise and it's an

00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:35.939
challenging exercise and it's an
 

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:38.540
challenging exercise and it's an

alien vegetation by the way so we tried

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500
alien vegetation by the way so we tried
 

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.040
alien vegetation by the way so we tried
not to disturb the vegetation that was

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.050
not to disturb the vegetation that was
 

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.460
not to disturb the vegetation that was

and even I to this day I still have a
 

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.439
and even I to this day I still have a
shiver down my spine when I see police

shiver down my spine when I see police
 

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:11.240

I they said that we needed a place where

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:19.990
I they said that we needed a place where
 

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.230
I they said that we needed a place where
we could interact with the public and my

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240
we could interact with the public and my
 

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.299
we could interact with the public and my
departure point was that i would say

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:24.309
departure point was that i would say
 

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:25.860
departure point was that i would say
that i would make the building not look

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:25.870
that i would make the building not look
 

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.150
that i would make the building not look
like a police station all this sounds

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160
like a police station all this sounds
 

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.329
like a police station all this sounds
pretty simple up until this point police

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:30.339
pretty simple up until this point police
 

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:32.489
pretty simple up until this point police
stations had slot windows so that you

00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:32.499
stations had slot windows so that you
 

00:16:32.499 --> 00:16:35.999
stations had slot windows so that you
could fire out of them they had brown

00:16:35.999 --> 00:16:36.009
could fire out of them they had brown
 

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:37.980
could fire out of them they had brown
brick walls so that you can't actually

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:37.990
brick walls so that you can't actually
 

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.199
brick walls so that you can't actually
see the dirt on them very defensive

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:40.209
see the dirt on them very defensive
 

00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:41.489
see the dirt on them very defensive
strategies and in fact all of their

00:16:41.489 --> 00:16:41.499
strategies and in fact all of their
 

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:42.809
strategies and in fact all of their
buildings all of their buildings were

00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:42.819
buildings all of their buildings were
 

00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:45.119
buildings all of their buildings were
fortresses in the landscape and I said

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:45.129
fortresses in the landscape and I said
 

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:47.069
fortresses in the landscape and I said
that one this building will actually be

00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079
that one this building will actually be
 

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:49.559
that one this building will actually be
fragile so I'm actually going to make it

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:49.569
fragile so I'm actually going to make it
 

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:52.319
fragile so I'm actually going to make it
white so that if if dirt shows up it

00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:52.329
white so that if if dirt shows up it
 

00:16:52.329 --> 00:16:54.150
white so that if if dirt shows up it
encourages you to clean it second I'm

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160
encourages you to clean it second I'm
 

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.650
encourages you to clean it second I'm
going to remove all of the burglar bars

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:55.660
going to remove all of the burglar bars
 

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.989
going to remove all of the burglar bars
which it had on all of the windows and I

00:16:57.989 --> 00:16:57.999
which it had on all of the windows and I
 

00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:59.610
which it had on all of the windows and I
would have no fence at the front side

00:16:59.610 --> 00:16:59.620
would have no fence at the front side
 

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.379
would have no fence at the front side
essentially I would I would turn the

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:01.389
essentially I would I would turn the
 

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:04.110
essentially I would I would turn the
inside of the the station out it and

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120
inside of the the station out it and
 

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.600
inside of the the station out it and
make it a public sort of building the

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:06.610
make it a public sort of building the
 

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.159
make it a public sort of building the
success of this project is that it has

00:17:08.159 --> 00:17:08.169
success of this project is that it has
 

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:10.079
success of this project is that it has
now informed a national strategy for how

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.089
now informed a national strategy for how
 

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.059
now informed a national strategy for how
all police stations should interact with

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:12.069
all police stations should interact with
 

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.189
all police stations should interact with
the area setting not necessarily the

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199
the area setting not necessarily the
 

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.169
the area setting not necessarily the
form of the building per se but really

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:16.179
form of the building per se but really
 

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:18.149
form of the building per se but really
that the police stations can become part

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:18.159
that the police stations can become part
 

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:20.939
that the police stations can become part
of their context and can be can afford

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:20.949
of their context and can be can afford
 

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.029
of their context and can be can afford
to be ephemeral if an ephemeral and and

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039
to be ephemeral if an ephemeral and and
 

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:25.740
to be ephemeral if an ephemeral and and
in that way show strength as opposed to

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:25.750
in that way show strength as opposed to
 

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.909
in that way show strength as opposed to
showing strength by having a

00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919
showing strength by having a
 

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:29.430
showing strength by having a
fortress-like sort of architecture the

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440
fortress-like sort of architecture the
 

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.529
fortress-like sort of architecture the
staff in this building have loved the

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:31.539
staff in this building have loved the
 

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:34.080
staff in this building have loved the
building I go then visited often but the

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.090
building I go then visited often but the
 

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.909
building I go then visited often but the
most intriguing thing that one of the

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919
most intriguing thing that one of the
 

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.080
most intriguing thing that one of the
most intriguing things was when I was

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.090
most intriguing things was when I was
 

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.220
most intriguing things was when I was
dealing with the police superintendent

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.230
dealing with the police superintendent
 

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.860
dealing with the police superintendent
and I was putting in hands growth taps

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:40.870
and I was putting in hands growth taps
 

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.200
and I was putting in hands growth taps
and so on in the in the in the bathrooms

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.210
and so on in the in the in the bathrooms
 

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.029
and so on in the in the in the bathrooms
the police superintendent said don't

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039
the police superintendent said don't
 

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.889
the police superintendent said don't
give the police 9th a nice things they

00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:46.899
give the police 9th a nice things they
 

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.240
give the police 9th a nice things they
will destroy them they're all animals

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.250
will destroy them they're all animals
 

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.460
will destroy them they're all animals
and I said if you treat your own staff

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.470
and I said if you treat your own staff
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.990
and I said if you treat your own staff
like animals and they will behave like

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000
like animals and they will behave like
 

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.430
like animals and they will behave like
that and not only that they will go out

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440
that and not only that they will go out
 

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.760
that and not only that they will go out
into the world and and take it out of

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:56.770
into the world and and take it out of
 

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.409
into the world and and take it out of
ordinary people so I said let's make a

00:17:58.409 --> 00:17:58.419
ordinary people so I said let's make a
 

00:17:58.419 --> 00:18:00.000
ordinary people so I said let's make a
building which brings dignity to the

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.010
building which brings dignity to the
 

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.740
building which brings dignity to the
police because they are a part of our

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:01.750
police because they are a part of our
 

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.630
police because they are a part of our
society and they need to see themselves

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640
society and they need to see themselves
 

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.810
society and they need to see themselves
in a different light and this building

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:06.820
in a different light and this building
 

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.450
in a different light and this building
has been it's a fairly ordinary a sort

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.460
has been it's a fairly ordinary a sort
 

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.950
has been it's a fairly ordinary a sort
of architectural language but I think

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960
of architectural language but I think
 

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.330
of architectural language but I think
it's quite a departure from the

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.340
it's quite a departure from the
 

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.700
it's quite a departure from the
normative way of how buildings were

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:14.710
normative way of how buildings were
 

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.700
normative way of how buildings were
designed in fact people are said to me

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:17.710
designed in fact people are said to me
 

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.169
designed in fact people are said to me
it looks like an art gallery it looks

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:19.179
it looks like an art gallery it looks
 

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:20.549
it looks like an art gallery it looks
like anything else and I said well I'm

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559
like anything else and I said well I'm
 

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.810

mobilizing people on the ground because
the ANC was banned so this this becomes

00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159
the ANC was banned so this this becomes
 

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:02.219
the ANC was banned so this this becomes
quite an interesting and significant

00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:02.229
quite an interesting and significant
 

00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:03.899
quite an interesting and significant
site of intervention because it's in

00:29:03.899 --> 00:29:03.909

Google air too you might have heard in

00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:06.579
Google air too you might have heard in
 

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:08.249
Google air too you might have heard in
the news about a killing of a tourist

00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:08.259
the news about a killing of a tourist
 

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:09.509
the news about a killing of a tourist
that happened there a couple of weeks

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519
that happened there a couple of weeks
 

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:11.759
that happened there a couple of weeks
ago so it's a fairly complicated site

00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:11.769
ago so it's a fairly complicated site
 

00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:15.209
ago so it's a fairly complicated site
and in fact before 1994 an American

too far from from the actual project and

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:19.950
too far from from the actual project and
 

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.589

for me that the conceptual proposition

00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:22.599
for me that the conceptual proposition

writer named and juggle and Evelyn about
 

00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:30.299
writer named and juggle and Evelyn about
township life and he told me that you

00:29:30.299 --> 00:29:30.309
township life and he told me that you
 

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:31.619
township life and he told me that you
know growing on growing up in the

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:31.629

sets of three so if you stayed in one

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.100
sets of three so if you stayed in one
 

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.640
sets of three so if you stayed in one
house the next three houses would be

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:38.650
house the next three houses would be
 

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.950
house the next three houses would be
your community and you were not you

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960
your community and you were not you
 

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.539
your community and you were not you
would not walk beyond those three

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:42.549
would not walk beyond those three
 

00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:44.310
would not walk beyond those three
streets because you would overlap with

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320
streets because you would overlap with
 

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.840
streets because you would overlap with
another community and you get into

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:45.850
another community and you get into
 

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.940
another community and you get into
fistfights and so on but what he also

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:47.950
fistfights and so on but what he also
 

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.860
fistfights and so on but what he also
said was that you would have three sets

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:49.870
said was that you would have three sets
 

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.600
said was that you would have three sets
of three so whenever there was a

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:51.610
of three so whenever there was a
 

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.490

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:53.500
political or social issue communities
 

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.260
political or social issue communities
were organized in three sets of three

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:55.270
were organized in three sets of three
 

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.390
were organized in three sets of three
and so on and so forth so this this

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:57.400
and so on and so forth so this this
 

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.110
and so on and so forth so this this
number three became quite an interesting

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120
number three became quite an interesting
 

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.820
number three became quite an interesting

reading this landscape became quite

reading this landscape became quite
 

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:17.159
reading this landscape became quite
important so essentially I'll actually

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:17.169
important so essentially I'll actually
 

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:19.440

jump back to this image we've got the

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.450
jump back to this image we've got the
 

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.180
jump back to this image we've got the
museum component sitting over here but

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:21.190
museum component sitting over here but
 

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.549
museum component sitting over here but
in fact this is the whole sort of sight

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559
in fact this is the whole sort of sight
 

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:26.100
in fact this is the whole sort of sight
there is a water feature over here which

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.110
there is a water feature over here which
 

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.840
there is a water feature over here which
is a detention pond where currently lots

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:27.850
is a detention pond where currently lots
 

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.390
is a detention pond where currently lots
of children drown every winter which is

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:30.400
of children drown every winter which is
 

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.060
of children drown every winter which is
our rainy season so the intervention

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.070
our rainy season so the intervention
 

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.430
our rainy season so the intervention
largely was okay to cycle back the

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440
largely was okay to cycle back the
 

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.649

intervention was to create the museum

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:37.659
intervention was to create the museum
 

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:39.659
intervention was to create the museum
but also to rehabilitate this context

00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:39.669
but also to rehabilitate this context
 

00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:41.250
but also to rehabilitate this context
and you can begin to see the sort of

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:41.260
and you can begin to see the sort of
 

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.590
and you can begin to see the sort of
fragmented language of the informal

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600
fragmented language of the informal
 

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.480
fragmented language of the informal
settlement and in some ways there's a

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.490
settlement and in some ways there's a
 

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.610
settlement and in some ways there's a
sort of dialogue between the formality

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:47.620
sort of dialogue between the formality
 

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.470
sort of dialogue between the formality
of the urban intervention along the side

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480
of the urban intervention along the side
 

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.990
of the urban intervention along the side
versus the informality and end of the

versus the informality and end of the
 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.730
versus the informality and end of the
sort of splicing of opportunities across

the space the the structure of the
building is essentially three

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.450
building is essentially three
 

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.149
building is essentially three
rectangular spaces which are interlocked

00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159
rectangular spaces which are interlocked
 

00:31:03.159 --> 00:31:04.740
rectangular spaces which are interlocked
in volume they are structured according

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:04.750
in volume they are structured according
 

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.750
in volume they are structured according
to three in terms of height width and

to three in terms of height width and
 

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.320
to three in terms of height width and
depth the creation of a sculpture park

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.330

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.510
depth the creation of a sculpture park
at the bottom scale over here this is

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:12.520
at the bottom scale over here this is
 

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.430
at the bottom scale over here this is
the existing building where relics and

visual beacon of the landscape which is
 

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:23.580
visual beacon of the landscape which is
actually how you access the whole museum

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:23.590
actually how you access the whole museum
 

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.230
actually how you access the whole museum

now is really in its early stages I mean

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:30.580
now is really in its early stages I mean
 

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.700

this is an organization which has never

this is an organization which has never
 

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.789
this is an organization which has never
done a museum before so a lot of the

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799
done a museum before so a lot of the
 

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.350
done a museum before so a lot of the
work is not necessarily the designing of

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360
work is not necessarily the designing of
 

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.240
work is not necessarily the designing of
the building but understanding how to

structure a museum how to structure

structured fundraising and a lot of my

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:48.190
structured fundraising and a lot of my
 

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.610
structured fundraising and a lot of my
work is very much in that

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620
work is very much in that
 

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.680
work is very much in that
domain because I've realized that it is

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:51.690
domain because I've realized that it is
 

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.840
domain because I've realized that it is
almost impossible to create architecture

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:53.850
almost impossible to create architecture
 

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.810
almost impossible to create architecture

the creation of a park along the side a
sort of empathy eter which would face

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840
sort of empathy eter which would face
 

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.420
sort of empathy eter which would face
onto the building and that effectively

onto the building and that effectively
 

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.590
onto the building and that effectively
would have a sort of urban renewal node

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600
would have a sort of urban renewal node
 

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.290
would have a sort of urban renewal node

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:24.990
so I'm hoping at the fundraising will go
 

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.470
so I'm hoping at the fundraising will go
well what I haven't heard much from them

fairly fairly mundane so to speak it's
 

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.420
fairly fairly mundane so to speak it's
really about reclaiming the relationship

drastically but what what's fascinating
 

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.280
drastically but what what's fascinating
for me about this project is that these

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:00.290
for me about this project is that these
 

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.430
for me about this project is that these

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.210
the background there was a very
interesting dialogue between the station

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:25.220
interesting dialogue between the station
 

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.400
interesting dialogue between the station
and the stadium and we had the only fan

literally the whole city came alive and

literally the whole city came alive and
 

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.980
literally the whole city came alive and
there were parties happening along the

there were parties happening along the
 

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.510
there were parties happening along the
route and particularly at the station

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520
route and particularly at the station
 

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.700

fairly recently and I saw this image

space internally I had a number of

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:05.390
space internally I had a number of
 

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.359
space internally I had a number of
challenges looking at particularly the

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:07.369
challenges looking at particularly the
 

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:10.030

the way that the space was structured
 

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.160
the way that the space was structured
there was poor lighting there were

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.170
there was poor lighting there were
 

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.609
there was poor lighting there were
informal traders all over the space so

00:40:14.609 --> 00:40:14.619
informal traders all over the space so
 

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:17.470
informal traders all over the space so
visual access was quite difficult there

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480
visual access was quite difficult there
 

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.410
visual access was quite difficult there
was no signage or advertising strategy

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:20.420
was no signage or advertising strategy
 

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.900
was no signage or advertising strategy
the space was not compliant in terms of

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:22.910
the space was not compliant in terms of
 

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.420
the space was not compliant in terms of
emergency evacuation so I had to develop

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:25.430
emergency evacuation so I had to develop
 

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.260
emergency evacuation so I had to develop
a design in which all of these sort of

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.270
a design in which all of these sort of
 

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.030
a design in which all of these sort of
problems could be dealt with and the

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040
problems could be dealt with and the
 

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.829
problems could be dealt with and the
solution was quite simple open the

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839
solution was quite simple open the
 

00:40:32.839 --> 00:40:34.299
solution was quite simple open the

but essentially again have a

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.380
but essentially again have a
 

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.410
but essentially again have a
relationship where as you come off from

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:41.420
relationship where as you come off from
 

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.360

the trains you can almost see the city

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:43.370
the trains you can almost see the city
 

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.010
the trains you can almost see the city
as soon as you arrive so again that your

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.020
as soon as you arrive so again that your
 

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.600
as soon as you arrive so again that your
sense of journey is that you don't get

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:46.610
sense of journey is that you don't get
 

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.430
sense of journey is that you don't get
off into a train into a dark space and

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440
off into a train into a dark space and
 

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.080
off into a train into a dark space and
then back into the city but you have a

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.090
then back into the city but you have a
 

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.740
then back into the city but you have a
seamless transition and I think this is

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:53.750
seamless transition and I think this is
 

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.820
seamless transition and I think this is
probably one of the more successful

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:54.830
probably one of the more successful
 

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.480
probably one of the more successful

people gathering hanging out and it's

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.030
