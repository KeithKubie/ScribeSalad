MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.770
WAYNE SUTTON: I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.540
We're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.239
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.170
globally.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.400
MELINDA EPLER: Welcome
to this series sponsored

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.260
by Women Techmakers,
Google's program that

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.720
provides visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.234
for women in technology.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:26.650
Together we're helping tech
hubs to develop more inclusive

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.869
cultures, programs, and spaces.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.910
WAYNE SUTTON: Let's start
with external programs.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.830
They are the key
driver in developing

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.940
a more inclusive tech ecosystem
in your city, town, or region.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.579
These programs might
include events--

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.120
MELINDA EPLER:
startup office hours--

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.453
WAYNE SUTTON: lunch-and-learns--

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:44.140
MELINDA EPLER: evening classes,
training, workshops, and more.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.330
WAYNE SUTTON: We know a thing
or two about hosting events,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.830
as our own company,
Change Catalyst,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.320
hosts tech inclusion
conferences, career fairs,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.660
and startup showcases
attracting thousands

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.950
of attendees each year.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.170
Events can expand your
reach and exposure

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.880
to under-represented
communities.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.650
Opening your doors to
diverse programming

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.430
can broaden your networks for
internal hiring, membership,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.251
mentors, instructors, et cetera.

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.750
MELINDA EPLER: Creating diverse
programs takes work, though.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.249
For example, when Wayne and I
were developing our first tech

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.450
inclusion conference, which is
an event focused on solutions

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.046
to diversity inclusion,
we realized with about 2/3

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:17.920
of the speakers signed
up, that we were still

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.490
missing some key demographics,
specifically Latinos--

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.620
not Latinas, just Latinos--

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.060
veterans, and people
with disabilities.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.900
So we took the time to widen
our network, put in the work,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.760
and rounded out
the diverse lineup.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.780
WAYNE SUTTON: Diverse
people are out there.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.310
We just might not know them.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.290
It takes time to
broaden your network.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.580
But through research and asking
questions, you'll reach them.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.660
Sometimes it's as
easy as asking friends

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.140
on social media for
diversity and inclusion

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.300
experts or diverse speakers.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.515
Also check out some of the
resources we listed below.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:50.140
MELINDA EPLER:
Partnering with programs

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.820
that focus on diverse
community signals

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.510
that your organization cares
about and values inclusion.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.260
WAYNE SUTTON: Invite
diverse organizations

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.270
to host their events
in your facility

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.370
or in partnerships
with your organization.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.600
MELINDA EPLER: Then
give them the space,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.430
support them as much
as you can, and spread

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.264
the word about their
event to your networks.

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:06.763
WAYNE SUTTON: And
remember, it's not

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:08.440
enough to simply
host diverse people.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.370
You need to show up, meet them,
and let them know you care.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.960
Establish partnerships
to help spread

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.870
the word of your programs
to more diverse groups.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.000
You can exchange
exposure on your website

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.050
as an incentive for the group.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.160
Pay to put an ad
in the newsletter.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.050
Or find another creative
way to work together.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.240
If it's an event
you share, offer

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.379
a promo code for the community
and a free ticket to join you.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.670
MELINDA EPLER: To develop a
truly inclusive and diverse

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.950
event, here are some
things to consider.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.260
Topics-- make sure
that your event topics

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.096
appeal to diverse audiences.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.470
WAYNE SUTTON:
Speakers-- speakers

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.210
should fully
represent the audience

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.320
you are trying to reach.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.986
Make sure that they
are diverse in terms

00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:50.230
of gender, race, ability, age,
and other characteristics.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.540
MELINDA EPLER: Outreach--
while promoting your events,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.623
always look for different
networking channels that

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:56.410
include under-represented
individuals.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.285
WAYNE SUTTON: Timing--
the timing of an event

00:02:58.285 --> 00:02:59.800
can make a big
difference to people

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.090
who are parents,
caregivers, currently

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.250
working, or commuting.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.840
MELINDA EPLER: Cost--
consider a sliding scale.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.440
Give discount or free
codes to new communities.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.894
And even make some events free.

00:03:09.894 --> 00:03:11.310
WAYNE SUTTON:
Accessibility-- make

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.050
sure you ask for accessibility
needs and requests ahead

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.207
of time on your website
and email communication.

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:17.790
MELINDA EPLER: And
if someone requests

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.680
a sign-language interpreter,
live captioning, a guide,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.990
or something else, make
sure that person has what

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.344
they need to fully
participate in your event.

00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:27.760
If you need help with this,
check out the resources below.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.051
WAYNE SUTTON: Code of conduct--

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.510
a code of conduct is an
indicator to many people

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.101
that you care about
creating an inclusive event.

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:35.725
Make sure you post
this on your website

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:38.620
and in the physical
space and share on stage

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.940
at the beginning of events.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.160
MELINDA EPLER: Photos--
nothing says inclusion

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840
like visual representation.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.670
Include diverse photos
in the presentation

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.164
slides and marketing materials.

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:49.330
And also consider having
diverse people look through

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.250
your slides, photos,
and other marketing

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.490
materials to make sure you
haven't accidentally included

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.860
imagery that might
offend someone.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.600
Supply chain
diversity can be one

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.220
of the most impactful
opportunities

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.200
to expand your diversity goals.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.150
Look at using services
or products founded

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.562
by local under-represented
entrepreneurs.

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:08.020
WAYNE SUTTON:
Consider every vendor

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.710
you use, from software vendors
to office supplies to food

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.740
in your cafe and
any subcontractors.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.529
You might consider adding
to your hub's values

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.910
or formal process to prioritize
hiring under-represented people

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.410
as vendors.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.743
MELINDA EPLER: Studies show
that companies with supplier

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.470
diversity programs
are more profitable

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.870
and promote innovation by
introducing new products

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.970
and services.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.170
WAYNE SUTTON: Plus, it's
good for your local economy

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.130
and the community.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.046
MELINDA EPLER: Diversifying
your partnerships,

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:37.990
events, and vendors can quickly
change your hub's reputation

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.120
as a place where diverse
people are welcome and belong.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.840
A little extra work up front
to diversify your networks

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.220
can make a big difference
in the makeup of your hub

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.894
down the line.

00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:48.310

create inclusive tech hubs

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.400
around the world.
