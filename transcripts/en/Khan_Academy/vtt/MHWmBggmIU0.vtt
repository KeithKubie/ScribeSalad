00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:04.342
Voiceover: So, I claimed in the last
video that we made a $5 risk-free profit

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.225
by spending $38 to buy a call and a bond

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:14.339
and we got $43 by shorting a stock
and essentially writing a put option.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.959
What I want to do in this video is verify

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.340
that we really do have
all of our basis covered.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.091
So let's just think about all
of the different scenarios

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:25.066
for the underlying stock
price at option expiration

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.590
because that's the date
that we care about.

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:29.625
So let's take this situation
where the stock just becomes

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:32.335
where the stock just goes to 0.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.602
In that situation the call
that we own is worthless.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.572
The call is worthless.

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.746
No reason why you'd want to
exercise the option to buy it

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:43.671
for $35 when the stock is worth 0.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.077
But the good thing is, is that when
we now have to cover our short.

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:51.279
Remember, when you short something
you're borrowing the stock and selling it

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.492
and in the future you have to buy
the stock to cover your short.

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:57.778
To buy the stock and return it
to whomever you borrowed it from.

00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:00.836
So now, we can spend $0.

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:07.823
We can now spend $0, $0 to buy stock

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:10.864
and essentially give it back
to whom we borrowed it from

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:12.727
or should cover the short.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.746
To buy stock to cover or unwind short.

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:17.827
To cover the short.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.867
The bad thing is, is that
put option that we wrote.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:22.336
Remember, we wrote it.

00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:23.619
We sold the put option.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.802
We're giving someone
else the right to sell

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.935
to sell the stock to us for $35

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:32.485
and if the stock price is worth $0
they're going to exercise that option.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.335
Because they can then, they
can buy the stock for 0

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:37.964
and they can sell it to us for $35.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:43.741
So, we have to spend, we
have to spend $35 to buy ...

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:48.533
to kind of buy the stock from put holder.

00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:51.524
From put holder.

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:54.475
But the good thing is, is
that we have this bond,

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:57.096
we own this bond that's now worth $35.

00:01:57.573 --> 00:02:01.062
We have a $35 bond, 35.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.242
We have a $35 bond.

00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:08.164
So we can use the $35
bond to spend the $35

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.771
such to give the $35 to the holder of
the put and everything cancels out.

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:15.536
We can still keep our original $5.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.161
So, that's the situation where
the stock price went to 0.

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.335
What about the situation where the
stock price goes to something crazy?

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:22.939
Let's say the stock price goes to 70.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.825
So, the stock price goes up.

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:26.284
We draw a column over here.

00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:30.342
So, now let's think about the scenario
where the stock price goes to 70.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.332
Now all of a sudden the
call option we have,

00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:35.745
remember it's an option
to buy the stock at $35.

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:42.135
The call, the call is worth, is worth $35.

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:44.244
The call is worth $35.

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:46.945
We have a bond that's
going to be worth $35.

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:49.528
A bond worth 35.

00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:54.079
The put option is worthless so the
person who we wrote the put for

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.670
they won't exercise it.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.457
So, the put is worthless.

00:02:58.273 --> 00:03:02.410
The put is worthless but we
still have to cover our short.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.273
We have to buy back the stock

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:07.532
and return the stock to
whomever we borrowed it from

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:11.670
and now to cover our short, to buy
the stock is going to cost us $70.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.936
So, we're going to have to use this $70,

00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:17.495
the $35 from the call
and $35 from the bond

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.745
to actually cover our short positions.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:27.338
So $70 to buy stock and cover short.

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:31.607
What you'll see is I just picked
kind of a low, a low stock price

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.138
and a high stock price but no
matter what the stock price is

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:37.335
you're going to be able to
cover all of your obligations

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:42.271
and break even at expiration and
keep your original risk-free $5.

00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:45.498
Now the reality of the situation is that
opportunities like this seldom exist

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:47.832
because frankly people can
write computer programs

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:50.673
to find these arbitrage opportunities

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:53.003
and just exploit them
really, really, really fast.
