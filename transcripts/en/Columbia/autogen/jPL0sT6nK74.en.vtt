therefore and that's drawing by the day

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480
therefore and that's drawing by the day
 

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.210
therefore and that's drawing by the day
and therefore those populations are over

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:36.220
and therefore those populations are over
 

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.200
and therefore those populations are over
they are a specific population of great

it's happening in different parts of the
country so then you have to be able to

country so then you have to be able to
reach them in different places so the
