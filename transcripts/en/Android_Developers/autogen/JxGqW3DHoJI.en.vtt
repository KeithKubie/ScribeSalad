thought were interesting and
 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.290
thought were interesting and
automatically favorite them so we have

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300
automatically favorite them so we have
 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.179

finally that ability to store replay so
I think when I created this we said we

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920
I think when I created this we said we
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.170
I think when I created this we said we

you to do a bit more than that now

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.490
you to do a bit more than that now

you to do a bit more than that now
so what does it mean in terms of data

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:49.900
so what does it mean in terms of data
 

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.170
so what does it mean in terms of data
sand pouring grass for you but but quite

sand pouring grass for you but but quite
 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.540
sand pouring grass for you but but quite
interesting I think I think what's what

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.550
interesting I think I think what's what
 

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.800
interesting I think I think what's what
you're seeing here is that these are the

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:55.810
you're seeing here is that these are the
 

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.840
you're seeing here is that these are the
share opportunities per da you so you

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.850
share opportunities per da you so you
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.610
share opportunities per da you so you
can see that roughly speaking were ran

00:10:59.610 --> 00:10:59.620
can see that roughly speaking were ran
 

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.160
can see that roughly speaking were ran
about one share opportunity for every

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.170
about one share opportunity for every
 

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.960
about one share opportunity for every
single da you in the game now clearly

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:03.970
single da you in the game now clearly

having to go away think about how

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:17.830
having to go away think about how
 

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.230
having to go away think about how

day here's a way you can share a video

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:25.930
day here's a way you can share a video
 

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.630
day here's a way you can share a video
here's interesting you can put out into

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:27.640
here's interesting you can put out into
 

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.680
here's interesting you can put out into
the community and what we see is that

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:31.690
the community and what we see is that
 

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.560
the community and what we see is that
around 15 percent of those people who

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.570
around 15 percent of those people who
 

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.900
around 15 percent of those people who
have a share opportunity go on and share

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:36.910
have a share opportunity go on and share
 

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.970
have a share opportunity go on and share
it now which is a pretty impressive

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:38.980
it now which is a pretty impressive
 

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.770
it now which is a pretty impressive
conversion rate now we all think about

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:40.780
conversion rate now we all think about
 

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.450
conversion rate now we all think about
conversion rates and lots of our metrics

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:42.460
conversion rates and lots of our metrics
 

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.060
conversion rates and lots of our metrics
in this world and to get 15 percent from

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.070
in this world and to get 15 percent from
 

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.980
in this world and to get 15 percent from
something that isn't initiated by you

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:46.990
something that isn't initiated by you
 

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.140
something that isn't initiated by you
that's initiated by the game is a pretty

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.150
that's initiated by the game is a pretty
 

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.000
that's initiated by the game is a pretty
powerful level of conversion and what's

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.010
powerful level of conversion and what's
 

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.800
powerful level of conversion and what's
interesting to us is that stayed very

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:52.810
interesting to us is that stayed very
 

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.810
interesting to us is that stayed very
consistent so you can see obviously you

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:54.820
consistent so you can see obviously you
 

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.190
consistent so you can see obviously you
know the launch spike at the beginning

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200
know the launch spike at the beginning
 

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.690
know the launch spike at the beginning
but this is a game now with many

early stage of the development when I

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:07.269
early stage of the development when I
 

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:09.389
early stage of the development when I
mean early stage I mean very early in

00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399
