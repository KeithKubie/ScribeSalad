Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today is an Iraq war veteran, a political analysts at America's favorite Black Gay Republican. Rob Smith. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. Day America's favorite Black Gay Republican. That's a lot of pressure to put in a Twitter bio. You know, it's a lot of pressure. I feel that, um, about a year ago about this time, because I came out as conservative a year ago and I out as conservative about fascinating phrase that we're going to talk a little, get into that. Absolutely. But when I came out I said I want something pithy and catchy and kind of funny because it's a joke. Yeah. America's favorite Black Gay Republican. I want there to be as sense of humor in it because as you know, you know, you use humor to bring people in, then you hit them with the facts. So a lot of people are going to be going, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:50          These guys are supposed to hate identity politics. But he's saying he's America's favorite Black Gay Republican. Well, here's my thing with that. I think that there's a, number one, all politics is identity politics. So everybody does identity politics. The left does it in the right, does it, I think that since coming out as a conservative, the way I play identity politics is this, I'm black, I'm gay, I'm going to rock war veteran, I'm all these different things and they don't matter about my politics because I can be all of these things and still love America. And the way the left plays identity politics is we hate you, evil white men or you know, this is my 72 genders or all this stuff. So I feel like they use identity politics not only in a super negative and controlling way, but as a way to get people's votes.

Speaker 2:          01:35          80 sucks though, to kind of have to do a little bit of what they do to throw it in their face. Right. Cause like anytime, I don't mention that I'm gay that often, but anytime that I do, I have no problem mentioning it. Like I'm more than happy to talk about it. Yeah. But anytime that I do, it really only is to throw the use the way that they use gay people. Uh, it's to throw that back in their face like I have no, I don't want special credit for it. You know? I mean, there's, there's no special credit. I think that for me, when you get into my history and you know, I'm going to Iraq war veteran, I protested against, don't ask, don't tell. And I came out at 19 or I came out at 19 kind of like to myself and a couple of friends of my mother.

Speaker 2:          02:13          But when I got out of the military, I'd, we're on 21 years old because I had to serve under, don't ask, don't tell. I said I'm done with closets, so I'm going to be out as gay. So being gay to me has always kinda been a political act. And when I was protesting against, don't ask, don't tell, and getting arrested at the White House and doing all these different things, it was always a political act for me to be gay. So even coming out as a conservative and being on the right, and I'm proudly on the right, being gay is still a political act because I have to go into these spaces and say I'm gay and this is why that matters and this is how we can change the party and change the idea of conservatism to bring more people in. Do you ever find that conservatives have problems? We gave people, cause people keep telling me that all these conservatives hate gay people and I go to events all

Speaker 3:          03:00          over the place, all over the country, all over the world. And I meet all these conservatives. And I'm not saying there are none. I have no doubt there's a certain sect of Bible thumpers obviously that's still do or some people that have different religious beliefs. You know, Ben Shapiro from an Orthodox Jewish perspective, not thrilled with gay marriage, but now takes a libertarian approach to civil marriage. I'm okay with, I don't need him to bow to my beliefs, but I don't find that there's any real push back against gay people from conservatives anymore. I just don't see it. This is, yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:27          What I've seen and I've seen very, very little in the way of people having some problem with me being gay. The um, in my experience, and I've been, God, I, I spoke to the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City and I speak at these republican events all over the country and it's not so much I have a problem with you being gay. It's some people say, um, one, one person came up to me and she said, you know, you're so good looking and you're black and you know, you're all these things. Like why do you have to talk about the gay thing? And I told her, I was like, I talk about the gay thing because it's very important for me to talk about it because people need to know there are gay conservatives out there that follow me right now that are afraid to come out. And so I need to take this gain as to the space and let them know that it's okay. And also let you guys know that you're missing out on a base of millions of voters by, by doing things that can even be construed as it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:17          Do you think it's one of those things where it's sort of you have to do it so that it can get to the point that you don't have to do it? Is that really? Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:24          And I was having the, um, this conversation with, with Candace and I shared this at the blocks are rally over the weekend as well. Um, doing identity politics, you do it now so that at a certain point we don't have to do it anymore. So we have to say that I'm a gay republican or I'm a black republican or I'm a gay, black, conservative, whatever you want to say. Because as Americans we have to break all that stuff down and figure out what our identity as Americans is. And that's the point for me.

Speaker 3:          04:51          Yeah. All right. So I want to talk about what it's like coming out as a conservative, as a gay black man. The rest of it. But let, let's just back up. Yeah. All together. Tell me a little bit about growing up in a family, that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          05:02          So I am from Akron, Ohio. One of the biggest, um, things that people like to say to discredit black conservatives is that we were all born wealthy. We were all born upper, upper middle class. And what we're doing is we're just trying to protect our privilege. I'm from Akron, Ohio. You weren't in Bel Air. I was not in Bel Air. All right. I was in Akron, Ohio in check the stats on Akron, Ohio. Anybody that doesn't know where that is, um, went to the worst one of the worst public school systems in the state. You can look on the website right now. I can, public schools are rated d plus. So I came from a single mother household. You know, I, I came from all this stuff and my mother tells me this story now. I was too young to remember, but obviously I went to kindergarten in a school that was in my neighborhood and my mother tells me the story about going to see me in kindergarten one day.

Speaker 2:          05:55          And it was just, you know, 90% black school. She's just to the people who are just running around crazy. And she said, I had to pull you out of that school because I knew you weren't going to learn anything, send me to school all the way across town. Um, the school was, was mostly white that doesn't make it better or made it better, was the property taxes and it was just a, a more funded school. So I was able to get that kind of base, went back to my side of town for middle school and high school, which was just a terrible experience. I, and I tell people all the time when they asked me about, you know, sort of things in the world, in Western civilization, all that, I'm like, look, I went to Akron public schools. There are so many things that I just do not know.

Speaker 2:          06:33          Um, and so I had that experience. But in those days, and probably still today, somebody that looks like me, that comes from where I come from, if I'm not dribbling a basketball or doing whatever they like, they don't know what to do with you. So it's not tracked in the college. I wasn't attracted to any of these things. I graduated high school at barely, I think it was either 16 or barely 17 and just had no path. So I joined the military right out of high school because I needed a path. I needed a job. I needed something to do. I wish that I could say in, in my military service is great and I love this country. And that five years that I spent in the military is probably the the greatest thing I'll ever do. But I can't lie and say that as 17 years old, like I was so patriotic, I wanted to serve my country like that. And it was a way for me to move beyond.

Speaker 3:          07:22          Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well before we get to that, I can't let anyone mention basketball. I got a boy. You got any skills? And I don't, I'm the word black man ever. I like am terrible at basketball. I don't want to Brag, but I won most improved player of the New York City gay men's basketball this year. I think 2012 when I was already like 37 which could be most improved player at 37. That's not bad. That's pretty good. It's really good.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Funny that um, they have that gay basketball league there. There's a part of me that has always wanted to try it, but I know it'd be so great,

Speaker 3:          07:51          bad and there were guys dunking. I mean it's a serious, it's a serious you got, it's funny because I don't mind, I always, for me at least, and I wonder for you, like my sports and my sexuality had nothing to do with each other ever. Like I never brought my sexuality when I'm out on the court in any way. You know what I mean? Like it wasn't like that. The only reason I joined that league was at that point in my life when I came out late and I finally was like, Oh, let me just meet some, I didn't really like, like the bar scene or like, yeah, like I didn't, I didn't like that and I was like, Oh mate, if there's happened to be some gay people that also like basketball, maybe I'll find some friends. And I did find some friends there and it's like, and half of them, it's like you're gay. Really? Like when a guy like dunks on you and like some of those guys like almost went pro. That's how good they got. The weird thing about kind of like being gay in not only am I gay, I was so used to be a fat kid. Um, as well. So you're really going forward here. I'm like, I got everything. Did you have Olympic at any point? Did not have a was five. Like I said, I was like some fat black gay kids was not athletic at, so I

Speaker 2:          08:55          didn't discover because there are some sports I'm good at. I played in the Gay Volleyball League in New York City for a couple of years and now I'm a pariah since I came out as conservatives. Oh, GPA. I thought they were all telling Shannon, right? New York City gays, they're not, are not intolerant. This is not so much. I am shocked, but I discovered that I am athletic and I discovered that I'm great at volleyball, great at tennis, you know like like lifting weights, like being in shape. But that's kind of what I discovered about myself. Kind of like, I don't want to say later in life, but definitely post 30 that I actually, you know, have some sports skills.

Speaker 3:          09:30          Yeah. All right, good. So when you joined the military, where you were you already sort of out to yourself? Now I'm talking about sexuality and politics,

Speaker 2:          09:38          politics, NYSE, but certainly not a conservative thing. I was, I was out to myself I think in the way that a lot of gay teams are. You know, I knew that I was kind of like feeling away about guys that I was supposed to feel about girls, but I don't know if I could really kind of quantify it in that way. Um, and when I went into the military, they actually, in those days I actually asked you, are you gay? And I said, no, I'm not. Only because I, I didn't know how to define it at the time, but also I knew that that was a barrier to, to what I wanted to do, you know. So being in the military, I came out to myself, you know, started exploring my sexuality, exploring all of that stuff. And like I said, when I got done with the military, coming out was like a political act. I was like, no more closets.

Speaker 3:          10:21          Were you finding other gay people in the military? Like what is that? What was that like then? I mean, now, now where it's more accepted and donate that it doesn't exist or whatever

Speaker 2:          10:31          about, um, it's really funny how it is now is that there are entire Instagram accounts dedicated to gay guys in the military. It's called gay military dudes. And I love the fact that these bees, young gay men in the military, so open about, you know, their sexuality and their posting thought picks and they're doing all this like great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:50          Yeah. And you're saying the military hasn't crumbled since and it's causing demoralization or everyone's still okay.

Speaker 2:          10:57          We still, everybody still good. Okay. But back then there was this, this underground movement of, of gay people, gays and lesbians that were in the military. And I remember the very first pride I went to, I was, I'm, I was stationed in Fort Carson, Colorado, so like right on Colorado Springs. And my very first pride was Denver pride. So I went there, uh, I think it was like maybe 19 or 20 at the time. And that was my first time being around a lots of other gay men at the same time. And it was the first time that, um, you know, I was, I was getting attention from men and then like people were looking at me and I was like, oh, he's cute. And I was like, oh, so this is what this is like. Um, so there was a thriving underground gay culture in the military.

Speaker 3:          11:39          Were you afraid to go out and go to a gay pride parade while you're at serving? Absolutely,

Speaker 2:          11:45          because it's like if don't ask, don't tell was tricky because it was not only, you can't tell somebody that you're gay, but if you were discovered be gay, then people would, um, you know, go up the chain of command and kick you out. But the thing about it is, and this is what we always realize, that nobody would care because there are plenty of guys in my unit that, that knew I was gay and a funny story, there was a club called, I think it's now different called hide and seek in Colorado Springs and they used to be open to people under 21 after 2:00 AM. So I would be, yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be open at 21. Uh, it would be open to people under 21 after 2:00 AM because it'd be like open till five and um, they wouldn't be serving any booze. So I was young in the military.

Speaker 2:          12:27          I was like maybe 20 years old. I would take a nap at 10 30 at night. I wake up at one 30, I would put on, I had like black leather pants and a tank top is insane, crazy. Um, and then drive to hide and seek and dance all night. And it was kind of, it was a more gay crowd, but it was mixed as well. And I saw a couple of my sergeants there. Wow. The time at the club and they saw me, they saw me and they saw me and they were like, okay, this is interesting. And they saw me kind of like dancing with some red head and, you know, feeling my oats, you know what I mean? Feeling myself. But I remember being terrified that weekend that they were going to out me, that they were gonna like tell my superiors or whatever. It never did well, but you had it on them too, right? I mean, no, they weren't gay. They were, they were just like, they with their growth

Speaker 3:          13:12          friends because it was like, oh wow. I just had a completely different story going on in my head for the last 30 seconds. Yeah, no, they were there with their girlfriends, their hour spot. Oh, whoa. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And so they did. They did

Speaker 2:          13:26          bust me out in a lot of these guys are still my friends to this day, my Facebook friends and they see all the stuff that they're doing. I'm here there and coming out as a Republican. I'm doing all this and they're like, Smith, you know, we always knew you were gay. We just didn't care.

Speaker 3:          13:38          Yeah. Cause you're a good soldier. So I know what most gay people feel about being in the closet. Just how you can be as a person. It's just, you know, you're, you're, I always felt like I was like lying all the time accidentally. Like I was, it wasn't even intentionalized people would ask me something and I could immediately, you know, where were you last night? And I could just lie without thinking, you know, it's really, it's a really twisted, dark. It's not fun to think back on that kind of thing. Um, but for someone in the military during don't ask, don't tell. Do you think that affected your ability to function as a, as a soldier? And I think it did. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:12          Says the, I think that to me the biggest thing about being closeted in the military was that it affected the relationships that I was able to have with my fellow soldiers. There was a wall there and if I was able to just be gay and nobody cared, that wall wouldn't be there. And, and it's so important when you're serving with people to be able to be close to them. Like literally to be able to, to bring your full self to work. Because not only were we serving together, I mean we deployed together, you know, I did a tour in Kuwait, I did a tour in a ripe, these are the people that you're with. These are basically your family and you have to hide a part of yourself and all the, that they were hanging out or doing things that we could become closer. I was separating myself from that because I knew that there was a part of me that had to hide.

Speaker 2:          14:59          And so when I bring all of that stuff now too, to being gay and being open as a conservative and everything, it is so important for me to be open in that way because there I can't have that wall there between me and other conservatives and me and other people in the movement. And the younger conservatives have been s like, these kids don't care. They don't care. Some of the older ones need to kind of be brought around a little bit, but man, they don't care. Do you think it's just because young people somehow have started to embrace a more libertarian view of the world? I mean, it's like we've got sort of, you know, crazy leftism. On one hand you seems to be catching fire all the time. It's really pushed on us by the media. But then I see, and I guess it's a little selected by, by who invites me to these schools, but I see such a strong libertarian like spirit with these kids.

Speaker 2:          15:48          Not meaning that they're all politically libertarians at every level, but like they just, they want to live their lives. They want to love who they love, they want to smoke whatever they want to smoke or whatever. And, and I'm very enthused by that. I think that the, the generation right now, they really do just, they just want to let people live and they want to let people do their thing. They don't care about gay, they don't care about transgender, they don't care about any of these different things. They just want to let people live. And it's really funny, like the conversation I had last night, I'm at Ucla, I had an event. And it's so funny because when I was protesting against don't ask, don't tell, I was, I was, you know, doing a lot of lecture work and I was talking with the young LGBT student groups and I was just like, you know, you can be anything you want to be.

Speaker 2:          16:31          Let's empower you. Like, let's do all this stuff. And I'm having these same conversations with young people who are afraid to come out as conservative. Same thing. Date. Yeah, no, it is. All right. So let's just dive into that then too, because I really do feel this now because I find, I know what the closeted thing was like, as, as in terms of sexuality, but I see this now the amount of emails that I get and when I meet people on the street and they'll kinda whisper it to me, you know, it's not even, they're not even saying, yeah, well they'll go hit Dave and then they'll go, it's not even like they're saying they are conservative per se. They're basically just saying they're not a progressive yeah. That they're not, they don't come from the woke monster. You know what I mean? And I, and they're walking around with that, that feeling that you described a moment ago related to sexuality where you can't be fully there with someone.

Speaker 2:          17:17          And I think there are, there are quite literally, I think there were millions of people in the United States that are walking around in a closeted stand, not because they're Nazis are white supremacists are haters are racist, but just because they happen to have either some conservative beliefs or uh, some libertarian beliefs or something like that. And I see it all the time and I'm sure you probably get 10 times as many messages as I do, but you see it and when you go have these conversations, it is the same conversations that I was having with a young gay kids that were afraid to come out. I had a conversation with the kid last night. He was just like, man, how do I come out to my friends is conservative or how do I come out to my friends as somebody who's like not a leftist? And this is what I always say to them.

Speaker 2:          17:59          You know, the real ones will stick around the fake ones. We'll go, I promise you that. And when, like a year ago, I remember sitting, I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and I was thinking about, I know from my experience, you know, being very prominent in, in the don't ask, don't tell thing that when you come out as something, like you're coming out to make a statement and it has to be a media moment and you have to get your face out there because that's what gives other people the strength to come out. And I was like, man, if I don't do this, somebody else is going to do this because I know I'm not the only black gay republican out there. I have fans that are, that are Black Gay Republicans and Latina Lesbian Conservatives and all sorts of stuff. Um, but I was like, if I don't do this, somebody else is gonna do this and somebody needs to do this because these people need to know that it's okay. And when I take the hits and you take the hits and Candice takes the hits and all of these other people takes the hits, it makes it easier for these other people to come out.

Speaker 3:          18:59          So I've asked a lot of my guests that have taken those heads. Yeah. This question, I usually ask it at the end, but what do you think it is about you that allows you to, to want to take the hit or maybe not even want to, that you do whether you want to or not.

Speaker 2:          19:12          I'm telling you the army built something that is indestructible, indestructible. I served for five years. I saw some things on a rock. I saw some things overseas and in not even outside of that. What the basic training does is it just builds you up and as somebody that has a lot of discipline that can take a lot of hits and I know enough about media and I know enough about the people that are making the moves right now. I know that it is important for me to do this because, and I'm telling you, they have, and you've probably seen the shift in the past five to seven years since you've been doing this and have really been blown up and traveling all the, all the world. There's a shift that's going on and I believe it's real. And in three to five years, me being a black gay conservative, this is going to be like, you know, whatever. And I hate the fact that the gay community, I'm, I'm Kinda my am ex communicated now, you know, so I'm not getting invites to the

Speaker 3:          20:15          thrilled with me there. Yeah, we should start our own awards. We totally should do the, the, the gate free thinkers. Right.

Speaker 2:          20:21          You know, but you get excommunicated and they're, they're very high level people that, I mean I used to get invited to, to all this stuff in New York City because I was a gay person in the media. And when I came out last year it was like, it was like silent.

Speaker 3:          20:37          So what does that really tell you about these organizations? And sorta like glad and these other organizations that they're there for gay people, they're supposed to be for gay people and, and if they subscribe to intersectionality, they should be

Speaker 2:          20:48          for black people. And the rest of it. But you're saying you were in that they loved you. You come out as conservative. We're done with you would, it tells me is number one, that these organizations are not for all Lgbtq people. Therefore, Lgbtq, um, democrats, first of all, these are leftist organization. People really need to understand this. I know I say it all the time, but like I think that because people just think glad is for gay people. This is for this per, and it's like, no, that's not really what's going on here. But it really takes work to get people to fully understand why that is true. And there used to be, and we talked about this a little bit before we started, before we started filming, there used to be a part of me that wanted nothing more than to be kind of like a gay celebrity in life.

Speaker 2:          21:33          Oh, I get to go, I get to go to the glad media awards and I get to go to the HRC red carpets and I get to, to be, and now I realize that what I'm doing right now is so much bigger than any of that stuff. And I'm not, I'm doing this not for fame or, because the concept of fame has been very strange to me and in grappling with, with this newfound attention. But it's not about being with some delist. I'm gay celebrities on the red carpet. It's certainly not about being with, even though I love the way, usually the ones that they're putting on the red carpet, they're not even gay half the time. Oh yeah. I told you I used to do these red carpets when I had a show on our Q and I was, so I was interviewing people.

Speaker 2:          22:14          I was on the other side of the red carpet and mostly it was just housewives of New York drunk. These drunk plastic women that are like, ah, I'll have them gave, let me tell you something and I can tell you a story and she will remain nameless. But I was actually at, Huh? Oh, I can tell you the name of it, so yeah. Yeah. But I was on one of these award shows and this was obviously before I came out when I was still getting invited and this person was H's, a drunken sloppy mess. And I'm just like, how is this celebrating gay people? How is this elevating us? And so what you have is with the glads of the world, this is about bullying Hollywood celebrities in the thinking that you know what, if you don't, if you don't show up to our red carpet events, you're not supporting, you know, the Lgbtq community.

Speaker 2:          23:00          So that's what, what, what that's all about. Um, the HRC is obviously of leftist organization like very much so I left this organization and what irritates me about this entire thing is that these organizations were not started as leftist organizations. They weren't supposed to be left as well. Cause at that time they wanted real equality. You didn't want it to quality under the law. They wanted the things that we have right now. But to continue to get funding, to continue to be data centers for the Democratic Party, they have to go with whatever far left craziness. And it's the intersectionality cold. And it's, it's being lectured by a queer Muslim at the glad media where it's about how gays aren't inclusive enough for, for Islam and, and about, you know, how you, how the LGBT community needs to accept undocumented people who are just like all this stuff that was never, it's never what our movement was about.

Speaker 2:          23:56          And at the same time for me as a gay man, I know that um, HIV aids rates among young black gay men are still exploding. Um, we have a huge problem with meth. There's real stuff's still going on. So what should they have done then? Was there a moment that there should've been a course correction? So say gay marriage gets passed on. Ask. Don't tell is yeah. What do you think the organization's, if they had done it right? I mean, is it, is it, do they close up shop? Do they well, that's what I think. That's what they were afraid of. They were afraid of. Now that we have this quote unquote true equality that the close up shop Chris, Chris rock that had been one of his great lines, the cops need a certain amount of crime. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that would happen after, don't ask, don't tell repeal a marriage equality were two of the biggest gay rights wins of our generation.

Speaker 2:          24:44          Like I think of our lifetime. And after that happened, I think that they just needed something else. They needed some more funding, they needed to, to continue to be relevant. So they'd gone into all of this intersectionality far left insanity. And what I see from being so open and being a gay conservative out here is that there is a large group of gays and lesbians that are conservative that want nothing to do with the leftist nonsense. They don't want to vote with their sexual orientation. They want to vote for their values, they want to vote with their pocket books. You know, they, they, they want to vote based on who they are. So you're saying, let me get this straight. Gay people are just like everybody else. Just like everybody else stayed. Just like everybody's getting just crazy, right nuts in the same. And you'd think so where are, where are the, the right gay organizations.

Speaker 2:          25:37          Are there any, I mean like the log cabin Republicans, are there anybody that you're out there and you're like, oh, you guys are doing some good grassroots related to the eye issues. It's always, it's never going to be the HRCS and the glads of the world. It's always the grassroots organizations. It's your, your, your um, Columbus pride. You know, it's, you're the Brooklyn Community Pride Center. It's like these are the organizations that are money really needs to go to because these organizations are doing work on the ground to like give young LGBT people access to jobs and education and all the stuff that the glads and the HRC is of the world claim that they're fighting for. But really they're just paying a lot of big wigs, sick, like insane six figure salaries and, and trying to get Madonna on a red carpet. And God loved Madonna. We don't love Madonna, but that's not the word.

Speaker 2:          26:32          So I always try to elevate the smaller organizations because they need the time and the money more than the big ones. For the record, I'm more of a Tina Turner guy. You Remember Tina Turner? I hear she gives an amazing show. I haven't been yet. I've never, well I don't think she's going live anymore. I think she's done tore and I think she like, she moved to like Sweden or something. I think she gave up her us citizenship and she's just riding it out and man. Ah, but um, I, I would, I will say about Madonna. The gays are going to kill me. I saw her one time and it wasn't great. I saw her once. New York, uh, confessions, confessions on the dance floor. It wasn't, it was Mbna oh, that's the one. Yeah. That was the whole dance album, right? We know confessions was the dance out.

Speaker 2:          27:13          Okay. So that day was like in 2012 I think that was odd. Mtma when I went to the, you went, that's okay. I paid a lot of money for those tickets. We were at Madison Square Garden somewhere out in jars. I was at Madison Square Garden, I was way up there in the rafters and I was just like, yeah, yeah, I'll wait until I'll wait until they're at the Farewell Vegas tour where she finally does all the things that people want to hear. Right, right. Well, age wise, she's, she's getting there. Yeah. But you know, she keeps it together. She keeps it together. She does. She does. All right. Let's, uh, let's talk a little bit about, I've heard candidates talk about how most black people actually are conservatives, but they sort of don't know it or they can't accept it because of the way the media has treated black people.

Speaker 2:          27:53          That the default position is you must be a democrat. Yeah. Do you sense that, I sensed that. And to get into that, you really have to understand how deeply entrenched this idea that black people have to be Democrats is. And, and I said this a little bit, uh, on the vice thing that I did, we have black celebrities, entertainers, ball players, athletes from the top of the charts to the answer, the thought with 10,000 followers. These are all people that are pushing leftists. You know, they are pushing leftists tactics and black people. We more so than I think other races. We look for representation in media and we look for representation and pop culture and these are our heroes. These are the people that we want to be like. And that's one of the reasons why this idea that we have to be on the left is so firmly entrenched.

Speaker 2:          28:48          So why, why do you think that is looking for sort of elsewhere, do you think that has something to do with the black family and some of the stuff that Larry elder would talk about? It has everything to do with, with Larry elders talking about literally odor will tell you, and I'm pretty sure he did that. The number one kicked the shit out of me. That's what woke me up. Yeah. But leary elder will tell you that the number one problem in the black community is black poppin listeners, right? That we don't have men in the homes. And so when there's not a man in the home, when there's not a man to, to raise that young man in the home, they look to athletes, ball players, the Collin, Kaepernick's, whoever. And so when Colin Kaepernick, just to give an example, if some kids he wrote right and he sees Colin Kaepernick taking a knee for black lives matter, and that's where he's getting his politics from because that kid doesn't know who I am.

Speaker 2:          29:38          They can certainly doesn't know who Larry elder is and the fact that kid is not gonna know who Larry elder is is a shame. You know what I mean? And so that's the message that we get. Even though black people do tend to be a little bit more conservative, just in terms of if you, for example, said that black people need fathers in the home and we need to stop having kids out of wedlock and we need to start doing all of these things that will elevate ourselves. You're a racist. I would say. I would say everyone, regardless of race, should have those things to the best of their ability. Not to say it can't happen otherwise. You just said you were raised by your mother. I want to do turned out pretty good. [inaudible] those outlier cases. Yeah. But at the same time I was, I went to military for five years and so the military taught me, the military gave me a male influence.

Speaker 2:          30:25          Um, multiple male influences. The military taught me how to be a man. The military taught me discipline. The military taught me courage and military taught me self control. The military taught me reliance, all of the things that a father is supposed to teach you. And so now me as a, as a gay black man saying these things, you know, if you're a white person, you know, you're white supremacist or whatever. But I'm sorry about that, you know? Yeah. I'm, I'm the COO and I'm the uncle Tom, I'm whatever. And there is this very huge movement of like very far left gay black men who it seems like they have these large online platforms and it seems like their entire goal in life is to just tear down straight black man or tear down the idea of masculinity or tear down the idea that our boys need men in the homes to teach them how to be men.

Speaker 2:          31:17          So they want to tear that down. And when I look at their platforms and I look at the things that they say, and sometimes they come after me and I ignore it because none of those people are my enemy. There is nobody that is out there that's a public figure that looks like me. That is not my enemy, that is my, these people are not my enemy. But when I look at the platform that they have, I say, you have so many people listening to you. Why are you always preaching divisiveness and hatred? Why are you trying to tear down black men? We should be lifting each other up. We should be empowering each other because you know our community meets. Yeah. Well, it seems to me that mostly, and it's not just with say those black men, but anyone that buys in to the far left ideology, they want conformity and they, there is some sort of, as I say all the time, Peter Boghossian, he's been on the show many times, calls this postmodern ideology a secular religion and they don't want a pasta date and they especially don't want to pass states that look like you.

Speaker 2:          32:14          That's crazy. I've never, I've never really heard that. I mean, I've talked about that idea and some of my lectures, but I've never heard it say quite like that because this is my thing. And one of the best things that happened for me over the past year is that I found religion and I found God because I will tell you, and you probably know there and I don't know, I don't know what your religion is, but for me there's a lot of people that are running after Twitter, followers and fans and Instagram followers and fame and money and all this other stuff and not, there's not an amount of Twitter followers or fame or any of that stuff that is going to fill that hole that you're looking to fill. And Twitter followers don't feel the existential void things out. What you telling me you do not the black hole of existence you've got filled by Instagram line is nodding.

Speaker 2:          33:02          You've got like 10 times my following. And when, when things started taking off a little bit last year, like when, when my life started getting bigger in some other ways, I had to make things smaller. Um, and so I made my circle smaller and, and I tried to get close with my husband and my best friends, but I also found God. And it is when you not religious before, were you not, were you, were you specifically not a believer before? No, not at, not at all. I was raised in the church African Methodist Episcopal. Um, so the AME church, like I was there. And when you're young and black in the church churches a full, like an all day event, I'm there at 10:00 AM for Sunday school and then you do the service and then it's two 30 dinner. You're like, you're not out of there until after dark. But I think that in my first 11 years in the city when I was kind of doing some of the, don't ask them until activism and trying to find my path, I was looking for fulfillment in all of those things that I told you before.

Speaker 2:          33:57          And when I started getting those things, I realized that not that it wasn't enough, but there needs to be something else to ground me. And one of the biggest things that the super far left tells young gay people is that God is your enemy and Christians are your enemy. And Evangelical Christians want to put you in conversion campaign and just all of this crazy stuff to separate them from relation so that this far left ideology becomes their religion. And I say that, you know, God is a gift in my life right now. And I say that and I'm not embarrassed by that anymore and I don't feel like that's something that I should be ashamed to talk about. Even as a, as a gay man. Somebody described me on, on Twitter when I think it's funny and they said, um, former military leftist turn right wing Bible thumping from tarred.

Speaker 2:          34:51          And I thought that, that a lot of words, a lot of where it was hysterical. I showed that to my husband. We both cackled I don't hear you Bible. Nothing. No, I mean I'm not, you may, maybe a Trump card and I, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right wing Trump tart. I don't Bible thump. I just, I talk that I talk about religion in my life and how it's grounded me and how it's become just a really powerful guiding force and it is fulfilling and it is grounding in a way that, let me tell you something as a young gay man, like, like all the sex, all the partying, all that stuff, like I did it all and there's, there's nothing in that. And for me it is becoming grounded in religion and God. Do you think a lot of gay people have like an extra struggle when it comes to sort of be questions?

Speaker 3:          35:38          Cause I know I definitely did like that. You are something that society tells you at least, you know, how old are you? How old are you? I am I allowed to ask how old you are. I just get to the one question that I get it. I'm in my thirties you're in your thirties wow. Wow. Yeah. All right. So that's how it is. Well I as an elder, I am 42 years. Okay. So, you know, when I was in say high school and college, you know, this way before gay marriage, you know, during don't ask, don't tell, and I never really saw sort of a functional future. I, it's not that I saw at dysfunctional future, I just saw no future. I was just like, I'm now and I'm just going to keep living now. So something like that. Um, but I do think for a lot of gay people that causes like this weird belief schism or something like that. So it's interesting to hear that just in the last year you've come back to some of this stuff and I think a lot of people have, by the way,

Speaker 2:          36:32          they are in, in, in I want them to, and it's like, so we, we tell the, I guess I don't, I don't want to say right wingers anymore because I guess I'm a right winger now, but they always say that, you know, you can't call gay lifestyle because it's my sexual orientation as a lifestyle. But there are elements of it that are very lifestyle oriented. The, the party lifestyle, the circuit party culture, the gay culture. Like all of that other stuff. Um, I don't like any of that stuff. Yeah. I like the golden girls who doesn't like the golden girls. I love like gay enough for me. You know what I mean? I watched three hours of the golden girls on a Sunday morning. I'm very happy. But the cool thing right now is that people like you and people like me can reach these young people and they can see something that is outside of all of that messiness. And I come to it is not somebody that judges it, but if somebody that did it all now, I never did drugs. That was never, I was never a druggie. I don't even like smoking weed. They say that people that are better, a little neurotic and I'm a little neurotic. They say we doesn't go well with us and it doesn't go well with me, so I never did the drugs. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          37:35          Yeah. I haven't found the right [inaudible] good, but I get it. You're a conservative now.

Speaker 2:          37:38          Yeah. No, it's not even that because some them, and it's really funny, I'm like to the right of some people in marijuana legalization, but that's a whole nother issue. We can go there, but yeah, good. But I did all the partying. I did all of the circuit parties and I traveled and kissing boys and having lots of sex. It's like I did all that and I fundamentally know that there's nothing there. And I think that the problem with reaching these kids right now is that I am like, it feels lonely because it really does feel like I'm one of maybe three or four people that like have these large platforms and obviously you as well, but they see people that are like, you know, they see the drag queens and the Hollywood celebrities and all that other stuff. I just really want these kids to see that they can have a more grounded life. And not that I'm trying to be anybody's role model in a way because I'm like, my thing is I did all the mess. So you don't have to.

Speaker 3:          38:33          Yeah, I feel very, even though I didn't do the math, I mean I did do my own mess in a way. Yeah. Like, and I did, I did do the drugs and I did do all that. But I wasn't really into the scene, let's say. But I do feel that too. I'm not trying to be anyone's role model at all. 100% not failure. Yeah. And I lived through, if anything, I would say I lived through shit to get to where I am. So that hopefully the next that that gay kid that's 18 doesn't have to do it. You know what I mean? And yeah, we're living right. Cause everyone's got shit. We're on the right. And the people that came before me lived through far more than that. So there's an interesting parallel here with the way Hollywood treats all of this. Because you mentioned something about, or just a moment ago, you mentioned how, uh, the black culture puts more emphasis on Hollywood and these figures and everything.

Speaker 3:          39:22          And I was thinking like, even just in the Oscars last year that Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar. Now I've seen every, so I think we're going to have a little difference here because I, I've seen every marvel movie I just saw I end game a couple of days ago, uh, as what's going to make me go see it at this weekend. I don't want to say anything right now, but um, but I've seen every one of the movies. I love superhero movies. I Love Star Wars, love all that stuff. Black Panther was a very average movie there. There was, in my opinion, there was nothing racist.

Speaker 2:          39:48          Same for same racist.

Speaker 3:          39:51          Well guess what? Why are you all of you said it too, but he's a self hating. Black guys just can't win here button. But my point is, but it was within the scheme of superhero movies, none of them get nominated for anything and that's fine. But it was very average. It in my opinion, it was just a very average movie and it got nominated for all these things and I saw the media was like, ah, see Black Panther. Got It. Like, like it was some major wins that would somehow make people more equal or feel better. Or now we can look at the numbers and go this many black films, this and this many white is. And I was like, it just seems to me that the aim is just so off of where you should go for the price, the real price.

Speaker 2:          40:29          No, and I agree with you on that personal, I love Black Panther. I really do. Like I'm a, I'm a huge,

Speaker 3:          40:33          yeah, no, it's perfectly fine. But you got an Oscar Award winning nominated for that.

Speaker 2:          40:39          She make a really good point in minority communities and specifically the two groups that I'm a part of, blacks and, and, and gay people. We always look for representation in the media as some sort of barometer of progress. And that's a trap. It's a huge, it's a big Tridell Chinese people do it. Yeah. Because they're focused on making money. And when I tell him and I'm all about it, and when I go give these lectures, and I told people that the biggest way for any group of people to achieve any kind of power is financially. It is not through Oscar nominations. And that stuff is great and it's amazing, but it's, it's kind of like these, these are false idols because Black Panther is great for visual representation and it's great that all those people on the stage, and I personally think this amazing movie, but what that does for the young black kid that's struggling in the high school that I went to right now, not much.

Speaker 2:          41:40          Not much. Right. Um, and, and we do it as gays and lesbians as well. If, you know, if somebody comes out and look at the, look at the, the, the, the Buddha judge thing right now. Yeah. Um, look at how people in this is somebody that is, I mean, I'm not a Buddhist meditator at all, but I, it seems to me, you know, I, I see the game, I see what's going on and I see the way that he picked the fight with pence to, to ingratiate himself to the far left though. Use it. Like, I get it, I see it. But just the idea that any power comes from media representation, it's, it's false hope. It also separates the people from what should be the end goal. Because I think that empowerment for any of our communities only comes through entrepreneurship. Look at this, look at that.

Speaker 2:          42:28          That is your name. On that sign, you are an entrepreneur. And if somebody had given me the message about entrepreneurship when I was 1718 1920 God knows where I'd be by now. And one of the biggest things that I've gotten out of out of become a conservative and kind of moving over to the right is the fact that entrepreneurship and capitalism is not a bad thing in my, both of our communities need more of it, but especially my black community, we need more entrepreneurship. We need more job creators. We need to stop looking for representation in the media to, to, to elevate ourselves or to make us feel good about ourselves.

Speaker 3:          43:07          So when you see then the Democrats, so just in the last couple of weeks, yeah, there's now this debate suddenly about reparations and I, I saw the video of Senator Elizabeth Warren talking about reparations and she's going to commission a panel about reparations. And my first thought, the first thing that just popped into my head as I was watching it was, holy shit,

Speaker 2:          43:27          Candice did it.

Speaker 3:          43:29          You know what I mean? Like whatever anyone thinks it. Candace, she created enough of a crack in that layer that that caused black people to either be completely afraid of saying they're conservatives are just, just say that they're not Democrats. Yeah. That now the Democrats are like, Oh shit, what do we got left? Here's money. Could you take,

Speaker 2:          43:49          yeah, I bet some money in the words of the Great Candice Owens, fear in handouts is what they have to offer black people this cycle, and it is no mistake, first of all, that Donald Trump got more African American votes in the two previous Republican nominees combined. That is just the fact, and it is no mistake that you know what? You know people say a lot about the black set movement and they say it's not real. It's not that. And what I tell people is that you're going to see Republicans make a bigger play for the black vote than you had ever seen before. I think in the history of this country, and it's not going to come through fear and handouts, it's gonna come from talking to the people that are the real job creators in the real entrepreneurs and saying that these policies will help you create. And the fact that reparations is even a conversation right now among the Democrats means that they're scared.

Speaker 2:          44:40          Um, I, I just did a video for, for turning point about reparations and, and not to spoil any of that, but none other than Bayard Rustin who is one of the architects of the march on Washington, a huge civil rights leader who by the way was black and gay in the 60s. They interviewed Baird Rustin about reparations in 1969 and he said, it's, he said, this idea is ridiculous. And the quote is something like, if my great, great grandfather, you know, picked cotton than reparations are owed to him, but he's dead and nobody owes me anything. Yeah. But this is how they're going to try to buy the black vote. It's also just a crazy way of dividing this. Yes. Each other. I was at a cousin's wedding on my husband's side this past weekend and uh, was with the young guy who's 21, 22 and he was telling me about how woke it is in college.

Speaker 2:          45:33          Now this is this a kid who grew up, his mother died when he was very young. He grew up, he had no money, bunch of different homes, uh, all sorts of crazy history in the family. And it's like the idea that this kid has privileged because he's white and we're going to take from him. I mean that's in essence, that's what he was saying like, and it wasn't specifically about reparations, but just this idea that this kid is somehow guilty or somehow privilege just because of the skin color, having nothing to do everything. He's lived through it. But that's what they're pushing on everybody. I mean, you know, that's what they're pushing and, and there's not a lot of pushback to that idea. And I just feel that there's a correction going on right now and there's a correction because you're seeing a lot more conservatives that are younger and browner and whatever.

Speaker 2:          46:19          And there's a really different movement right now. And the, the, the leftist, it's like, I call it the intersectionality Colt. The intersectionality Colt will eat itself because there's all these things that you cannot stay on the left right now. And there's somebody who, I'm not going to name, but this is, this person is, it has a platform as a feminist, right? And this is a male feminist. And I'm like, great, you know, do what you gotta do, but don't call me Trans phobic for defending women's sports or women's spaces or, or lesbians who are now, who now feel pressured into having relationships with transgender women. Um, when, when you call yourself a feminist and you're not standing up for, for lesbians. And I standing up for women in that way, I, I, you know, you call me whatever you want to call me, but I'm, I'm always going to, to stand up for, for lesbians to stand up for women in that way.

Speaker 2:          47:10          But like I said, the intersectionality coat there, things that they can't say, um, they're things that they can't say about radical Islam. You know when, when they run into a gay bar and kill 49 of us, you mood, they can't say that. You got Jonathan Capehart running around talking about, oh, this guy was a closeted gay in this. I was this and this guy was that. And I'm like, that completely ridiculous and not true. And we know that that's not true now, but the intersectionality Colt will eat itself because there there is, it is becoming to the point where there are too many things that they can't say. So people like you and I have to say the things that they can do.

Speaker 3:          47:43          Is that doubly tough then for you as a gay black man? Because the culture, if we're talking about black culture and gay culture, there's so much humor richness, their political incorrect. Yes. Yeah. All of these things. So for someone like you to be fed these, these ideas that you've obviously rejected now, but to be fed these ideas that would stop you from joking the way you want to joke or saying something politically incorrect with the rest of it, it's like, like I remember going when I would go to gay bars and they would be like a drag queen. Now I again, I was never into it. I thought drag queens were all bad comics. Like they all struck me as just hack comics. That being said, they would say a ton of politically incorrect shit. They would mock gay people. They, I mean they would mock everybody. That was the point where now it's like, I don't know, I don't know what's going on in the, in the drag queen world these days, but it's like, I'm guessing it's gotten pretty bad because they're probably really afraid to say, yeah,

Speaker 2:          48:36          I'd be irreverent. I mean, I, I think that right now, I mean I, I'd love drag. I ru Paul's drag race. I'm like, I'm all about it. You know, my, my husband and I are big fans.

Speaker 3:          48:43          When I voted for the, in the last election I voted for Gary Johnson, but I used to live in West Hollywood so I had to go over there to, to vote. I was standing behind Ru Paul at the voters.

Speaker 2:          48:53          Oh, not in drag. And you want to talk about like, and you want to talk about how crazy the is. Let's talk about Ru Paul. Let's talk about the crazy blue Chez. Ray's ease on the LGBT left coming after Rupaul. Like forgive me for being gay. Mvaa you come from mother, you say that Ru Paul is transphobic or she doesn't represent gains and whatever. What was it that she said this about a year and a half ago, this is about a year and a half ago. Like ru Paul did an interview where she says she doesn't, we're Paul. Hey, because we pause, man. Rupaul said he doesn't believe in transgender women in drag because drag is supposed to be a male's elevated and comedic idea of what a woman is. And so they came after Ru Paul for that. They came after. There was a, I'm a segment on drag race called a sheet shemale girl, you got shit.

Speaker 2:          49:45          You know what I mean? And so they kept the blue checks came after Rupaul for that. And so it's really funny when I look at the Ru Paul situation and we'll look at somebody who has done more for, for LGBT culture than maybe anybody walking on this earth right now. And the fact that people are attacking him after everything that he's done tells me that these people are insane, tells me that there's not enough. And if there's one thing that I would need, I don't know if this is a critique because I, I love Rupaul. And by all accounts I hear people say that Rw is amazing. It's that like real kind of bended bending the knee a little bit. Oh, you know, he apologized. We're bending the knee a little bit. Um, um, two people coming for him and I want to get to a point where we are not bending the knee to the mob anymore.

Speaker 2:          50:35          They came after Ellen degenerates what lesbian on this planet has done more for freaking gay and lesbian visibility. And an Ellen degenerates came after Ellen just because she sat down with Kevin Hart and Hart for having the conversation with Kevin Hart and they came for Ellen. And so this is what I say, if they're coming for ru Paul in Ellen degenerate, they'll come for you and me so die. So I will never been the knee. I was, um, we were supposed to have them an LGBT conservative panel at the LGBT center in New York City. Um, and when, you know, people found out about it, we've got excommunicated from the center because we were all racist and all white and transphobic and all of that other stuff. And so I will never apologize for things that I say. I don't try to offend people, but you're certainly not going to control my tongue and I'm not going to bend the knee to these people.

Speaker 2:          51:31          And I'm really glad that Ellen didn't, and I hope Rue Paul never does again because these are two people that have done more for this community that anybody in the planet, certainly not some blue check mark that writes for some blog. Right? Right. But we create this reverse or this perverse I should say incentive structure where it's like there's a lot of value for those blue checkers. We go after them cause it's like, oh you can ruined one of the heroes. Even if they were the ones that paved the road for you. Wow. If you can build your castle on their blood, you know, car Cardi B says they do anything for cloud cloud chasers. That's all they're doing. And the fundamental critique that I have with, with a lot of these people that the cloud chasers is that the platforms are always built on destruction. It's cancel culture.

Speaker 2:          52:16          So everything is always built on. If I build a platform of let's say like a one hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand and my platform is completely built on tearing people down, like I'm going to go up to Dave Ruben because he's got 10 times my following and he said something I don't like, so maybe I'll get some attention for, for tearing him down. You know what I mean? So if your platform is built on that, then you always have to look for new things to be offended by new people to destroy new cloud to chase. And I don't think that it goes anywhere. Yeah. You know? Well, it's also sad, right? It's like, it's deeply sad. I mean, I see this with this crew going after me all the time and I just ignore it. But it's like the idea that you're waking up in the morning and go into, where did Ruben say today so I can get some clicks?

Speaker 2:          53:01          It's like, man, there's so many things going on in the world that pathetic. Yeah. And it's like I'm not perfect and I've made mistakes in this very room on this show, but it's like if you're waking up going, this is the guy we got to go after. I, I see more value than it says about me. It does. And I, and I feel sorry, I just, I, I feel sorry for their life because I just, there's nowhere to go from that. And I would like to use these opportunities that I'm getting right now too. I want to engage people, but I also want to empower people. Like I want to empower my people is much crap as Candice Owens gets. And Man, she gets the a level that I couldn't even dream of. She is a true believer. She is really out here trying to empower people.

Speaker 2:          53:46          She is really out here trying to wake people up. And I um, I saw a Bernay Brown special, I think her name is Renee Brown on Netflix. So she's apparently enormously huge motivational speaker but I'd never heard of, um, so she just got, um, promoted to me on Netflix. So I decided to watch a little bit of, of Bom special. And she said that, and I think she, I think this is a doodle Roosevelt quote. She said that don't worry about critiques that come from people who are not in the field, who are not in the battle, who are not putting themselves out there in some way and trying to affect change in some way. And now that I've saw, I've seen that that's how I try to live my life. And because you can't take all of these critiques, there was a point where you can get 90% of love from people and we'll follow

Speaker 3:          54:33          because sometimes in the person of, Hey, you know, I was really doing stand up. I always remember I could be killing like 300 people laughing hysterically. If there's one guy look at his phone, it's like, that's the guy I'm looking at that there's a guy that was asleep in my lecture last night. Did you call it out? I did. I said, I didn't call him up directly, but I was like giving my speech and I was like, you know, and, and I think that everybody needs to have conversations. Even that guy is funny. He wake up. He did. He did. Uh, I'm sorry we didn't do more of this earlier, but tell me a little bit just about your service having nothing to do with, with all of this stuff only. And that's, yeah,

Speaker 2:          55:07          just, you know, my service in general, I think that when I look back at the military service, what I regret is that, you know, people come up to you when you're a veteran and they thank you for your service. And like people call me a hero and all that other stuff in it. I'm always uneasy by that because I didn't do anything particularly heroic. I was a young kid. Um, just just trying to make it from one day to the next. I mean, I was doing things that I believed in, but when I look at some of these kids that are serving right now and they're the same age, I was, you know, 1920, 21 years old, it's so much for a young person to take on. But for me, when I look back at it and it just, it, you know, I lost weight and it gave me discipline and it gave me kind of that, that strong male influence that was missing in my life. And when I talk about my service, it's not so much the day to day of what I did because it was really, you know, I did one tour in Kuwait, I did one tour in Iraq right after the invasion. Um, you connect those dots, you can get to that age question. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          56:12          yeah. [inaudible] it, yeah. Connect the dots. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          56:16          Um, but when I look back to that, we were just, I was just trying to do the best that I could and everybody that I served with, we were just trying to do our best and I, the people that are serving the military, they are heroes from like, you know, from the guy who captured a Sama Bin, Ladin indies, these great men that you see these books from and all that stuff. But just the people that give up three, four, five, sometimes 20 and 25 years of their life to be of service in some way. Like there is a very heroic element to that. And I think that with me and my service, I talk about it a lot and I talk about loving America because it has given me so much. Just that service has just put me onto a path that just sitting here with you right now and coming back from being with Candice and going to events in the White House, like what?

Speaker 2:          57:09          What were black kid from Akron, Ohio could, could see that vision for himself in the military put me on the path to doing all of these things, so I don't look at myself as heroic, but I look at all the people that are serving now as as heroic. It's to me it's very strange. I feel like I'm not giving you an answer, but no, no. It's very hard to reconcile who I am now with who I was then and to see that as anything other than a scared kid doing the best he could, if that makes sense. It does make sense and that feels like a nice ending. Yeah. How do you feel about that? I think that's a great ending. I don't know what I'm doing later, but there would be something if we just showed up at the Abbey in West Holly. Oh my God. Are you, can we find some other band that deplorable? Oh my God, we should, we should make it happen. We should, we should make the could the conservative gay meetup or something like that. We should make it happen. Classical liberal. Oh, that's right. Classical liberal. Come on for more on Rob. Follow him on Twitter at Rob Smith online.
