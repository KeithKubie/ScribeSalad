[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.020
NATE STANIFORTH:
Thank you very much.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.520
Thank you.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.840
Thanks very much for having
me to Google headquarters.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.950
I'm very glad to be here.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.780
Here's my plan for the
next 45 minutes or so.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.610
I'd like to talk to
you about the book.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.200
And I'm happy to
answer any questions

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.300
you have at the end of this.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.480
But it occurs to me that if
I'm talking about magic as I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840
see it, and you're sitting
there thinking of laser beams,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.880
and smoke machines, and
tight leather pants,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.560
and top hats, and
rabbits, and Job

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.780
from "Arrested
Development," we're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
never going to
understand each other.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.830
So I'd like to start
by just telling you

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.440
a little bit of my story.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.270
And at some point in the
middle of that, it will pivot,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.280
and we'll go from there.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.430
So I became a
magician by accident

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.140
when I was a nine year old.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.532
I read the "Lord of
the Rings" books.

00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:02.240
You've seen the movies
or read the books?

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.820
Yeah.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.739
So there's this scene
at the beginning

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.330
of the first "Lord
of the Rings" book

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.230
where the wizard Gandalf
is at a birthday party,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.310
and he uses magic to shoot these
magical fireworks into the sky.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.530
And it turns into this
dragon, and swoops down,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.840
and terrifies everybody.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.970
And I wanted to be
able to do that.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.530
Because I thought
that if I could

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.420
do that on the playground,
I would be unstoppable.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.210
And I very much wanted
to be unstoppable.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.730
So I went-- nine is an unusual
age, because you're old enough

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.000
to get through 1,300 pages
of pretty obscure fantasy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.910
literature, and young enough,
at the end of that time,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.300
to still hold out hope
that maybe there's

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.610
such a thing as real
magic in the world.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.770
So I finished the "Lord
of the Rings" books,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
and I went to the adult
section of the library looking

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.100
for a book of spells that I
could do on the playground.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.140
This was my moment.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.520
I was going to
crush it like that.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.720
What I learned instead was that
that's not how magic works.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.580
But I found a book
of sleight of hand,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.289
and I learned my first
really great piece of magic.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.539
And it's very simple.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.240
You put a coin your hand.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.220
When you close your hand and
open it, the coin disappears.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.130
The thing about magic tricks
is that when they are bad,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.150
they are worse than
just about anything,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.460
because it just
looks like a trick.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.970
But when you take a magic
trick and push it far enough

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.580
towards excellence, there
is this tipping point

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.560
where it no longer looks
like a trick, where

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.180
it looks like an actual
supernatural event.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.020
And I became obsessed
with this coin trick.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.880
I bet I put in--

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.360
I don't know-- 400 hours
of standing in front

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360
of the bathroom mirror--

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.500
I was sort of a
weird little kid--

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.875
standing in front
of the bathroom

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.577
mirror practicing
this over and over.

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:53.910
For some kids, it's video games.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.159
For other kids, it's football.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.020
For me, it was mastering,
as a nine year old,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.400
this coin vanish.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.992
And my mom-- because I'd
stand in front of the mirror

00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:06.450
and practice, and I'd drop the
coin over and over and over.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.670
She went out and got a carpet
sample and put it on the floor

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.350
so it wouldn't
make so much noise.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.530
But after months
of this, there was

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.900
a point where it didn't
look like a trick

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.432
anymore, where I closed my hand
and opened it, and the coin--

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.210
it just disappeared.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.880
And I decided that I wanted to
see how people would respond

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.770
to that if I did it at school.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.060
The thing that I couldn't
really have known then

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.830
that I've learned since, is that
when you watch a magician, when

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.820
you buy a ticket to see my show
or you see a magician on TV,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.150
you understand that you
are seeing an illusion.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.470
Magic is fiction.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
And it's just part of the
form that the audience knows

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.840
that they are being deceived.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.310
That's why everyone shows up--

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.940
to see something that
they can't explain.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.400
When you don't
have that context,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.840
magic isn't entertaining.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.741
It's just terrifying.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.990
If I were to just stand here
in front of you right now

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.230
and disappear, the
appropriate response to that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.490
would not be to clap.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.100
It would be like, get up and
run as quickly as you can

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.390
from this room.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.660
So the kids watching
on the playground

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.296
didn't know that they
were seeing a magic trick.

00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:19.920
They didn't know that
I was a magician.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.086
Because I wasn't a magician.

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.100
I was just a kid who
had mastered this trick.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.370
So they saw the coin disappear,
and they didn't clap.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.120
They didn't laugh.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.590
They didn't applaud.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.610
They just started
shrieking and running away.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.440
So imagine for a
second that you're

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.132
the teacher on duty
at the schoolyard,

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:37.590
and you look across
the playground,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.210
and you see this group of
children screaming and running.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.900
And I'm standing in the middle.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.800
So this teacher stormed
across the playground.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.930
And I was terrified
of this woman.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.100
And she towered
above me and demanded

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.860
that I show her whatever
it was that I showed

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.240
the kids to make them run away.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.470
And so I took the coin
out, and put it in my hand,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.690
and did my little
dance of the fingers.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.150
And when I opened it, it was
like she was a little kid.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.910
I had never seen
any adult anywhere

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.260
respond to anything the
way this grown, educated,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.490
terrifying woman was
reacting to this coin vanish.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.970
And I suppose
that's a fun story.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.010
But for me, it was
very troubling.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.110
Because I knew it
was just a trick.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.100
I knew that I was
just a little kid who

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.680
had learned a coin trick.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.690
And I could not
explain the disparity

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.980
between the very simple means
and the staggeringly unexpected

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.130
result that came from something
as simple as a coin trick.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.619
So I didn't become
a magician because I

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.660
wanted to be a performer.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.160
I didn't become a
magician because I

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.480
wanted to be in entertainment
or get on stage.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.100
It's like I discovered,
at a really young age,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.440
that you can say something
with a magic trick that's

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.240
hard to say any other way.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.880
And I just wanted to chase
that as far as I could.

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:17.580
I think it's one thing as a
nine year old to say that you're

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.350
going to become the
greatest magician

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.160
in the history of the world.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.380
It's another thing to say
that as a 19 year old.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.900
And I went to college
on an acting scholarship

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.870
because I wanted
to study stagecraft

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.180
because I thought it would
lead me to become a better

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.420
performer.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.010
But what I learned instead
was that the best way

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.140
to learn magic is to
just do it for people,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.170
to do it for anyone you can find
in all different walks of life.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.080
And the discovery
that I made is that it

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.370
doesn't matter who you are.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.440
You can be young,
old, rich, poor.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.820
You can be a
sheepherder in Tibet

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.050
or a taxi driver in Texas.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.810
It doesn't matter.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.770
Everyone everywhere
in the world responds

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.710
to a good piece of magic
in exactly the same way.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.470
It's like this
universal experience.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.920
The question that
I've been chasing

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.605
as a magician for as long as
I can remember is very simple.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.540
I've noticed that
as I get older,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.380
it becomes harder for me to be
genuinely amazed by anything.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.620
To be clear, it's easy
to be entertained.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.370
It's easy to be inspired.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.490
It's also easy to be
deceived or fooled.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.240
All of the experiences that
are in orbit around wonder

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.900
are relatively common.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.000
But for me, that white
light through the clouds--

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.370
astonishment-- does
get harder and harder

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.846
to find as I get older.

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:41.220
I think one of
the reasons I love

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.570
magic so much is it's a
way for me to chase that.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.300
But even as a young magician--

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.210
I feel like in every
profession, you probably

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.880
get to see a corner of the
human experience that's harder

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.380
to see from another profession.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.690
Doctors probably see
things in waiting rooms

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.664
that you don't
see anywhere else.

00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:01.080
I don't know what
architects learn

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.520
about being a human
being, but I'm

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.950
sure there's something there.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.230
But for magicians, especially
as a young magician,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:13.530
it becomes impossible
to ignore the loss that

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.140
happens in the
transition from being

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.580
a child to being a grown-up.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.020
Because you see in all of--

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.410
as a kid, I remember
doing magic for my parents

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.060
and the friends of my parents.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.230
And it became clear that there
is this incredible weight that

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.280
settles on people when you're an
adult. And with a magic trick,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.049
you can make that go
away for a second.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.890
I love that.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.120
I think the obvious
answer to why

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.390
is it harder to become
amazed by anything

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.610
as you get older than
it is when you're

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.300
a kid is that when you're an
adult, you just know more.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.330
You have more information.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.350
But that answer falls apart
for me for a few reasons.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.220
I think the magician operates
from the fundamental conviction

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.200
that learning more
about anything

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.740
makes that thing more amazing
rather than less amazing.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.290
It's the absolute
renunciation of the axiom that

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.710
familiarity breeds contempt.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.320
Just before I got married, I
was reading this book about--

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.820
I was fascinated by lightning.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.960
I just wanted to
understand what it was.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.400
And so I was reading
this meteorological book.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.702
And then my wife and I
happened to be on our honeymoon

00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:33.410
in the middle of the
Canadian wilderness.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.240
We went on this
wilderness canoe trip.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.840
And we got pinned down
on an island seven days

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.390
from the middle of nowhere
with this lightning

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.980
storm that came in.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.210
And it was one of the most
terrifying moments in my life,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.260
because lightning was slamming
over and over and over

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.640
onto the trees on our island.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.200
You could hear
trees falling, and I

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.720
was worried that a tree was
going to fall on our tent.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.860
And it was terrifying.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.310
But it was also,
if I'm honest, one

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.170
of the most riveting, wonderful,
wide awake moments of my life.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.310
And I reckon it was in one
scene, in one experience,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.630
the reality of lightning--

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.826
I understood that understanding
the nature of lightning,

00:10:20.826 --> 00:10:23.450
understanding that it's a static
discharge from the clouds that

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.450
explodes to the ground in
this cataclysmic blast--

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.160
knowing the facts
about lightning

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.470
does nothing to remove
the astonishment

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.520
of being in the middle
of a thunderstorm.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.450
So I love magic for
a number of reasons.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:46.090
But one of them is that it's a
way to connect with the unknown

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.850
and to make peace
with the fact that I

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.030
don't have all the answers.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.760
I will never have
all the answers.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.215
And to share that
experience with an audience.

00:10:56.215 --> 00:10:57.590
A few years ago,
I decided that I

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.010
wanted to write a book
about all of this--

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.020
about wonder, about
disillusionment,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:09.470
about losing sight
of astonishment,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.450
and all of the things
that I love about magic

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.380
and finding it again.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.750
And when I finished
writing the book,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.410
I was worried that it's easy to
get up and talk about wonder.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.660
It's easy to write
a book about wonder

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.160
when you're sitting
in a Starbucks

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.050
paying $5 for a cup of coffee.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.290
But I wanted to see if
it would still hold up

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.200
if I went to the toughest,
most aggressive, most hostile

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.760
place I could find.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.300
So I asked a warden of a
maximum security prison

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.080
if I could come in to do
magic for the inmates.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.110
And it was one of the
most incredible events

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.230
of my entire career.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.990
I'd like to show you
the video, but here's

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.820
what I want you to see.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.324
Before the magic happens, they
wanted nothing to do with it.

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:52.740
They wanted nothing
to do with it.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.690
They were standing like this,
sort of tough and antagonistic.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.130
And then you will see there is
a moment where something happens

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.390
that they can't explain.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.550
And it's just like
a switch flips.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.260
And you will see these--

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.300
some of these guys are
in prison for life,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.890
and you will see them--

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.320
I don't know-- become
little kids again.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.131
So if I can get this video to
work, I'd like to show you.

00:12:17.131 --> 00:12:20.470
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.550
- I'm going to use
a deck of cards.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.780
I'm going to give it to
you to hold for the moment.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.897
We're going to need--
here, will you name a card?

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:40.730
- Eight of diamonds.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.600
- OK, eight of diamonds.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.610
Will you name a number?

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.175
- 13.

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:45.675
- 13.

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.281
We have eight of diamonds, 13.

00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.530
And you were holding the card.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.930
I want you to see this.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.970
I'm going to give you the deck.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.820
Before we start, I want to just
point out a couple of things.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.079
You could have named any card.

00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:06.870
You agree there is no
way I could have made

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.207
you think of eight of diamonds.

00:13:08.207 --> 00:13:08.790
Is that right?

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.120
- Right.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.250
- You don't want to
change your mind.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.160
Eight of diamonds.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.120
Same with the number.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.462
That was your choice.

00:13:13.462 --> 00:13:14.420
You said-- what was it?

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:14.850
- 13.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.360
- 13.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:15.860
Right.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.600
OK.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.420
And you've been
holding the cards.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.802
With that hand, I want you
to just deal the cards.

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:23.010
Just drop them on the ground.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:23.640
Let's see.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.290
You said 13.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.700
So deal 12 cards from the
top, and just drop them

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.420
on the ground.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.770
Go.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.130
Count them out loud.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:37.110
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.760
- There you go.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.220
Stop.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:38.730
Stop.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.960
Drop that one on the ground.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.460
Can we all agree the next
card is the 13th card, right?

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.360
- Right.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.210
- So you could have
picked any card,

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.980
but you said eight of diamonds.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.122
You could have picked any
number, but you said 13.

00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:53.580
If you had said a
different number,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.580
we'd go farther down in
the deck or stop higher.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.410
You said 13, eight of diamonds.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.460
Turn over the 13th.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:06.752 --> 00:14:09.778
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:20.740
- Can you see that
wherever you're standing?

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.630
I'm going to hold it so
the camera can get it.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.725
I want you to see
it's permanent.

00:14:25.725 --> 00:14:26.650
So here's the idea.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.150
Watch this.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.238
Look at your hand here.

00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:47.738
- Damn!

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.443
That's crazy.

00:14:53.443 --> 00:15:01.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.000
- Now throw it back.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.069
- No, it's permanent.

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:07.110
It's going to stay there.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.880
- Throw it back.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.320
- Take if off and
give it back to him.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.020
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.000
- That's great.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.560
- You can see the thread, right?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.911
You can see it on camera too.

00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:22.410
Listen.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.342
More than anything, I
want you to hear this.

00:15:24.342 --> 00:15:26.252
I'll give that to
you for a second.

00:15:26.252 --> 00:15:26.752
Thank you.

00:15:26.752 --> 00:15:27.252
Listen.

00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:30.080
I want you to hear it.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.650
Can you hear it break?

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.650
I'm going to do it again.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.510
So here's the idea.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.564
I'm going to take some
of the broken pieces.

00:15:43.564 --> 00:15:45.230
And I don't want you
to think I'm adding

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.520
anything or switching anything.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.103
These are the pieces
I'm going to use.

00:15:48.103 --> 00:15:49.690
I'm going to roll
them up into a ball.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.148
You can see all the broken ends
get pulled together, right?

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.880
This is the amazing part.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.420
If you take the ball of
broken pieces and squeeze,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.020
the idea is to get
it to just stick.

00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:07.150
Will you help me?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.980
Just grab the bottom.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.320
Do this slowly so the
ball doesn't fall off

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.065
as you start to pull.

00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:15.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:22.105
- OK.

00:16:22.105 --> 00:16:23.937
- That was bad, man.

00:16:23.937 --> 00:16:24.520
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.060
NATE STANIFORTH: So
when I finished college,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.910
I started touring as a
professional magician.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:37.480
And for me, that looked
like essentially living out

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.720
of a suitcase and bouncing
around the country

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.180
doing a show as often
as I could five nights

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.450
a weeks, six nights a week.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.520
I think when you're an
established magician,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.490
you can tour in a circuit,
sort of like a band.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.590
So you can play
Denver one night,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.980
and Fort Collins the next night,
and maybe Colorado Springs,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.180
and work your way across.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.890
Maybe go to Lincoln,
and then Des Moines,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.204
and tour across the country.

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:03.620
But when you're
just starting out,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.349
you have to go
wherever the work is.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:10.329
And so I do Tuesday in Florida,
Wednesday in California,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.980
Thursday in Ohio, just
criss-crossing the country.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.329
And I did that for five years.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:21.369
And I discovered that
maybe like most jobs,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:25.060
the profession of
magic, which I thought

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.000
looked so amazing
from the outside,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.810
concealed beneath that
veneer this grinding,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.300
day-to-day reality.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.620
My commute would be 15 hours.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.870
I'd wake up at 3:00 in the
morning to get to the show,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.537
and then do sound check and
load in, and do the show,

00:17:40.537 --> 00:17:42.370
and then go to bed and
sleep for four hours,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.750
and then get up and
do that all again

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.041
the next night, and the next
night, and the next night.

00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:49.450
And after five years,
I just ran into a wall.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.370
I just felt like I
couldn't do it anymore.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.090
I was onstage in
Milwaukee in front

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.924
of-- it was a beautiful
auditorium, a great audience,

00:17:57.924 --> 00:17:59.090
and the show was going well.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.360
And in the middle of the
show, I just said, I'm sorry.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.870
I'm done.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.990
I hope you had a good time,
but I'm going to go now.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.180
I walked off in the
middle of the set

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.980
and went back to my
hotel room and thought,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.750
maybe this ship is sinking.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.850
Maybe I'm not going to do
this anymore, because I do not

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.610
want to have this be what my--

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.815
I don't want my life to
look like this anymore.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.090
The universe, I think, is a
strange and mysterious place.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.560
And once in a while,
incredible things just happen.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.830
And it just so happened that
on this leg of the tour,

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.740
I happened to be
reading this book

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.700
about traditional
Indian street magic.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.240
Every culture in the
world has its own version

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.170
of the archetypal
figure of the magician.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.950
Just like food or art
or music, the magic

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.490
that comes from a
culture is as much

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.840
an expression of that culture
as any of the other arts.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.960
So had I been reading a book
about Chinese traditional

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.720
magic, I would have
wanted to go to China,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.950
or Japanese magic, maybe I would
have wanted to go to Japan.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.432
But after I walked off
in the middle of the set

00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:18.640
and went back to my hotel
room, I picked up this book

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.990
and started reading it.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.480
And I decided that
what I wanted to do

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.430
was walk away from
everything in the US,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.460
to just leave my touring career
behind and forget everything

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.640
I knew about being a
magician in America,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.427
and go to the other side of the
world to see all of this magic

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:38.260
I was reading about.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.754
So I wanted to see
snake charming.

00:19:39.754 --> 00:19:41.170
I wanted to see
street performing.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.000
I wanted to see fire breathing.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.310
It wasn't so much that I wanted
to go to India specifically.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.180
I just wanted to
go to this place

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.060
where all of these things I was
reading about were performed.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.450
So my mission was I wanted
to go be amazed by something.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.579
I wanted to remember why I
loved being a magician so much

00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:04.120
by seeing a tradition
of magic that's

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.400
totally different from my own.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.630
And so I did.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.580
I went to India, and I sought
out snake charmers and street

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.300
performers.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.630
I found a tribe of traditional
Indian street magicians who

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.120
trace their lineage and have
passed their secrets down

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.750
from father to son
for 3,000 years.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.940
I saw amazing magic, so I found
what I was looking for there.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.760
But what I discovered was
that the most amazing parts

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.910
of the trip, the most
genuinely magical moments that

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.790
felt like I think magic should
feel, good magic should feel,

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.620
had nothing to do with
tricks and nothing

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.210
to do with performances.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.930
It was in immersing
myself in a new culture,

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.120
seeing things I had
never seen before.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.410
Both travel and magic are
similar in their ability

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.490
to deliver this
cataclysmic death

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.440
blow to any sense of certainty
you have about who you are

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.650
and how you fit in with
the world around you.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.870
And so I became
really fascinated

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.230
with this idea of finding
wonder not in the extraordinary,

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.287
but in the ordinary.

00:21:12.287 --> 00:21:14.620
It's one thing to find it on
the other side of the world

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.900
or find it in a magic show,
but how do you find it

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.070
in your day-to-day life?

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.927
How do you-- adults are really
good at making things ordinary.

00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:24.760
We're really good at
getting used to things,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.500
which is probably useful.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.200
If we woke up every
morning and freaked out

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.200
at this bright, burning
ball of thermonuclear fury

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.559
rising over the east, that would
be an untenable way to live.

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:38.850
We should just call it the
sun and get on with our day.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.580
But the danger is
that you end up

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.720
shrinking your world down to
the size of your certainties.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.550
And you live in the
story you tell yourself

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.640
about the world rather
than the world itself.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.650
And my favorite
moments are those

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.960
that wake me up, and shake
me loose from that world

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.110
that I've made for
myself, and remind me

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:07.180
that there's more that I'm
not paying attention to.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.860
When I came back
from India, I was

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.005
worried that that was a
lot to ask of a magic show.

00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:14.380
For the first
time, I felt like I

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.171
had something I wanted
to say that I didn't

00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:18.415
know how to say as a magician.

00:22:18.415 --> 00:22:20.290
So I started learning
to write, and I decided

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.380
I was going to write a book.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.379
And that's the book that
all of you are holding,

00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:24.910
"Here is Real Magic."

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.140
When the book came out, I wanted
to invent a piece of magic that

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.330
would set the stage to tell
everyone what to expect

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.250
from a book by a magician.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.191
And I'd like to show it to you.

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:38.857
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.851
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:31.626
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:33.500
NATE STANIFORTH: My book
came out in January,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.210
and so I've been doing a
number of these author talks.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:40.832
And sometimes when I open
the room up for questions,

00:24:40.832 --> 00:24:42.540
everybody has something
they want to say.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.070
And sometimes no
one has anything

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.220
they want to talk about.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.940
But I would like to open
the room up for questions.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.980
We can talk about magic.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.104
We can talk about the book.

00:24:51.104 --> 00:24:54.600
We can talk about wonder
or the ideas in the book.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.159
We can arm wrestle,
whatever you want.

00:24:57.159 --> 00:24:59.450
But if you have anything that
you'd like to talk about,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.424
now is the time.

00:25:01.424 --> 00:25:02.280
Hi.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.380
AUDIENCE: So I have unsolicited
feedback and comments, and then

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:05.987
a question.

00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:07.070
NATE STANIFORTH: Yes, sir.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.610
AUDIENCE: So I
watched you watching

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.380
that video, which I'm sure
you've seen about 100 times.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.830
And you are the one
doing the tricks.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.440
And so you weren't
smiling at the tricks.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.450
You were smiling
at the reactions.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.720
I could tell that's very--

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.110
it's just awesome.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.335
I believe you when you
were telling that story

00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:26.340
of impacting the people.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.730
I've always loved magic
and hated magicians.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.507
So I think--

00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:31.632
NATE STANIFORTH: Thank you.

00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:33.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.515
AUDIENCE: But then wondered, all
right, why is it real for you

00:25:36.515 --> 00:25:40.740
and maybe not for
a larger handful--

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.050
NATE STANIFORTH: Of
magicians specifically?

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.735
I don't want to speak to--

00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:49.110
it's hard to comment on what
other people's motives might

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.150
be, so I don't want
to assume anything

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.850
about other magicians
that might not be true.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.320
But I think you probably
have the same thing

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.410
in music as well.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.670
Some people get into
music because they

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:08.010
want to be rock stars, and they
want to have everybody scream

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.239
and go crazy, and they
want to be famous.

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:12.030
And then you have people
who get into music

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.610
because they love music,
and they love writing songs.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.680
And I'm not saying one
is better than another.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.260
But for me, being
a performer is--

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.990
it's something-- I've made
my peace with it, for sure,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.910
but that's not why
I got into magic.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.030
I got into it because
I love the thing that I

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.860
am able to chase as a magician.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.160
And if I could do it better
as a musician, maybe I would.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.070
Magic has a lot of
cultural baggage to it.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:48.800
But I just-- personally, I
love the experience of magic.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.030
You don't need to do
tricks to do magic.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.360
The first time I really
remember the experience

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.580
of being amazed by
something was when

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.650
my parents took
me to see a meteor

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.330
shower when I was a little kid.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.470
And we lived in a small college
town in the middle of Iowa.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.512
But even in a
small college town,

00:27:06.512 --> 00:27:08.220
there's enough light
pollution that makes

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.570
it hard to see the Milky Way.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.640
But they woke me up in
the middle of the night

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.860
and drove my brother
and sister out

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.900
into the cornfields
where there's no light.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.400
And it just--

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.200
I remember feeling like, where
has this been all my life?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.360
It was one of the most
amazing things, still,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.680
that I've ever seen.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.410
And I love that experience.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.550
And I'll follow that anywhere.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.240
And if that means,
as part of the job,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.000
getting up and doing a
magic show, that's fine.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.860
But I guess that's
my way of answering

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.889
how I feel about it, trying
not to speak for other people.

00:27:43.889 --> 00:27:44.430
Is that fair?

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.140
AUDIENCE: That's fair.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.420
NATE STANIFORTH: OK.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.420
Thank you for asking.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:46.920
Yeah.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.010
Hi.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.580
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that when we see a magic show,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.460
we know it's an illusion.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.220
And part of the fun is
trying to see how it's done.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.870
[INAUDIBLE],, you know
it could be failing.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.850
When you go to see a
magic show, obviously, it

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.500
must be quite a
different experience,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.900
because you have a
pretty good idea how

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.855
a lot of the common
effects are done.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.180
That must change the experience
for you quite a lot to one

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:19.260
of being amazed to one of
trying to see how it's done.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.970
How often do you find yourself
astonished and amazed by magic?

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.440
NATE STANIFORTH: So I'd like
to answer that in two parts.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.790
So the experience I'm having
now, having written this book,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.690
is now that I have been
through the process

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.190
of writing a book myself--

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.070
and it took four years
of pretty rigorous work.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.990
When I read other
people's work, I

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:48.480
feel like sometimes I can
see the joints and the beams

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.890
and the girders in a way
that I couldn't before.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.820
And it has changed the way
I read certainly memoirs,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.500
too, because now I have this
professional relationship

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.490
with that form that necessarily
changes the way I take it in.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.870
That's been true for
magic for a long time.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.440
And as you say, it's hard
not to watch a magic show

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.210
and deconstruct it.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.220
But I would say that
like the best writers,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.310
you read some books,
and there are no seams.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.590
It's just like it arrived fully
formed from some other world.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.770
A great magic show
is that way too.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.780
And in the book, I
describe one piece of magic

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.760
that I witnessed that--

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.010
I saw it in 2013, and
I've thought about it,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.610
without exaggeration,
every day since 2013.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.940
And I still can't explain it.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.830
And I love that.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.160
I love the realization
that no matter how far

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.560
I push this craft,
there are still people

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.297
who are so far ahead of me.

00:29:46.297 --> 00:29:47.880
Rather than being
intimidated by that,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.380
I really love that,
because it means

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.555
that I can still find that
spark of inspiration as well.

00:29:55.555 --> 00:29:57.070
Is that a fair answer?

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.625
Yeah.

00:29:57.625 --> 00:29:58.900
OK.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.680
Hi.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.160
AUDIENCE: So given everything
that you've been through,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.624
and going through the process of
writing the book, what's next?

00:30:06.624 --> 00:30:08.290
NATE STANIFORTH:
That's a good question.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.360
Yeah.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.800
I discovered that I
really love book writing.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.840
I feel like I snuck into
this incredible party,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.452
and I very much don't
want to leave now.

00:30:16.452 --> 00:30:18.550
So I've got other books
that I'd like to write.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.420
And in the course of writing the
book, there was a lot of work

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.070
as a magician that
I didn't do that I'm

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.360
catching up on as well.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.940
So I'm trying to
have it both ways

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.090
and have this career where I
can go on tour twice a year

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.050
and write books.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.510
And we'll see if I
can stick the landing.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.300
But that's very much the goal.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.870
So thanks for asking.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.719
Hi.

00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:40.260
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.290
What advice would you
give today to that 9,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.310
10-year-old boy or
girl getting into magic

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.060
and wants to do magic?

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.540
NATE STANIFORTH: There's
this quote from Houdini

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.290
that I discovered when
I was a little kid.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.690
You're all familiar
with Houdini?

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.590
Yeah.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.710
So Houdini said--

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.280
Houdini was like the
original Gary Vaynerchuk.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.040
He said, the real secret
to my success is simple.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.270
I work from 7:00 AM to
midnight, and I like it.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.310
And I think one of the reasons
I latched on to magic is

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:19.050
because I just really liked that
monk-like existence of having

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.790
one--

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.970
my life was very simple.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.890
I had one job, and it
was to perfect this craft

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.380
to the exclusion of
basically anything else.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.260
And I think whether you're
interested in magic or music

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.667
or poetry or
basket-weaving or whatever,

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:39.000
I think there's a lot to be
said for just working harder

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.416
than the other people who are
trying to do the same thing.

00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:44.490
Because that's the one
thing you can control.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.220
There are other people who are
more gifted performers or more

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.020
charismatic communicators.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:55.410
But the one point where I
get to choose how I react

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.550
is just working harder
than everybody else.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.380
And I don't know.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.145
I think it doesn't suit
everybody, but it suits me.

00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:04.645
Yeah.

00:32:07.087 --> 00:32:09.420
AUDIENCE: I think you were
talking about lightening when

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.530
you brought this
up, but you talked

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.300
about how as you
learned more about it,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.510
it increased the amount
of wonder and awe in it.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.295
Does that apply
with magic tricks?

00:32:17.295 --> 00:32:18.670
NATE STANIFORTH:
Certainly, yeah.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.740
AUDIENCE: Even when
you learn more about

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.828
how the trick is done,
you're more inspired by it?

00:32:21.828 --> 00:32:22.744
NATE STANIFORTH: Yeah.

00:32:22.744 --> 00:32:23.770
AUDIENCE: Can you explain that?

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.840
That seems counter-intuitive.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.006
NATE STANIFORTH: Absolutely.

00:32:26.006 --> 00:32:30.450
I think one of the things
that you discover as you--

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.550
I'm going to say explore
the craft of magic--

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.330
I assume this is true
with music, or with art,

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.490
with painting, or poetry,
or writing, or whatever.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:46.860
But the better you get,
the larger your awareness

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.720
of how far you have to go.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.340
The distance between good and
great becomes much clearer.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.360
When I was starting
out, it was harder

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.730
to understand
exactly what it would

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.660
take to take an illusion all the
way to the point of perfection.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.490
And I think the closer
you get to that,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.470
the easier it is to see
how almost impossible

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:15.638
it is to become as good as
some of the greats have been.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.930
Magic is interesting.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.250
I think of magic like fiction.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.705
It's easy to think that--

00:33:27.175 --> 00:33:28.800
with a magic trick,
it's easy to assume

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:34.710
that once you know the answer,
you can stop thinking about it.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.810
But I think a good
piece of magic,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.930
like a good
fictional character--

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.870
you don't finish
"Catcher in the Rye"

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.630
and then say, well,
that was a good story,

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:49.980
but Holden Caulfield wasn't a
real kid, so who cares anymore?

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.790
A good novelist is using
the craft of deception.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.020
Let's be clear about that.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.450
He's making, or she's making
things up that aren't true

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.820
and pulling you into
this imaginary world

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.470
to give you something real.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.770
And in my experience,
the better I

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.320
get as a magician,
the more I become

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.510
aware of the complexities
that are involved

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.940
in actually doing that well.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.230
Does that begin to--

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.190
is that a fair answer?

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.121
Does that-- yeah.

00:34:15.121 --> 00:34:15.620
OK.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:18.489
Hi.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:22.969
AUDIENCE: I've got a son
who's stumbled into magic

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.270
and is really into it.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.094
NATE STANIFORTH: I'd
watch out for that.

00:34:26.094 --> 00:34:28.510
AUDIENCE: Sometimes it's to
the exclusion of other things,

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.451
like homework.

00:34:31.451 --> 00:34:34.049
But he's gotten to the
point where he's starting

00:34:34.049 --> 00:34:35.139
to get really good at it.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.175
He can go to parties with
adults and do a card trick,

00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:41.121
and the adults are stumped.

00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:42.996
And the same reaction
that you're looking for

00:34:42.996 --> 00:34:44.739
is the reaction
that he's getting.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:48.170
And he's falling
in love with it.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:54.244
So my question for you is
how many times did people

00:34:54.244 --> 00:34:55.010
tell you--

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.760
your mom grabbed the
carpet out and put it

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760
on the floor for you.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.100
How many times did
people discourage you,

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.050
and how did you
get over the hump?

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.340
NATE STANIFORTH: All the time.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:12.750
I mean, basically everyone, I
think for the best of reasons.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.640
It seems to be the
prudent thing to do

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.530
to discourage
someone from becoming

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.760
a professional magician.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.330
Of course.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.232
It's not-- joining the circus,
it's becoming the circus.

00:35:26.232 --> 00:35:30.980
But I think sometimes, you
know something about yourself

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.840
that you can't
prove to the people

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.330
in your life in any other
way but by doing it.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:41.030
There were a number of years,
especially when I was first

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.060
working as a professional
magician, where I think

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.770
basically, everyone
who cared about me

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:50.200
was terrified that I would
be unemployed in two years.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.890
And they were probably
right to be concerned.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:58.320
But I knew that I was doing
what I was supposed to be doing.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.835
And it's like I didn't even
care what they thought.

00:36:01.835 --> 00:36:03.960
I just knew that I could
do it, and then show them,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.210
and then that would be enough.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.860
I think that anyone who makes
it in a profession like magic

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.400
only--

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.150
I think the only people
that make it don't

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.380
care what anyone else says.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.060
After shows, sometimes
young magicians

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.360
come up to me asking if they
should make the jump to being

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.530
a professional.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.030
And I never know
how to answer that,

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.410
because the only ones
who will ever make it

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.300
are the ones who are so
committed to doing it

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.220
that they don't care
what I have to say.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.570
And I don't know what
advice to give you,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:49.350
because it almost seems like--

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.140
it's such a hard way
to make a living,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.970
and it's such a hard
field to gain traction

00:36:52.970 --> 00:37:02.130
in that unless that motivation,
that fire comes from within,

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.180
it's not going to happen.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.960
So maybe discouraging him
is the right thing to do.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.630
I don't know.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.330
I think you can
split the difference.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:12.750
I think you can be realistic
and supportive at the same time.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.058
And if you figure that
out, you let me know.

00:37:15.058 --> 00:37:16.891
I have a five year old
and a three year old.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.166
But good luck either way.

00:37:21.166 --> 00:37:21.940
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.920
NATE STANIFORTH: Yeah.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.530
Hi.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.080
AUDIENCE: So you've been doing
it for a really long time.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.459
Do you have any stories
of the craziest reactions

00:37:27.459 --> 00:37:28.250
that you've gotten?

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.530
Or has anyone gotten aggressive
after you fooled them

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.170
with a trick, or
anything [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:37.490
NATE STANIFORTH: I was
onstage in Danville, Virginia.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.470
And I had just done a piece
of magic with someone onstage,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.010
and he felt as if I
had read his mind.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.710
And he was conflicted
about that.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.970
There was tension in the room.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.470
It wasn't like, oh,
this is amazing.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.180
We're having fun.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.790
It was like, burn this guy.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.330
And he went back to
his seat and just sat

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:06.440
there festering for 90 seconds.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.172
And then he stood up on his
chair-- and this was a theater,

00:38:09.172 --> 00:38:10.130
so there were armrests.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.550
And he climbed up on the
armrests to get my attention,

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.450
which worked.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.162
And pointed at me and
said, to hell with you.

00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:17.870
You're the devil.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.310
I'm out of here.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.220
And stormed out of the room.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.050
The highlight of my career.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.450
So I'm just putting
that out there.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.510
But yeah, I think like we were
talking about at the beginning,

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.999
when magic feels like a trick--

00:38:33.999 --> 00:38:34.790
and let's be clear.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.130
Most magic does
feel like a trick.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.100
You can take the same piece of
magic and perform it 100 times,

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.560
and 99 of those times,
it will only ever

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.040
feel like a competently done
piece of sleight of hand.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.150
But through some
mysterious combination

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.530
of atmosphere and expectation
and technical ability and just

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:58.070
coincidence, sometimes
the air is just right,

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:02.280
and it resonates on a
totally different level.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.770
And then people go crazy.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.970
And yeah, I feel
like magicians get

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.430
to see a very beautiful
side of people.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:13.550
Because I think we all are
performing for each other

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.350
all the time.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.030
We all choose the clothes
we wear and the language,

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.580
the vocabulary that we use.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.960
We're all putting off an
image of ourselves the way

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.300
we want to be
received or perceived.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.052
And a great thing about
magic, when it's really good,

00:39:28.052 --> 00:39:30.010
is it makes you forget
to be cool for a second.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.650
And all of that falls away.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:35.320
And you just get this very
open, unguarded experience

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.970
of the personalities
that you're with.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.370
And often, that's a
positive experience.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.880
But yeah, sometimes people
just lose their cool.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.640
Thanks for bringing it up.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.790
Thank you very much.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.440
[APPLAUSE]
