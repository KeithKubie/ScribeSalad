00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.420
To create this plot, we're going to pass in our variables

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.890
to gg plot as usual. We'll set x equal to age,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.560
and y equal to median friend count. And we'll set

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.456
data equal to the data frame that we just created. So

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:15.240
pf.fc by age, gender. Now I just need to add

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.540
gm line and pass up the color parameter inside the unaesthetic

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.470
wrapper. This time the color will take on the value

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.290
of gender. This will give me one line for males and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.570
one line for females. Running this code, we get the same

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.600
exact plot. Hopefully you're feeling like a data guru at this point.
