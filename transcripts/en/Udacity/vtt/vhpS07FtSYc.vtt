Now, Box2D was originally written in C++, horded the action script, and used in

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.871
hundreds of games. Including the incredibly popular Angry Birds. And recently

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:13.829
the action script version of Box2D has also been converted further to

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.399
JavaScript by Jonas Wagner. For grits, we grab the JavaScript part of Box2D

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:23.244
from the Intertubes and placed it into our source folder. Now, if you have

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:27.836
further questions about the Box2D API that we don't answer here. We recommend

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:32.049
you take a look at the Box2D manual shown here, and linked below. It was

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.132
written for the Flash version, but the concepts translate. Now, the first thing

00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:40.893
we need to do to use Box2DJS is to load it into the Dom. And we do that, using

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:43.690
this fairly simple script tag.
