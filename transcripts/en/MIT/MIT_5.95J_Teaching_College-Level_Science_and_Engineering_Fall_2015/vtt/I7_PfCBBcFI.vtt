JANET RANKIN: The
lightning round

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.910
is a nice interactive technique
that I use in my class.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.730
And what we do is
I divide the group

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.060
into usually two
teams, two sides,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.920
and I have them face each other.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.250
So you can have them face each
other in two parallel lines,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.010
or you can have an inner
circle and an outer circle,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.120
as long as one person is
facing only one other person.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.680
And then you can
do it on a topic

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.320
similar to the debate where
there's really two sides

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.200
and you ask the one side to
take one side and the other side

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.640
to take another side.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
But the difference with this is
that the communication is only

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.680
between the student
and the student

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.950
that he or she is
facing, and they only

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.460
have one or two minutes
for the interaction.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.810
So one student gets to speak
for say, it's a minute,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
and the other student gets
to respond for a minute.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.110
And then after
that's over, I ask

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.510
one line to shift,
or one circle to take

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.090
a step to the right or the
left, and now each person

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.120
has a new partner
that they speak with.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.350
Generally speaking,
if you had one row

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490
be the pro and the other
row be the con, then

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.770
for the next iteration,
you would switch roles.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.430
So there would be
the con and the pro.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.480
The advantages of
this technique are

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.320
that the students get to hear
a lot of different opinions

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.160
from a lot of
different students.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.520
The fact that it takes
only two minutes at most

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.740
for each interaction means that
you can do it several times,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.964
four times, five times.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.130
If you do it five times,
it's only about 10 minutes,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.090
maybe 13 minutes with
some time to translate.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.970
So it's a pretty quick exercise.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.997
And by doing this
lightning round,

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:51.830
students can get many
different perspectives

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.450
from other students.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.630
The other kind of question you
can ask with a lightning round

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.570
is you can ask a question, maybe
you give students a few minutes

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.390
beforehand to do a
calculation or to solve

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.220
a particular kind of problem.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.530
And then you say, OK,
you have one minute

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.850
to explain how you did the
problem to your partner.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.690
And your partner has one minute
to explain how he or she did

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.700
the problem to you.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.270
And again, that lets students
see other students' approaches,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.350
and it lets them think
about their own approach

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.474
in the context of the
other person's approach.

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:24.890
You also tell them
they're allowed

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.440
to change the way they
think about the problem,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.560
or to think about the response,
based on what they've heard

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.960
in their previous pairing.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.720
So it lets students
kind of iterate

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.360
and develop their opinions
kind of as they go.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.640
A couple of disadvantages
of the technique

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.562
are that it's very, very noisy.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.270
So students are speaking
with each other.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.250
They're really only
about a foot apart,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.043
and everyone is speaking
at the same time.

00:02:51.043 --> 00:02:52.501
STUDENT: I originally
thought there

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.920
was going to be an
increase, but then I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.970
learned that in the 1870's,
there was like, a mini ice age.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.740
JANET RANKIN: So
depending on the class,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.877
depending on the
personalities, depending

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.460
on the people in the
class, it may not

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.810
be such a great technique.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.400
But the advantage is that
it really gets everybody up.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.050
It gets everybody moving, even
people that are really shy.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.810
There's virtually nobody that
will stand there for a minute

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.490
and not say anything.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.930
Even people that
are extremely shy

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.630
are generally willing to
talk with one other person.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.970
And since you
can't hear anything

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.100
about what's going
on in other groups

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.100
or even the instructor
can't hear what's going on,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.880
it's a fairly safe
conversational situation.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.640
So that is an advantage of it.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.080
The thing I like
about it the most

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.970
is that it gets students up.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.790
It gives them the opportunity
to formulate an argument

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.844
and to listen to the
argument of others

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.510
and then put their
opinion, or argument,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.180
or answer in the context
of other answers.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.340
And it lets them hear the
opinions and responses

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.972
of a lot of their peers in
a very short period of time.

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.430
After I finish the
lightning round,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.640
I always give students a
minute, or two minutes,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.280
three minutes to sort
of sit down and reflect

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.510
on the exercise,
what they learned,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.200
if their answer changed, how
it changed, why it changed.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.610
And then we usually do a
large group report out to say,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.160
I thought this going in,
but I heard from so-and-so

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.540
and this is what I think now.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.339
So we do a little
bit of a report out.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.670
Also because of the fact that as
the instructor, since you can't

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.230
hear with students
are saying, you

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.230
want to know if there's some
big misconception that's

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.780
been propagated
during the activity,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.300
and you would want
to address that.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.340
So the report out
for that exercise

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.880
can be particularly important.
