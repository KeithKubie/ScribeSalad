00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:10.044
Suppose you placed a camera
at a fixed position,

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.587
took a picture of the sky

00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:15.040
at the same time everyday 
for an entire year

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.612
and overlayed all of the photos 
on top of each other.

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:21.630
What would the sun look like
in that combined image?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.033
A stationary dot?

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.711
A circular path?

00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:25.702
Neither.

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:28.531
Oddly enough, it makes this 
figure eight pattern,

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.559
known as the Sun's analemma,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.380
but why?

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.012
The Earth's movement 
creates a few cycles.

00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:39.318
First of all, it rotates on its axis
about once every 24 hours,

00:00:39.318 --> 00:00:41.982
producing sunrises and sunsets.

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:44.737
At the same time,
it's making a much slower cycle,

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:49.817
orbiting around the sun
approximately every 365 days.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:51.071
But there's a twist.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.161
Relative to the plane of its orbit,

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:57.396
the Earth doesn't spin 
with the North Pole pointing straight up.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:02.857
Instead, its axis has a constant tilt
of 23.4 degrees.

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:06.842
This is known as the Earth's axial tilt,
or obliquity.

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:09.860
A 23-degree tilt may not seem important,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.820
but it's the main reason that
we experience different seasons.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.695
Because the axis remains tilted
in the same direction

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.064
while the Earth makes its annual orbit,

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:20.781
there are long periods each year

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.601
when the northern half of the planet
remains tilted toward the Sun

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.200
while the southern half is tilted away

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.346
and vice versa,

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:31.949
what we experience as summer and winter.

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:33.999
During summer in a given hemisphere,

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.707
the Sun appears higher in the sky,
making the days longer and warmer.

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.908
Once a year, the Sun's declination,

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:42.682
the angle between the equator

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:46.691
and the position on the Earth
where the Sun appears directly overhead

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.464
reaches its maximum.

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:53.382
This day is known as the summer solstice,
the longest day of the year,

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:57.134
and the one day where the Sun 
appears highest in the sky.

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:58.863
So the Earth's axial tilt

00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:02.790
partially explains why the Sun 
changes positions in the sky

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.217
and the analemma's length

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:09.249
represents the full 46.8 degrees
of the sun's declination

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.655
throughout the year.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.903
But why is it a figure eight
and not just a straight line?

00:02:13.903 --> 00:02:17.116
This is due to another feature
of the Earth's revolution,

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.463
its orbital eccentricity.

00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:22.190
The Earth's orbit around the Sun
is an ellipse,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.042
with its distance to the Sun
changing at various points.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.777
The corresponding change
in gravitational force

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:32.306
causes the Earth to move 
fastest in January

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.809
when it reaches 
its closest point to the Sun,

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.346
the perihelion,

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:40.234
and the slowest in July
when it reaches its farthest point,

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:42.616
the aphelion.

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:45.151
The Earth's eccentricity 
means that solar noon,

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.788
the time when the Sun 
is highest in the sky,

00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:50.968
doesn't always occur 
at the same point in the day.

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:54.410
So a sundial may be as much
as sixteen minutes ahead

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.187
or fourteen minutes behind
a regular clock.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:04.202
In fact, clock time and Sun time
only match four times a year.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:08.620
The analemma's width represents
the extent of this deviation.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.736
So how did people know 
the correct time years ago?

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.635
For most of human history,

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:16.334
going by the Sun's position
was close enough.

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:17.844
But during the modern era,

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:22.085
the difference between sundials
and mechanical clocks became important.

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:25.423
The equation of time, 
introduced by Ptolemy

00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:28.439
and later refined based 
on the work of Johannes Kepler,

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.417
converts between apparent solar time and
the mean time we've all come to rely on.

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:37.847
Globes even used to have 
the analemma printed on them

00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:40.004
to allow people to determine 
the difference

00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:44.563
between clock time and solar time
based on the day of the year.

00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:48.679
Just how the analemma appears
depends upon where you are.

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.759
It will be tilted at an angle
depending on your latitude

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.227
or inverted if you're in 
the southern hemisphere.

00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:55.778
And if you're on another planet,

00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.378
you might find something 
completely different.

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:01.844
Depending on that planet's 
orbital eccentricity and axial tilt,

00:04:01.844 --> 00:04:04.351
the analemma might appear as a tear drop,

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.255
oval,

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:07.137
or even a straight line.
