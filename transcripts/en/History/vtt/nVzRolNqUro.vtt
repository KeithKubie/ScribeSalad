00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.545
Gentlemen, this is
the strength test.

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:05.088
The test is strength and
durability of your edge

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.340
as well as the overall
construction of your knives.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.551
I'm going to baton your knives
through these slate tiles

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:11.511
twice.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.345
Matthew, you're up first.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.304
Are you ready?

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.180
Oh yeah.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.142
All right, let's do it.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.560
I am nervous.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.188
The cracks are still
on my head, and I

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.190
don't want my knife to fail.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.668
Well, Matthew, first things
first, your edge held up very

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.962
well, no wiggling, no chipping.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.133
The handle, little
bit on the small side.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.302
Right up here where the
finger rail is, it's square

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.720
and it's a little bit bitey.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.597
Overall, it held up nicely.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.182
Well done.
- Thank you.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.641
Wade, you're up next.
You ready?

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.309
Yeah, I suppose.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.856
I'm worried going into testing.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:08.526
I just hope my blade is
usable, it's testable.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.861
I just have no
confidence right now.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.418
Well Wade, your edge
held up very well.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.295
It's a bit obtuse for me.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:32.217
It's more like an ax edge
than a slicing knife.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:36.513
There is some gapping here where
the shoulders meet the guard.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.556
But, overall, well done.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.641
Thank you, sir.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.517
Christoph, you're up.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.226
All right.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:41.976
You ready?

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.102
Break that puppy.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.312
I don't want to break it.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:45.480
Oh, come on.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.816
All right, fine,
I'll break it.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.151
I feel a little bit nervous.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.238
Tile, not very good for edges.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:08.711
Well Christoph, out here where
it was resting on the tile,

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.547
your edge held up very well.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.925
But when I hit
it, it put a roll.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:14.759
You can hear it--

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.593
Yeah.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.095
--on the edge here.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:18.930
And I do like the
shape of your handle.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.266
It's a very classic design.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.684
Overall, it held up very well.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.355
All right, gentlemen,
now that we brutalized

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.440
your blades in
our strength test,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.192
it's time for the
sharpness test.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.862
I'll deliver two blows to this
conveyor belt with your blade.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.947
Now a sharp blade
should have no problem.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.740
All right, Matthew, you're up.
You ready?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.825
Let' do it.
HOST: OK.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.638
All right, Matthew,
the blade's sharp.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.682
Second cut, it
blew right through.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.186
The first cut when I hit this
blade just rolled in my hand.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:10.523
For me, there's not enough
handle to the blade.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.108
But the blade's sharp.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.318
It's definitely a cutter.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:16.613
It went through
the belt. Good job.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.614
Thank you.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.241
All right, Wade, you ready?

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.493
I suppose.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:25.288
That was not a threat.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.374
I'm worried about the
handle busting through,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.667
something loose coming undone.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.214
The anticipation is grueling.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.467
I have to hold my arm to
keep my hands from shaking.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:55.068
So Wade, first off, I really
like the shape of your handle.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.195
It fits my hand really nicely.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.529
Good chopping edge.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.907
I could take a tree
down with this easy.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.786
But as far as cutting
this conveyor belt,

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.620
it's just not cutting.

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.458
All right, Christoph,
let's do it.

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.056
Well, I really like the
design of your knife.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.891
Your handle feels wonderful.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.351
I like that simple grip.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.103
The style of your
blade is great.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.022
I just wish it had
more of an edge on it.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.816
I can run my finger
along your edge

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.485
without fear of cutting myself.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.112
An edge like that's
just not going

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.738
to cut this kind of material.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.032
I'm sitting in the
same spot as Christoph.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.033
He has some flaws.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.034
I just think mine are more.
