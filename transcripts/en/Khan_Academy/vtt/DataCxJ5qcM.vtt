00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.548
- [Voiceover] The value of a bond

00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:05.484
on January 1st, 2014 is $1,000.

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:10.406
Each year the value of the
bond increases linearly by $75.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.357
So after one year it's gonna be $1,075,

00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:14.133
after another year it's gonna be $1,150.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.434
So on and so forth.

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:19.496
Which graph below represents
v, the dollar value

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:22.666
of the bond as a function
of t, the number of years

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.986
after January 1st, 2014?

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:27.750
Well there's a couple
ways to think about it.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.245
What's the value of the
bond when t equals zero?

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.836
When t equals zero

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.936
that means that we are
at January 1st, 2014.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:39.127
We are no years after January 1st, 2014.

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:40.394
So when t equals zero,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.411
we should get the $1,000
value of our bond.

00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.314
So let's see, this choice has that.

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:49.367
At t equals zero our bond is worth $1,000.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.363
This one at t equals zero, I don't know,

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:52.873
it doesn't even clear, I don't even

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:54.889
see what the value of the bond is.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.803
So I would rule this one out.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:01:00.345
This one at t equals zero the
value of our bond is $1,000.

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:03.896
This one at t equals zero
the value of a bond is $500,

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:06.381
so I would rule this one out as well.

00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.165
So, the two that we're left
with, this one and this one,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:11.200
they start in the right place,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.022
but let's see how fast they increase.

00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:16.365
So remember, every year we
should be increasing by $75.

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:17.364
Or you could say every two years

00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:20.266
we should be increasing by $150.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.863
Or every three years we
should be increasing by $225.

00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:28.543
So let's see, here it's, I'm
just gonna try to eyeball it.

00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:31.654
Let's see after two years we
should increase by about $150.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:35.079
And that doesn't look inconsistent
because one whole block

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.262
of the vertical access is $500.

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:40.582
So let's think, after three
years we should be $225,

00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:43.600
we should be, so that actually
looks a little bit less than

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.015
five, a little less than half of $500

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:48.082
so this one is looking pretty good.

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:50.136
Let's look at this choice right over here.

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:51.460
This one's actually a little bit clearer.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.222
It looks like in two years we've increased

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:57.914
almost $500, which means

00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:01.594
we're increasing nearly $250 per year.

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:03.440
You see that, in one year we're almost,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.562
looks like we're over, we've
increased by more than $200.

00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.258
So this one is increasing too fast.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.337
We can rule this one out.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.113
And this one looks close enough.

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:14.515
It looks like it's consistent
with $75 increase per year.

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.453
And once again, we're just eyeballing it,

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:17.894
but it looks pretty good.

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:20.075
And this one is way off,
and these two just started

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:21.201
in the wrong place.

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.484
So I would definitely go with this one.
