1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,130
Three. Two one. Yeah.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,520
I walked in. You guys were watching
soccer. I was hugely disappointed.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,050
England's and penalty kill. My God. Is
that okay dude? What happened? Like the,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,310
we'll cut man, if they, when they move
on. So the penalty kick and they just won.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,870
They just want England. Just
one. They just fucking done.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,800
You guys rooting for England? You? I'm
English man. I'm happy English. My mom,

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,070
my mom was born and raised there,
bro. I thought what's up bro?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,110
I know most people do English. So
you really root for England? Yeah.

9
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:34,550
Big Time. No Shit. Yes.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,480
I don't know if us isn't in it.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,850
You know what's happening when they're
playing or do you want me to know when

12
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:43,130
the ball goes in? No,
I have kind of an idea.

13
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,560
I would say I'm a blue belt
in soccer, a blue belt. Wham.

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,570
Like I wake up early and watch the games.
The only world got World Cup,

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,370
Dude, I was in boulder. You know Boulder's
like the People's Republic of Boulder.

16
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,530
I don't have to tell you. You're from
Colorado. You know what it's like.

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,390
I went to school. Their son bowlers
rough. Yes. It's uh, they're,

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,190
they're like super duper
liberal and people were

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,770
unnaturally happy about the World Cup,

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,580
like super excited that they know
so much about soccer and yelling.

21
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:16,540
I was at a bar and I was
like, that'll make you hate
it. That'll make you hate it.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,600
But if you just, if you go to
England, you'll feel good about it.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,860
But he was this certain type of white
dude. I, let's see you, you know,

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,840
I mean, well they probably had a dad
that was in the navy or some shit

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,770
got bullied around at home and they just
went the total opposite hard way. No,

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,140
that shit happens. He's a tough sell.
Especially if you're like an athlete,

27
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,860
like a black athlete.
Oh God. This is like,

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,820
that's what I know why
they struggle a little bit.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,700
Like look at the beautiful mountains
are like, bitch, I don't hike.

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,140
I don't give a fuck about your mountains.
That's why they struggle.

31
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:54,430
I think recruiting really, it's so
beautiful there though. Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:59,380
If you're into fucking hiking and fucking
water rafting in shape or super nice

33
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,350
too though. They're all right. They
don't give a fuck about sports.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,950
Where if you go to like a southern
school like Georgia, Tennessee,

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,400
they get pumped. God,
oh, every fucking period.

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,520
Is that bad that they don't care?
Is it good?

37
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,610
Like balance bat makes your
work hard. No, it sucks.

38
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,940
You've got nature out there though.
Eagles and shit like fucking feature

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,690
thing sucks.

40
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,800
You know that a wolves and bears and
wolves and grizzly bears and making their

41
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:30,790
way back into Colorado. Really?
Yeah. That goddamn time. Interesting.

42
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,624
Why were they gone?

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,680
They killed them off in the 18 hundreds
and then they reintroduced him to

44
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:40,681
Yellowstone and mostly they stayed around
Wyoming and Montana or Yellowstone is

45
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,520
and they made their way into Idaho,

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,880
but now they've definitely spotted them
in Colorado and they've also a very

47
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,540
credible source.
In fact,

48
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:54,220
my friend Adam Green tree took video of
what he said it was a grizzly bear and

49
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,050
he knows the difference.
He knows his shit. Yeah.

50
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,310
It was in the San Juan Mountains in
Colorado last September. So they think

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,150
that there's a population of grizzly
bears. Adam would know. He would know.

52
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,330
And if you watch the news, like
the local news in La, which I do,

53
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,760
especially when I get depressed,
you there's,

54
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,290
there's a bunch of black bears like a
hot tubs in shit popping up in Pasadena

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,280
chilling. Huh? Why did
they love the tubs? Well,

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,170
they don't know that it's a hot tub.
They just know it's water.

57
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,780
And so like for them to find a
spot that's filled with water,

58
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,390
it's probably terrible for them.
And once you have a salt pool,

59
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,570
they know how hot it is doing.
The chlorine, the chlorine,
that's what I'm saying.

60
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,540
Like it's a bear's drinking all
that chlorine goes in that pool.

61
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,960
You know what you're doing hot tub.
Yeah. That's like, that's dick soup.

62
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,200
Conch soup and then black mayors. Yeah.
What percentage of hot tubs to people?

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,030
Fucking 100% is the answer.
100% well in Pasadena expressly Pasadena,

64
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,150
they're just rocking it out there.
Yeah. There's a lot of bears up there.

65
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,540
There's a funny video man at this dude
in Pasadena and he's on his phone and

66
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,110
he's walking down an alley and as he
turns and walks down the aisle and he just

67
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,970
on his phone and he's looking down,
he's not looking where he's going.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,660
He looks up and there's a fucking bear
right in front of him and the beer didn't

69
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,220
do shit.

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,840
The bear doesn't know what to do and
he just runs really find that dude,

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,550
homey is just not paying attention. I
would shit my pants. Oh yeah, for sure.

72
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,270
It's like you saw the, you saw the
homeboys in Seattle yet fucked up.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,890
Well one died by the mountain lion. Yeah,
that's super hungry. Mountain Lion. Yeah,

74
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,590
just on a bike. Apparently the
mountain lion was a Macy ated.

75
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,370
It was all fucked up and sick and it
only weighed like 90 something pounds.

76
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,240
But it's still fucked. Both of those dudes
up. But they, they tell you like, oh,

77
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,870
use your bike as a shield and scare
them off that Lens. Like, what?

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,640
I don't give a fuck about your trek
button. They hit it with the bike.

79
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,430
Apparently it didn't do shit.
How about homeboy was like, dude,

80
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,740
you're going to attack. I'm going
to run and get help. Way to go.

81
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,860
Asshole runs off in that line
goes where the fuck you going?

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,230
And they can't kill him.
Yeah. Homeboy got away.

83
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,370
You know that happened in Beijing to with
the lady who got out of the car and a

84
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:54,520
tiger attacked her at the wild animal
park. Yeah, that's what you get.

85
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,080
She got out of the car. The Tiger tanks
are here to stay. Dan. That's a big bear.

86
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,100
Big Bear. That's a fucking
terrifying bear. So this guy,

87
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,570
he's on his cell phone.
Where's the uh,

88
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,340
that's a big ass beer. Here it is. Here
it is. Watch the dudes on his phone.

89
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,310
He's like, fuck. Which by the way,
the worst fucking thing you could do,

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,640
just go run. Super Lucky.
See if you could pull back.

91
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:25,030
You can see like where the bear walks
behind those bushes. Yeah, right here.

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,920
This is hilarious, dude. Look,
the bears walking right there.

93
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,420
That guy walks down. He's
not even looking. Dude,

94
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,530
you're supposed to get loud, right?
Like get as big as possible. Yes.

95
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,350
You definitely don't want to run away
because their instincts that have chase.

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,711
Yeah,

97
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,440
but they say when you get loud and like
challenge them like you hear about that,

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,430
it's fine.

99
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,730
I don't want him having your about that
boy scout leader know who they rent.

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,480
They solid bear and you know it's like
play dead or, or do your thing, you know,

101
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,670
or you know when you play
dead or get real big and loud.

102
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,140
Like they don't know exactly what to do.

103
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,990
But I bet I guess the boy scout fucking
handbook says to get loud and like make

104
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,740
a scene. I'm gonna Forget loud made a
scene and that beer was like, oh cool.

105
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:08,660
Hey kids watch this. Atum asshole first
and from the whole squad. Oh No. Yeah.

106
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,090
So they don't,
I don't think they know exactly.

107
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,620
Well the problem is bears are just
like every other animal, right?

108
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,150
Like think about dogs.
All dogs are different men.

109
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,600
Some dogs just come over to their house
and they're like, hey, what's going on?

110
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,190
How are you doing?
And it's some dudes,

111
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,020
you come over to their house and
dog's checking you out and like,

112
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,570
I dunno motherfucker. I'm
not sure about you, Austin.

113
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,810
They get around you and the hair
comes up and you're like, oh my God,

114
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,990
his hair's up the worst. Your dog has
his hair up. What's going on here?

115
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,430
I think bears are probably just like dogs
and they're just, they vary. They say.

116
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,820
It also depends where you're at. Like
they walked into his cave so he's like,

117
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,390
you're in my house. Give me
that ass hole. It's terrifying.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,090
I don't think if you're that cub
scout you're like, oh my God.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,990
Apparently the worst thing that could
happen is you walk into a female with

120
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,490
their cubs game over a female grizzly
with her cubs. She'd just light you up,

121
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,980
do you don't have no chance. It's not
like you're going to, what do you do?

122
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,620
I was listening to some bitch on the
news because they're talking about black

123
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,930
bears in hot tubs and few run
into one. This lady is saying, go,

124
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,190
solar's punch him in the nose on my nose.

125
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,260
They're noses are super sensitive or
go for the eyes. Yeah, let me try that.

126
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,760
They bite each other's faces.

127
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,070
You people have to understand like
when they fight with each other,

128
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:19,010
which they do all the time,
they do all the time.

129
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:23,030
They're always fighting for sure.
There's in person fight in the wild.

130
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,780
I've seen it. They just fight,
especially during the Rut,

131
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,070
like in the springtime,

132
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,310
they fucking bite each other's faces
and it doesn't even look like anything

133
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,180
happen. They bite the shit out of
each other and nothing happens.

134
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,820
So you contacting clothes

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
with you little bitch ass hands.
Like what are you going to do?

136
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,800
Cowan has an old bit where,
uh, it's, he did on a special,

137
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,600
so he won't mind me saying it. We count
as a little bit where people would go, oh,

138
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,250
just punk punch a shark in the nose.
Secure, tried punching underwater.

139
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,540
He's like all slow.

140
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,730
I've taught that exact same thing.
I've thought that exact same thing.

141
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,070
Like how much could you
generate underwater?

142
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,350
Like people go under water to work out.
You've seen that famous photo of Ali.

143
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,070
Ali used to do a lot of shadow boxing in
the water water and John recreated it.

144
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,460
Have you seen John John's one?
It's fucking dope. That's right.

145
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,370
Know GSP does a lot of work in the water.

146
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,150
He was the first one I knew it was doing
work in the water and actually for,

147
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,100
I mean months would drive down to Laguna
Niguel where he's working out and we do

148
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,410
water workouts and we're in the pool
when the pool for like two hours.

149
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,110
I was like Bro, I did it for
two weeks and think it, he goes,

150
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,170
you coming in on Wednesday and
I go, oh worst. Just the worst.

151
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,260
That sounds more like someone with a
mental disability from that sounds like a

152
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,520
rice.
I like Stephen Hawking.

153
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,080
Definitely sound like someone who doesn't
know English. That good. Not Good.

154
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,110
So anyways because you
come in on Wednesday,

155
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,290
I won't do that cause then again
and I was like Nah, I'm not man.

156
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,230
I'm thinking of fucking pull.
You'd be in there for like two hours.

157
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,420
He'd have these things.
You just have been doing this stuff.

158
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,480
He does a lot of jumping, which is
really interesting. I was thinking about,

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,250
I was like, yeah, you could
generate maximum force,

160
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,440
like jumping in the water and it's
probably like real easy on the joints in

161
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,930
comparison. It's easy
on the joints. But um,

162
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,420
I was listening to one
expert talk about it. Um,

163
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,250
actually I think Loren
Landow is telling me this,

164
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,710
he's a strength coach for the
Denver Nuggets, the Denver Broncos.

165
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,770
Now he was saying it's good to mix in,

166
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,250
but to do it every week all the time,
especially in the sand or water,

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,200
you're not going the same explosiveness.

168
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,580
You're not generating the same explosive
power. So you should mix it up. Yeah,

169
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,210
he goes, if you're just
doing that, you're actually,

170
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:30,580
it's actually gonna make you less
explosive. Wow. See though, she just,

171
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,000
B plus p begs to differ like land out.

172
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,790
But those dudes that are
just on the cutting edge,

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,390
they're constantly let comparing studies
and just trying to get that little

174
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,540
extra edge.
And it is so interesting now.

175
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,560
It's so like the world of strength and
conditioning has never been like more

176
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,500
complicated because there's no
more bro Science. They'll also,

177
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,690
because there's actual experts are
like, you can look it up now, right?

178
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,860
Like back in the day, my buddy like,
dude, just eat fucking egg whites,

179
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,090
which we know the terrible thing.

180
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,290
Just the eggs and drink milk and
get fucking swole. You wish that no.

181
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,210
Everyone had all sorts of weird fucking
diets or just take this Bsn enecto

182
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,740
explode and you'd be jacked, Bro. Yeah.

183
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,360
There's so many variables still.
There's still some some variables,

184
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:17,250
but when it comes to like the guys that
get paid big bucks to train top level

185
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:21,340
athletes, they seem to all be kind
of on the same page, correct? No,

186
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,570
Lauren Endo is one of my best friends at
plyometric stuff. A lot of plyometrics.

187
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,470
They all,
usually they all agree on similar things.

188
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Like they might have this variation here,
this variation here,

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,990
but most of them agree on the
same fucking thing. Potatoes.

190
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,370
No one's saying you need to be power
lifting only and no one's, yeah,

191
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,220
no one's doing anything stupid. A
lot of them are saying, you know,

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,030
doing like Max reps and and
multiple days and all this stuff,

193
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:49,050
like that's not the way to go anymore.
[inaudible] days are over,

194
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,340
but I say fuck that noise.

195
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,120
I still do the meat head days like
sometimes like whatever fun to be a mean

196
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,100
Italian, get those jeans
shorts out. Yeah. Nice.

197
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,800
Three hour workout for
Ross was looking for Deca.

198
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,480
Frost was given us some insight into that,
that like his philosophy on training,

199
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,820
what he said it was the most
interesting thing. He's a smart,

200
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,920
smart man by the smartest people get,

201
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,340
but one of the more interesting things
that he said was that you should never

202
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,930
feel sore. He's like, you should work out.

203
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,530
You should build yourself up to the
point where you never feel sore.

204
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:27,180
It never push yourself past your
limit should never be like, ah, never.

205
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,700
It's like working out or training too.

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,250
He was talking about training and talking
about everything he was talking about.

207
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:36,840
Just do more, do more
of a day. Interesting.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,740
Yeah. He was saying that if you do like
sets it like do a set at like here,

209
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,880
here's a for instance, I'm taking it
out of context. This is example. Yeah.

210
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,040
It was like if you did um,
certain amount,

211
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,300
I forget the numbers he was talking about,

212
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,670
but if you did a certain amount of work,
let's just to paraphrase,

213
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:55,420
say if you do a 20 ups and
do two sets of 20 chin ups,

214
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:59,770
he like barely can get 20 and you're
burnt out afterwards and your wrecked or

215
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,820
instead of that you're doing
40 reps, right. Either way,

216
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,060
do 40 of them throughout the day,
but do it five reps at a time,

217
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,290
but do the same amount of work.
How would hold your stamina?

218
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,590
It's a good question but the idea being,
well I think it's a different thing,

219
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,331
but the,

220
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:19,870
the idea being like to get yourself into
this position where you can train hard,

221
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,910
especially with like physical fitness
type stuff shouldn't break your body down

222
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,753
totally.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,750
You should just give your body enough
of a chance to fully recover and then

224
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,500
build up.

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,590
I think we have to be a little careful
with it because for us specialize in

226
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:35,300
mixed martial arts where there
so many disciplines, right?

227
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
Where you can't go balls to the
wall and strength condition.

228
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,260
You can't just break yourself
with wrestling. You can't
just go hard and sworn.

229
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,020
You have to kind of monitor
those things and figure it out.

230
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,320
So I think it's a little bit
of bias thing. He's right.
I think as far as it goes,

231
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,160
as mixed martial arts,

232
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,370
Loren Landow has been saying that forever
cause I'd go super hard in the weight

233
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,430
room. He's like, I'm telling you tonight
you have wrestling, you'd be screwed, man.

234
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,390
Got To figure this out. You've got
to figure out this form with a man.

235
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,050
That was a long time ago.
Yeah.

236
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:04,051
They think that doing weightlifting and
lower reps more often is a way to do it.

237
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,710
Yes. It's fucking interesting man.
But when you train for a fight,

238
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,900
you're going to have to push
yourself, right? If you're going to,

239
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,740
there's going to be certain things like
whether it's hill sprints or whatever it

240
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:15,011
is.
I mean,

241
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,630
you're going to push yourself to the limit
and I remember [inaudible] is Bisbing

242
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,900
NGS. We had the same concept and trading
with both of them are busy being,

243
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,260
he would go so hard in
practice. I kissed his, his,

244
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,060
when he would warm up his
repetition, striking, hitting
Mitts, wrestling, Jujitsu,

245
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,750
everything was super high and they come,
this is where I get my card here from.

246
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,660
I'm doing the actual sport of it. I'm not
going to go run fucking sprints. Right.

247
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,890
Just gonna do more wrestling
rounds and GSP was very similar.

248
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,050
You'd go super hard in that aspect.
Yeah. GSP was a wizard with that stuff,

249
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:47,621
man.
I mean,

250
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:51,130
he was always at the cutting edge and it
came to doing gymnastics member who was

251
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,820
really into gymnastics with them, meaning
Mark Hart and him would do it together.

252
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,570
So interested in big ass. I'd watch them
do all these flips, flops, iron man,

253
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,410
let me try this bullshit.
Fucking cartwheel. And
they're like, very good man.

254
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,870
It's good. You're getting better.
You're better than fuck you guys.

255
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,880
Does anybody your size do that stuff?

256
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,880
It's gotta be some the
biggest one in there for sure.

257
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,940
And the rest were all eight year
old girls who are just monsters.

258
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,140
Nate and just pee.

259
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I should look like this
big Shrek character in the
gymnastics is probably like

260
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,230
the sport that gets dudes the most
jacked when you see like ring guys tiny

261
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:30,120
though. Right? But there. Well,

262
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,720
do you ever seen a skinny midget, you're
skinny, small person I've ever seen.

263
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:39,400
Like a real thin, small
person. Just how, sorry. Small
Person. Uh, they're all jacked.

264
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,640
Are they?
No fat asses.

265
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,070
They're all jagged bat houses,
Bro.

266
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,290
I don't think it's the same
thing we're talking about here.

267
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,530
I'm saying the smaller, I know
they're small though. Third Jack.

268
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,810
Like if like if Lebron got in gymnastics,
he's not going to be Jack.

269
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,860
Well what's the average size
of a like an Olympic gymnast?

270
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:04,550
Five three or the really tiny,
tiny,

271
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,230
stocky Jack Jack.

272
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,010
But they've also been lifting like
that since like four months old.

273
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,060
All I was getting at, sorry,
before your horrific, no,

274
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,830
I correct this scale. Herbalist rant.
Uh, do you know what a Buddhist is?

275
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,370
The newest thing? No. What to say? If you
make fun of someone who has a disability,

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,870
you're able ablest including stupid
people. Tall gymnast is no oxymoron.

277
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,700
Okay. The average height for adult male
gymnast is around five four to five.

278
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:36,470
Seven. Johnathan Horton is listed as
five one five six five eight five.

279
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,020
The tallest one is my height. Five, eight.

280
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,080
I mean he's like the Dikembe
Mutombo tall [inaudible].

281
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,030
Who's the tallest? This is like the
tallest girl was like five. Two. Oh Jesus.

282
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,440
So that makes sense. I mean, our stud,
does it say gymnastics stunts growth?

283
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,080
Is that really what they think?
They start super young,

284
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,080
said that bright pillow that there was
an article. Does gymnastics stunt growth?

285
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,860
Is that a real question? Whether it's done
script, right. That's what I'm saying.

286
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:07,160
Is that a real question?
Let's see. Click it. Well,

287
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,250
they say lifting young stunt
your growth. Right? I heard that.

288
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:13,780
But how do they know that they don't even
listen? Why aren't you in fourth grade?

289
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,580
Why aren't you maybe you'd be
fucking super giant if you did.

290
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,550
I should have been fucking with
the gymnastics. What does it say?

291
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,520
Hold on a second. Stunts
growth explained. Hmm.

292
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,170
I don't remember tall. Maybe
there's drawn to it. You know,

293
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,510
maybe the short people are drawn to it.
Makes Sense.

294
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Well for it's absolutely a myth says u
s gymnastics scientific community is an

295
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:38,420
entirely sure,

296
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,620
but the idea that gymnast's would have
grown to be a foot taller for they'd only

297
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,120
hadn't spent the time on the
parallel bars is absolutely a myth.

298
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,660
The best in the world is four eight that's
Simon Bio biles is four eight Simone,

299
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,470
some girl bro. Simone, don't Miss Gender.
Her friends call her assignments son

300
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,450
talking about Sim sims four April
essentially see that recovery.

301
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,310
That's a crazy sport man. When like
everything is like ready, set, go.

302
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,240
It's all about doing it in one moment,
right?

303
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,740
Someone says go,

304
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,030
you know it's there and then you have
to nail it and every a foot you have a

305
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:21,530
routine is you've got to hit a cop at
all. Came over, so over a little slip,

306
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:25,280
all those bunts and you watched
gymnastics. I'll watch a little bit.

307
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:29,120
You won't watch World Cup. I watch
World Cup. I'm just fucking with you.

308
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm just sent you understand. Look, if
you, if I find out something you like,

309
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:35,870
I'm going to start mocking it. That's
how we do tell. We do, I'll tell me do,

310
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm just kind of make fun. If you can
make fun of some shit that I like, man.

311
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,420
I like a lot of dumb shit.

312
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,750
You know how much dumb shit
you did bring back fanny pack.

313
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:47,510
So I brought them back strong.
[inaudible] says, yeah,

314
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
you're will get credit for you
and cro cop though. Let's be real.

315
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,080
You got to give Kroger Europeans less
courageous because they'd been doing it

316
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,900
forever over there.
But as far as you as,

317
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,680
as far as the u s is me and Hulk Cogan
no hope. Got Rid of a long time ago.

318
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,450
Okay, well we, we cross bridges. He
had it and I had at the same time,

319
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,290
it's like a coke relaying. What did he
let it Tom? Oh, years ago. Let it go.

320
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,850
Know that sex date. Can we said fuck that.
I bet he's still got one. No, no way.

321
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,490
I bet he does. Back in the day
at Gold's guys would have them,

322
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:21,810
they'd be steroids in those.
They would shoot up what?

323
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,510
Their little bag? Yeah, he could
buy it off of him. Look at that,

324
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:27,060
the hot seat and have one there.
That's pretty recent.

325
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,890
Those four GTECH had a shitload of
back surgeries, man. Yeah. No Shit.

326
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,140
Would you expect was going to happen
the wrestling he is. I believe so.

327
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,710
Ww eating. I heard that. Yeah.

328
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:42,000
Probably for like Wrestlemania appearance
or something. Yeah. Well that's amazing.

329
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,130
And Chuck Liddell and Tito are fighting,
so what else you got?

330
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,570
What do you think of that? Not My cup
of tea, but you know I used to watch it.

331
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,740
I for sure. Well, to watch it,
we'll watch campaign for it.

332
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,610
There's some people say it
shouldn't happen, right? No, I see.

333
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,720
I don't think it shouldn't happen.
I look at it more like if I see,

334
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:04,050
I think if Chuck Liddell was still
employee of the UFC getting paid $400,000

335
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,870
just to chill or whatever he was doing
for the USC, he would not be fighting.

336
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,220
I think it's more of a money play,

337
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,670
which bums me out because I think
chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz,

338
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:14,310
what they did for the sports should be
compensated for the rest of their lives.

339
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,550
I you bumps me out. They have to
fight to make money. That bumps me up.

340
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,070
I don't know if Tito does so much cause
he was very smart. Chuck, you know it,

341
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:24,150
it seems like maybe that's the
what's going on there, but,

342
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,410
but he also has been saying,
no, you got to wonder what,

343
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,850
where this is coming from.

344
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:33,780
But he has been saying that he misses it
and it's the who was his favorite thing.

345
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,740
I miss that. He misses it. Yeah,
but it's different. Like if,

346
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,780
if we're going to live forever, if we're
going to live forever, I would say, yeah,

347
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,770
definitely don't do it because you're
just going to keep damaging yourself if

348
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:47,910
you're not going to live forever.

349
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,520
He's 48 so let's say we're going to live
to a hundred let's say chuck lives a

350
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,910
hundred homes. He's halfways
and being friendly right now.

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,320
Let's say he's going to live
to a hundred never know.

352
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,900
Athletes don't let us in brother.
Oh, I have another one. Am I?

353
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,860
I'm 35 30 solid years left to be.

354
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:09,330
So let's say chuck is going to
Madison's Sun Science. I knew shit.

355
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,490
I'm big though. Great
hands. Great Danes Bro.

356
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,430
So let's say he lives to a hundred
he's basically halfway there. Dude,

357
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,220
at the halfway mark fighting. It's
just, it can't be healthy man.

358
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,540
Like imagine me in 50 fighting Joe.
And you're the exception, you know,

359
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,420
like you're in phenomenal shape it.
Yeah, but I don't want to get hit.

360
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,570
You don't get hit in the face. It's not
going to be pretty. Not In the head.

361
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,530
Especially if you had all those years
of, listen, I'm not hating on it.

362
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,210
There's a market for it. Do
your thing. I took, like I said,

363
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,840
to me it's more of a sad story.

364
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,160
I think they should be compensated or
like I want them to parlay their careers

365
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:48,010
like a Michael Stray Han or Kobe Bryant,
you know, where through legends and

366
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,480
then they move on to do great
things. I agree. But I also,

367
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,380
if they wanted to compete,
it was because they wanted to compete.

368
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,140
I wonder where it makes sense to tell
them they can't or they shouldn't because

369
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,600
if they want to do it,
if they both want to do it,

370
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,930
like if they had money and they're
like, oh, so what is it about?

371
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,090
Is it the motivation that bothers me?

372
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,670
Like what is it about a fight like that
is the fee. I think it's the motivation.

373
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:18,010
Yeah. I cringe a little bit right
half a little bit because see,

374
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,970
I think Tito did better financially.
You know? I think Tito is fine.

375
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,670
He did really well in Bella Torah.

376
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,750
He might actually want this fight
just to fight chuck again. I think so.

377
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,430
I think Tito Tito's a
different trajectory. Correct?

378
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,420
Yeah. I mean he's been fighting
and doing well any last few years,

379
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,820
you know? Yeah. He's, he's
still a formidable guy.

380
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,130
Yeah. He's a beast to those. A big
fella. Yeah. Both. Great guys. Now,

381
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:53,110
I will say this, everyone who's fighting
in these older leagues or if they,

382
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,140
if golden boy, if that's your thing
to do like these, this master league,

383
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,130
every one fight in that league, better
pray to the MMA. God's view Bell Balfour.

384
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:05,620
It does not enter that fucking thing.
Juice to the gills. Yes, you better.

385
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,110
She's amazing. Fantastic.
So happy with, we'll,

386
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,850
we'll kick the fuck out of all those
old dudes at the same time. He really,

387
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,510
well dude, I was looking at his Instagram
the other day. I was like, oh my God.

388
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:17,080
Yeah,

389
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,130
there's something happens to veto or when
he fills up with super unleaded dude,

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,670
it's like he a butter and Jelly.
He's a different and doing roids bro.

391
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,490
Like some people don't, don't, don't do
well with Roy to get all red and shit.

392
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,760
He looks great.
His skin vibrant is tits or popping.

393
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,290
He's all tans teeth get wider.
He's doing straight testosterone.

394
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,840
He's not mean when he was on, see, think
about this, right? We know for sure.

395
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:45,370
We all know absolutely 100% that people
have cheated and taking steroids and got

396
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:49,510
away with it. We know that. I know
you know that especially in fighting,

397
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,260
especially when the weigh ins where the
only day you had a pee and there was no

398
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,480
randoms, they didn't just
come by. We know for a fact,

399
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,290
but when you watch someone who's just
doing testosterone and what else is doing

400
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,810
with a tumor growth hormone and plead
fucking gigantic now. I love that.

401
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,500
I love it too. But what you get
there, it's a different thing.

402
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,610
Like for Vituro like something
happens with him. Like when you,

403
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:18,790
when they allowed him to take it,
like during the Rockhold fight,

404
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,140
Bisping fight dude, his body
ate it up. But that's it.

405
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,220
It's a kind of a different thing because
you're, it's like it's above board.

406
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,640
Right. Let me let them do it so he
doesn't feel guilty about it. You feel me?

407
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,310
Cause he still, he's finding a
way where it's still legal. Yeah.

408
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,900
When he was doing it, yeah, he was doing
it legally. It was doing it leaving.

409
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,880
He got permission from the UFC
to do it. Yeah. The commission.

410
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:44,350
So it as much you want to say if
you go back before he did it like a,

411
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,070
you see when he sexy Yama. Yes. Dude. His,
his body didn't look nothing like that.

412
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:53,900
It looked like a welterweight. Right? And
everyone wants to go. A lot of people go,

413
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:58,460
oh, he did steroids with whatever sports.
Sammy Sosa, Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds.

414
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,360
You take steroids.
Try hitting those fucking homeruns.

415
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,720
Everyone was doing it in fighting.
A lot of people were doing, I'm,

416
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I can say names if so when Jon
Jones tested hot against DC,

417
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:13,100
right? Whatever he does hot for.
If DC was doing the same stuff,

418
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,050
would he have beat John?
The answer's no.

419
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,520
What was a very close fight up until that
head kick, right? It was a good fight.

420
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,040
You don't, you really never
know what could have happened.

421
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,070
I'm just saying about high level
fighting. Right? Correct. However,

422
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,980
but however that's what happens.
We have to judge it based on that.

423
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,830
If they are taking the same stuff,
whatever you want to say, John took.

424
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,260
But if DC was saying, do you think the
outcome would've been any different?

425
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,250
My answer's no. If they were taking
the same stuff. I see the John Thing,

426
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:39,230
we've gone over this,
but we probably should go over this again.

427
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,410
If anybody doesn't know the actual,
the numbers,

428
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,990
he tested negative,

429
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,980
then he tested positive
for a minuscule amount,

430
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,490
was really small and then
he tested negative again.

431
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,770
So whatever happened happened in a very
short window and it was incredibly small

432
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:01,610
amount of whatever that stuff was.
Some call it micro dosing. Yeah.

433
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,880
It could be that. Maybe we don't,
we don't know really. Yeah.

434
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,660
The thing about it is that stuff is
supposed to stay in your system for a long

435
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:08,991
time.

436
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:12,530
It would be a stupid thing to take
because supposedly it's in your system for

437
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,800
weeks, but we don't, we don't. Yeah.

438
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,970
And also the micro dosing Shit
is real folks. That's real.

439
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,360
I mean that's what they were doing in
baseball. They were taking testosterone,

440
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,140
gummy bears and they would only last
like three or four hours and decided we

441
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,440
arrived, belies it today. Or I would
eat them during the game. Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,780
And then by the time the game was
over, it's out of the system. Yeah.

443
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,090
And baseball with that was the testing
baseball players was that dumb as shit,

444
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,360
but it was one of those weird American
things like everybody's [inaudible] but

445
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,160
if we had the Russians attitude about
this, just be cool man. If, I mean,

446
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:49,851
what is it like,

447
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:54,410
like how do the Russians feel about like
that documentary Icarus where that guy

448
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,890
came on and claim that all the
Russian athletes were on steroids.

449
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,860
They don't get to dress like, yeah,
no shit buddy. Anyways, whatever.

450
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:04,340
Let it go over it. Get over it man.
Kill a few whistleblowers over here.

451
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:08,390
Don't mind us. Come over here. Let me know
how it works out for you. Yeah, yeah. Um,

452
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:12,560
but wonder, but that's the stuff was
steroids. I think we put too much,

453
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,980
we almost put too much
emphasis on the steroids.

454
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,590
They don't get wrong and get fucking
helps and helps a lot of guys. But if,

455
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,940
if everyone was on the same thing,
John Jones is still be the grace all time.

456
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:26,900
He'd still on being defeated. Brock
Lesnar. It's still be Brock Lesnar.

457
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,550
I think Kane would still be canes.
They'd still be it.

458
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,870
I think everything would be
the exact same. I gotta I
gotta be serious here, man.

459
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,850
I think you're right.
If everybody was on,

460
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,820
the results would be the
same if everybody was on.

461
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,350
The problem is like some people
like the tour, just, it just,

462
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,190
his body

463
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,150
loves it. He's made for his
body's made for TRT replacement.

464
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,370
It's crazy. Yeah. So I mean, you
know, good luck. Good luck. Good luck.

465
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:57,610
Do that. Now that he's in the wild west
of Brazil and he's looking for stuff

466
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,340
on his Instagram, we talked
on his Instagram, he finds
his fan and you're like,

467
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:05,370
how long have you been a fan?
He's all begin and Brown.

468
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,980
If you want to see me fighting,
those gets goes, let's do it.

469
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,700
Like gives them a wink. I'm like, yeah,

470
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,290
who's going to sign up to fight that
fucking monster? But here's the thing.

471
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,060
How does he get out of his contract?

472
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,070
Does UFC still have them under contract
or did he retire? He retired, but that,

473
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,880
but just because you retired and I know,
cause I retired.

474
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,610
Your contract isn't void.
It's frozen. They're very
smart, but it's veto. Balfour.

475
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,630
I highly doubt all he's done for the UFC.

476
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,430
I guarantee you can talk to let them go.
I would let them go out. Assume yeah,

477
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,190
that would be nice if they did.
The scary thing about chuck is Dana,

478
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,350
who's obviously very close
with chuck for a long time.

479
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:44,970
I don't know if they're so close anymore.
Dana, this is Dana gone. She says,

480
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,640
I don't think he should be fighting like
I don't want to see him fight again.

481
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,080
I sure as fuck went limp fight here.

482
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:53,250
I hope he stopped and went on close to
the situation. So then I'm like, Oh God,

483
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,440
but he's going to do what he's gonna do.

484
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,140
Chuck versus Vituro was one of
the first fights I ever called

485
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,820
completed his contract with the UFC last
month and a lost Liotta Machita but it

486
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,120
doesn't mean he's retiring.

487
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,810
The phenom took to social media to hint
a return as fans who they would like to

488
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,960
see him fight next. Always. He's good
then. That's usual free tour though.

489
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,640
His choices were a bit curious.
Who is he asking a fight? Vandelay.

490
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,830
He asked the fan, so he said [inaudible]
Chuck, Tito, Bisbing or handle? Well,

491
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,390
hand on business, not
happening. Truck t door.

492
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,650
Manderly you're telling me you wouldn't
watch fan ugly Vitorin I would go for

493
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:31,640
that. I would watch that. What if,

494
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,980
so imagine of Tito and
chuck fight and chuck wins.

495
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,450
Chuck wants to fight again.
He wants to fight Vituro again.

496
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,710
Pete v tour in UFC 37 and a half and
now it's like we're back to the future.

497
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,840
Yeah. Text. Chuck might please don't
fight via tour. He's a fucking I fee.

498
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,470
I feel like it's different with, but wait
a minute, we don't know. Chuck was clean.

499
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,770
How about get chuck on the super soft,

500
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,650
the ultimum iceman sets truck
in a round 48 years old sound.

501
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,870
You can't be eating mangoes and dates and
fucking almond butter and think you're

502
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,620
going to compete with a sauce Dot v tour.
I didn't think of that.

503
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,400
Come on golden boy. Yeah,
you get that fucking, yeah.

504
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,890
You can't fuck with any
legitimate organizations.

505
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,890
All these with all these organizations
that want to sneak up on you in the

506
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,520
middle of the night and test your
key now plan, come on golden stairs.

507
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,650
Take a break. How about, how about, uh,

508
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,400
there's guys like Josh Barnett
and even Leo. Leo said,

509
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,650
this goes with signed with the
UFC because of you sada enough.

510
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,030
See they've all been busted previously
so that they have a little different.

511
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,910
You have an agreement with them,
but they're saying, listen.

512
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,980
Well Josh Barnett was not bust by right.

513
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,160
They came out. He never took anything.
We lost a year of his career. Yeah.

514
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,780
I don't understand the Josh Barnett case.

515
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:50,680
I'd like to have him explain it cause it
sounds like what I've read sounds like

516
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:54,980
he got fucked. No, he did tell
me what you know, they admit it.

517
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:00,290
They know for a fact he did not write
like they came out that same thing.

518
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,760
Like they've had other guys, right? Like
the, the, the dirty bird. What's his name?

519
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,090
Tim means he means they came out that
are bad over the counter or something.

520
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah. It's all good. Right.

521
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:14,080
It took like some protein powder that
was slightly contaminated and that came

522
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,850
out as true and with Josh Barnett,

523
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,960
it took a year to figure this out and
then they go my bad bro. Yeah, yeah.

524
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,360
I know he missed a year. And in
your, you know, older fighter,

525
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,440
it's a year of not getting
paid. My Bat, you're back,

526
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,460
you're welcome back now and Barnett's
gone fuck this man. I'm out.

527
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,220
Is that really what they did? I
promise you that's what they did. See,

528
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:35,221
that seems to me to be a case where
you've made an error that should be,

529
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,950
you should compensate that fight.
That's what I'm saying.

530
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,490
He should be fully compensated that
he should have went force a guy.

531
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,870
If you made the mistake, that's that's
like a, I mean I'm not a business person,

532
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,340
but if I was a business
person I'd be like,

533
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:52,030
well this is a clear case of someone
owing someone money because you fucked up.

534
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,900
But what,
what the you saw,

535
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:57,400
I was going to say it was an investigation
took us that long to figure it to get

536
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:01,420
to the bottom of it. That's the
process. But they were wrong. Right.

537
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,560
So if they were wrong,

538
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,270
so all their investigation stuff they did
that took so long to get to the bottom

539
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:10,600
of you accused the guy
who's innocent, right? Yeah.

540
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:14,620
But see they say potentially
flagged for PDS, right?

541
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:17,380
They don't say what you're flagged for
and then it goes into investigation,

542
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,080
but they're not, they don't
say he was, he suspended,

543
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,540
he taught test pilots for this.

544
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:26,080
They say potentially flagged and there's
an investigation then took a year to

545
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:30,430
figure that out. I think that
they, the, you sought a like,

546
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,990
especially,
uh,

547
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,500
under the whatever guidelines that they
had coming in here had a lot to work

548
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,870
with. Right. There's a lot of fighters.

549
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,280
You got to figure out who's he got to
test this one more tonight. I mean,

550
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:48,810
it must be crazy, but it
must be a nightmare. I'm not
saying it's an easy job. I, I,

551
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,960
I think it's too much a very hard job and
I'm thinking it's too much to this 500

552
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:56,800
fighters on roster,
but with a legend like Josh Barnett,

553
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,250
he deserves respect. That's the youngest
ever heavyweight champion. Agreed.

554
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:01,510
Joanie's.

555
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,070
He's one of my favorite fighters and he's
probably one of the smartest maneuver.

556
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,740
Grace the octagon. He's such a smart,
very smart. I love Judge Brennan. However,

557
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,590
if you're Novitsky and you look
at the history of Josh Barnett,

558
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,450
there's a reason to have skeptical golden
snitch eyes on him because he's tested

559
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,600
positive previously. Right. That's
what's going on. See what you're saying.

560
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,490
You know what I'm saying?
Like if you have a track record,

561
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,770
like I'm going to test over him a tad
more Vittorio, tad more than steeple.

562
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,440
You DC, like I just look at DC,
be like, no, you're good dude.

563
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,380
You're fucking super unleaded.
DC. DC's 40 years old son,

564
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,040
DC's 40 years old on the Nash,
which is some powerful fucking genetics.

565
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,550
Just to get him on that super sauce kid,
Bro.

566
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,230
Get them on that v Tour Shit that gives
you veins in your teeth. [inaudible]

567
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,330
phase in your ears. Got here,
dude, killer dude. When he was,

568
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,880
there was a time when [inaudible] was a,

569
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,910
there were had to face off with him and
Rockhold and you look at Vitara like how

570
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,060
he was when he was doing the Mohawk to
get a sting ray hanging off the back of

571
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,690
his neck like a fucking sting ray
with back then. His traps were like,

572
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,650
they look so scary, dude. And this is
even at the Wayans man. This was when,

573
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:16,100
the way is where the real way in,
which I called told me, he goes,

574
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,920
you looked right at him. He's
like, what the fuck is this?

575
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:22,550
But just one straw coming
out of the eyeballs. Just
fucking tears of wind strong.

576
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,840
It was just testosterone.

577
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:27,440
It was just whatever they let her take
was on other things too. Oh my God.

578
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,730
I don't know what he was on.

579
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,230
It's hard to tell from that picture
cause he's an actual one 85 right there.

580
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,060
Oh my favorite fighters deflated.

581
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,400
It's amazing the difference between
some guys like when they weigh in,

582
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:44,840
like Joelle, when he weighs in at one
85 he's still looks super ridiculous.

583
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,610
Uber jacked at one 85 you can't believe
he only weighs one 85 and he gets a note

584
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,190
scale,
but then he fucking,

585
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,660
he mean he just puts all
that meat back on your boy,

586
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:01,190
your boy a Whitaker was like that mother
fuckers. Yeah. Here's interview is like,

587
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,220
[inaudible] said it was magic. He's
like, it's magic. See that man.

588
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,200
Go from that to that.
And he goes,

589
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:09,710
I honestly find them before and he's
aging and this time he was even harder.

590
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,120
He's like, something's up their
son. Yeah. Um, here's the thing.

591
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,860
Maybe, but you know what else may
be may be crazy. Cuban genetics.

592
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,410
I think that shit would be crazy.
There's young genetics,

593
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,600
but how much more impressive
whether whatever it is on,

594
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,180
let's say is on something where
it could beat him twice. Yeah.

595
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,560
There should not be a third fight.

596
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,510
I don't think this decision was just
in the second fight. Now you're crazy.

597
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,250
I think there should have been
10 eights. No, I think I did.

598
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:39,110
The new rules I think should've been a
draw that I don't think you all won that

599
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:39,621
fight.
If any.

600
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:43,220
If you're going to give you all a ten
eight then that's a draw or draw them and

601
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:45,320
I don't think they give drawls out enough.
I will draw them,

602
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:48,950
find her because then they're forced to
have that trust in him saying that I'm

603
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:51,290
fine with.
I didn't think that a decision.

604
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,060
I thought like there's too many moments
in the fight where Yo el hurt Whitaker

605
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,500
like really hurt.

606
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,580
There was no moments in the fight
where Widdick really hurt you.

607
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:04,460
Well like really hurt him.
Like had them in deep trouble.

608
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:08,840
There was one that head kick the wobbling
a little bit [inaudible] the head cake

609
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,430
was when Dow,

610
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,420
I don't think that even fucking did
much it why would his legs a tad bit.

611
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:18,590
But if you go round by round, watch that
fight a bunch. I think I was a good,

612
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,560
that was like he landed with the foot
right [inaudible] face top of the head.

613
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,120
But also like you go round by round.
I just stylistically,

614
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,800
I had Whitaker winning three,
two and I,

615
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,840
let's say I gave you out when he
fucked him up that there was a fourth,

616
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:34,430
a fifth in that I think it was both
rounds. You have him in trouble.

617
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,320
I gave one to 10 90 you all and
then if you give a ten eight youth,

618
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,980
it would still be a draw. Right? Which I'm
fine with, which makes more sense to me.

619
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,180
People have a hard time with decisions
when the guy at the end of the fight is

620
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:45,961
fucking the guy up.

621
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:49,050
Now obviously this is coming from
someone who's a professional commentator,

622
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,910
so I understand this is
a ridiculous argument,

623
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,380
but the ridiculous argument is if
we're going to judge what a fighter is,

624
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,590
we all know if you're
watching a fight fight, right?

625
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,180
If you and I are in a fight and you're
on top of me beating the shit out of me

626
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,490
in the last few seconds when the cops
come in, that doesn't matter if I,

627
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:12,750
if I've ran around this room and kicked
your legs for the first two minutes and

628
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,900
then you got on top of me and we're
beating the fuck out of me for the last 20

629
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:18,570
seconds when the cops can talk in
prison rules, you won the fight.

630
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,730
He won the fight in the fight. But
as a professional sport, understand,

631
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,400
but this is a professional sport
that's kind of a fight in boxing.

632
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:30,960
If I win the first eight rounds,
right, and you're whooping my ass,

633
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,280
nine 10 1112 it was first day. What
do we do there it is. It's a good no,

634
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:39,780
it's real good point dude. It's a
real good point. But the idea is,

635
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,800
see that didn't hardly all he was
on wobble. Q is already tired. Dude,

636
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,480
look how wobbly he is already there.

637
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,690
How about the kicks by fucking
Whitaker tickers? So good dude.

638
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,470
And the fact that he fought that fight,
most of it with a fucking broken hand,

639
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,050
broken him with one's brown and being
with one like the first fight gone. No,

640
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,060
he's how phenomenal the through that hand
to even when, Oh look, you've got cloud.

641
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,920
He was in trouble for Shit couple times.

642
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,890
I had one round of ten eight so
that'd be a draw. See this right here.

643
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,210
This is a ten eight man. This is a ten
eight again, even if you give a tenant,

644
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,610
it's still, it should be a draw. Then
maybe you wouldn't win the fight. Okay.

645
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,540
What draw? Two guys are
fighting. It's a close round,

646
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,480
but one guy drops the round,
drops him and has him hurt.

647
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,910
They're like everything up
until that moment. His clothes,

648
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,950
I think that's still a ten eight geesh.
Toss, tossing ten eight, ten eight.

649
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,280
It's got to be the differences.
Someone almost got finished.

650
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,210
This is an almost got finished
moment. The legs go, the person falls,

651
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,600
the guy gets on top,
starts pounded them to see.

652
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,340
I don't have a problem with ten nine
that I think has to be a clear fucking

653
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,020
bully beat down for ten eight I think
that should be a ten seven I think we

654
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:46,570
should make this shit makes sense. Game.
I mean flat white and five and 10 set.

655
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:51,450
If you gotta stop, you gotta stop slow.
I really feel like this scorecard, this,

656
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:56,190
this 10 point must system silly
the whole thing. Silly the judging,

657
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,500
but the silly things. Yeah,
you're right. We've been,

658
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,430
we've kicked that fucking whore. The
numbers. Like why do we need 10 points?

659
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:06,000
Just because boxing always had 10 points.
They're only using their hands.

660
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,740
They're not even using their elbows.
You know?

661
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:08,850
Just think about all the different things.

662
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:13,430
Like how what's worth more is a jab
worth more than an elbow. Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,410
What's worth more a gea teen choke
that you get out of how much,

664
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,990
how many points you get for that?
I've got to figure that out, man.

665
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,100
But it's also predicated off styles too.
Cause what happens if,

666
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,490
let's say I'm Brian Ortega,

667
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:27,360
let's take Brian and take a mex hallway
and Max Hallway on the feet jabbing good

668
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:30,780
distance control, and Brian really can't
get it going. But then he pulls, guard,

669
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,561
pulls guard,

670
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:36,561
and he's fucking throwing armbar
triangle leg and Max is kind of defend.

671
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:40,090
But he's in trouble. Yeah. They're not
given that to Brian down there. Right.

672
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,020
They don't know shit about the ground
game that they'll get Max on Tom real well

673
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,800
when it was on the feet, he
landed more jabs. Let's give
it to a fucking Max. Yeah.

674
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:52,480
There's moments where a regular guy
is on his back and they're right.

675
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:53,620
Correct.

676
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,710
It doesn't have a good guard or a guy
who just tries to hang on until the

677
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,350
referee pulls them off.
But then there's some dudes who have,

678
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,360
their guard is like the
scariest place to be.

679
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,950
You gotta you gotta know
what you're dealing with.

680
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:06,190
You've got you to know the premises.
You got to remember that Kid Paul Sas.

681
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,940
Fuck yeah. Won So many fights by
triangle, man. It was ridiculous.

682
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:14,800
You see that guy fight off
of his back. He'd be like,
whoa. Yep. He's moving quick.

683
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,750
He was closing shit up quick.

684
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,480
Dude's didn't know what the fuck was
happening and all of a sudden they're

685
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:23,620
jacked and triangled. Dude, how about
that? Max Holloway Brian or take a flight.

686
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,300
That's a greatest fight at 45 cents.
Connor and Aldo. Yeah, I agree.

687
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,820
I agree.
It's such a dangerous fight for Max.

688
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,510
It's a dangerous fight for both guys. I
mean this is the first, well for Ortega,

689
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:37,540
it's not his first time in
worldclass territory. Right.

690
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,541
He had cub and he had Frankie wolf one
bolted them in spectacular fashion I

691
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:45,340
think in this. Frankie never been
done. Never been done before.

692
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,670
But the crazy thing I
thought just as crazy,

693
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,890
maybe more crazy was the way finish cub.

694
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,690
He almost got cub in the first round cup
is a real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu blackbelt

695
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,400
free and I know that Max finished cub
as well, but cub was hurting that fight.

696
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,440
I think he had either a broken jaw or had
he went into the fight. Injured. Yeah,

697
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,570
some was fucked up. Something went
real bad during the fight. Anyway.

698
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,150
You know all credit to Max.
He did finish him,

699
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,800
but it was the way when they went to the
ground or take a locked up that Doris

700
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:19,080
at the end of the first round, I was
like, Jesus standing tight. It was,

701
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,930
this was tied to man when they went to
the ground and they were when it was,

702
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,050
when he was cinching it up and
then the buzzer went off. I'm like,

703
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,060
second step dad, that fights over.
That's fine. That was a tight fucking,

704
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,310
he did the exact same thing
again. He went, oh cool, cool.

705
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,570
He just knew he could do it.

706
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,780
The thing is his Jujitsu as
at such a fucking high level,

707
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,420
he's so dangerous.
You can't really train for it either,

708
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,380
like just just being in the room with
Dortay guts. You've seen triangles,

709
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:51,820
you've seen arm bars. The way he sets up,
it's so explosive in the angles he hits.

710
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,930
You can't bring anyone into
to duplicate that to me,

711
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,080
so different and what's crazy about Brian
says story like he's a guy who's not

712
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,520
going to go on and talk shit. He comes
from a super humble background and his,

713
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,590
his demeanor inside that octagon when
even early on his UFC career when the,

714
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,030
it was not going well for
him and he found some way to,

715
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,720
he's finished all fighters,
so found some way to get it done.

716
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,020
And I think it comes from growing
up in that rough background, man.

717
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,340
It doesn't fluster him. He's like, I
just, I need something he never gives up.

718
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,530
He's like, hey, something's going
to come. Something's going to come.

719
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,020
And I think that's huge in
this Max Holloway fight.

720
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:29,380
Cause Max distance control is
fucking second to none, man.

721
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,000
It's gonna be tough for
Brian to get in there.

722
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,440
I think once Brian can get an hook,

723
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,960
I think we're gonna see him jump
to half guard. Something like that.

724
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,040
It's going to be interesting.

725
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,160
It's going to be interesting to see a
Brian can turn into a Jujitsu match.

726
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:43,220
But the thing about Brian is he so
comfortable with his hands, man.

727
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,040
He's getting more company for sure and
doesn't train that doesn't have like a

728
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:50,000
super team. Yeah, he's amazing.
But Max Holloway, dude,

729
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,840
when I saw the second fight with Aldo,
the second fight with Aldo,

730
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,090
there were some moments in that
fight where I was like, Geez,

731
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,540
he's one of my favorite foods.
Dues on another level now.

732
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,780
But he was overwhelming Aldo. Like
he went into that fight, you know,

733
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,560
and the basically when they announced
the, this is where his phrase, uh,

734
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,860
where it started to hit me, it is what
it is. You know, as I said, I love it.

735
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,770
That was his attitude to go fight an
absolute future hall of Famer who was

736
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:19,550
thought to be the greatest featherweight
of all time. A guy who, you know,

737
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,720
think about some of the spectacular
at Kaos of Chad Mendez. And I mean,

738
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,220
he was a monster when he was young.

739
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,110
So the Cub Swanson flying knee in Wec,
dude,

740
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,430
he was a based and for her collar that
fight and be like, it is what it is.

741
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Like it is what it is. The flux,
that man, he just smashed him.

742
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,600
Just was gonna fight.
Fucking could be. Oh yeah.

743
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,060
And he would've if they'd ref
if commission mission let off.

744
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,920
If the commission did pull him off,
the weight cut he would have fought.

745
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,330
Could be about like how many days
notice what was that? Eight days? Yeah,

746
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,960
some days when curriculum. That's not much
of a bad ass. He is super short notice.

747
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,280
I also think the reason why I love
this fight and so good for the UFC,

748
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:02,120
especially just for the both of them
is Max and Brian are going to fight

749
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,930
multiple times this I think so. I think
this needs to become a cool rivalry.

750
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,480
We're going to see him go
from 45 whoever wins this,

751
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,720
I don't really care who I love both those
men. I fucking love both those guys.

752
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,943
Whoever wins.

753
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,370
I think eventually they're both huge
for the weight class and Max is young in

754
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,700
Brian, they're going to go to
55 even Max's team goes, he,

755
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:23,690
he should be a 55 and he's fucking huge
for 45 well you think about how much

756
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:26,030
weight he had to lose to
get to 55 then I know he,

757
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,270
they pulled them off the weight
cut to 55 which is crazy.

758
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,950
55 there's some flight for them. I think.
And this is great for fighters, man.

759
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:37,340
Like with, with Aldo, he was never
that big until Connor came. Right?

760
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:39,680
And there's this rivalry DC,
John Jones,

761
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,540
Nate Diaz con like there's these Raleigh
Frazier, me shook Rhonda, there's all,

762
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,440
you know Holly run,

763
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,010
there's all this stuff starting to
happen and then people fucking tune in.

764
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,640
So I think for Brian and Max,
they don't need to talk any shit.

765
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,340
They just keep being humble.
Their skills speak for themselves,

766
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,050
but the people want to tune in for that.

767
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,180
And you're going to get a bunch
of flights out of these guys, man.

768
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,960
And I think you're probably right on my
Dick's hard about it. I know. I love it,

769
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,450
man. I get goosebumps talking
about those fucking too. Yeah,

770
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,560
they're pretty bad ass.
It's nice to see, uh,

771
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,170
just anytime you have a guy
who's defending his title
and you have a guy who you

772
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,780
legitimately think could be
a champion and you see, look,

773
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,080
you look at the two of them. Like I look
at that fight and I go, I don't know.

774
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,240
I don't know what's going
on. Yeah, I don't either.

775
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:24,680
I just don't know if Max makes one
mistake by capitalize on it buying so

776
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:26,010
dangerous,
so dangerous.

777
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,690
What's interesting to me is when I first
met Brian Gears going, he's in the gym,

778
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:31,220
remember he was mopping mats,

779
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,230
just doing his thing and Henry
would bring them on the road.

780
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:36,640
He even goes on the road now with Hennen.
They teach cops there,

781
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:39,240
their tactical stuff and
why they do these seminars.

782
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,720
And he was like Ken or
little guy and I was,

783
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,030
took him serious cause
Jitsu was ridiculous and he
would train with me and all

784
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:49,120
this stuff. But I never thought best in
the world, you know, I've never eaten.

785
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,830
Now I know I'm new. I'm like,
what's up man? And I seen it when,

786
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,780
when they told me, cause I caught him
for a fight and then, um, they go, dude,

787
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,660
you fcs come in Colorado. Not
yet. Uh, you know, I'm cautious,
Larry. I'm like, no, no,

788
00:45:01,661 --> 00:45:05,490
no, no, no, no, please. He
has to work on a stamp. Don't
fucking let them do it, man.

789
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,280
And then Henry was like, dude, he
wants to do it. And then fucking,

790
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:12,090
I was way off that motherfucker.
He got good with his hands with fast.

791
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,300
He steps up to the level of competition,
man. Well, he definitely does,

792
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:16,134
but it's also,

793
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,430
he's so good at Hugh Jitsu that he just
took whatever that focuses that got him

794
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:24,420
so good at Jujitsu and
applied it to striking. And
now he's, he's just a winner.

795
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,830
He knows how to win.
You know what I mean?

796
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:29,400
He knows how to put shit together when
he landed that upper con Frankie and I

797
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:32,330
was like,
Jesus vicious frank.

798
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:36,240
He's a hard guy to fucking hit clean
in Paul's. Yeah, gray Maynard. Yeah,

799
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,630
it's a fucking nightmare. Well, even gray
Maynard, he came back and won that fight.

800
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,690
Which was insane. This is insane.
Draw on the first fight. Chaos.

801
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:46,350
I'm in the second fight. Those fights
were fucking chaos, man. Some of the best,

802
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,230
but the fact that Ortega took
him out and meet some people say,

803
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:51,450
well maybe Frankie's at the
end of his rope he's in,

804
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,000
you know he's in as deep into
his thirties now. What is he?

805
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,620
36 something like that, right?
36 34 either way though.

806
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:00,670
It's Frankie Edgar. Either
way. It's Frankie Edgar. Yeah,

807
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,690
and then he went on to beat Cub Swanson
one four weeks later or some shit.

808
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:07,320
I was like, no, I'll do that.
New Jersey. Yeah, 36 yeah,

809
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,630
just phenomenal conditioning dude.

810
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:13,970
And then also on this card
he got DC fucking steepy too.

811
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,800
To me it's like the first real,
like when the super fight here,

812
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,790
to me this is like the first real, real
super fight like GSP Bisping. I was like,

813
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,960
that's cool. That's a thick ass GSP.
I guess that's Super Fun. But DC,

814
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,930
Steve Bay's a fucking real super fight.
That's a real super fight. I love it,

815
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:31,531
man.
You know what?

816
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:36,531
I'm looking to almost lose four to
almost as much of Francis black beast.

817
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,330
That's right son Derek Lewis,
Frances and Ghana. Woo.

818
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,480
I know everyone thinks of me a
first round knockout in there.

819
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,690
Just going to throw caution to the wind.

820
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,140
I think Derrick Lewis double legs him
either in the first round or second round

821
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:54,090
and beats them, uh, via Tko. Really? Yeah.
Damn. How good is d Derek's wrestling?

822
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,450
I mean, he's the explosive dude and
you play football. You know, I, I, I,

823
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,320
I think people are making mistake going.
Oh Derek, just going to go on there.

824
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,280
Francisco, go in the fucking plant. Their
feet and just fucking chuck the bombs.

825
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,940
I think you're wrong, man. I think you're,
I think people think that are wrong.

826
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,480
I think Derek's going to mix
it up if he's smart. I just,

827
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,770
I think what I would do if I was them
in what Derek in his background and

828
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:20,580
Francis working on stuff,
I think Derek's going to shoot the crowd.

829
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:21,630
The crowd's going to bu,

830
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,810
but Derek's going to shoot and
then his grandma house little boot.

831
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,980
It's a good crowd crowd that understands
the danger of Francis on his back.

832
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,650
Derek on top. Derek with big
Kao Power Stop. Travis Browne.

833
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,480
I bet they might be thinking,
oh shit,

834
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:37,420
this is going to get crazy hopefully cause
it's not like if Derek takes you down,

835
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,730
he's just going to hold on to you.
There's going to try to get,

836
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,650
you know you can punch you.
It's going to try to kill.

837
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,240
You can face that Travis Browne
key Tko or a [inaudible].

838
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,170
It's one of the worst ones.

839
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,830
Bisbing route Dan Hendo and then that one
for me it's like you don't want to see

840
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:55,750
that replay and that was a rough one.
That was a tough one. And gather new man.

841
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,400
You got to get to him first.

842
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,270
The thing about getting to him
was you're running into hammers.

843
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,610
You've got to get to him,
got to get to your rotors.

844
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,700
Just got to kind of stay back
and then the cardio gets still.

845
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,730
We only saw him tired once,
but it was a big one.

846
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:11,920
You don't see them out of the
first round ones, right? Yeah.

847
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,060
Steve Bay figured it out. He just, he
does also steep bay. Like we're good.

848
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,020
I get friends, a lot of shit. But that
fucking CPA, he's the most calm, you know,

849
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,170
accomplish heavyweight of all time.
Yeah. I mean you have to look at him,

850
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,010
his accomplishments. You look at the
guys that he stopped and the guys,

851
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:31,330
he defended his title like Great
Stop Fabricio wins the title stops.

852
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,820
Ouster stops junior dos Santos.

853
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:37,690
I mean the only reason why Steven
doesn't get enough credit as he should is

854
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:42,040
because all these guys are a step past
their prime. Right? Like to me, yeah.

855
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,440
And I love Stevie. To me, what's
more impressive when Cain beat Jds,

856
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,190
that was prime jds.
Who was the motherfucker?

857
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,480
Motherfucking Cain put his fucking head
right in the middle of his chest and did

858
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,910
work after getting knocked
out in the first round.

859
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,620
[inaudible] fight in MMA history
was insane. Insane, insane.

860
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,730
Like that. That to me, that's a little
more impressive than what, when, what?

861
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,760
When Steve Bay beach jds cause the
jets JBS after an ass whooping by Kane

862
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,160
rounds. It is impressive.
10 of an ass whooping,

863
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,880
but it's almost as impressive as surviving
that first round against Francis.

864
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,470
I don't know who would have agreed.

865
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,430
There's not a lot of guys that
would've survived that round the waist.

866
00:49:23,431 --> 00:49:26,530
Deep Bay did DC, DC, man, I wonder.

867
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,920
He ate that fucking pumped from Anthony
Romero. John, talk about that kid.

868
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,880
Pop the fuck back up. Yeah. Oh God.
Yeah. Jesus Christ. But John Kay Odom.

869
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,880
Yeah, it's Jon Jones. Jon
Jones beat everyone we're
talking about, but maybe she,

870
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:42,960
the thing about Francis, I'm very curious
to see what it looks like you no, no,

871
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:43,794
not on what I'm saying.

872
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,990
I'm very curious to see what he
looks like in this next fight,

873
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,800
but we're going to find a
lot about whether or not he's
able to correct mistakes,

874
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,100
whether his conditioning is just one of
those things with all that fast twitch

875
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:56,740
muscle fiber, whether he's not going
to be able to go five rounds hard,

876
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,430
I don't think he's going to turn into
fucking Nate Diaz or something like that.

877
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,470
I,
I think it might be a tad better.

878
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,880
The way you get better is not using
all his energy on power punches like so

879
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,270
maybe it's more of a experience thing.
But with Derek Lewis,

880
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:15,100
he also pedal to the metal and hits
hard as fuck too. He does and he's been,

881
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,920
you know, he's been in some serious
trouble that Travis Brown fight.

882
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,720
Like he was in serious fucking
trouble, man. Yeah, he's a,

883
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,310
he's a warrior for sure.

884
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,670
I mean that guy has been in some crazy
ass fucking fights. Crazy fights.

885
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,320
He's dangerous.

886
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,760
Both are super dangerous and he wants
that fight to Derrick Lewis has asked him

887
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:39,320
for that advice. They both won that fight.
This is going to be crazy. Super Crazy.

888
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,520
I think the craziest thing on the card
to me is how many people are riding off

889
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:48,430
DC? He's the underdog against Ebay.
Yeah, I have DCB Noman to you.

890
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,180
Yeah. I know you hate pigs, but when I,

891
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:53,840
when I break down the fight I look at
what that's terrible picture makes the

892
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:58,841
bail like super small fucking DCL giant
small STP looks DC looks like he's like

893
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:02,150
a fucking gigantic. It looks like
Brock Lesnar's do you? It looks like.

894
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,570
And what are they doing?
It looks like a Bantam weight.

895
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,760
It's all there. Yeah. One. So
76 inches. I want to 71 inches.

896
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:11,990
None of that bothers me man.

897
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:15,850
Like the reach the height because DC's
dealt with as entire career Gustafson.

898
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,170
Jon Jones looked,
guys had even bigger reaches.

899
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,300
I think also one thing to
take into consideration,

900
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:24,770
Steve Bay doesn't throw a lot of kicks.
He's not a big kicker being goes, yeah,

901
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:28,160
he's more of a boxer and um,
you know,

902
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:32,060
he's DC's also going to be able to get
under him easier than any guys ever

903
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:36,650
fought before. I mean, dcs flit five 11 to
about five alone if that. Yeah. You know,

904
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:40,930
he's getting, and he fucking, he has
top of the food chain wrestling man.

905
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,370
Remember when he did the Henderson
to Barnard that launched in the air,

906
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,550
launched them in the air. Fucking
slammed them to Barnett. Big Fella. Yeah.

907
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:52,760
And Kim grapple is fucking and
grapples fucking ass off in DC.

908
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:53,980
Took him for a ride sign.

909
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,440
But the Henderson fight was the most
impressive to me because Henderson,

910
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:58,760
even though he's smaller than DC,

911
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,720
he's a fucking stud and he was an
Olympic silver medalist himself and DC,

912
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:06,530
just rag doll dim. See? And people go,

913
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,410
I see some people discredit
DC a little bit when they go,

914
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:12,920
when he won the Grand Prix in strike
force, that was a different time.

915
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,280
Those heavyweights are
older and you know the,

916
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,720
the games evolve while it gets deep AI.
I'm like,

917
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,240
heavyweights haven't really
evolved that much, man.

918
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:23,360
You don't see a guy throwing a lot of
kicks and mixing up wrestling and Jujitsu.

919
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:27,170
Like you look at Steve Bay's game,
it's boxing or wrestling, you know,

920
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,530
that's very similar to
what dcs used to beating.

921
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,210
So the times when he's in trouble,

922
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:35,690
this guy like Jon Jones who fucking
mix up and he's a fucking nightmare.

923
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,970
But when you're just, when you're John
bought all, that's what I'm saying.

924
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,470
When DC goes in a fight and
you're just boxing or wrestling,

925
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,160
dcs is the reason why DC is going to go
down as one of the grapes all the time

926
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:51,050
is his mental game. Bro. You. So fuck
is he's fucking fight Iq is crazy. Yeah.

927
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,640
He's tough as shit. And you
know the, like if you look

928
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,090
who else does it the way John does,
where they're,

929
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:04,490
they're really good at everything. They
win by submission. They win by knockout,

930
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,580
they win by, you know, my
emails, you'd have to go,

931
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,110
you have to go to a lighter weight. Those
are the two, right? Because even Cain,

932
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,640
Cain with do moy Tai and came would
for sure wrestle and ground and pound.

933
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:18,320
But he never really submitted anybody.
No.

934
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,850
Kingston was wrestling and smashing
out windows. Yeah. Outwork you,

935
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,620
get you to get you exhausted
to the point you didn't,

936
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:27,900
you never even believed you could
be there. Embrace the grind.

937
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,510
Which DC has been trained with
Cain for out of this fight. Yeah.

938
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,640
And who is came back now. Is he a hundred
percent training? Yeah, he's helping him.

939
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,630
Wow. So, so when I look at
that, I go up a cane styles,

940
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,610
almost identical to fucking Steve Bay's,

941
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:44,550
but Steve has a little more
power as far as cardio,

942
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,370
wrestling kings better at
those things, man. Well,

943
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:50,930
Cain was better than anybody that ever
lived for like two years. There was there.

944
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,630
Yeah, there was a moment. I mean, and
he just got injured so many times.

945
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,130
There was so many injuries with him,

946
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:01,490
but like when you look at what he was
able to do with real fucking tough guys,

947
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,930
just break them down. Deal
tough guys. But you know,

948
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:10,290
he's had shoulder surgery,
back surgery, knee surgery.

949
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,970
I mean after a while everything was just
given out because of the force of his

950
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:19,290
will and his workouts are so
fucking tough. Those guys at Aka,

951
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:22,320
you know like Dana was giving them a
hard time at one point in time saying

952
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:26,430
something about, you know that they,
they're always getting hurt but they win.

953
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,920
That's how you get killers.

954
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:32,190
Like cane to get a guy
that's got that kind of mind.

955
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:36,060
He's used to being in that horrible
misery of trying to break someone.

956
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,040
He's used to. It does it all the
time. They all do it all the time.

957
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:42,810
And then DC went all go there and train
and remarried DC before he went there.

958
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,110
He trained with us in Denver. He
didn't, he wasn't that good, you know,

959
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:47,610
loves his wrestling was ridiculous.

960
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,840
But he moved there and then he just
followed suit. They got John Fitch,

961
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:56,610
he unconscious checked yet fucking
can be got beep hold. Yeah man.

962
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,070
When Rockwell gets people on the ground,
smashes him.

963
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,660
When he got Weidman on the ground,
widen was stuck under a building. Two,

964
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,980
same thing with Leo Machida. You look
at him and he'd go, Oh, branch branch,

965
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,970
same belt gets you down. And His
fucking top game is just murderous.

966
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,660
He's because of who he's training with.
He's training with those guys.

967
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,560
I have friends who were watching them
train down in Florida and they were just

968
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:22,440
saying, is his Jujitsu heal?
They wouldn't give me names.

969
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:26,400
They said worldclass shoes
guys. He's fucking up rolling.
Like just destroying. No,

970
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:30,420
he's a nightmare. As a freak
athlete. He's strong and he's long.

971
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,720
He's got like long leverage.
But he's also got physical strength.

972
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:37,930
He was supposed to by Dustin until he hurt
his leg. We'll have those official, uh,

973
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,200
he got a huge gash in it.
He had staples.

974
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:41,760
I think he posted it
looks fucking terrible.

975
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:46,380
That would be an interesting Justin
Kahn. Close to mirror. No time.

976
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:51,180
No time son. So you think Steve Pay
and DC goes to DC by decision? Yep.

977
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,500
Thank you out wrestles him.

978
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,890
I just think he out works them I think
yet [inaudible] I don't think it's a

979
00:55:55,891 --> 00:56:00,630
classic fight. I just think hopefully
more people appreciate DC after this.

980
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,740
I looked at both of them.

981
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:06,180
They both have to embrace the grind thing
as as and as long as DC can avoid that

982
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:09,840
big power punch early on he's going
to be fine. And he's so smart man.

983
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,550
Well I definitely think he's really
smart but I also think that steep a is a

984
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:18,450
really good striker and he's a bigger
guy and he's got a long reach and he's

985
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:22,350
probably one of the best heavyweight
strikers that dcs ever fought.

986
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:27,520
He's got real one punch knockout power
at heavyweight. He throws clean shots.

987
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,960
He doesn't have any fat and its punches.

988
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:33,100
He'll stand here like this and drop
one in onto he credits his best shot.

989
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:37,840
He's got a chin. He's tough as fuck.
He loves being champion. You know,

990
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,160
he might, he might have a lot
to prove here. And you know,

991
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,640
he doesn't throw a lot of kicks,
but it doesn't mean he can't,

992
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,170
he can throw him if he wants to,

993
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,780
if he thinks that's part of the strategy
and he wants to throw head kicks.

994
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,500
I mean he would be cool to see. I don't
see him kick. I have, he can kick.

995
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,260
You can kick. It does. It's the
difference between kicking in practice.

996
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:56,900
I'm pulling off against a worldclass.
That's true. I like DC. Big Guy too.

997
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,040
Man Sees Man. And that's where
John, that's why John Jones goes,

998
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm gonna knock them out by head kick.
Cause if you look at the video DC's here,

999
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:07,840
he's, if he's down there,
man, he's susceptible to it.
So that's what it sees it.

1000
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,770
But did John fake a right hand and
then throw that left high kick?

1001
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:14,610
He was setting up, he was thrown
to the body. Thrown the Mati yeah.

1002
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:18,430
And then threw it out. And then you see
d say go over and then there's whack.

1003
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,630
Yeah. I want to see if you could
find that clip of John Jones.

1004
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:27,190
Kaylene DC hurt is powerful. Jamie.
Oh Man. Just landed it. Perfect.

1005
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,870
Let me say that one more time.
Yeah.

1006
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,770
You know what to about the, let's go back.
Go back. Sorry. Go back to the beginning.

1007
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Watch this. Fuck this. Only have
to do that. That was beautiful.

1008
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,900
The way he did that. That was, I hope
John comes back. It was beautiful.

1009
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:48,580
There was like no fat in that at all,
man. It was beautiful. So amazing. Boom.

1010
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,450
Thank you. All good. DC is, and
for him to do that, amazing,

1011
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,150
ridiculous smashed him.
Dude, look at this.

1012
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,130
So ridiculous.
Damn.

1013
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,730
It took a couple extra shots there
that he didn't need to take. Well,

1014
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,710
there's a lot of down there and now
they're even going back at it on Twitter.

1015
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:10,330
But John Jones here, here,
here's the perfect case
scenario. If you're, you know,

1016
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:13,840
if you're scrooge McDuck and you're
sitting down and you're looking at the UFC

1017
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:17,590
roadmap roadmap, you're like, we love
Steve Bay. He's been a great champion.

1018
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,040
But if he could plan it like you're
fucking Vince Mcmahon and WWE,

1019
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,050
you want DC to win.

1020
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,610
And then John to come back
and at heavyweight you have
DC John Jones fight for a

1021
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:30,010
world title heavyweight
and they have Brock gone.

1022
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:34,760
I got next wait in the back on I
got next kick, kick kick you off.

1023
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,920
Ratings, ratings, ratings,
ratings, ratings, ratings,
golden snitch. Take a hike.

1024
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,860
I like it.
Let's let that sink in.

1025
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,840
Another one is would have John
suspension lasts longer than we think.

1026
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,831
We don't even,

1027
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,440
we're assuming that John's going to get
a suspension then he's going to be able

1028
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:53,180
to come back fairly soon.
Don't be the no fun police.

1029
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:58,210
Well what if Brock comes in and Brock
fights the winner of DC and Steve Bay?

1030
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:03,430
Let's just say DC wins. I'll take it.
Okay. And DC. DC could beat Brock.

1031
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,780
That's an instinct. Fight. DC versus
Broxton. Interesting fight. Great fight.

1032
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,970
Bronx got hands as big as this table.

1033
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,960
He's fucking any Ken Russell's
ass his ass off. The question is,

1034
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:18,961
cause he can he do it clean at his age
because he took like 12 different tests.

1035
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:22,250
Clean talk, role clean.
We'll figure it out.

1036
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,210
Just like the last one.
I think the UFC wants to make that paper.

1037
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:29,530
You got to tell you Cyrus
scram for like dinner. One,

1038
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:34,410
five k to go grab a cup of coffee.
It's broken.

1039
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:38,810
John, go grab a fucking cup of coffee.
No one's going to ever let that happen.

1040
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,810
This is what we're talking trash.
This is nonsense talk. You're crazy.

1041
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:46,430
If you think you signed as all clean, like
the US government, what are you saying?

1042
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,790
First of all, you think the US government
is clean. I'll call Eddie Bravo. Right?

1043
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,040
That's what I'm saying. On his
way. That's what I'm saying.

1044
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,170
You saw it as like the government son.

1045
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:58,200
Everything ain't fucking done by
the books. If I'm Dana, I'm like,

1046
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:00,460
you open up your glove
compartment bucks. Yeah, man.

1047
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:04,190
Keep that came greasy mouth shut.
Keep agrees with these boys.

1048
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:08,690
Come over and punch each other in the
face. Go fuck up our ESPN deal. Wow.

1049
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,190
And who wouldn't want to see that?
Yeah, maybe. Yes. Pam pulls him aside.

1050
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,660
Take them into some smokey room. Sit down
there with some Cuban cigars. It's like,

1051
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,920
what am I doing here? Fine whiskey. How
long is their deal with Usada? Do we know?

1052
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,820
Do we have any idea? I don't know
there cause he had signed a contract.

1053
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,260
I don't know. I bet there's a count
down at Dana's office just every day.

1054
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,280
365 days.
64 days.

1055
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:42,320
The whole thing is kind of crazy that
it's self imposed, right Cody doing man.

1056
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:46,140
Well it was a great, it was a, it's
a great move to cell to cell. Yeah.

1057
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:50,090
There's the move for tea
is so genius monster.

1058
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:53,840
Lorenzo's a god damn genius.
He figured it out and you know,

1059
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,370
now he gets to just be a fan with
4 billion in the bank. You what?

1060
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,360
What he's like, yeah, I know you have to
smash a few eggs to make an Omelette man.

1061
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,101
But he,

1062
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:08,101
it's a great success story because those
guys were down 40 plus million dollars

1063
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:12,650
in the hole when I yeah,
when the ultimate fighter took off,

1064
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,540
they had spent, they'd lost 40
million. What does that to them though?

1065
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:21,120
It's enough. Forties 40 but still when
you're not, when you're, if you lost,

1066
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,100
you lost a couple hundred grand, you
would survive. But you'd be like, Shit,

1067
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,590
pissed for sure. He'd be
like, fuck, this is not good.

1068
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,120
It takes a long time to make that much.

1069
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:31,820
Especially when I get to my boy
to run and it was fucking up.

1070
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,810
You know what I'm saying? Exactly.
Two $40 million is $40 million.

1071
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,450
I'll give a five. I agree. You all
I'm appealing and I'll be like,

1072
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,800
I don't want that money going away.
Going home. Get my dick sucked.

1073
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,920
You know what I'm saying? Like
I'm like, God, that sucks. Anyway,

1074
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,470
let me walk in my giant mansion.

1075
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,740
You got to think of how many different
businesses that are run at the same time

1076
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,940
though. They had like 20 casinos,
20 plus casinos. The stations.

1077
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,490
They had a green valley ranch. Yep. They
still red rocks. Rocks is dope. Dope.

1078
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,420
Dope. They just bought out palms
too. Oh Yeah, a little rundown,

1079
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,310
but whatever. The nine though,
that steakhouse there. Oh,

1080
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,440
that's one of the best steakhouses in
Vegas and they goes by nominal goes

1081
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:15,650
probably should be dope. That's old
school. I used to stand up there.

1082
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:19,160
We've done stands up, goes parts.
This is like one of the bars there.

1083
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,390
One of the bars downstairs.
There's,

1084
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,810
there's a laugh factory in
Vegas right there is now. Yeah.

1085
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:27,090
I'm trying to bring it back
dices there all the time.

1086
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,670
I think it's in the Tropicana.
Does that make sense?

1087
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:32,820
The laugh factor in the Trump camp
and that uh, the comedy cellar? Yeah,

1088
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,810
that's in the Rio. The comedy cellar is
supposed to be really good. Who, who,

1089
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:39,360
who's running that though? Sown
sown. We know is running that.

1090
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:43,860
I thought the comedy cellar, I don't
know. Um, Ian's there a lot though.

1091
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:47,730
Ian Edwards. Do what? He says it's great.
Pages to me is always a weird vibe.

1092
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:52,620
Obviously you're there during UFC fight.
We can do your huge fucking stadiums.

1093
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:56,550
But I'm saying as far as the crowds,
usually if it's not a UFC crowd, yeah,

1094
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:00,010
it's a different thing. Well, there's so
many things to do. First of all, right?

1095
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,150
Or you can be a Celine Dion. I could
be on ecstasy right now. Why am I here?

1096
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:07,110
Listen to you talk. I do want the
blue man fucking roll in my ass off.

1097
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:10,730
Why am I here? There's so many
things to do, like, uh, have you,

1098
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,900
have you ever been to one of
those sorts of soul lies? Sure.

1099
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,200
Have you been to love the one at the MGM?
No,

1100
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:20,850
but I've been Zumanity with a friend
and some drugs and it's one of the best

1101
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:23,620
times ever.
Uh,

1102
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:28,310
how about when Disney uses those robot
flipper things to do with Cirque du

1103
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:33,000
Soleil? How crazy was that? I
posted this online. I saw this,

1104
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:33,834
uh,
this,

1105
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,960
this article about Disney's
making acrobatic robots do
these robots flip through

1106
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:45,291
the air and land and jump into holes and
shit in the middle of the Goddamn Park.

1107
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,020
These robots that Disney's
making their animatronic robots.

1108
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,850
But here's what's fucked up about it.

1109
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,320
What's to stop someone from using these
and making like a super warrior with the

1110
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:59,670
same technology. This is all under the
guise that Disney, these motherfuckers,

1111
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:03,270
I know what they're doing. So look at
these things, dude, that's a robot.

1112
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:07,500
That's a robot. So look at this. Look at
it. Swing and look at it. Let go and Tuck.

1113
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,680
Hurfeish jumped into a whole. Yeah, dude,

1114
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:13,950
that's going to be a killer robot that
we send overseas to fight battles.

1115
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:18,300
So look, get that thing fly through the
air and boom. This is nuts, man. I mean,

1116
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:21,390
this is really insane stuff.
What the fuck they doing with this?

1117
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:21,961
They're going to have this.

1118
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,030
I like the Pixar parade or
some shift for all the kids.

1119
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,620
I think they're going
to do this for movies,

1120
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:30,800
for Shit like that so that you don't
have to risk up, man. See Ya, dude.

1121
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:34,860
That is so stoked, man. Oh
my God. That's Tait Fletcher.

1122
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,690
Tate's acting. He'll slide
in. He'll be able to make it.

1123
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,820
He's still going to be a
character, actually. True.
Yeah. He doesn't talk to too,

1124
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,390
but CGI a face on that ces,
right?

1125
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,850
Paint that Disney Pixar is
painting faces on there tonight.

1126
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,390
If you gonna need people for
Voices, half of that movie, Logan,

1127
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,880
the Wolverine movie that he wasn't there.

1128
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:58,050
There's a video you can see where they
show you how they CGI to everything.

1129
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:01,350
He wasn't really there for half of it
or they act. They did it. Very strange.

1130
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:05,280
That movie's depressing anyway. If
you're a Wolverine Fan. I was like,

1131
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,010
God Damn Bro. It's driving
home limo and shit. Oh,

1132
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:11,550
is that what he's doing after it's over?
He's like a limo and fucking Xavier.

1133
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:15,690
Professor x is like in some weird
fucking hut dying. It's hot out.

1134
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:19,330
It'll bump me out, bro. Don't watch it.
I'm not saying that movie the wrestler.

1135
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,490
That's terrible. Yeah, it's a bumps
you out. Depressing. Excellent.

1136
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,690
First class all the way anyways.
Yeah.

1137
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:28,090
Vegas is weird as what we're getting
at in Disney's trying to take over the

1138
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,240
world. The Disney is about to work with
Darpa. That's what's going on. Sign.

1139
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:35,260
That's Boston dynamics or whatever
it is. What's the company? Yeah,

1140
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:39,650
Boston Dynamics. Disney does
everything better than everyone.

1141
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,690
He's not doing that. This show that
all breaks down. This is all a robot.

1142
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,950
It wasn't even, it was just a stunt
double guy. What fucking haters.

1143
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,880
Double Guy does this and then
they put him on top of that. What?

1144
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,050
So him being a, Oh, look at
that. They just have this space.

1145
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,710
See if you can make a
robot do all that stuff,

1146
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,620
then you could easily just put
his face on there and Whoa,

1147
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:06,430
Hugh Jackman got Super Jack Bro.
He's on that beat tour diet.

1148
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:11,050
He got so swollen but he
doesn't look like that anymore.

1149
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:14,410
Like in this one. No, it wasn't the
tool. America's greatest showman.

1150
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,630
You can't be all jacked seeing niche.
Right.

1151
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,600
So they just mapped out his face.

1152
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,200
But the thing is like if
you see him in this one,

1153
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,680
he doesn't look as jacked as he did.
And like the earlier ones, he's older,

1154
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,420
he's old marine,
which is sort of supposed to be right.

1155
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:33,350
If his body can recuperate from anything
when the flux, the aging. Exactly.

1156
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:36,970
Come on. Why is he aging like that? Come
on where he's losing some of his muscle,

1157
01:06:36,971 --> 01:06:40,300
but he's still throwing people through
the air like they're attack. He gets shot,

1158
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:43,450
recovers right away.
But his fucking joints hurt his arthritis.

1159
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,680
What's happening to the arthritis? No,
no. You really moved like it these days.

1160
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,850
I don't know if he officially does.
I'm just saying it doesn't make sense.

1161
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,820
How about to come out with
another fucking Spiderman. Oh,

1162
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,610
thank God they need a new spider man.
They never want to pay Peter Parker.

1163
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,850
When Peter Parker's starts getting
big, they'd go, yeah, well guess what?

1164
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,010
We're going to reboot it.
I just keep playing coating it.

1165
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:05,650
They keep telling the same story over
and over again with subtle differences.

1166
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,110
My Spiderman Tobey Maguire.
You fuck you.

1167
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:11,800
Fuck [inaudible] Scott Chick rocks.
I'll tell you what though.

1168
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,790
The only time that that's worked though
the hulk. Yeah, they've done that.

1169
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,430
They started off with that Australian
dude from chopper. What's his name? Uh,

1170
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:24,850
Eric Bana. Eric Bana. He was number one,
wasn't thrilled about him as the hall,

1171
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,970
not his fault. It wasn't his fault.
It wasn't the best match script.

1172
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,960
And then Ed Norton pretty good as a
hulk fan of ed noise. I was like, okay,

1173
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:35,920
I could buy this.
But then Mark Ruffalo Best Hawk best talk,

1174
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,350
I believe in me too,
I believe he's really assigned to,

1175
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,260
is to really believe he
really understands genetics.

1176
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:46,310
You know like Christian Bale's the best
Batman you're talking about. Relax.

1177
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:49,330
I agree. Sorry, Ben Affleck. I agree.

1178
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,560
How about Michael Keaton was Batman.
Who the fuck a good God. Damn.

1179
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:57,010
Batman hygienic cast. Michael come
up this George Clooney's Batman too.

1180
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,550
He's a fucking Mr. Steal your girl. I
bought George Clooney. I brought did you?

1181
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,990
I didn't buy it for the second call
when Jim Carrey was the Riddler and then

1182
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,880
Tommy Lee Joint Jones was to phase.

1183
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,100
Those are the best Batman's
when they were like, oh,

1184
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:11,290
we need to make this more
real. I'm like, fuck you.

1185
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,770
I liked Arnold Schwarzenegger's
Mr. Freeze. Wait a minute.
Who was the Riddler?

1186
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:18,290
Jim Carrey was a Riddler when?
Who Was Batman? Uh, George cloney.

1187
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:23,210
No Batman returns. Broan wow. But
Christian Bale's Batman forever. Sorry.

1188
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,430
Christian Bale is a better bet.
It's too real.

1189
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,240
Do you know Christian Bale was Batman
only like six months after he was the

1190
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:33,200
machinist. That's insane. Really insane.

1191
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,080
Down to like almost nothing.
He was dying.

1192
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,140
He was eating like a can of tuna and an
apple a day. That's insane. Willpower.

1193
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:45,260
You have to have to let
your body literally rot away
to this skinny thing for a

1194
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:48,470
movie. Just for a movie. You don't have
anorexia. You don't have a disease.

1195
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,580
How much you love the craft of
act and to do that. Yeah, man.

1196
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,600
Everybody trying to be the joke or these
days though. That's like the big one.

1197
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,620
Tony Hinchcliffe. He's trying
to be wet. Excuse me. Tony.

1198
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,810
Tony wants to be the
joker. Yeah, look. So look,

1199
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:07,400
he went from that to that one 21 to
one 95. That's all natural. Insane.

1200
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:11,000
There was another movie in between,
I think otherwise. Yeah. Equilibrium.

1201
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:12,170
It said there's no picture here.

1202
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,520
You're telling me that's not photo
shopped at all on the left. No, no, no.

1203
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:18,980
That's what it really looked like.
That is so unhealthy. Oh Dude.

1204
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:22,790
It takes years off your life. I mean,
you're putting unbelievable stress.

1205
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,240
He's under Oregon's, he's a beast.
He's English. You know that.

1206
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,380
I thought he was Australian,
Izzy. He thinks so.

1207
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,410
I thought there was an Australian English
bro. A lot of them are Australian.

1208
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,860
They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll throw
you for a loop. Jack. Chris Hemsworth,

1209
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:41,000
but Jackman like as an actor,
like Christian Bale.

1210
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,230
He does some stuff. Wolverine. Now
look, I'm a fan. Don't get me wrong. Um,

1211
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:51,110
but Christian bale does some stuff
like in American psycho. Okay.

1212
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,550
That's another one. When he
was in the fighter, when he,

1213
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,460
when he played a Micky ward's
brother. Oh my God. Dude.

1214
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,050
Up and down the whole time
when 85, one 21, one 91 35,

1215
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:07,880
one 91 45 him and reign of fire,
he is bodied the fuck up.

1216
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,950
So he got down skinny again to play
a Micky ward's brother. Meth addict.

1217
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:15,170
Yeah. Yeah. I forgot
making boards, brother.

1218
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:19,380
But his brother fought sugar ray
Leonard. Yeah. In between two rescue don.

1219
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,110
I don't know. I never saw that one
fucking and bs. That dragon movies.

1220
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,880
Dope for one of them silly dumb movies.

1221
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:29,150
Which Dragon Movies in a dragon
movie was the dragon movie he was in,

1222
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,140
wasn't the, in a dragon movie with
Matthew mcconaughey. If it was uh,

1223
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,460
it was in the future. Yeah. That
everybody has to do underground drugs.

1224
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:42,540
I did them all. They had to live
a fire. Oh, reign of fire. Yeah.

1225
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,910
Yeah. That's the drag. That's a reign
of fire. There's a dragon movie. Yeah.

1226
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:50,480
Matchup of Khan Hayes jacked in
that movie. Oh, super jacked to see.

1227
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:53,630
He got Super Skinny for Dallas buyers club
when he had aids. Yeah, he did it too.

1228
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:54,590
He's another one.
Yes.

1229
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:59,600
See if you get a picture of
Matthew mcconaughey jacked dude.

1230
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:03,320
I heard rumors about Tom Hardy shirtless,
but Matthew mcconaughey,

1231
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:06,200
shirtless ring of fire. See
it right there. That picture.

1232
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:10,660
We've got a vest on lookout. Jackie. Looks
Damn. Yeah, he was Jack's for this movie.

1233
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,890
Ever heard of that movie?
[inaudible] it's a

1234
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,640
dumb movie. Is it bad? It's
just dumb. It's entertaining.

1235
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:22,740
It's silly. You know that these dragons,
fuck everybody up. And you know, dude,

1236
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,420
remember how bad he
used to hate on dragons.

1237
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:28,320
Do I watch game of Thrones town
on all you guys for watching?

1238
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:34,290
I watch game of Thrones,
Dragon Burns. Spoiler you
fuck's been out for nine years.

1239
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:38,700
He Burns that fucking frozen wall.
I'm talking about standing ovation.

1240
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:40,620
I was in the middle of my living room.
Slow clap.

1241
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:43,350
And those dragons are fun
and scary that when they,

1242
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:47,060
the one turns into a fucking
Whitewater. Yeah, yeah. Woo.

1243
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:50,880
Card into is. I just feel,
and it's a white walker. I,

1244
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,330
everybody who works on that show,
listen to me, don't ever cancel it.

1245
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,450
Just keep going. It's just, you never
going to do anything better than that. Oh,

1246
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,180
that's the greatest show of all time. I
know. I don't know what you're thinking.

1247
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,910
Just write some new episodes.
Figure out some new shit.

1248
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:06,570
It's the greatest show of all. They just
rap. No, they rep. No, there'll be back.

1249
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,430
God Damn. Look at that. Miss Jam.
I'm mechanic jacked Jack Cheese.

1250
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,630
I feel like for me to get that skinny
and thin, I would have to go on some,

1251
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,660
I'd have to get some roll like
Dallas buyers club and blew it up.

1252
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,140
One right above that. Right above that,
right above your cursor. Right there.

1253
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,550
Right there on different, Oh,
who's that? That's Bradley Cooper.

1254
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,840
Cooper body dumped to him son.
Look at him,

1255
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,980
but wouldn't you get do all of
the steroids to play these roles?

1256
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,740
I think they call me to be Batman.
I'd like, yeah. Yeah. All right.

1257
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:37,500
Let me go down at Gold's gym. See what
I can do. Yeah. You would have to.

1258
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:41,400
You'd have to, you'd have to go on the
carnivore diet. Drop your body fat down.

1259
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:46,080
I wouldn't you though.
Intermittent fasting. Just the
whole cryo every day. Yeah.

1260
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:48,880
You'd be training camp.
Get shredded training camp.

1261
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,420
You would want to have that scene where
you're putting on your fucking outfit

1262
01:12:51,421 --> 01:12:54,450
and you're just talking like we need
more scenes. Where at mom's short list.

1263
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,740
Just town downtown bullshit.
Oh,

1264
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:03,480
Ryan Reynolds. Ryan ramp. Is that
Ryan running blade blade blade three.

1265
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:04,840
That's Ryan Reynolds and Blake three blue.

1266
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:09,060
Who is that guy sees another guy
that's, oh no, that's next level.

1267
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,850
See if that's what you gotta try for.
That's what you gotta try it for.

1268
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:14,310
No one ever tries to that.
Do chicks don't take that though.

1269
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,360
Other dude's Dick fucking mouth.
We take that shy girls are like,

1270
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,230
no, I don't like they say that because
they're trying to make you feel better.

1271
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,690
Oh my God. I think it's so gross.
I like geysers soft like you.

1272
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,520
I like to grab your back and fill out fat.
Okay.

1273
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,980
Brian federals with this fuck no bro.
Pack.

1274
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,580
Oh my God. No Way. I mean,

1275
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:38,100
I definitely don't bond
his dick in my mouth.

1276
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,260
A little belly fat on my nose.
Full rack of ribs.

1277
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:46,290
No fuck in the shake once you're
done with this shit like a man.

1278
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:51,150
He was just a real lax like me and doesn't
want to deal much. That's what I like.

1279
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,580
Please do. They're trying to make you feel
good. We'll try to make you feel good.

1280
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,660
I'm pretty good saying,
I'm not saying you are fat.

1281
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,790
Were both fat compared to that guy,
dude.

1282
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:04,170
Both of us are fucking Adele compared to
that guy. I'm saying that's unrealistic.

1283
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:07,580
Like dope. Like that's too much.
Someone has body image issues,

1284
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,650
girls to get planes about chicks with
little waist and big tits. Oh my God.

1285
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,280
I have body and it shows. I appreciate
it man. More than people think I'm gay.

1286
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:18,400
I appreciate you have any body image
issues because of these women that are

1287
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:20,920
unattainable. They have these
unobtainable bodies and it's filled up.

1288
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:25,420
You're putting a standard on women that's
not real. Yeah. Yeah. I have that framed.

1289
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:28,600
One sweat. I had a friend once who
said this, she was, she was uh,

1290
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,880
talking about someone's
girlfriend. She's like, Oh,

1291
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,510
I just wish he had a real girlfriend
or like a real, a real woman. I go,

1292
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,720
what are you talking about?
And she's like, oh look,

1293
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:41,750
look who he's dating is typical pretty
girl with blonde hair and a nice body.

1294
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,440
Like what? You know, why doesn't
he have a real girlfriend?

1295
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:48,520
I go put heats up the fuck I'm, and
it's so crazy. People are real people.

1296
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:49,350
Like everyone's really,
you're,

1297
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,670
you're hating on someone because they're
a trust not you. Yeah. Yeah. I come.

1298
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:56,440
Why would you assume that she's not
super nice and really friendly and really

1299
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:57,100
smart?

1300
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,250
Cause you're prejudice because you just
looking at her and deciding that you're

1301
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:03,400
hating it. She had dumb ass
probably. But does that matter?

1302
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,590
You know what I'm saying? It
does not matter. It's all right.

1303
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,550
You might not be as smart as you. How much
is that? How much of that is her fault?

1304
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:14,140
I've, this is as I've gotten older and
wiser when even when I meet dumb people,

1305
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,090
I'm like,
how much of it is really their fault?

1306
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,490
Maybe they're just not into that stuff.

1307
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,630
Maybe they just got a bad roll of the
dice with life and with genetics and the

1308
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:26,740
whole ball on top. Sometimes a bad roll
the dice is you're genetically gifted.

1309
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:29,930
If you're a girl or a guy and you look
super pretty and things come easy to you.

1310
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:34,120
You never had to read a book or get
balls deep into a sport or something like

1311
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,690
that. And that's, to me, that
can be a curse. Yeah, dude,

1312
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:40,360
there's a curse to that because
then things get easy like you want,

1313
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:42,740
you want your daughters, you
don't want to be tense. You want,

1314
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:47,160
I'm like sevens strong, seven strong
seven where like guys like didn't like,

1315
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,710
there's certain guys types, they still
got to educate themselves. You know,

1316
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:54,010
like you don't want to blot asses and
big titties. You want him to just like,

1317
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,350
you know, you know what I'm
saying? Oh yeah, for sure.

1318
01:15:56,351 --> 01:16:01,351
You don't want Nikki Minaj
is your daughter in that
10 to tens of sprint seven

1319
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:05,020
is a ultra marathon. Yeah. To
me, seven to have a long day.

1320
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:07,630
A seven for many, many, many years.

1321
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,400
Especially like h and r block go
to the gym. They can hang in there,

1322
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,160
but they gotta work for it. Like you
don't want to just give it to them.

1323
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:15,760
You know what I'm saying?

1324
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,750
The problem with some tens that
go to eights can't handle it.

1325
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,930
Even when they're eight they're still hot,
but in their mind,

1326
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:25,460
but in their mind they're not anymore
and they get real freaked. Rosa,

1327
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,960
no test to Testarossa.

1328
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:31,240
It was hot in the eighties so long this,

1329
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,120
that's when they had the gated shifter.
Yes. You drive one down. You're like,

1330
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:35,900
what the fuck is going on?
Oh,

1331
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:40,180
stupid Fred Flintstone could get on until
I have to get out and do this now let

1332
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:43,480
me one of the worth like $1 million or
something just to try and bind one. Yeah.

1333
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,300
Did you? I wanted one. I'd
go on these weird fucking,

1334
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:50,410
I almost bought a Delorean the other day.
I knew a lady who had an old Ferrari.

1335
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:55,411
She bought an old Ferrari in like 2015
she bought like one that was the one from

1336
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,180
Magnum Pi. Oh, the three 64 is
that what it is? I think so.

1337
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,800
Is this cool little car,
but it was always breaking those things.

1338
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,560
They're just not gonna. It's
not, you can't drive across
country in that car. No.

1339
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:13,940
You don't have somebody who's in driver
every year. Yeah, that'd be fun though.

1340
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:16,340
I'd like to have a bunch of cars.

1341
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,070
I would like to have a bunch of
cars to half a bunch of Co. Yeah.

1342
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,350
Don't jump into this company. I'm
still hustling. Don't try like, Hey,

1343
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,360
don't try to the dude.
You're fucking Hudson your ass.

1344
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:29,000
I'll put you out of all the clothes.
I don't have all the cars.

1345
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,560
You know what I've been getting into man,

1346
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:35,460
old plain looking BMW m
threes like an e 46 Mre.

1347
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,350
Wow. All right. I'm down for
that. You'd get an eight series.

1348
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:42,560
Would that be 12 maybe,
but I'm talking about what holds cars.

1349
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,680
I'm talking about like a 2005
me to have that eight series.

1350
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:50,600
I'm talking like 1994 but those are for
12 that's when the lights go up has been

1351
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:54,710
sick. That's where I draw the line.
When the lights go up, can't do it son.

1352
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:58,880
Testarossa of the BMW you like
deal with the the 95 three series.

1353
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,390
Kim, that Canary Yellow.
I did. I did like those.

1354
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,900
I like the ones with the big weighing
in the back of the m three with the wing

1355
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:09,620
on the back. Tiny ass little car too,
man. You go near those cars today.

1356
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,020
They don't make anything that
small anymore or not know.

1357
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:15,320
BMW doesn't at least look at that.
Those white lights on the side.

1358
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:20,180
So that's a dope look. And that's an
[inaudible] 86 right? That's an e 36 BMW.

1359
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:24,410
Yeah. Yeah. Google a silver.

1360
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:27,320
He 46 BMW. You're thinking
about getting one of those.

1361
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,990
I'm thinking I don't have
all the cars. I know, right?

1362
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:33,770
Well that's because valley guess. Yeah.
Are you going to buy it to run into,

1363
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:37,610
look at, look at that. I like that.
You know what I like about that?

1364
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:42,050
That's not that. That's on 95 yes,
it's 2005 what I like about that. Yeah,

1365
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:46,900
that's not 2005 [inaudible] 46 back
stiff. Yeah. No, not supposed to.

1366
01:18:46,901 --> 01:18:47,481
What they look like?

1367
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:51,140
That's an m three that's exactly it
looks like I'm a fan of the model.

1368
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,420
It's a very plain looking car.
You just,

1369
01:18:53,421 --> 01:18:54,830
so you know what some
people do with those?

1370
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,580
They just juice the shit out of the
engine and change the suspension.

1371
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:03,260
And the thing about it, it's a light
small car that like moves. Well,

1372
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:07,190
I think that car probably only weighs
about 3000 pounds. Like Google.

1373
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:11,930
How much does a 2005 BMW m three were?

1374
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,680
Those portions are layered
as fuck too though, man. Uh,

1375
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,720
just Google. How much does
it weigh? Was the weight.

1376
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,160
I mean, we could go buy 10 of these
right now, Joe. No, no, no. The two,

1377
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:30,260
3,400 pounds. So that's a pretty
light in comparison to like a new one.

1378
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:35,240
I bet the new ones are three or 400 pounds
heavier than that. That's a big deal.

1379
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,630
The new ones are way fast wave and way
too fast. Way Too fast. Way Cooler.

1380
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,110
The spiral. They take these and they
put crazy engines and oh they belonged.

1381
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,030
Juice them up because it's a smaller car.
That's one of the original like cars.

1382
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:52,031
I remember kids just fucking Jack and
the big exhaust on you buy the shirts.

1383
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,330
Do you ever see a kid who just spent so
much money on a really shitty accord and

1384
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:58,090
puts Chris Civic and we grow
just as they sell it at pepboys?

1385
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,840
Doesn't mean you have to
put it on the Goddamn car.

1386
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:04,460
Why do you have all that shit all over
the car? What are you doing and why?

1387
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:08,120
And it was so loud. I'm like,
Kirsten, even fast. It's [inaudible].

1388
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,180
I have that horrible four
cylinders are all fucking nuts.

1389
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,860
Those kids thought they were so cool.

1390
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:17,010
Well I guess it's cooler
than the car as it is. No,

1391
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,100
probably not even cause what
it is is just transportation.

1392
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:23,300
It's supposed to just accept what it is.
It's peacocking like,

1393
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,150
like look at this again.
You're not doing it for girls.

1394
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,530
He draw up for dudes. Other dudes like,
oh, that's pretty cool. Girls got,

1395
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:33,660
what the fuck is that thing?
Yeah. Look at that Honda Civic.

1396
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:36,930
It makes my dick go limp like that.
Like a civic.

1397
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,150
They can make those things fairly
fast though. Campaign. Yeah.

1398
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,540
I do start into the Sii ones
you're talking about. Yeah.

1399
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,750
What does that Ford Focus Gt?

1400
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,560
Is that that little tiny
car go fast as fuck. Yeah.

1401
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,240
That's a tiny little concert like that
though. You want that Subaru WRX STI.

1402
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:00,120
The Ford F. Yeah. How much does that thing
way though? That's a tiny little car,

1403
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,690
right?
That thing looks like shit.

1404
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:08,690
[inaudible]

1405
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:14,660
does. It does. 3,200 pounds
is a tiny little car, bro.

1406
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:20,480
Dude, you brought up 95 BMW's
Ford focuses and civics.

1407
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,320
Well, you know man, you know I have that
white car though. The white nine 11 rs.

1408
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:29,410
Fuck that car three ruins me for
everything else because it's so light.

1409
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,090
They're crawling away is 3000 pounds.
That thing's insane.

1410
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,690
Ruined me for everything else. Nothing
else fun to drive. Everything's fun.

1411
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:39,530
I love car. Didn't, that thing
is just a different animal.

1412
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:44,330
It's like the difference
between like a dog in a Cheetah,

1413
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:48,080
like one of them was like dogs run
pretty good, they do a pretty good job,

1414
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:50,660
but then you get cheated and
you're like, Jesus, what?

1415
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:53,300
But what if you got him a dog?
What if? Yeah, it's a weird,

1416
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:57,920
but what if he got a nine 11 t how lights
at nine 11 t and then soup the Senate

1417
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,830
to shark where it's just a blow they ass
out the front. Oh one of the new ones.

1418
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:04,760
You mean the things light?
It's fuck, they're very light.
Yeah. The nine 11 teaser.

1419
01:22:04,761 --> 01:22:06,860
Yeah. I'm sure they could do something
like that because they don't even have,

1420
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,230
you know, they don't have handled,
they have nothing there. No backseats.

1421
01:22:09,231 --> 01:22:12,890
They're super light. Yeah, they, what
did they get them down to? I forget,

1422
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:16,630
but is it gt three weights there? I want
to say they're lighter, aren't they?

1423
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:23,590
Gt three touring package gt three without
the crazy wing and it just cause which

1424
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:26,150
most of the people are not
taking them on a track.

1425
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:29,900
You just driving a fast car around
town 35 I can't have that thing.

1426
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:33,760
So the GT 200 is this the
GT three or this? The uh,

1427
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:37,620
the t 3,200 that's pretty God
damn light for a Porsche. Yeah.

1428
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:42,980
Zero to 63.4 seconds. Yeah, but you
can soup that fucking thing up. Yeah.

1429
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,560
I wonder what is the a horsepower,
what does it say?

1430
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:47,203
Okay.

1431
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,350
See the, what they're doing with, yeah,

1432
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:52,980
that's a three 70 and that's not even the
s engine. No mass. The regular engine.

1433
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,990
The salts turbo. Now though,
go to nine 11 gt three touring.

1434
01:22:57,991 --> 01:23:01,470
I bet that's just as light.
But that's got like 500 horsepower.

1435
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:06,790
That's my next ride. Either want that on
glare. Glaring man. But you have that gts,

1436
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,340
which is a very fast car too.
There was a, it's fucking great.

1437
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:12,490
[inaudible] there was a big article about
one of those recently. I know people,

1438
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:14,740
they say it's that one of the
best like daily drivers, Porsche.

1439
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,770
How that's 3,100 pounds
son [inaudible] 500

1440
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,620
500 horsepower, 3,100 pounds.
That thing must be amazed.

1441
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:25,510
This is what I want to do.
Only get a torn,

1442
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,510
I want to order and I want in that mint
green, they've got pretty, that is,

1443
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,910
they just nailed that shape.
You know?

1444
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:35,590
I love it if it's one of the more
interesting things about cars is just the

1445
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:39,400
physical shapes, like what they've
managed to like make iconic,

1446
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:42,970
like the Porsche is such an iconic shape.
They don't need to do anything.

1447
01:23:42,971 --> 01:23:45,520
They'll do little subtle changes
to the back and the exhaust.

1448
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:49,090
That doesn't bother me. Yeah, they just
keep kind of tweaking it a little bit.

1449
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,410
They keep that shape like every nine 11
looks like a nine 11 like if you look at

1450
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:58,411
a 2019 Mustang and then you
look at it in 1965 Mustang talk,

1451
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,330
how do I know this is the same thing.

1452
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,150
I know could barely tell
this is the same thing,

1453
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,630
but you could have a nine 11 next to
like you'd have that that nine six four

1454
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:11,950
that's like a 91 next to a
2019 and you'd go, I see.

1455
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:14,170
They're both fine.
Eleven's 100% yeah.

1456
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,220
That's the only car that I can think of
like that because old Ferrari's don't

1457
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:20,830
look like new Ferrari's at all.
Not at all.

1458
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,990
I guess the new challenges looked like
a little bit like the whole challenge.

1459
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,350
That tab. Yeah. They retroed
it out a little bit. Minerals,

1460
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,730
they're trying to go back to it.

1461
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:32,680
Can we count Sky Camaro's did like
a new take on it at the newest ones.

1462
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:36,610
Even look at that Sun.
Come on though.

1463
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:41,470
That is a gt three rs in all green.
Seinfield gets like those and shit too.

1464
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,520
That's an amazing car, man. That's
cars more than 500 horsepower.

1465
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,920
I think that things got
five 20 and they're,

1466
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,630
they're so light and that just
design track. You like that?

1467
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,660
You think you're a dick head for driving
around town? Oh yeah, for sure. Why?

1468
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:59,350
Draymond green of a lime green card
that says gt three Rs on it through Mike

1469
01:24:59,351 --> 01:25:03,910
says gts and it's fucking hot orange.
You should only wear a golf club.

1470
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:07,690
Shirts from exclusive golf club,
golf clubs that no one could join.

1471
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,990
If you try that and then have
those loafers on with no socks.

1472
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,910
Smell like audio,
just beating the shit out.

1473
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:18,040
You should smell like a,
what's that?

1474
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:22,330
What is it called when you might pass
down money to your kids and they have one

1475
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:24,910
of those accounts were drugs found
trust funds. That's it. Smell.

1476
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,930
You could smell it and trust fund.
That's a f. I'll tell you what, man.

1477
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:32,380
It's like all the handicaps you get in
life when the biggest handicaps you get

1478
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:36,010
is a trust fund. There's something
that happens to kids, at least secure.

1479
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,320
The ones that I've ever heard of,
not just security,

1480
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,590
but a large income just given
to them by their parents.

1481
01:25:41,591 --> 01:25:43,240
I still have to work on it. Yes. You know,

1482
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:47,860
I read a statistic that it's like they're
400% more likely to die before they

1483
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:50,510
just 40 when they have that much money.
Jesus,

1484
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:55,640
4% 400% I know a couple people that have
had one of those deals where they had

1485
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:00,490
one of those and did you like
them? Now they fuss. They felt,

1486
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,410
I felt sad for them. No. I know.
It felt like they were, they were.

1487
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,110
They weren't really done.

1488
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:09,590
Like if you're an egg and you
still got that gooey stuff on top,

1489
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:10,790
it's like it's not quite done.

1490
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,110
Rich kids are counting on inherence
to pay for retirement will offer young

1491
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:17,600
people. Hold on. Where
are you going? Well,

1492
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:21,080
if young people say they need money
from relatives and friends to guarantee

1493
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:25,390
their golden years, stay gold. See
that's just click baity system.

1494
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,250
Click Baity Shit.
I just saw this article the other day.

1495
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,530
You guys just mentioned
it as like 63% of them.

1496
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:36,280
Then the panel was 63% of affluent
children between the ages of 18 and 22 say

1497
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:41,300
financial stability. Retirement would
depend on inheriting money. You know,

1498
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,020
it's just,

1499
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,990
that's one of the things that Tim
Kennedy said when he was on the podcast.

1500
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:49,610
He said, hard times make hard,
man hard man. Make easy times,

1501
01:26:49,611 --> 01:26:53,960
easy times. Make soft men and worst
and Kennedy to preach. What do you do?

1502
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:54,950
What do you do with your kids?

1503
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:58,640
Like my kids growing Marshall
Armonica martial arts for the girls.

1504
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,720
You think going to be balls
deep in martial arts? They're
like in ninth grade. I,

1505
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:03,550
no, just to get, I think you,

1506
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:08,270
you got to get a certain amount
of like actual hard work in,

1507
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:11,300
in your life or shorts going to do that
for him. I think there's something to it,

1508
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:16,150
there's something to goal, uh,
like valuing goals and, um,

1509
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,520
to working towards things and then
being in difficult situations.

1510
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:23,900
We can help kids. Sports. Yes.
Sports in general. Yes, for sure.

1511
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:28,310
I think all sports, but I think Marshall
Marshall articular it's more personal.

1512
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:31,160
Like when someone's strangles you and
somebody gets your back and then sinks

1513
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:34,190
that fucking body triangle on you and
you're fighting off and then they get you

1514
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:37,510
and you have to tap. That's very
personal. You'll get humbled for sure.

1515
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:40,730
But most people don't deal with
those kinds of things in life.

1516
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,910
I think the experience of dealing with
those things in life is very valuable

1517
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,150
because you can relax more.
They could relax more. You know,

1518
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:49,220
there's some people evidence. Yeah. Well,

1519
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:51,980
it's not just that you've
experienced bad things,

1520
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,690
bad things in terms of like
bad, uh, defeats losses,

1521
01:27:56,691 --> 01:28:00,250
getting smooshed, having to tap. There's
a lot of people that have never occur.

1522
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:03,000
Many times you have a role with the guy
that never rowed before and the moment

1523
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:03,791
you start rolling with him,

1524
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:06,200
you get him on his back and they
start hyperventilating, panicking.

1525
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,620
They panic because he never been there
before. Professional football players,

1526
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:12,980
basketball players, I've rolled with them.
They get down there like, oh shit, oh no.

1527
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:17,350
They realize they can't get up and
then you start closing the gap on him.

1528
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,300
Here's the problem with my only
problem with Marshall active,

1529
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:23,780
if you're just going to go down that road
is when you're in that Dojo where the

1530
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:27,920
fuck you're doing the martial arts, when
they leave, they know that they're not.

1531
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:28,940
Many people have seen it,
right?

1532
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:31,520
Like if you and I are rolling and we
don't know each other, you tapped me out,

1533
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:33,590
I leave. They're not too
many people see it the other,

1534
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:36,440
I see it when you're professional
sports and we're playing basketball or

1535
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:40,250
football and the game's on the line and
I get embarrassed cause I dropped the

1536
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:41,031
ball.
Why?

1537
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:44,690
Whiffed and struck out in the entire
audience sees it and I have to deal with

1538
01:28:44,691 --> 01:28:48,170
that and then come back from it and be
like, all right, I can deal with this man.

1539
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:51,260
I've, I'd fucking struck out.
I play a game next week. Right.

1540
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,220
I got to go through class.
People are gonna make fun
of me. I'll figure this out.

1541
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:00,110
To me that builds a little something
different yet it's also teamwork. Right.

1542
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,360
That's a big part of life. Part of lives.
Being able to work with other people.

1543
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,020
Yeah.

1544
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:08,700
Being able to perform under pressure but
also facing that adversity and no one,

1545
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:11,430
cause if you tapped me out, Mike
McMahon, when I go to school,

1546
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:13,560
no one knows that that's
whatever. When I, when,

1547
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,860
when my class knows I threw an
interception and like fuck shop threw that

1548
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:20,910
interception man. Monday. Everyone's like,
dude, what happened? Like I know, I know.

1549
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:24,860
Wait Til Friday. We'll see. What
happens Friday. Oh yeah. Um,

1550
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:28,890
Bill Buckner had to leave Boston.
You have to go into like fucking,

1551
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,440
he had to go into hiding.
The ball went between his legs.

1552
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:34,080
Everybody freaked out dude. I
remember people walking around, dude,

1553
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:37,320
people were walking around
the neighborhood while
that was like try and find

1554
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,740
kicking the snow and angry.
They were just so angry.

1555
01:29:40,741 --> 01:29:42,120
People were leaving their houses.

1556
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,520
It was like there was reports of it
all over Boston that people just slant,

1557
01:29:45,521 --> 01:29:48,450
they couldn't deal with it anymore because
then they would just slammed the car,

1558
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,030
the the the front door rather and
just walk out into the street be like,

1559
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:53,310
what the fuck?
Just to tie out there smoking,

1560
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:56,130
looking at each other like how the
fuck did he drop that ball? Dude,

1561
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,660
imagine you'd be that guy. Tragic.
Look it. All of it is rough.

1562
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:04,260
I think sports are definitely great
for, for kids, for anybody developing.

1563
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:07,320
Even for adults. I think they're
good. I think competition is good.

1564
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:09,750
The problem with people
is they, they, they,

1565
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,520
they get nervous about trying new things
or doing things and I think one of the

1566
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:18,180
things that gets you over nerves is
having done difficult chip before.

1567
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,410
And one of the things about Jujitsu is
that that's such a claustrophobic feeling.

1568
01:30:22,411 --> 01:30:22,860
Like when you're,

1569
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,400
when you're locked up in a triangle and
you're just trying to get like a hand in

1570
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,480
there to protect,

1571
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:30,750
you just just try and you're feeling
the squeeze and you're like fuck,

1572
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:33,600
I might have to tap. And you try
and you make your way out of it.

1573
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,410
That being able to do that in your life.

1574
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:42,150
Like knowing I've been in a bad
spot before knowing I've been,

1575
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:44,700
someone's been on top of me before
and I didn't think I'd get up.

1576
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:47,970
I think it's a very valuable thing for
people to experience and I think it's a

1577
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:50,580
good thing for people to learn.
Like,

1578
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:55,170
if you could start out as a white belt
and just deal with that stuff that you

1579
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:57,420
get up until like blue
belt and purple belt.

1580
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,250
We start developing some skills
and putting some tap sound up.

1581
01:31:00,251 --> 01:31:03,720
If you can get through that man you can
get through anything a guy can get to

1582
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:08,100
purple belt or a girl can
get to black belt or brown
belt. Those people, that man,

1583
01:31:08,101 --> 01:31:11,640
that woman that can get that far, they
can do a lot of shit. God Damn Bro.

1584
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:14,820
That a lot of people can't do
for sure. For sure. For sure.

1585
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,760
I think giving your kids
that opportunity is,

1586
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:22,800
is a a massive thing, you know and I know
your kid's going to learn how to fight.

1587
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:27,570
How the fuck is [inaudible] you alright
cause you know I watched a lot of fun so

1588
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,490
I came in the house whenever
I want to get home today.

1589
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,640
Hope cause he sees all the fighters,
boxers and UFC guys.

1590
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,400
They fight with their shirts off
and I walk in, you just pop up,

1591
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:40,200
pop up pink shirt authors.
I'll show you video of him hitting Mitts.

1592
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:43,550
I'm like, I don't know what to
do. Get encourage him. Yeah. Time.

1593
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,080
The don't you tell him not,
don't you don't have to fight son.

1594
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:50,180
He only does it kind of made good. Yeah.
He only does it with me. Goddamn hit five.

1595
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:52,380
You're not getting hit in the
head that he's toying dead.

1596
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:55,300
He's on the road rolling out.
So,

1597
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:59,800
but like have you seen any Bravo's
kid do martial arts to seen hunters?

1598
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,700
I haven't. I'm going to focus on
a teddy bear kind of just post.

1599
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:05,410
He's on a teddy bear doing like
armbars teddy bear and he's a,

1600
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,270
you know Eddie does drills with his kid.

1601
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,370
He posts videos of drills
he does with his kid.

1602
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:13,060
His kid has no learning the system.
I think that's good. Fuck yeah,

1603
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:15,430
his kid's going to be an assassin.

1604
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:18,280
You know what kind of Jiu Jitsu
Eddie Bravo's kids going to have?

1605
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,140
Pretty gnarly because he's
around this kid all the time.

1606
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:23,410
Like Eddie is a diligent father.
He loves that about dad.

1607
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,090
He [inaudible] get some
mount this shit ghetto.

1608
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,080
That is hilarious.
He takes the back look at that.

1609
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:34,930
He's like two and a half on this.
That is hilarious.

1610
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:39,160
This kid is taking the back at
two and a half. That is so funny.

1611
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,530
This is hilarious. The best teacher
in the world. Of course. Yeah.

1612
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:47,530
That's amazed on explains about it.
And I think Ken or two,

1613
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:51,880
this is like his biggest
pupil in terms of a Jujitsu.

1614
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:55,240
I mean obviously Ronda Rousey was his
most famous pupil that aren't by that.

1615
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:58,720
Kids got that. Rhonda had an arm bar
before she got there. She did exactly.

1616
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:02,290
But Brian or take as everything,
he's got everything he can choke.

1617
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,540
You could take your back and
you fight you off his back.

1618
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:08,560
Brian came in there and
didn't know anything. Yeah,
it was a tough gang member.

1619
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:12,280
Want to be? Well, I shouldn't say wannabe
was a tough gang yet from the streets.

1620
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,790
Couldn't afford it. So a Henna took
him under his wing. That's amazing.

1621
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,410
And now he's one of the,
you know, he's number one.

1622
01:33:17,411 --> 01:33:21,500
That's a middleweight in the world, not
named Max Holloway. That's amazing. Yeah,

1623
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:24,550
it's a cool story. And are such a good
instructor, man. I love listening to him.

1624
01:33:24,551 --> 01:33:29,260
Talking to, he's so enthusiastic as a
contagious, you know, like videos online.

1625
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:32,590
She could sell anything. We're going to
make watermelon juice guy. So I, Oh shit,

1626
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,050
this is what we can do it. You're
like, okay, watermelon juice. I've,

1627
01:33:35,051 --> 01:33:40,051
I've had a lot of coaches since I was a
very young kid and I've never had anyone

1628
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,490
as far as like a better coach than Henoch
grace. Wow. I know, man from the source,

1629
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:49,390
man. I mean, think about that. Yeah. But
there's of those guys from the source,

1630
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:52,450
but they just, they're not, they're not
Hanner and all those guys are great.

1631
01:33:52,451 --> 01:33:55,390
But as far as like,
as far as egos and just being like a cool,

1632
01:33:55,391 --> 01:33:58,370
like you and hang out with Henry anywhere
and he's like a great Todd's office.

1633
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:02,050
He knows a thing or two about everything.
Like he's like, did you say surfing?

1634
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:06,580
And he has a black belt in
serve fruit. You know, sue,

1635
01:34:06,581 --> 01:34:09,720
she opened up his own place. Now he
has his own Jujitsu place. Yeah. They,

1636
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:13,880
they left his dad's place. They went
right up the street. Now him and his, uh,

1637
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,120
here on Huron. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing.

1638
01:34:16,121 --> 01:34:18,820
So they shut down that and it's right
up the street still in Torrance.

1639
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:22,150
Very close. I'll have the facilities.
Ridiculous. Is the old place still open?

1640
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:27,250
Hines got down. I'm not sure. I'm not,
I don't know the details on that, but I,

1641
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:30,700
I know Hannah and Huron on doing their
own thing on. They're killing it.

1642
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,380
That's awesome. Yeah, dude,

1643
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:35,410
it's very lucrative in southern
California to think about how many Jujitsu

1644
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:39,400
schools, especially if you're, I mean
Henna and here on top of the food chain,

1645
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:43,030
but as far as business mind to, that's
what makes her so special. His business.

1646
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:46,240
Mine is insane. Yeah. He
started the Gracie University.

1647
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:49,390
That was all his concept is
they're willing. He came up
with that. Well, let's see.

1648
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:52,030
Oh, someone who lives in the middle of
the country. That's a great thing. I mean,

1649
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:54,640
it's not as good as being
instructed by Hammerstein,

1650
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:58,100
but if you live in the middle of the
country and you don't have to other

1651
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:00,680
instruction, that's a great
note in Wyoming or some shit,

1652
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:04,910
and you can go online and real place
snowed in my will. I do snowed in. Oh,

1653
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:07,340
you know what I'm saying?
Sounds like your town though.

1654
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:12,290
He's played does like a ski resort. I
don't, Snowden noted. Noted. Oh yeah.

1655
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:17,010
We go to Snowden every year with the
McGraw. I love snow. Did we fly Snowden?

1656
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:21,830
We fly together. Drink
cocktails. It's amazing. No done.

1657
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,510
We're going to Snowden.
I'm going to wear my far.

1658
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,800
I don't care where my fire for Peta.
It sounds like a legit place. Yeah,

1659
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:31,620
it does. Have you ever been in
Wyoming? I've been to Wyoming, yeah.

1660
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,940
Do I just went to Idaho for
the first time. I was just, Oh,

1661
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:39,650
you met the black rifle guys mast. Great.
Got Great to see. They're all great. Yeah,

1662
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,930
they were awesome. Did you go
hunting with him or no? No, no. Oh,

1663
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:46,910
well those mother fuckers humans, but
yeah. Hey, that's not what I want to do.

1664
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,770
I'm just saying it's like, you know
humans. You can hunt elk or, yeah.

1665
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,040
A lot of those guys who used
to hunt humans become hunters.

1666
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:58,290
It helps them sort of cope with
society. They also have, you know,

1667
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,790
they have a special skillset. Yeah. It
was a little bit very good with the guns.

1668
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,240
Not even with just guns. A lot them
get into bow hunting and a lot of them,

1669
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:08,510
a lot of that. You and Matt would get
along. Great Guy. Great Guy, right? Yeah.

1670
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:11,660
And the coffee's bad ass
man. It's delicious shit.
And I got my own Coffee Cup.

1671
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:15,620
I don't know. That's what I heard. Kid
Black Rifle Coffee Brendan shop version.

1672
01:36:15,621 --> 01:36:18,080
Were they calling it the
big, big, big brown coffee?

1673
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:22,100
Smiling Bray about big brown blend. I like
that too. With the Big Brown Coffee Co.

1674
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:27,140
I liked that too. Via Brown
car rifle. Yeah. Nice. Your
own grand. I know. Damn sign.

1675
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:31,820
I know. Ranching out here. Like a, what
are those things? Entrepreneur. Yeah,

1676
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:36,500
I guess I got fucking boss,
businessman type care. Dan. Fuck dog.

1677
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:40,850
Idaho is nice dude. They said the show
is fucking great. It was really fun.

1678
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,170
It was a big ass place. Is
Big theater down that side?
Yeah. It's where the UFC is.

1679
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,710
U of C's there in July.
What car does that? Um,

1680
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:52,540
that's junior Joe Santos versus dude,

1681
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:57,320
he's fighting that Russian lead character.
Who's he fighting that off yet? No,

1682
01:36:57,321 --> 01:37:02,090
not Volkov new. That's the talking.
Forgot about Volkov. I know.

1683
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:05,930
Darkest of dark horse. What's
that? Even off, isn't he? Um,

1684
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,010
wasn't he the guy that was the belt
or champion at one point in time? No,

1685
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:13,730
that's full cub bro. No, but I
think he was first. So it goes,

1686
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,380
yeah. Black Golf, ignorant black
glop. Ivana. Ivana of, yeah,

1687
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:23,330
black boy Yvonne off. I think
he was, um, just Google him.

1688
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:28,130
I think he was, uh, he was either a
world series of fighting champion.

1689
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:32,490
Might be that we're, I think you're right
on world series. That's not built tours.

1690
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:37,340
Is it? Maybe world series
of fighting. Let's see.

1691
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,580
Oh, he's world series. You're right.
He's world series of fighting. Yeah.

1692
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:44,330
He's a tough mother fucker. That
kinds of crazy story too. Um,

1693
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,930
he was stabbed and he almost died. See
if he could find that story. It's a,

1694
01:37:47,931 --> 01:37:50,750
it's a crazy story.
Got their mean Juhas no favors.

1695
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,570
He was stabbed I think more than once.

1696
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:58,830
I'm pretty sure this is the guy, but just
to just Google his name and stab. Sure.

1697
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:02,340
You're not talking about Darren
till no, no, no, no. Darrin tells,

1698
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:05,450
well he needs to be Marie as
well. Everybody can stay. Yeah.

1699
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:09,440
A lot of people got stabbed like against
that, but I think he got stabbed. Yeah,

1700
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:13,920
he got stabbed. The God. Yeah, I'm
serious. Let me see. Bell Tours. You see,

1701
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,060
did find Bell Tor to

1702
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:20,950
Ivana reportedly stabbed in the heart
clean to life support, right? Yes.

1703
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:25,980
This was like 2011 what year was this
sweet memories of fighting champions.

1704
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:30,900
So good with shit that I
shouldn't even know. Um, yeah,

1705
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:32,280
he got stabbed in the heart.

1706
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,050
So he fought for Bella tour and then he
went over to world series and now he's

1707
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:40,590
in the UFC and his first fight
is junior dos Santos. Damn. No,

1708
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:44,100
that's not his first fight.
No, I feel like he's fought
already in the UFC. No Way.

1709
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,420
That's his first fight. Is it
okay. My first fight for sure.

1710
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:50,640
I must be thinking about the
world series of fighting. Yeah,

1711
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:53,820
that's his first flight. Cause he
thought Josh Copeland World Series.

1712
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:56,820
He's a tough motherfucker. This
guy though. Very tough. Tough.

1713
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:59,010
It depends what junior
we get, you know? Right.

1714
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:03,120
And this is junior and that also had a
Usada scare. Something happened with him,

1715
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:06,150
but then they let them off the hook.
Right. I don't, we never hit right.

1716
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:08,370
That lets us, to me, that's the
problem with you. Solid as they go,

1717
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:12,480
this guy flagged. But then if they
get, you know, proven innocent,

1718
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,970
there's no big writeup.
There's no big announcement.

1719
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:18,660
Like there should be a fucking,
maybe didn't really proven
innocent. Maybe it was,

1720
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:22,410
um, wasn't a diarrhetic or something
like that. Yeah, it was diuretic.

1721
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,530
Maybe didn't get proven innocent. I
mean, what was the last time he fought?

1722
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,190
Maybe he just hasn't fucking grizzled.
Steepbank yeah, that was steep.

1723
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:32,610
It was last fight. How long ago was that?
May of last year. It was a good fight.

1724
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:37,110
So how much time do you get suspended?
It depends what you're up, but six,

1725
01:39:37,111 --> 01:39:39,060
12 months, right? Depending
what you took. Right.

1726
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:41,850
But if you're going to take a diuretic,
is it the same as taking Jews like that?

1727
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:46,380
He took a steroid. You get longer,
right? Yeah. Hm. It's all weird, man.

1728
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:47,930
It's almost,
it's almost confusing.

1729
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:51,050
It's like what they say about
the Tour de France tour.

1730
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:54,030
France knows how it's pronounced. It like
Brian Cowen would appreciate that too.

1731
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:55,530
De France Tour de France,

1732
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,930
they say that it's healthier
actually to do that with drugs.

1733
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:01,520
Those do without drugs. It's so brutal
in your body then when they take, yeah,

1734
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,980
and we taking fighting's the same way,
like it's so taxing on your body. Yeah,

1735
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:09,210
that was my point. Yeah. I mean,
I really do, but I didn't want to,

1736
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:11,220
I wouldn't want everybody to
say they have to be on it,

1737
01:40:11,221 --> 01:40:13,880
like everybody has to be on it.
I wouldn't want me,

1738
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,340
that seems like maybe we shouldn't do it.
If you have to do,

1739
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:19,020
and just Santos admits
he's still scared of Usada.

1740
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:23,700
I won't say it doesn't bother me. Hmm. I
wonder what the actual, he was flagged,

1741
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:27,730
but he was a proven innocent.
That's insane because we don't,

1742
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,780
there's no huge announcement about
it. See, that's dangerous. Right?

1743
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:35,160
Because if that, I mean, how long did
he get sat out for a month? It said,

1744
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:38,580
and under. He hasn't fought since then.
He wants to fight again right after c,

1745
01:40:38,581 --> 01:40:39,540
but you're,
you're guilty.

1746
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:42,240
It's like if a girl accuse you of
sexual assault right off the bat,

1747
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:45,990
if that goes on Twitter, you're assumed
guilty with these guys. It's, oh,

1748
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:50,430
he's a drug user. But then I had no
idea he was, yeah, I have no idea.

1749
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:51,870
I had no fucking clue.
I know.

1750
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:55,510
I saw the announcement that making
that final oh yeah. Always back.

1751
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,950
Who was he supposed to fight though?

1752
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:59,710
He was supposed to fight someone else
and it got rescheduled, I believe.

1753
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:02,990
Am I wrong? Was Sing dollar? No.
Is Francis Right? Oh, Jesus did.

1754
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:07,040
He's supposed to fight Francis. Oh, it
was in September and fun. Oh my God.

1755
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:11,380
The one thing I wish the UFC would
do better, even this isn't the UFC,

1756
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:13,750
but it be great if they did
announce when a guy's vindicated,

1757
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:16,990
when he's good to go. Yes,
I need a fucking celebration
like this little birthday.

1758
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:20,260
So they're, they're good to go. The
other thing is when guys retire,

1759
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:23,250
like so many guys retired,
like let's do something for them.

1760
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:27,940
Like guy like Rashad Evans, UFC hall of
Famer. One of the best guys to ever do it.

1761
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:32,290
Great Dude. He put the UFC on the map.
Let's do something which they do for them.

1762
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:36,440
I need fucking something or
celebration of his career some.

1763
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:40,100
So it's just I need something, man. You
just can't go. Yeah. Thanks for the Times.

1764
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:43,840
Here's a tweet. I just, I don't feel
like that's right. Not for everyone,

1765
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:48,040
but for a guy like Rashad, we need
something won the ultimate fighter.

1766
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:52,600
One of the light heavyweight title
think of is rivalries with a fucking Jon

1767
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:56,110
Jones. Jon Jones, Quentin Rampage
Jackson. He based being too tough.

1768
01:41:56,111 --> 01:42:00,790
Fighters never fight like he's
had some crazy times. Now.
It's funny, man. Fighters,

1769
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:04,750
people think about you as, you know, your
fights. You have late in your career.

1770
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:08,470
They forget that crazy fights that he had
earlier in his career. Oh my God. See,

1771
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:11,650
I think the ones that he was doing
these paths, whatever, four or five,

1772
01:42:11,651 --> 01:42:16,070
which were tough to watch, I don't
think of her shot like that. Yeah.

1773
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:20,500
He's a different guy and there's something
that happens to fighters or to human

1774
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:24,170
beings, uh, when they don't want
to do it anymore. And I mean,

1775
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:25,960
I think it happens with every job,

1776
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:28,810
but if you don't want to do it
anymore and you're a printer,

1777
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:32,410
it's not like if you don't want to do
it anymore in your fighter. Correct.

1778
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:33,250
So if you don't want to do it in,

1779
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:36,580
you're a fighter and you kind of half
asset and you're in there with a guy,

1780
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:41,050
you know,
like Glover to sharer Cantonese Smith.

1781
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:44,620
I mean he's in there against dangerous
guys that are trying to kill hungry lions.

1782
01:42:44,621 --> 01:42:48,520
Yeah. It's just, it's a bad place
to be. It's a bad place to be.

1783
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:53,680
You, you gotta be all in, in this, but
it's not a sad thing because, you know,

1784
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:57,030
like that ridiculous safety for,
uh, the Seahawks retirement.

1785
01:42:57,031 --> 01:42:58,300
Cause they had some neck issues.
He tried,

1786
01:42:58,301 --> 01:43:02,080
he tried to figure out he's a pro
baller and he retired after eight years.

1787
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:03,760
I went, Damn, eight years.
That's a good run, man.

1788
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:07,750
I like how long is were shot been
fighting that the fucking run man. Dude,

1789
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:12,010
he won that season one. Season two as
a heavyweight. The heavyweight. Yeah.

1790
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:16,390
Remember he fought bad. Brad,
what was this bread? I am
proud. I am so that's right.

1791
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,330
Right. And then remarried his fight after
that with uh, Sean Sam Salmon. Dana.

1792
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:20,780
He goes,

1793
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:25,570
Dana was give them a stink cause the
fight was boring and then just tack and

1794
01:43:25,571 --> 01:43:27,580
fucking,
we knocked out chuck Liddell.

1795
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:30,580
That was like the first and
he did this to his heart. Yep.

1796
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:33,180
I remember this time out with
one punch dude. The special,

1797
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:34,270
when I think about Rashad,

1798
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,500
he was so special to me and my career
because he was like in our camp and he was

1799
01:43:38,501 --> 01:43:41,140
like, the guy when he won the belt,
I marriage train with this one.

1800
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:43,730
The belt came back and it was
the first time where like,

1801
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:46,720
he would speak truth to us because
at the time I had a girlfriend,

1802
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,220
I was super in love with it. I didn't
want to leave and go to training camp,

1803
01:43:49,221 --> 01:43:51,950
all this stuff. And he's like, dude,
how old are you? I told him, he's like,

1804
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,630
I'm telling you it's gonna be different,
man.

1805
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:58,070
You got us make decisions now based off
this and you just drop knowledge about

1806
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:02,000
the professional life of fighting. And I
remember when he won the belt, he goes,

1807
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:05,930
uh, he was sitting down. He came back
like a week after training and I go, dude,

1808
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:10,640
fucking crazy. Or did you just feel like
out of this world I feel the exact same.

1809
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:13,670
Nothing feels different. I
feel the exact same. He goes,

1810
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:16,910
it's cool and you want this goal and
your achieved and I have the belt and he

1811
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:20,930
goes back to work, man. He goes, I thought
I'd feel completely different. He goes,

1812
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,510
you got to get better now. I gotta
get better. He goes nuts. It's,

1813
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,360
I feel just like you do, man. It
felt right before I won the belt.

1814
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:31,540
He fought Machida when the Cheetah
was Machida. Machida were there too.

1815
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:36,080
There was a time for a couple of years
where Machida was just put it on piece

1816
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:40,250
scares Gann UFC for awhile.
He was such a weird guy to fight man,

1817
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,400
because he'd be like doing this.
Yeah.

1818
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:47,210
He'd be doing all this weird movement
and then he would blitz in on you.

1819
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,490
Nobody knew what to do.
Knock out power man.

1820
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,380
That in his last fight with v
tour like good low, those uh,

1821
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,760
one of the best knockouts.
So see pulled that up.

1822
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,600
Pull that Leo Machida Kaos Vito
Belfort and now he's in Bellator belt.

1823
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:04,930
We're making some waves, son and
saucy over in Beltour, right. Saucy.

1824
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:07,940
How saucy things going to get to
whatever. Be Tours on thing. Proof,

1825
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:09,290
sleet type Sausa

1826
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:14,860
look like Ryan Gordon. Dude,
how bad is it right here.

1827
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:19,780
Let see how he's almost too
respectful. Oh, he knew me. This,

1828
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:23,340
he just, I mean he was out
cold. I'd almost rather have
you set up right. My knock.

1829
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:26,470
I know, right? Let's, Ooh shown
like this is embarrassing.

1830
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,320
This makes it more
embarrassing. Hands on. Yeah.

1831
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:34,820
And then now he's fucking, his eyes
rolled back. Yeah. Damn. And then,

1832
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:36,680
and then I guess the UFC,
I want to see that.

1833
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,120
Wanted to work with them a little bit,

1834
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:40,910
but he just went to Belk toward cause he
goes, you saw it as a way to strike, man,

1835
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:43,190
I'm out. That's what I'm
talking about. Let's see.

1836
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:46,830
Can we see in real time or they only have
it here? Look at this man. Look like,

1837
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:50,600
fix that. Boom. One more time.

1838
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:55,950
So what's interesting is like v tour
always would talk about standing square.

1839
01:45:56,990 --> 01:46:01,990
You know when I first started trading
Carlson Gracie's in 1996 old school,

1840
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,980
it was before Vituro made his UFC debut.

1841
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:10,730
That's when I first started Jujitsu
and feed tour was 19. The feed him,

1842
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:14,680
he was always talking about um oh, here
it is in real time. Look high moves man.

1843
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,380
Liotta so sneaky. Look at
that. That is phenomenal.

1844
01:46:18,381 --> 01:46:22,120
Let me give me that one more time, son.
In real time. He gets down on his knees.

1845
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,380
Leo Machida,
the way he's moving here.

1846
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:29,000
So slacky I mean he didn't
even see that comment. He's,

1847
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:32,500
he's looking at these crazy hand
movements. I remember before this,

1848
01:46:32,501 --> 01:46:36,650
he beat on a Andrews who's a big up
and comer football player at Alabama.

1849
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:41,390
He beat him. Start v Toilet. Yep. I'm
out. Yeah. Now he's at Bellin Story.

1850
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:43,490
You get Roy McDonald. Gigger. I'm saucy.

1851
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:47,120
There's some fun [inaudible] his
brother over there to test the waters.

1852
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:49,480
Like tell me pee Pete.

1853
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:53,070
How's it going bro? What kind
of car? What kind of toast?

1854
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:57,060
And they get that Ryan Bader rematch.
There's some cool fights. Yeah.

1855
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,540
Especially if they let them get saucy.
I mean he and he's 40 years old.

1856
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:05,810
Do I think the other scary thing about
Bella tours that dad's on days on days,

1857
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:08,520
that dead zone, where the fuck they're
going to call it is given them,

1858
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,600
they gave them a nine figure deal.
Who did you remember about this?

1859
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:15,590
Does zone deal? I don't know
what you're saying. Does,

1860
01:47:15,591 --> 01:47:18,930
oh hey z n what is that?
It's their streaming service,

1861
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:21,270
so now they signed with them.
So now Bella Tor,

1862
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:22,920
you remember how they had tape delays?

1863
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:27,060
Now you can stream it digitally for
ff you get that now for five quality.

1864
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:29,910
I think you have to pay for
it just like much. I Dunno,

1865
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,220
but you can stream it on your phone.
First ones can be free.

1866
01:47:32,221 --> 01:47:35,370
Their first like welterweight
big fight is going to be a free,

1867
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:39,840
everybody wins in Beltour deal
with days into stream live events.

1868
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,530
So thinking about who they got right.
Okay. The Guy Gay Guard who uh, they,

1869
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,590
his people just contacted me. I'm going
to get gay garden saucy on the podcast.

1870
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:49,140
He's fighting Roy McDonald.
So they got gay guard.

1871
01:47:49,141 --> 01:47:53,820
They got Roy McDonald to absolute world
class fighters. Absolute world class,

1872
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:57,660
top of the food chain. Maybe the best one,
85 and the best one seven in the world.

1873
01:47:57,661 --> 01:48:00,850
Certainly in the argument,
right then Shit, you know,

1874
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,080
grind baiters never looked better.
Ryan Bader has never looked better.

1875
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,720
He might have to wait Terman right.
Man, I'd ever beat Jon Jones,

1876
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:10,410
but he's never looked better. You know
what I'm saying? Phenomenal. I mean,

1877
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:12,450
he looks fucking incredible
and he knocked out King Mo.

1878
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,330
He could be heavily champion, could be
heavy. He's light heavyweight champion.

1879
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:18,420
Right? Who knows, man. Maybe him going up
to heavyweight would be better for him.

1880
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,840
I mean, maybe it doesn't
have to cut weight. Maybe you
could fight more trimming,

1881
01:48:21,841 --> 01:48:25,650
especially as an older, as an older guy
in his thirties if he can beat Mitrione,

1882
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:29,310
that says a lot. Well, he's really
gotten better and better and better.

1883
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,080
You never stop getting better.
Then of course you got Paul Daily,

1884
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,850
one of the most exciting motherfuckers
in any weight division who's got out

1885
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,860
nuclear missile for a left hand.

1886
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,570
Michael Van and page phenomenal.
Who did Paul well, Paul [inaudible],

1887
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:45,090
his last fight with Fitch was
brutal. Man, that doesn't fit.

1888
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:48,800
Fitch is going to Fitch.
Okay, but why make that fight?
That's what I'm saying. Why?

1889
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:51,150
Why do that? That's fine. What are
we doing? How would you diminish,

1890
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:54,430
why would you diminish daily like in,

1891
01:48:54,431 --> 01:48:57,270
in terms of what he was
marketability after the Larkin fight,

1892
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:02,100
so he chaos Larkin who lark and I was
felt like it was a dark horse at one 70

1893
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,730
especially after he fucked up Neil,
Maggie, Neil, Maggie. I was like, dude,

1894
01:49:05,731 --> 01:49:08,910
this guy is just, he's got
a lot of weird skills, man.

1895
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,830
Larkens got a weird way of moving.

1896
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:13,740
He's got that oblique kick that he
does to the body and he struggled in

1897
01:49:13,741 --> 01:49:16,430
Bellatore came over there, you
know, he's fine with Lima, Lima,

1898
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,110
the motherfuckers [inaudible] him.
Lima beat them,

1899
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:22,780
but it was close to in a row and
then he got chaos. Yeah. See Man,

1900
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,610
you and us ones last semester. You're
in a slug fest with Paul Daley. Dude,

1901
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,270
that dude has got something crazy
in his left hand. But you know,

1902
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,500
after doing Paul Daley
and Michael Bennett Page,

1903
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:38,310
Paul Daley signs new Bella tore contract
except Joe shillings call out. Oh,

1904
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:42,870
Jesus. Joe Schilling.
Dan in MMA. Yes. Joe.

1905
01:49:42,871 --> 01:49:46,440
Cylance shillings fighting MMA.
Now Paul does not taking anybody down.

1906
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:50,860
They're going to stand. That's
interesting. It feels kickboxing match.

1907
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:51,850
I'll be more excited.

1908
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:54,190
But do you think Paul Dale is gonna try
to take them down after all the shit he

1909
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:58,600
talks about guys taking him down? I don't
think there's a chance in hell. Yeah.

1910
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:01,240
[inaudible] Joe Schilling
fighting kickboxing,

1911
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:04,120
one of the best kickbox in the world.
MMA tough for him.

1912
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:06,940
He wants to fight him and may now
that's what he's doing. I'll watch it.

1913
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:10,660
Here's the problem that Joe's been having
is they don't give them enough money

1914
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:13,150
and kickboxing,
Bella toward kickboxing even.

1915
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:16,930
It's just not materialized cause he's not
with Gloria anymore. Right. He's belter.

1916
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:20,230
Yeah, I know. But he was in Gloria
or no? Yeah, he was in glory.

1917
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:23,260
And then he came over to Belle tore a
couple of years ago and he's fought well.

1918
01:50:23,261 --> 01:50:27,130
He said, I love you. I loved watching
him. Fuck kickboxing for whatever reason,

1919
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,040
Bella tore kickboxing just
does not have the appeal.

1920
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:33,040
Can you call it doesn't have the
appeal. That's crazy to me, man.

1921
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:37,090
I do not understand. I do not understand.
Really. I do not understand. I do.

1922
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:40,850
Boxing is popular. How was kickboxing
not pocket? I don't know. I,

1923
01:50:40,851 --> 01:50:43,300
I've watched Bob time much
rather watch southern kickboxing.

1924
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:47,200
Did you watch Rico Verhoeven's last fight?
Sure did. Fucking, that was amazing.

1925
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:50,210
It was cool against, uh,
I'm not stopping my plan,

1926
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:53,260
Ben Siddique you're not stopping.
You're Friday night for it.

1927
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:57,010
I would if I didn't have shit
to do. I know, but, but yeah,

1928
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:02,080
but have shit we've done. We've done
glory fight companions. Halfly. Yeah,

1929
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:04,720
I did a glorified companion with
Joe Schilling. And who else did it?

1930
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:09,010
I was in here. Well listen,
you would've been here. True.

1931
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:11,890
I never miss fite campaigns. You're
going to make fun of the things I love.

1932
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:15,430
Like I made fun of your soccer. I see.
Where do we go? Full comment down on me.

1933
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:19,480
Full Circle, sir. I got to find
something to eat. I love kickboxing.

1934
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,870
I enjoy kickbox and I think
Gloria puts out the best product.

1935
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:24,010
I think Gloria is phenomenal.

1936
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:28,810
I'm actually bummed out that lion fight
is not on a access TV anymore. Yeah,

1937
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,790
they lost their deal with access TV.
Well,

1938
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:34,090
if you've done fake plants for land fight,
probably still be around. So did one.

1939
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:38,740
No, no, no. I think we only did
Gloria Phi companion for glory.

1940
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,960
Bam. Joseph. That's right.

1941
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:46,170
Eve Edwards and Joe Schilling Son 2016
so I would have done it since then.

1942
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:50,280
She didn't have time, man. Okay.
Just cause it's kickbox love it,

1943
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:54,580
but you would fucking down for, you
know, but we only did one Bella tore to,

1944
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:58,870
we only done one belt tore ever. The
hope was that it was a big belter. Yeah.

1945
01:51:58,871 --> 01:52:03,270
Who was that? Who was fighting?
It was all Kaos and submissions.

1946
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:06,490
It was amazing. An amazing card. No,

1947
01:52:06,491 --> 01:52:10,750
Shane hasn't bought borough dare you shut
down your mouth. Jamie. Jamie was like

1948
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:18,690
fucking to work. Dare you.
Shamed car when she goes.

1949
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:21,550
Never fought Bella toys.
No bench.

1950
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:26,410
You son of a bitch name
came to my head shaved.

1951
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:31,600
I apologize. I'm thinking, who the fuck
was, it was a big belt door. It was you.

1952
01:52:31,601 --> 01:52:33,340
Me and Eddie did.
It was phenomenal night.

1953
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,000
Was it fade or [inaudible]
98 but it's not. Who Was it?

1954
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:39,790
Fatal war fade or Frank Mir.

1955
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:44,710
Oh yeah. Bombs on bombs. On bombs. Yeah.

1956
01:52:44,711 --> 01:52:46,160
Fade Frank Mir was chaos.

1957
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:50,030
Yes. Good night. If you know Frank
Mir. I really appreciate that guy.

1958
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:53,080
I appreciate the way he thinks and
talks about fighting too and one of the

1959
01:52:53,081 --> 01:52:55,970
things you said is like remember
fade or a hip toss them,

1960
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:59,720
slammed him on his back and he said he
just got up and just wanted to swing at

1961
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:02,330
him. His Ego got the best of
them and that wasn't the plan.

1962
01:53:02,331 --> 01:53:06,890
The plan wasn't just recklessly
abandoned and gauge on them. Yeah,

1963
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:09,080
but he almost beat him. He almost
beat him. He had them wobble.

1964
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:13,070
Well this is the thing I think
fade or gets you into his groove.

1965
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:16,150
Like he did that with our live ski.
He's done it with a lot of people.

1966
01:53:16,151 --> 01:53:18,930
It gets you into his group with any in
any cracks you would send them over.

1967
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:22,350
He's done it to Brett Rogers
but I think that I was,

1968
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,490
I was curious to see how that fight was
taking place because in the beginning

1969
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:28,460
frank was catching up.
He called rushed in,

1970
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:31,000
but frank also said ring routes
is real. Like he's like, dude,

1971
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,060
I need the experience.

1972
01:53:32,061 --> 01:53:35,990
Like I haven't felt that kind of like
nerves and stuff going to fight in a long

1973
01:53:35,991 --> 01:53:38,170
time. Like it's been a long
layoff for me. He's like, yeah,

1974
01:53:38,171 --> 01:53:40,640
as long as he been off two
years, two years. He's like,

1975
01:53:40,641 --> 01:53:42,320
I just need to get back in there.
Yeah.

1976
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:45,710
What do you don't just they mine that's
supposed to sign with them with belter.

1977
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,680
Scott Coker is on the phone with Barnett
and they've worked together before.

1978
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:50,840
So you know that boy Barnett
gets in there. Molly,

1979
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,390
Mario Batali's in the kitchen
right now making some salt.

1980
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:59,960
He's chopping up some basal
and some garlic. Fucking right.

1981
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:03,570
Let him for they're heavyweights.
Get saucer.

1982
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:07,640
Let them get sauce on net saucy against
Ryan Bader. Well, who do they have?

1983
01:54:07,641 --> 01:54:12,070
They have bater. They
have just zoning. Uh,

1984
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,440
Chael Sonnen, um, Frank Mir.
Remember when Frank Mann,

1985
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:19,370
when Josh Stop Frank Mir actually realize
how good Josh's Josh the nightmare.

1986
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:21,980
It's a nightmare.
I remember we beat the brakes off.

1987
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:24,120
Roy Nelson beat the shit
out of him for five rounds,

1988
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:26,450
beat the shit up and
showed some serious cardio.

1989
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:28,910
Serious cardio to do that for five rounds.
Yeah.

1990
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:31,490
Josh is a nightmare for all those
dudes. Oh, he's phenomenal. Yeah.

1991
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:33,110
He might be Bellator heavyweight champion.

1992
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:37,530
He could special if you let the man sleep
in, you know what I'm saying? Kind of

1993
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:43,190
like went into, oh, just trust it.
Don't hate on them. Just look at it.

1994
01:54:43,191 --> 01:54:46,850
It's all yellow and it's all healthy.
Older would just skills for days,

1995
01:54:46,851 --> 01:54:48,260
leave him alone. Yeah. That's the problem.

1996
01:54:48,261 --> 01:54:51,200
When those old dudes get ahold of
that juice, they got all that year,

1997
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,080
those years and years of learning and
experience and then all of a sudden the

1998
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:56,270
body starts moving like
young man's body again.

1999
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:00,110
That's why t r t v toward
was so fascinating to, he
might go over to bell too.

2000
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,420
I wouldn't be surprised if,
well he might tell him with Ryan,

2001
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:05,540
but he might go to bill. But if he
goes to that door for a detour is like,

2002
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:07,910
he's like, dude, you know, you
guys touched a little bit. I don't,

2003
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:12,620
I only want that bell tours dies. It's
too strict for me. I don't want that.

2004
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:16,870
Well, that was one of the things
that, um, Rory, I'm not Rory, um,

2005
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,260
that uh, gay garden was Saucy, was talking
about guys fighting him. Who was he?

2006
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:24,530
Who was he bringing up that he
would need extra testing from?

2007
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:30,230
He was just talking about this gay
guard was just talking about this.

2008
01:55:30,231 --> 01:55:34,910
Like someone will five or 85
at 85. Who Was it? Machida.

2009
01:55:34,911 --> 01:55:37,340
That's Rao. Machida. Yeah, that's right.

2010
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:40,550
Because he lost a decision
to mature over in Bellator.

2011
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:43,710
He wants extra drug testing for
Leo to Machita. They rematch.

2012
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:47,370
I don't trust that guy said, whoa,
bell tours are going. No problem man.

2013
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:52,290
The we checked. Yeah, we like sat on, it
looks like pee tastes like p set up once.

2014
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:55,650
We did it twice.
The auto confirm it's PPN tastes.

2015
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:58,620
We let them know six months in advance
when he's going to be testing the heads

2016
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:01,890
up. He's getting tested a lot. Yeah.
We post dated all must get samples.

2017
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:04,980
He has a full schedule. You want it
to look, we have 12 urine samples.

2018
01:56:04,981 --> 01:56:06,750
We took them all on the same day,
but we've got them.

2019
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:10,470
That's what they need to do,
man.

2020
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:12,750
Even that's too strict for
fucking be toward though. Hey,

2021
01:56:12,751 --> 01:56:15,120
have you heard anything about Tony
Ferguson? How's his knee doing?

2022
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,460
I don't know what is going
on with her now. Eddie.

2023
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:23,340
Eddie Bravo just had shoulder surgery a
couple of weeks ago. He just took his, um,

2024
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:27,060
I think actually a week ago
just took the stitches out. Yes.

2025
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:30,320
Bad from an episode because I remember
last time I saw him torn his story.

2026
01:56:30,321 --> 01:56:33,510
He's like, he's going like this
back. I'm good man. I'm good.

2027
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:36,270
And he's doing this well,
it must not have been good.

2028
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:39,360
He must've done something to hurt it
again and realize he just should go ahead

2029
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:40,740
and bite the bullet and get the surgery.

2030
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:44,910
I need to get them a sim styles or
whatever the sem stills. I need them.

2031
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:48,810
Stem cells in the left team.
Dagestan braking.

2032
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:54,060
If the negotiate negotiations of on
the fight. Okay, this is Russian.

2033
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:58,950
A translation team could be versus
notorious MMA will not be achieved.

2034
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:03,690
Then next week UFC announces fight
team could be versus Tony Ferguson,

2035
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:06,960
x t UFC two 29,
October six.

2036
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:10,700
How can he come back that
quick? Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute. Phil.

2037
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:14,820
You know, real, I mean, MMA
team Dagestan that doesn't
work. Yeah, but wait a minute.

2038
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:18,620
Let me think of like when Tony go to
Tony Ferguson's, uh, Instagram show,

2039
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:21,780
I'm like break dancing. Right? When
did Tony Ferguson have a surgery?

2040
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:25,620
That was before Brooklyn. Before Brooklyn
was what, how many months ago? Was that?

2041
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:30,390
Two months ago? Correct. There's no
way. How's he do that to and from,

2042
01:57:30,430 --> 01:57:34,800
from four months. I hear controversy.
Khabib is happening. Yeah.

2043
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:39,110
Fucking happening this year. That's
really, that's what you're here.

2044
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,580
That's what the,
that's how the UFC gets him out of jail.

2045
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,640
I said this and I don't
think they give up. I mean,

2046
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:47,910
there were find out what's going to
happen in, uh, in July, right into the,

2047
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:52,170
so there's go to these, uh, just
go to the actual images. The, yeah,

2048
01:57:52,171 --> 01:57:54,540
go back and then scroll down.
Let me see that one right there.

2049
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:58,740
The words moving around or is the video,
let me see that this is him recently.

2050
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:05,180
Hmm. That's fucking slow. Yeah.
He's just controlled. I mean,

2051
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:08,310
Tony's an absolute freak, so when he's
ready to go, he'll be ready to go.

2052
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:12,390
But it almost hurts him because he's
such a freaking, he wants it so bad.

2053
01:58:12,391 --> 01:58:15,390
He might not be ready. Right.
And he might hurt himself,

2054
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:19,750
but he's gotta be with state of the art
guys. Ma'Am. It's Tony Ferguson thing.

2055
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:22,780
Was that one up there with, so he's
doing that one right there. No, right.

2056
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,500
You just had it. There
you go. Look at this.

2057
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:29,700
So he's getting on his knees and
crawling across mats. So this,

2058
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,730
this does not totally live very
guy who's ready to fight though.

2059
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,990
It looks like he's just breaking down
scar tissue. That'd be a little strength.

2060
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:39,840
Flexibility, motivation,
creativity, increasing tremendously.

2061
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:42,100
Not 100% but close

2062
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:47,680
champ step seven weeks out, 11 weeks
out. That's not much time, man.

2063
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:53,530
That's not even three months.
That's a weird thing. It's
like, you know these guys,

2064
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:58,531
they have incredible willpower and in
incredible endurance and incredible like

2065
01:58:58,811 --> 01:59:03,430
just the focus and drive and discipline
to get better. But your body has to heal.

2066
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:07,570
If I'm the UFC, I'm paying to an open
house. Stem cells work. But if I'm Dana,

2067
01:59:07,571 --> 01:59:11,830
I'm paying for Tony. See a stem
cell doctor every week. Yeah,

2068
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:16,330
no way back work. That would totally
help. I mean maybe it would help.

2069
01:59:16,331 --> 01:59:19,450
I think everything helps a little bit,
right? It's amount of what, how much is,

2070
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:21,340
it's not like you could really measure it.

2071
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:25,330
Like you've got a body chart where it
can look at your diagnosis is and go,

2072
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:27,220
oh yeah,
look after we shot the stem cells in,

2073
01:59:27,221 --> 01:59:31,660
look your number here from fucking
fruit rollups oh yeah, yeah.

2074
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,220
I mean I'm sure he's,
I don't know what he's doing.

2075
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:35,950
I would assume he's doing something.
I would do growth.

2076
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:38,130
I'll do a shitload of growth,
which you might get flagged to.

2077
01:59:38,131 --> 01:59:39,880
I don't know what they're
doing with testing,

2078
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:41,780
but I don't think he could
really test for growth. Um,

2079
01:59:41,781 --> 01:59:43,150
I'm honest with you have to do bloodwork.

2080
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:47,140
I don't think they're really embed a man.
I think it's real,

2081
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:49,960
real iffy whether or not they
can catch you doing that.

2082
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:54,940
The Igf one to get to growth and its short
half life, you have to do blood work.

2083
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:56,440
So I don't know how they test these days.

2084
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:58,380
How do they test and
they randomly show up.

2085
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:01,100
They get blood in urine or just
have no idea. They've never done,

2086
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:05,210
I still have those guys could
probably get away with it. Correct.

2087
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:06,600
That's such a dangerous move.

2088
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,700
If they flag you with it and
then you're out for a year. Yeah,

2089
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:13,840
but if I'm injured and I have a doctor's
prescription for HGH to recover,

2090
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:17,620
I'm doing all that HGH stem
cells with the UFC allow,

2091
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:20,860
you can't even have a fucking ivy like
while he's going through all this,

2092
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:22,260
he can't take an ivy blame.

2093
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:25,600
Is that give you Phil's
dehydrated health still terrible.

2094
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:28,720
What do we do about this?
What if he wants to get an Ivy Nad drip,

2095
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:30,100
which will help them recover?
I know.

2096
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:33,850
What if he wants to get a IV in
that's not even like outlawed,

2097
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:37,840
but if he wants to get IV vitamins
like vitamin infusion, you can do that.

2098
02:00:37,841 --> 02:00:40,480
But for the,
if you're then the UFC business,

2099
02:00:40,481 --> 02:00:44,900
why wouldn't you want that guy to be on
all the HGH you can get just to recover

2100
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:50,080
so he can fight cubby to fight for one
55 which were all vying to see. Yeah,

2101
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:53,540
that's good for business you to say
flying. Fuck what he's, how he's doing.

2102
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:55,480
You'd want him for sure on
the stuff that you can do,

2103
02:00:55,481 --> 02:01:00,481
like platelet rich plasma or you know to
send them down a Panama fucking like a

2104
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:04,720
David Lee Roth Song. Panama. I agree. Dot.

2105
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:09,430
But the thing about Panama and go into
like Dr Neil Riordan and doing all that

2106
02:01:09,431 --> 02:01:12,560
shit that a Mel Gibson was talking
about on the podcast with his dad. Yeah.

2107
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:16,360
That stuff's legal. So legal in
Panama, you go down there and they'll,

2108
02:01:16,361 --> 02:01:19,780
they'll do shit that Tj went down
the road, gone down there twice.

2109
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,140
He's gotten in there twice. Illegal
teacher's doing, it's legal.

2110
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:24,940
It's totally above board.
You're allowed to do it.

2111
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:28,480
I'd fly that fucking doctor in here
and I'd have it. You can't do it here.

2112
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:32,230
You have to do it in Panama because
they're doing things that aren't legal in

2113
02:01:32,231 --> 02:01:36,310
the United States. Well, all right.
Either way. Private jet Tony says,

2114
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,830
you know what I'm saying?
I'm saying anyone gets hurt.

2115
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,240
We got this covered. This is
not enough money though. She,

2116
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:47,810
the thing he said to the UFC made more
money last year than ever before. Right.

2117
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:50,900
It's like a record year. Okay. A
lot of it was like all these deals,

2118
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:54,800
but do you know how much money they
must have to pay every month? That loan,

2119
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,670
they have $4 billion purchase.
That's so much money.

2120
02:01:59,170 --> 02:02:02,960
They just signed a few fucking nut
with ESPN in the streaming deal.

2121
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:03,883
European plus.

2122
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:08,120
But do you think they have enough money
where they could fly guys down to Panama

2123
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:11,390
every time everybody gets hurt. All
500 and we're not, I'm not talking,

2124
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:13,970
I'm talking about special treatment.
I'm talking to Tom Brady.

2125
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:16,940
If I'm the New England patriots, I'm
flying down there by any means necessary.

2126
02:02:16,970 --> 02:02:19,250
Okay. When do you take it
off? When do you not allow it?

2127
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:24,170
Do you let Michael Kia fly down there?
Nope.

2128
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:28,670
You're shaking your head no.
No Dad. He strangles pedis? No.

2129
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:33,230
Oh, was he raised? What's he
rate you sign up for a bit.

2130
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:34,130
We'll have to find out.

2131
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:38,750
It's also Pettis has an executive in on
Kevin Lee send Kevin lead down there.

2132
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:43,150
Probably the same. Kevin
[inaudible]. Kevin Michael didn't,

2133
02:02:43,151 --> 02:02:44,170
he choked him out.
Denny.

2134
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:47,900
He didn't tell me and the kids
got a lot of star power to it.

2135
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:51,390
Doesn't mean I'm like a
shitty promoter. Yeah, no.

2136
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,860
Kevin was levels to this game where like,
like if Lebron gets hurt,

2137
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:59,000
we're flying them some. Yeah.
Michael Kassan. Number nine.

2138
02:02:59,001 --> 02:03:01,370
Kevin Lean number five.
Okay. Do you fly down Dustin?

2139
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:04,270
Poirier Ooh,

2140
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,650
you don't write

2141
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:13,370
these fucking guys. What am
I [inaudible] numbers? No,

2142
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:16,740
he's lost two. We're not playing.
Ah, you don't fly him down.

2143
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:19,220
Maybe he can find to now fight nights.

2144
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:22,070
Can you try to replant and get a bunch
of them in at one, sir? Listen. See,

2145
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:27,071
now you're talking to Michael Johnson
from the Michael Johnson fight with Justin

2146
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:31,730
Gagey. He gets flown down for the rest of
his fucking life. Check brain cell. Yes.

2147
02:03:31,731 --> 02:03:35,050
We're going to go through the ears.
Check brain cells.

2148
02:03:35,051 --> 02:03:38,090
I'm going to get them to lie with his
head on one side or fill his ears up,

2149
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:39,260
let it soak into his brain.

2150
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:42,530
You know there's holes in his ear and
then let him lie down on the other side.

2151
02:03:42,531 --> 02:03:46,190
Fill them up with stem cells.
Just go right through the nose.

2152
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:50,060
We're going to the whole body. I
mean I'm giving Khabib, Connor, Tony,

2153
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:54,320
Eddie Alvarez and Nate Diaz the fucking
frequent flyer card in the bitch.

2154
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:58,780
Do you know that? Um, that's something
that, um, Kyle Kingsbury said he did.

2155
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,370
He did some sort of nasal exosomes.
Right?

2156
02:04:01,371 --> 02:04:03,200
And that w do you remember
him talking about that?

2157
02:04:03,730 --> 02:04:06,040
Did you talk about that on the
podcast or off the podcast?

2158
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,640
He's into all kinds of crazy jacks.
State of the art shit. Oh shoot up treat.

2159
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:13,450
He's a big fella.
That's a big fella.

2160
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:16,370
Cow Box checked super athlete too.

2161
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:20,030
Does everything to try and
get the best body possible.

2162
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:23,500
Well now that he works at on it too, like
that's his job. You know, it was on the,

2163
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:27,350
on top of everything new that's
coming out. What can help and what,

2164
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,540
what's the newest, latest, greatest shit.

2165
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:33,770
So you're saying he injected testosterone
bright into is, I don't know. I,

2166
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:38,280
these exosomes with that I think is the
shit that makes a stem effective into

2167
02:04:38,281 --> 02:04:41,310
his nose. Was he talking about
there was had Ben Greenfield,

2168
02:04:41,311 --> 02:04:46,300
God dammit hang out with,
he was Ben Greenfield. This
is why I think it was okay.

2169
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:47,400
Now I remember in Greenfield,

2170
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:51,930
Ben Greenfield crashed his bike
hard and really hurt himself.

2171
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:55,740
His nose. Yeah. He hurt his head.
And uh, one of the things he did,

2172
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:56,520
that's who it was,

2173
02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:01,520
one of the things he did to mitigate
CTE is have exosomes shot up his nose.

2174
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:04,010
He did it.

2175
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:08,310
I ve had it done up his nose and he did
like a full body exosomes treatment.

2176
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:11,040
Help do it, isn't it? Did
you know Ben Greenfield is,

2177
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:15,450
I've listened to you gotta have
him on your show on fire. Zippo.

2178
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:19,170
Yes. First of all, he's a super
genius. Tell Brian is shut the fuck up.

2179
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:23,020
Always talking to, can't I feel like
shouting Brian's pile rocks? No,

2180
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:26,700
but he's also a super athlete.
Like he does a lot of crazy shit,

2181
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:28,100
like tough mudders and all that stuff,

2182
02:05:28,101 --> 02:05:31,380
but he's on the ball when it comes
to the latest and greatest stuff.

2183
02:05:31,381 --> 02:05:32,400
He did a whole article for,

2184
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:37,401
was it Esquire or when he shot his dick
up with stem cells and talks about all

2185
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:39,310
the different things he did to his dick.
Oh really?

2186
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:41,990
PRP and stem cells into his deck.
Yeah.

2187
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:45,540
Any self administered as Dick has like
Gil's now and he's a super genius,

2188
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:50,820
but Brian will teach us to Brian,
shut the fuck out or leave them at home.

2189
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:53,280
I know. Tell Brian we don't have
the podcast. Do you know the,

2190
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:57,450
the French Alps where they train us gears?
Hey God damn it.

2191
02:05:57,530 --> 02:06:01,100
This may talk just today. Please let
them tell them. Go. Please don't die.

2192
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:05,100
I went Benzie ards, wind him up and let
them tell him drop science on me dude.

2193
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:08,250
That dinner at the posted with
all those smart people. Yes.

2194
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:10,590
Trying to solve the world crisis
or what was going on there.

2195
02:06:10,591 --> 02:06:12,570
And where'd you guys eat?
Eating, talking shit.

2196
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:16,540
Like you talk shit like we talk shit.
Probably no date. They're smart guys.

2197
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:19,890
Smart Shit though, right? Oh, there's
some shit talking. Especially it,

2198
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:24,210
Sam Harris is very funny. Believe it or
not. Yeah, he's very smart dude. Yeah,

2199
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:29,180
he's real funny. Fucking Weinstein is
very funny. Uh, Peterson was there, right?

2200
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:30,120
Yeah.
And Jordan Rubin.

2201
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:35,070
Dave Rubin rather is Dave Rubin's a
standup and then Jordan Peterson can be

2202
02:06:35,071 --> 02:06:39,990
funny sometimes.
He's a just insanely smart though.

2203
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:44,610
Does one person start the topic and then
you guys go around like a round table

2204
02:06:44,670 --> 02:06:46,110
now?
We were all just talking and then some,

2205
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:48,420
sometimes we're all talking
together in a couple of times.

2206
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:52,320
Broke off in a separate
conversation was a lot of people,

2207
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:55,290
you know those big dinners are tough.
You don't to talk to,

2208
02:06:55,291 --> 02:06:59,370
you break off in groups who's close
to, you know? Yeah. It was fun though.

2209
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,080
It's fun knowing people that are way
smarter than you. That's my entire friend.

2210
02:07:04,410 --> 02:07:07,620
All my friends are smarter. Well, I
thought about this element. Oh Wow.

2211
02:07:07,630 --> 02:07:11,180
Everyone's swearing. That's what you want
though. Yeah. You don't want to be one.

2212
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:14,500
This was the smartest guy in the
group. You're fucking, that's not good.

2213
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:16,740
You don't want to be just like, you
want to be the toughest guy in the room.

2214
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:19,440
You don't want to be that
good training partners.

2215
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:21,840
Also sneak tough training partners
get good. You know what I'm saying?

2216
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:25,440
You don't wanna be the best fighter in
your gym. Well, really interesting people.

2217
02:07:25,630 --> 02:07:28,400
It makes you crave
interesting conversations,

2218
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:32,340
makes you more interested in different
subjects. They motivate you the same way.

2219
02:07:32,341 --> 02:07:35,980
Like if you were trained with Brian
Ortega, you'd want it to be tighter.

2220
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,430
You were motivated by watching them.
It's like I did a podcast,

2221
02:07:39,431 --> 02:07:43,630
I think Drinkin Bros with Matt best and
those guys and they're all super high

2222
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:44,680
level military guys.

2223
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:47,560
They're asking me about fighting or
whatever and we're doing our Dick Jokes.

2224
02:07:47,570 --> 02:07:48,403
I'm like, nope, hold on.

2225
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:51,400
Cause I want to hear what they say about
the military because they have this

2226
02:07:51,401 --> 02:07:54,970
fucking that they're black belts and
military and all that combat experience.

2227
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:57,920
So I flipped the script on them
as fucking fascinating. Well your,

2228
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:59,490
your listeners are going to
hate this because they pray.

2229
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:02,980
I know this but it went by in like
missions and how it goes down.

2230
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:07,540
I'm so fucking fascinating man. It is.
I don't want to talk and hear them talk.

2231
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:11,840
Have you ever done a podcast
with Jocko? No, I fucking, uh,

2232
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:13,460
I don't know him at all.

2233
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:16,660
I woke up early on the other day and
felt like a tweeting and be like,

2234
02:08:16,661 --> 02:08:20,710
what's up now? Bid. You welcome for
all your, what time are you up? Uh,

2235
02:08:20,711 --> 02:08:24,190
I think like four something, but he
posted, he was up at like five something.

2236
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,480
I'm [inaudible],

2237
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:28,630
he's been on the carnivore diet
before it was the carnivore diet.

2238
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:32,440
He just eats steak. I look at
him, I think that steak, you know,

2239
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:36,380
knows I need to have him on the podcast.
He would be a great guest. I know wheat.

2240
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:39,040
I think someone goes, man, we need
to get Jocko and fire the kid.

2241
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:41,160
And I put let's do it. And he
goes, he goes on their boots.

2242
02:08:41,161 --> 02:08:43,480
You got to figure it out. Yeah, just
get, I'll, I'll give you his number.

2243
02:08:43,481 --> 02:08:45,670
I'm just show. But uh, he's,

2244
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:49,390
he's one of those dudes were you,

2245
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:53,740
if you read his stuff enough
and pay attention, it will
increase your motivation.

2246
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:57,250
Just will. He's the real deal.
You know, he has this video call.

2247
02:08:57,310 --> 02:09:01,150
You ever seen this video? Good. Here
we're seeing good. Please play. Oh my God.

2248
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:03,940
How long is this going to give
you a rock hard boner. What is it?

2249
02:09:03,941 --> 02:09:07,180
A couple of minutes. Two
minutes long. It's tough to
motivate. One of my favorite.

2250
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:10,750
I've watched this at least once every six
months. And I'm not bull shit. Really.

2251
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:15,300
Yeah, we played it on the podcast,
right. Go a full screen and uh,

2252
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:18,550
gimme some volume and don't start
it prematurely. You son of a bitch,

2253
02:09:18,551 --> 02:09:19,780
let it load up.

2254
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:26,320
One of my direct subordinates, one of
my guys that worked for me, he would,

2255
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:30,760
he would call me up. Are we positive
side? What's his background?

2256
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:34,630
Navy seal commander man.
Say No more fam. Okay.

2257
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:38,860
Direct subordinates. One of my
guys that worked for me, he would,

2258
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:42,430
he would call me up or pull me
aside with some major problems,

2259
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:45,460
some issue that was going
on and he'd say possible.

2260
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:49,090
We got this and that and the other thing.
And I look at him and I'd say, good.

2261
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:54,310
And finally one day he was telling me
about some issue that he was having some

2262
02:09:54,311 --> 02:09:59,260
problem and he said, I already know
what you're going to say. I said,

2263
02:09:59,261 --> 02:10:01,180
well, what am I going to say? You
said you're going to say good.

2264
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:02,203
Uh,

2265
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:08,280
he said, that's what you always say
when something is wrong in going bad.

2266
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:13,280
You always just look at me and
say good. And I said, well, yeah,

2267
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:16,870
when things are going bad,

2268
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:20,590
there's going to be some good
that's going to come from it.

2269
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:26,610
Didn't get the new high speed gear
we wanted. Good. Didn't get promoted.

2270
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:33,920
More time you get back. Oh,
mission got canceled. Good.

2271
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:38,120
We can focus on the other one. Didn't get
funded, didn't get the job you wanted.

2272
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:42,770
Got Injured. Sprained my
ankle, got tapped out. Good.

2273
02:10:43,630 --> 02:10:44,750
Got Beat.

2274
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:51,570
Unexpected problems,
good

2275
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:56,040
opportunity to figure out a solution.

2276
02:10:57,910 --> 02:11:02,650
That's it. When things are going
bad, don't get all bummed out.

2277
02:11:02,651 --> 02:11:03,490
Don't get startled.

2278
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:04,680
Don't get frustrated.

2279
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:11,700
If you can say the word good,

2280
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:16,560
guess what we meet?
You're still alive.

2281
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:20,490
It means you're still breathing
and if you're still breathing

2282
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:27,460
[inaudible] you still
got some fight left in.

2283
02:11:29,370 --> 02:11:33,930
Get up, dust off, reload,

2284
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,730
recalibrate,
reengage.

2285
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,820
Go out on the attack.

2286
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:51,740
Gangster. Dude. When it
comes from a guy like him,

2287
02:11:51,741 --> 02:11:54,680
I know it has a different meaning
behind different meaning. Yeah.

2288
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:59,420
When those guys speak, I listen. Then I
fee. I hear that sometimes when I run,

2289
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:03,890
when I'm running hills and
listen, I'm tired. I just go,
good, go, let go. I'm tired.

2290
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:07,700
Tired. Good. You're supposed to be working
hard, good fight with a girlfriend,

2291
02:12:07,701 --> 02:12:11,030
but good. Don't bring a bit.
It's having that attitude though.

2292
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:14,840
Like making that switch in your mind to
just look at things at a different way.

2293
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:18,170
Everybody can do that.
Everybody that's not unattainable.

2294
02:12:18,171 --> 02:12:19,850
When you listen to something like that,

2295
02:12:19,851 --> 02:12:23,750
the real beauty of something that inspires
you like that is you hear it and then

2296
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:25,010
you can actually put into action.

2297
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:28,240
But do you ever have a problem
being self motivated Joel?

2298
02:12:28,241 --> 02:12:31,250
Like I like the don't your mind.
That's fucking fantastic.

2299
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,270
I've never been a guy who's been drawn
to the motivational stuff or, yeah,

2300
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,850
I just never have been.
I've, I've never needed it.

2301
02:12:37,851 --> 02:12:40,490
I've been blessed in that regards.
I don't know what it is.

2302
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:45,520
Even when bad things happen, I'm always
super positive. Always. No, that's great.

2303
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:46,640
I see bad things.

2304
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:51,600
I'm not comparing my bad situations
to fucking jock on the in ward.

2305
02:12:51,670 --> 02:12:55,810
Right. I'm talking whether it's
a fee one, I lost a fight. Um,

2306
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:59,690
if something's going wrong, if it in
stand up and it's something business wise,

2307
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:02,120
I don't get something. I'm
usually all good. I always have.

2308
02:13:02,121 --> 02:13:04,880
I'm usually pretty positive. You
are. You're very positive guy.

2309
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:08,930
I think that's one of the secrets to your
success is that you look at things in

2310
02:13:08,931 --> 02:13:12,140
a good way and you have
confidence and you act. You know,

2311
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:13,930
I mean I tell all these young standups,

2312
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:16,820
I go Brenton Charles and doing
comedy for two fucking years.

2313
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:18,170
You gotta look what he's doing.
This is what,

2314
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:22,120
when an athlete goes after
something like you, you,

2315
02:13:22,121 --> 02:13:25,520
you have the work ethic of an athlete
and the mindset of an athlete.

2316
02:13:25,521 --> 02:13:26,390
But you're also funny.

2317
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:30,170
See the thing about comedy is a lot of
people that are really funny or also

2318
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,440
we're, we're were personal
saboteurs. We self sabotage,

2319
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:39,120
we are impulsive a lot of times get
addicted to things is like real,

2320
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:42,600
like the type of person that becomes a
stand up as a person who says ridiculous

2321
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:43,350
shit.

2322
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:46,470
They say things that as
socially unacceptable things
cause they know it's going

2323
02:13:46,471 --> 02:13:47,304
to get a rise.

2324
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:50,100
They hang around with a bunch of other
degenerates like you and me hanging

2325
02:13:50,101 --> 02:13:53,910
around and you get,
this is a certain style of person,

2326
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:55,890
like a Joey Diaz style of person,

2327
02:13:55,891 --> 02:14:00,060
but you are an athlete who has
those attributes. So for you,

2328
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:02,460
like what I tell like young
guys in particular go,

2329
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:06,030
this highlights the importance
of discipline. It doesn't
make you less funny.

2330
02:14:06,031 --> 02:14:06,900
That's a cop out.

2331
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:09,270
Like a lot of people think that
discipline makes you less funny.

2332
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:12,540
There's the comics have these weird cop
outs. Like you don't want to be a guy.

2333
02:14:12,590 --> 02:14:13,980
Works hard. You want to
be a guy. It's funny,

2334
02:14:13,981 --> 02:14:16,740
some guys are funny and it's
effortless. Yeah, that's nonsense.

2335
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:19,110
Working hard in everything
should work hard in everything.

2336
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,580
Everything you try to do,

2337
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:23,460
you should put the more attention
and more focus you put on it,

2338
02:14:23,461 --> 02:14:26,550
the better you're gonna get at it.
Correct. I just don't want to be a loser,

2339
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:29,970
you know what I'm saying? I don't want
to embarrass myself or people either.

2340
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,900
They pay for our ticket and be like, Dude,
Jesus Christ. Well also you can do it.

2341
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:37,290
You can do it. Correct. You know
you can do it. So if you can do it,

2342
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:40,500
just keep doing it. Get better at it,
keep working at it, keep swinging.

2343
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:44,190
It's a fascinating thing to do for
a living then. You know the best.

2344
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:49,050
Fuck kidding me. But
discipline man. So I've, I've,

2345
02:14:49,051 --> 02:14:53,730
um, I've never necessarily had
a problem, self motivating,

2346
02:14:53,731 --> 02:14:57,000
but I've always drawn inspiration
from a lot of different sources. Yeah.

2347
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:01,140
I'll go to the rocks Instagram page
every day. Every day. No bullshit.

2348
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,270
Cause he's always hustling.
I see the Rock,

2349
02:15:03,271 --> 02:15:06,420
he's always fucking flying around
in a jet. He's always in the gym.

2350
02:15:06,650 --> 02:15:10,240
It's a little bit put the rockin splash.
But Kevin Hart, he goes, no, no, no.

2351
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:14,370
He does too. They're really not on jets.
The jet thing is, I know it's money,

2352
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:17,710
but when Kevin Hart's in the gym all the
time, that inspires me for sure. Workout.

2353
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:19,110
He's constantly in the gym.

2354
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:21,480
Doesn't mean I'm going to work
out because of Kevin Hart.

2355
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:23,700
No going to work out already.
You're just like, fuck yeah,

2356
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:27,720
like watching people kick
ass. There he is. Bam.

2357
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:31,440
The Rye also like people to kick
in it. Like I, I don't hate anyone.

2358
02:15:31,441 --> 02:15:35,330
I root for everyone. Like I, it's almost
a problem. Why root for everyone? Yeah.

2359
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:36,630
I almost think it was almost a,

2360
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:39,810
it was my downfall as a fighter
and as a football players,

2361
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:44,940
I would root for everyone.
I think anybody, I want
everyone to do the pudding,

2362
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:48,960
but it helps me any comedy. Like I want
everyone, I want everything to be good.

2363
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:50,850
Yeah. Like I did a show at the
ice house and they're like,

2364
02:15:50,851 --> 02:15:54,240
you need to open up for you.
And so I called Emily at
the comedy store. I'm like,

2365
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:57,990
Hey, do you have to door guys who are
vying for spots? She's like, fuck yeah,

2366
02:15:58,090 --> 02:16:01,770
give me a list. So every show I, I'm
always trying to bring the door guys in.

2367
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:04,350
That's because I'm like, how can I, you
know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah,

2368
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,520
everyone to do well.

2369
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:09,810
That's because when I look at like what
inspires me is like when you post a

2370
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:13,890
video in the crowds in Idaho or
whatever, or Krista, Leah, you know, are,

2371
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:16,650
are like the crew when guys
are doing like, to me that's,

2372
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:19,530
it's trying to keep up with that.
I, cause I feel like I'm in this,

2373
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:20,670
we're in this race,

2374
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:25,700
right in this race together and everyone's
fucking beast and animals and you've

2375
02:16:26,061 --> 02:16:26,540
got,

2376
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:30,220
you're going to fall back in the PAC man
be a loser and get eaten by these lines

2377
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:34,030
or you keep running with these
monsters. Yeah. That's how I look at it.

2378
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:36,460
Well it's a great attitude
to have in anything.

2379
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:38,140
If you want the people around you do well,

2380
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:40,210
it's a great attitude to have
with everything that's been,

2381
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:45,040
it's one of the major secrets to my
success for sure is have a bunch of people

2382
02:16:45,041 --> 02:16:49,060
around you that are kicking ass and then
like helping them, helping everybody,

2383
02:16:49,061 --> 02:16:53,080
promoting everybody, letting everybody
know and encouraging everybody. And then,

2384
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:56,530
you know, when everybody's doing great
and everybody's, it's just, it feels,

2385
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:58,990
it's a good feeling for all involved.

2386
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:02,560
When people go selfish and they only
want a good thing to happen to them and

2387
02:17:02,561 --> 02:17:05,230
they get upset of good things happen
to other people, that's poison, man.

2388
02:17:05,231 --> 02:17:08,670
That's jealousy doesn't work. It does
the opposite of work. It does. That's,

2389
02:17:08,671 --> 02:17:10,900
so there's a,
there's an actual quote about that,

2390
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:15,220
that jealousy is one of the rare emotions
that achieves the opposite effect.

2391
02:17:15,221 --> 02:17:20,221
That an intense too because you intend
to like diminish someone by being jealous

2392
02:17:21,671 --> 02:17:23,530
of them, but in fact,
you diminish yourself.

2393
02:17:23,890 --> 02:17:26,910
You're putting the energy into things
you can't control and it does not matter.

2394
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:28,540
Yeah.
I forget who made that quote,

2395
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:33,310
but it's even uglier when it's jealousy
amongst friends and we all have seen it.

2396
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:37,690
We've all seen, it's weird. It's a weird
thing to see it. It's weird to me. Uh,

2397
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:41,680
when I was flooding, it was weird to
see people who, I won't mention names,

2398
02:17:41,681 --> 02:17:45,100
but we're all in the same group
and a guy who would be fighting,

2399
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:48,480
you could tell they didn't want him
to succeed. I'm like, dude, we just,

2400
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:53,560
we just went through an eight week camp,
like tough, tough. I'm like, Oh, you're,

2401
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:57,550
you're jealous man. With his success.
It's not to, you can go on your own path.

2402
02:17:57,610 --> 02:18:00,610
That's a weird thing, man.
With comedy, we don't see,

2403
02:18:00,611 --> 02:18:01,900
I thought I'd get it way worse.

2404
02:18:01,901 --> 02:18:04,240
I thought people were going to fucking
hate me when I walked into the store,

2405
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:07,520
laugh factory. But we, I don't see
it around there. And if I do it,

2406
02:18:07,570 --> 02:18:10,520
they're not say it to my
face. But what is it? Well,

2407
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:14,710
it's also once you're proven to actually
be funny, you're in, it doesn't,

2408
02:18:14,711 --> 02:18:16,630
nobody gives a shit.
Everybody just wants you to be funny.

2409
02:18:16,631 --> 02:18:20,440
But if you were like some guy who was
like maybe an actor that was kind of half

2410
02:18:20,441 --> 02:18:23,500
asking it and people would come to see
you just because you were an actor,

2411
02:18:23,501 --> 02:18:27,210
but you weren't really trying. He didn't
respect, which we've all seen in the gas.

2412
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:27,760
Well,

2413
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:31,540
there's been a bunch of those people that
tried to get sitcoms back in the early

2414
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:36,100
days and during the Sitcom days when
there was a lot of comics like that.

2415
02:18:36,101 --> 02:18:39,580
We're getting these deals and then that
they would do a sitcom based around them.

2416
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:42,500
Very few of them ever became like a
Seinfeld or something like that. Yeah,

2417
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:44,970
but they gave it a lot of deals.
Manville mental.

2418
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:49,360
So there was a lot of actors who got
into comedy and put together like a quote

2419
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:52,180
unquote act to try to get a deal.
Like they would,

2420
02:18:52,210 --> 02:18:54,700
they would do it because they
would look at it seeing like, look,

2421
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:56,290
if they're just going
to audition for shows,

2422
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:58,630
it's really difficult to stand
out from the crowd. I mean,

2423
02:18:58,631 --> 02:19:01,870
unless you look like Luke Rockhold
or you got some, you know,

2424
02:19:01,871 --> 02:19:05,910
you're the perfect Ryan Reynolds looking
fella. It's fucking hard. Fuck you.

2425
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,910
And then if you're a girl,

2426
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:10,450
like you have to be like really
hot or you have to be really big.

2427
02:19:10,451 --> 02:19:14,570
Like you have to, some has
to be funny about you, right?
Well if you're a stand up,

2428
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:19,450
there's no rules. Like you can be
Ali Wong, you can be Roseanne Barr,

2429
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:22,780
you can be, I mean there's no, you just
have to be funny like anybody matters,

2430
02:19:22,781 --> 02:19:25,510
right? So a lot of actors
looked at it like, oh,

2431
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:28,100
I'll just put together an act and aw man,
stand ups

2432
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,320
would hate them. Hate them. I'm sure.

2433
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:34,370
Want to go well either because it's
within like it's whoever it is.

2434
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:37,520
Let's say fucking John Goodman's
I started doing stand up right.

2435
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:40,310
And he came on stage and I'm like,
go fuck, that's John Goodman.

2436
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:43,760
Then after about three minutes like okay,
let's John Goodman,

2437
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:47,030
they'll fucking do man. Well that
was Michael Richards. You know,

2438
02:19:47,031 --> 02:19:50,120
Michael Richards wasn't really, it didn't
really have a background in stand up.

2439
02:19:50,121 --> 02:19:54,320
He had a bass on. I didn't
know that. Yeah, he was like,
he would do like, he would,

2440
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,120
it wasn't,
didn't have like an act.

2441
02:19:56,150 --> 02:20:01,150
He would do like he would fall down on
stage and play like he was doing Kramer

2442
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,900
Character Kramer. Yeah.
It was very strange.

2443
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,530
And I don't know if he did it for a long
time and then stop doing it for a long

2444
02:20:06,531 --> 02:20:10,340
time and then started doing it again
after Seinfeld. But before he had that,

2445
02:20:10,510 --> 02:20:14,390
you know, air quotes incident at
the laugh factory. Um, you know,

2446
02:20:14,391 --> 02:20:17,250
we'd seen him a couple of times and
it was weird. You know, it just, it,

2447
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:21,200
it was like a really,
really famous open Mike night guy.

2448
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:23,480
Jesus Christ. Yeah. Strange.

2449
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:28,550
It was like a guy who's super famous but
really hasn't been doing it that much

2450
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:31,070
because you're going up at
the laugh factor comedy stuff.

2451
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:33,980
You've got to remember it's murder.
They're not booking those people.

2452
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:35,960
So it's murder drone for
whatever reason you got in,

2453
02:20:35,961 --> 02:20:38,980
but you're on that line up
with Belper and you and delay.

2454
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:43,970
You got to go up and the crowds used to
seeing high level fucking stuff. Yeah.

2455
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:49,160
This was like what,
2006 or some shit,

2456
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:50,840
when did all that go down with him?

2457
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:54,730
Brian said was at the Improv
and drove trouble. Well,

2458
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:57,440
I had gotten back to
the comedy store and uh,

2459
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:01,670
I think it was Brent Ernst,
I think.

2460
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,040
I think he saw it.
Yeah,

2461
02:21:04,041 --> 02:21:08,360
he was over at the laugh factory when it
happened and he came back. He was like,

2462
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:12,380
he was like, Yo, I just left
the left factory. He goes,

2463
02:21:12,381 --> 02:21:16,670
fucking crane was up there
throwing the end. Bob and I
was like, Oh, what happened?

2464
02:21:16,671 --> 02:21:20,120
He goes, dude, it was crazy. He lost
his shit. He was getting heckled.

2465
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:21,590
So we had heard about it.

2466
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:25,850
But then when the cell phone
video got TMZ released that shit,

2467
02:21:25,851 --> 02:21:28,880
everybody was like, Oh God, set match.

2468
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:33,370
Like this is a new thing dude.
Yeah, it was weird man. I was uh,

2469
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:36,470
I was going sit in the belly room the
other night and I've never seen Brody

2470
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:40,190
Stevens who stand up. I've
never seen them. And they
got up there and just again,

2471
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:41,750
I, I, I know who he is,

2472
02:21:41,751 --> 02:21:44,630
obviously he's always running by Mercedes
and then he just came out like doing

2473
02:21:44,631 --> 02:21:46,820
crowd work and not using the
Mike and I looked at Sam, I go,

2474
02:21:47,430 --> 02:21:49,430
what the fuck's he doing man?
He's like,

2475
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:53,090
you've never seen him like going to go
just watch. And it was so funny, man.

2476
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:56,990
Forever. And it's just
fantastic. That does.

2477
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:00,620
Crowdwork for he does was warm warmups
for so many television shows for so many

2478
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:04,280
years that he's like super comfortable
just talking to people. Yes,

2479
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:08,750
it was fucking done. A special came
out recently. I think it's on iTunes.

2480
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:12,740
Oh really? Lie from the main room taped
it and the man doing that set this,

2481
02:22:12,741 --> 02:22:17,060
the Kinison set the spot. No
Shit Dude. That's so cool. Wow.

2482
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,850
When did they do this? Just came
out recently. A couple weeks ago.

2483
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:22,190
He was talking about
on stage did for them.

2484
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:27,450
He can go around and he'll go Iowa
like, yeah, for my goes, there you go.

2485
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:31,410
Moves on the explosion like Jesus
Christ. Man. It was so funny.

2486
02:22:31,890 --> 02:22:32,880
He's a weird guy.

2487
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:37,910
I'll be here to 2:00 AM 10:02 AM I'm like,

2488
02:22:38,071 --> 02:22:41,130
what the fuck? That's how he kicked it
off. I'm like, what is going on right now?

2489
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:42,173
Well his uh,

2490
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:46,530
his style is so unusual because on paper
you would never understand where the

2491
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:50,380
punchlines are. But then when you hear him
say you can't stop laughing. Yeah. Yeah.

2492
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:53,790
It's like I was dying. I don't know
if he writes it or if he just does it.

2493
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:57,570
I wonder, I'd like to ask him if you
write stuff down or if he just does it.

2494
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,150
Just a few guys like
that that are just funny.

2495
02:23:00,151 --> 02:23:05,151
The way that like Theo's like that funny
the way they say shit like Theo says

2496
02:23:05,191 --> 02:23:06,720
shit that I could say the same shit.

2497
02:23:06,721 --> 02:23:10,770
It wouldn't be funny but he says it
and it's fucking hilarious. Yeah.

2498
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:12,660
That's the kingdom out comedy man.

2499
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:16,350
Like nobody really knows what
funny is until you hear it.

2500
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:20,280
But there's also something, uh, Steve, uh,

2501
02:23:20,281 --> 02:23:24,550
Simone [inaudible] he
was saying, um, cause I,

2502
02:23:24,551 --> 02:23:26,930
I was telling him I go, he goes man,
your hair a lot and go yeah, I'm,

2503
02:23:26,931 --> 02:23:30,270
I'm trying to just jump on anyone shows
cause I want to make sure it's not my

2504
02:23:30,271 --> 02:23:30,931
crowd.
You know,

2505
02:23:30,931 --> 02:23:33,390
cause you got to figure out what's
funny cause you just played your shows.

2506
02:23:33,391 --> 02:23:36,330
I don't want to be that guy. It was who
told you that? Who the fuck told Jay goes,

2507
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:39,910
everyone here is trying to get their
crowds. Here's when you're on the road.

2508
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:41,910
Do you want your crowd
man? And I'm like, I know,

2509
02:23:41,911 --> 02:23:45,480
but when I'm here on make sure it's not
my crowd because I feel like the funny

2510
02:23:45,481 --> 02:23:48,780
uncle at the barbecue, if it's my crowd
right, you don't find out what's working.

2511
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:52,710
Yeah. The Ice House, if it's my crowd
that, especially at as I've walked off,

2512
02:23:52,711 --> 02:23:56,010
feel like Kevin Hart, like blood
flow. That was a fucking a plus.

2513
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,440
But then you go to the comedy
store and it's not your crowd.

2514
02:23:58,441 --> 02:24:01,440
Like that was a d that was a
fucking dudes. That's true.

2515
02:24:01,441 --> 02:24:05,280
But if you go to the ice house and it's
your crowd and you actually record it

2516
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:07,740
and listen to it, you
can do, that's important.

2517
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:11,130
You can tell what is actually gonna work,
what's not gonna work.

2518
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:15,120
You can tell and then you can tighten
it up so you have extra confidence at a

2519
02:24:15,121 --> 02:24:18,150
place like the ice house to do
different shit. To me, what it's like,

2520
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,620
it's like cross training,

2521
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:24,480
like it's not a bad idea to do some
kettle bells and run some hills and do

2522
02:24:24,481 --> 02:24:26,550
Jujitsu.
It'll probably make you jujitsu better.

2523
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:30,750
And I think just doing crowds were,
no one knows who you are is great,

2524
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:33,570
but doing crowds where they
know who you are is great too.

2525
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:36,090
And as long as you're paying attention
to get a different thing from,

2526
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:40,170
from each one, yeah, you're right.
100% right. Yeah, it's, I mean the,

2527
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:43,230
you also get different things from
different size rooms. You know,

2528
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:47,790
there's certain things that will work
at the laugh factory in certain pockets

2529
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:52,500
that won't work anywhere at calm. It's
so strange to me. It's a weird thing man.

2530
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:56,670
It's very strange. Strange as it
gets you feel any different energies.

2531
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:58,500
It's so cool. It's so fascinating, man.

2532
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:01,710
[inaudible] you want to talk to him about
the comedy store and like the history

2533
02:25:01,711 --> 02:25:05,100
of it? Steve Simone just,
yeah, he knows a lot of shit.

2534
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:08,550
Steve's been around for a long
time and couldn't be a nicer guy.

2535
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:11,490
Might be the nice guy and he might
be the nicest guy that's ever lived.

2536
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,110
Almost like this. Like a darkness
back there that I want. I want him,

2537
02:25:14,111 --> 02:25:17,020
I know on what's going on.
Well I push him. C'Mon he's,

2538
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,630
he's open about his dad and I was like,
can we come from a good family?

2539
02:25:20,631 --> 02:25:23,920
It sounds like you come from a nice guy,
a good family.

2540
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:27,880
Just one day it was opened up for, are
you in San Francisco? I wasn't. Yeah.

2541
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,900
The cobb's cobb's is an interesting room.
It used to be the tiniest room.

2542
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:35,620
He used to be like 150 people, a little
tiny room on the road, but it was so good.

2543
02:25:35,621 --> 02:25:37,900
Everybody wanted to do it and
then they moved to that place,

2544
02:25:37,901 --> 02:25:42,460
which is like 454 50 giant ass ceiling.
It's a big place. It's in crowd there too.

2545
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:46,990
Damn liberal. Well that San Francisco
man, San Francisco, highly educated,

2546
02:25:46,991 --> 02:25:50,140
very progressive. It's you. It's,

2547
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:53,080
you're doing a different kind of
comedy there. Did an abortion joke.

2548
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:54,890
Ah,
they

2549
02:25:54,890 --> 02:25:57,470
didn't like it.
[inaudible]

2550
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:03,170
that's Larry. I'm more of a reference,
but it did not go well. Yeah,

2551
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:07,190
you can feel it. Yep. Is
there anything worth? Nope.

2552
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:12,020
But you know what it is, is when you run
into a subject that people don't accept,

2553
02:26:12,021 --> 02:26:13,310
you gotta ask yourself,
okay,

2554
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:17,630
does my sense of humor different than
theirs or did I do a shitty job in

2555
02:26:17,631 --> 02:26:21,770
figuring out how to get that subject to
them? You know, because some subjects,

2556
02:26:21,771 --> 02:26:26,720
like there's quite a few bits that are
going to be in my Netflix special that

2557
02:26:26,721 --> 02:26:28,340
when I first started doing them,
they weren't that good.

2558
02:26:28,341 --> 02:26:31,550
There was something missing. Like I knew
there was something there, but your,

2559
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:35,150
you don't,
you only know so much when it's written.

2560
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:40,010
You really find out what's good when you
try it on stage and then that's when it

2561
02:26:40,011 --> 02:26:41,030
sort of comes to life.

2562
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:46,040
It's like I have almost every bit that
I've ever done written in some way,

2563
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:49,120
but they're all rarely the
way I do them. Yeah. You know,

2564
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,110
once you get on stage with it,

2565
02:26:51,111 --> 02:26:53,480
that's when you start fucking with
it and figure out how to do it.

2566
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:57,860
More of an outline. Yeah. And then we'd go
on stage like, yeah, but it's, you know,

2567
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:02,240
along the way sometimes it just
tanks, you know, that has to happen.

2568
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:05,300
This isn't something I stick with
it though. Don't, that's so crazy.

2569
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:08,690
This isn't what I tell you just
the other night man around.

2570
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,570
They'll move it around,
but a good beating,

2571
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,570
like doing it where it doesn't
work makes you just refocus. Like,

2572
02:27:14,571 --> 02:27:16,970
let me go back and look at this thing and
figure out why these people got upset.

2573
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,830
Oh, you know what? If
I just do this first,

2574
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:21,650
then they'll know where I'm coming
from first to let me get away with that

2575
02:27:21,651 --> 02:27:24,770
because they won't think I'm an asshole.
You know it's weird.

2576
02:27:25,460 --> 02:27:30,410
And you finish your especially finish
editing yourself. Yeah, that's uncommon.

2577
02:27:30,411 --> 02:27:33,860
Right. But I didn't have much to
edit in terms of like content.

2578
02:27:33,861 --> 02:27:36,920
It was just how much should I
cut out and wear what, you know,

2579
02:27:36,921 --> 02:27:38,180
what show was the best one?

2580
02:27:38,750 --> 02:27:42,710
That was what it was really a lot of
the best one was the first show I heard

2581
02:27:43,010 --> 02:27:47,150
Tony, as soon as you guys get done, cause
I text you in a text on and he goes,

2582
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:50,650
I don't even know why we're filming the
second one. I'm my mouth. The first one.

2583
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:54,560
It really is. Yeah. Out of the park
Paul slugs. It's fun man. Wilbur Wright.

2584
02:27:54,561 --> 02:27:56,960
That Wilbur theater is
amazing. That places, you know,

2585
02:27:56,961 --> 02:28:00,080
cause it's like a theater but it's
also like a comedy club cause it's like

2586
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:04,070
there's 900 or 1100
people in the room and uh,

2587
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:08,750
I think it's like 500, 300,
300 or something like that.

2588
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:13,040
Yeah. Reminds me of the palms if feel
you've come kid, the palms, the palms.

2589
02:28:13,041 --> 02:28:15,350
It's like people who are
right on top of yet. Yeah,

2590
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:18,470
they're right on top of you were most
theaters so far. You can't feel it.

2591
02:28:18,590 --> 02:28:20,870
Katt Williams did the palms
one time when we were there.

2592
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:23,930
I didn't get a chance to see him
though. God, he's fucking, he was there.

2593
02:28:23,931 --> 02:28:27,080
I think he was there like the day
before the UFC or something like that.

2594
02:28:27,081 --> 02:28:31,700
My brother went and saw a Kevin Hart.
He was at Pepsi Center. Oh yeah. I God,

2595
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:35,930
I wonder how, how the fuck do you pull
off? Stand up the Pepsi Center. Jay Goes,

2596
02:28:35,931 --> 02:28:38,930
I know. And my brother's a little
bit of a hater by nature. He was,

2597
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:41,270
he can't be that good. And I'm like, dude,

2598
02:28:41,271 --> 02:28:44,540
he's like the most successful
comic ever touring in the stadiums.

2599
02:28:44,541 --> 02:28:47,270
I bet it's pretty fucking good.
And he goes in there and he was,

2600
02:28:47,271 --> 02:28:51,720
I'd like Brown stage like three 16 he
goes, dude, it was incredible. Best.

2601
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:54,140
Best he's ever seen. Wow. Which is crazy.

2602
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:56,860
So fucking power house man power is,

2603
02:28:56,910 --> 02:29:01,160
or how hustling performance powerhouse.
Yeah.

2604
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:04,970
Interesting. Right. It's interesting
when you see those super winners,

2605
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:10,160
those super winners that just pushed
the envelope of success. It's weird.

2606
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:12,710
You know those,
those qualities are very strange.

2607
02:29:13,130 --> 02:29:18,050
It's also strange in comedy
because someone, Kevin Hart
might be Your Cup of tea,

2608
02:29:18,230 --> 02:29:23,060
but then they might hate bill burr, which
it's very strange to me. That's silly.

2609
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:26,240
Why don't I shouldn't say hey. You
know what I'm saying? Like, yeah,

2610
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:30,860
like bill burn might be just okay to you,
but Kevin Hart's your number one. Yeah,

2611
02:29:30,861 --> 02:29:33,620
but that's okay.
That's normal.

2612
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:35,570
There's always going to be people
that have different tastes.

2613
02:29:35,571 --> 02:29:39,110
That's that same with music. That's the
same with four shirts. Everything percent.

2614
02:29:39,290 --> 02:29:41,870
Yeah.
It's crazy time for stand up though.

2615
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:45,200
If you think about how many different
comedians are really good right now and

2616
02:29:45,201 --> 02:29:49,610
have specials, it's nuts.
Netflix is blown up,

2617
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:50,270
blown up.

2618
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:53,480
Do you know Russell Peters was the
first comic to get a Netflix special?

2619
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:56,060
When did he get is a long ass time ago.

2620
02:29:56,260 --> 02:29:57,500
We heard him in an
interview talking about,

2621
02:29:57,501 --> 02:30:01,080
I think it was with a sway in the morning
and he goes out as the first one and

2622
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:04,590
they say, how much did they pay you?
And he talks about it. He goes, ah,

2623
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:08,340
he goes 10% of what Chris rock got paid.
And they looked at him.

2624
02:30:08,341 --> 02:30:11,270
And when was he the first one?
What year was it? Old School.

2625
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:16,350
Really find that look good on a Russell
Peters comedy special prosecutors is a

2626
02:30:16,581 --> 02:30:17,270
monster.

2627
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:22,250
I had one on Netflix in 2005 I
think Russell Peters beat Ya.

2628
02:30:22,430 --> 02:30:25,520
Probably if he was first.
Pretty sure he said he was first

2629
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:31,190
two then five Goddamn Goddamn, I don't
even know Netflix was back then. Yeah,

2630
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:33,050
nobody knew.
That was part of the problem.

2631
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:36,650
It was like everyone was going on.

2632
02:30:36,651 --> 02:30:38,860
So when people like my
specials on c so I'm like,

2633
02:30:38,890 --> 02:30:42,350
oh fuck to what else is going on this
weekend with the UFC? What are the fights?

2634
02:30:42,351 --> 02:30:45,400
Are there? Well you got the ultimate
fighter finale on Friday. Prayers.

2635
02:30:45,401 --> 02:30:49,640
Are Any others on that card
style bender pull up. Ooh, style.

2636
02:30:49,641 --> 02:30:52,400
Brender I did Brad to
vars versus tile vendor.

2637
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:56,090
Perhaps a motherfucker man beat him,
but I think I really love style Benner.

2638
02:30:56,091 --> 02:30:58,730
But uh, Brad's been quietly foreign. Oh.

2639
02:30:58,731 --> 02:31:03,200
But also Brad is a guy who the
rumors he's injured go on this fight.

2640
02:31:03,210 --> 02:31:06,380
He was going to call the fight off. He's
injured. Dare you say that online? No,

2641
02:31:06,381 --> 02:31:09,170
it's all over. It's as it, yeah.
What's he injured with? I don't know.

2642
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:11,690
He's supposed to pull out, but he's
going through it. So it depends.

2643
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:15,890
People forget bracket and
fucking wrestle too fucking.

2644
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:21,030
That's a tough fight.
Fire style bender from Nigeria 13 and,

2645
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:26,010
oh son. He's a motherfucker. He
really is. He's so exciting. Damn.

2646
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:29,430
That's very good. Let me see the
right, the regular UFC card again.

2647
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:32,970
That's a big fight. So that's the headline
fight. Yeah. And the ultimate fighter,

2648
02:31:32,971 --> 02:31:36,120
which is you see them, you see they're
selling the ultimate fighter house.

2649
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:39,600
The title, the ultimate by selling.
They're selling it really. Five Mil son.

2650
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:44,130
You want it five now. A good investment.
What did you just like 19 bedrooms,

2651
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:48,000
p people peed all over that house.
Oh Dude. He would go on there.

2652
02:31:48,001 --> 02:31:52,050
It's going to smell like a dude's ball.
Do jacked off in the sun's out rom font.

2653
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:53,160
That's a good fight right there.

2654
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:58,560
That's a very good fine go con sacking
and Kaleel round tree fucking fight.

2655
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:02,850
That's a real good fine Felder,
Mike Perry. That the fucking fight.

2656
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:07,410
That's right. Do you remember an elder
at welterweight? Very interesting.

2657
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:08,760
He's a big dude.

2658
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:13,140
Felder has to cut some serious weight
to make one 55 Felder's a monster on the

2659
02:32:13,141 --> 02:32:17,670
Mike too. He's a great commentator.
Very Smart Paulo Kosta in Uriah Hall.

2660
02:32:17,671 --> 02:32:18,960
That's very interesting.

2661
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:22,680
I'm not at 2.0 I'm not saying
Paul Coast has done all the drugs,

2662
02:32:22,681 --> 02:32:25,350
but how does he pass this fucking tests?
What?

2663
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:30,470
Whose nose is clogged up for that sniff
test and his allergies are kicking in

2664
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:34,860
that forgot their inhaler?
Like

2665
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:40,830
how does the [inaudible] he's just
not live wherever his house is. Dude,

2666
02:32:40,831 --> 02:32:44,630
he is first team. All Landover
nod on that car to go down there.

2667
02:32:45,050 --> 02:32:49,560
It's close. Oh, what your car clothes and
Landover Nada. That might be the sleeper.

2668
02:32:49,561 --> 02:32:50,430
The night folks.
Yeah.

2669
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:53,700
I get this phone once you've been
talking about that fight on fight pass.

2670
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,200
That's crazy. Hooker and Burns is a
more fucking fight to Gilbert Burns.

2671
02:32:58,201 --> 02:33:01,280
Dan Hook or holy Shit.
What a card this is. Yeah.

2672
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:04,080
To this card is insane.
Great Card.

2673
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,320
This is an insane car cause people aren't
even talking about this hooker burns

2674
02:33:07,321 --> 02:33:09,330
fight. Dude. You know what's
going to be sad though?

2675
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:11,850
I think the pay per view
numbers. Oh, how dare you.

2676
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:14,180
You never know Steve paid versus DC.

2677
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:19,110
It might get into twos 20 hundreds well
and a lot of people like Max Holloway

2678
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:21,900
and Brian Ortega. You don't think you
can make it into the to do hell yeah.

2679
02:33:21,901 --> 02:33:25,260
200 200 be a nightmare to
50 was the last one, right?

2680
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:27,400
Which is not good.
I see.

2681
02:33:27,430 --> 02:33:31,290
I'm hoping it does around five
to 600 make GSP fight again.

2682
02:33:31,430 --> 02:33:34,950
You need GSP back bring GSP. But he's
the last one. They get real good numbers.

2683
02:33:34,951 --> 02:33:36,450
He got eight 50 right?
I know,

2684
02:33:36,990 --> 02:33:41,250
but see I think this does around between
400 600 yeah. What do you think Jamie?

2685
02:33:41,251 --> 02:33:45,030
I hope so. Do you want me to wait face?
It's tough to tell these days, man.

2686
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:47,140
I think they need to get rid
of the pay per view model.

2687
02:33:47,141 --> 02:33:49,350
It's obviously not working.
What do you think they should do?

2688
02:33:49,710 --> 02:33:54,310
I think they should put these on a,
on for free. I think Jewish Poland,

2689
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:59,190
ESPN, these major fights. How
are you gonna pay people? Well,

2690
02:33:59,191 --> 02:34:03,360
the paper you model top four NBA guys
are getting more than the top 10 NFL

2691
02:34:03,361 --> 02:34:07,830
quarterbacks and those games are all
free. So there's one somewhere, right?

2692
02:34:07,950 --> 02:34:10,800
There's a model. That
model is not working. Yeah,

2693
02:34:10,801 --> 02:34:14,260
but NBA is way more popular than New York.
She was on the board,

2694
02:34:14,350 --> 02:34:18,130
but it's also free.
The sponsorship deals,

2695
02:34:18,131 --> 02:34:21,790
the endorsement deals or you know,
they have major endorsements. Right.

2696
02:34:21,791 --> 02:34:25,180
But there's only so many endorsements
that, and they'd get behind cage fighting.

2697
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:29,520
You know, it's such a crazy dates
in for bud light Miller lite.

2698
02:34:29,521 --> 02:34:33,520
Like we've had some big more now. Right?
Yeah. Roughly the same amount of people.

2699
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:37,290
Also like same amount of fighters. Same
on NBA players. About 500 yeah. Yeah,

2700
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:41,590
yeah. There's no comparison in terms
of overall viewership though. Like,

2701
02:34:41,591 --> 02:34:46,310
what is a big basketball game? NBA
Finals. 35 million. Yeah, yeah,

2702
02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:50,650
yeah. 100 on it. Yeah. I'm
just salient view models.

2703
02:34:50,651 --> 02:34:53,740
So old school,
especially now with the illegal streaming,

2704
02:34:53,810 --> 02:34:57,310
me and Jamie were talking about
it. You know, if I'm not that guy,

2705
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:59,410
cause I find I'm not trying
to steal money from UFC,

2706
02:34:59,411 --> 02:35:02,220
but there's a link I can go
to every time that's in HD.

2707
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:04,630
I don't have to be a fucking
dime for really everyone.

2708
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:06,430
So many of my friends do that.

2709
02:35:06,510 --> 02:35:10,600
I have so many people so they're going
to jail when uncle fester finds out.

2710
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:13,900
So when the numbers are low,
you've got to take that in consideration.

2711
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:18,790
18 to 36 males can figure it the
fuck out there. Not like $70 no.

2712
02:35:19,890 --> 02:35:24,010
I wonder, I wonder if you just had it
free if the numbers would be bumped.

2713
02:35:24,350 --> 02:35:25,960
I don't know man.
It's like you're going to make it.

2714
02:35:25,961 --> 02:35:29,020
You've got to make a big fucking risk to
do that because you've got to think of

2715
02:35:29,021 --> 02:35:33,280
how much money the U of c has to pay
every month to make that loan to make that

2716
02:35:33,281 --> 02:35:35,980
monthly nut that's on them. That's
not the fans prompt. That's true.

2717
02:35:35,981 --> 02:35:39,890
The other problem is think I'll expensive.
It'd be an MMA fan these days, so I'm,

2718
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:44,140
I got to fork out money for ESPN plus
now just to watch how much does that,

2719
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:47,930
was it nine 99 you could call it low
and five bucks a month. That's like,

2720
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:52,000
I think it's 10 okay. Okay. Nine 99 so you
got that right. What does that go live?

2721
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:56,920
Because fipass is still 2019 January,
so I've got to pay for that.

2722
02:35:57,070 --> 02:36:00,790
So that's money, additional money and
then paper views, there's one every month.

2723
02:36:00,791 --> 02:36:04,720
So if I want that, that's 70 so it's
$80 a month just to be a UFC fan.

2724
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:08,980
Not following. Watch dies on, dies
on, dies on Bella tour. I got to pay.

2725
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:11,980
How much is that going to be?
Nine 99 to watch the Bella Tor now,

2726
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:15,760
is that what it is?
Let's say it's nine 99 less than that.

2727
02:36:15,761 --> 02:36:17,830
I'm assuming something's wrong
with the streaming service.

2728
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:22,000
So if they just had a free streaming
service and then you had ads,

2729
02:36:22,150 --> 02:36:25,240
do you think they could make it up?
I'm sure what,

2730
02:36:25,610 --> 02:36:29,800
but my point is it's going to expense
would be an MMA fan and you're losing fans

2731
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,940
and the numbers aren't declined.
So often there's a business model problem.

2732
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:38,830
What if they made a deal with Netflix?
They tried that and no Netflix, Amazon.

2733
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:39,940
Those guys didn't want to play a game.

2734
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,610
They went and your audience isn't
big enough. Really? No, they went,

2735
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:45,940
we'll Twitter will use the NBA.
We're going to the NFL route.

2736
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:49,660
Cause the the other sports
too big. Hmm. Twitter.

2737
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:52,930
What are they showed it on Twitter.
Can you get Twitter on your TV?

2738
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:57,850
You could send, if you have it on
your phone, you could almost it. Yeah.

2739
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:59,470
You can just send it to
the screen. Yeah. Yeah.

2740
02:36:59,471 --> 02:37:01,420
What is your phone runs out of
batteries in the middle of the fight?

2741
02:37:01,421 --> 02:37:04,830
Your friends call you pussy. We'll
plug it in. It's out linking.

2742
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:07,490
It's up playing off your phone
directly. Now when you do it, I'm,

2743
02:37:07,570 --> 02:37:11,800
I do it through apple TV, but you could
do it through Google. Android, right.

2744
02:37:11,801 --> 02:37:15,300
You can do like Google play. You have
like a stick that sticks in the USB show?

2745
02:37:15,330 --> 02:37:18,440
Yeah, there's a little symbol.
Um, interesting. Sean up there.

2746
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:21,850
I mean down all used to be science
fiction just a little while ago, but I,

2747
02:37:21,851 --> 02:37:24,980
I see shit on my like, uh, someone
sends me a youtube video to watch.

2748
02:37:25,010 --> 02:37:27,200
If I'm home watching
something on apple TV,

2749
02:37:27,201 --> 02:37:31,910
I'll just stream it right to the TV
set. That's amazing. Is that us? Oh,

2750
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:32,893
well,
uh,

2751
02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:36,920
there's a little symbol like on the top
by the bar just broadcast to a TV thing.

2752
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:41,810
It's just, I feel like UFC has
this old school model right now,

2753
02:37:41,811 --> 02:37:46,370
but with the UFC plus a ESPN plus it's
at least heading in the right direction.

2754
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:49,820
But the paper, your model, especially as
expensive as is to be a fan right now,

2755
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:50,840
they're making it tough.

2756
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:54,110
I think it's going to come a time where
you're not going to need any streaming

2757
02:37:54,111 --> 02:37:54,560
service.

2758
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:57,740
You just to be able to type of website
address into your television and it'll be

2759
02:37:57,741 --> 02:38:01,460
universal. Everybody will have that.
I think that's, that's real close.

2760
02:38:01,461 --> 02:38:03,270
Like a lot of people getting
rid of their cable. Yep.

2761
02:38:03,350 --> 02:38:07,430
Dish can't apparently young kids,
they never watched Katelyn ever. Yeah.

2762
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:11,370
I'm a dish fan, but most young kids
don't fucks with any of them. Yeah.

2763
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:14,540
Like what dish? What? That's
interesting, right? The only ass, Huh?

2764
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:18,410
The only thing it's good
for really is live events.

2765
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:20,030
That's everything else.

2766
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:25,010
Netflix is more popular than broadcast
cable and more in TV viewing.

2767
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:28,790
Hm. Hulu and Youtube
all, I think it's, wow.

2768
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:32,360
The thing I read said it's got more
viewers than all of those combined. Wow.

2769
02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:36,170
That's accurate. Broadcast
Cable, Hulu and Youtube.

2770
02:38:36,171 --> 02:38:40,220
Netflix has more than everything.
See if Netflix got the UFC,

2771
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:45,140
that would be crazy for the
UFC, for the UFC flakes. Like,

2772
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:49,550
dude on it. They could, you know what
if they just said, we have so much,

2773
02:38:49,610 --> 02:38:53,660
like how much is your not
billion? 4 billion. Um, okay.

2774
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:55,880
Gonna just write them the check.
We'll just buy it.

2775
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,730
It's like a pair of sneakers that you
never going to wear and fight every day.

2776
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:03,470
We don't give a fuck just there.
They could do it, man. I wonder.

2777
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:07,550
Yeah, that would be, but then how would
you figure out how people get paid?

2778
02:39:07,790 --> 02:39:10,220
You'd have to give numbers, right?
It would have to be in the contract,

2779
02:39:10,221 --> 02:39:12,660
because that's one thing about Netflix.
They don't want to give away the numbers.

2780
02:39:12,661 --> 02:39:16,130
So if you have a comedy special on Netflix
and you ask them, hey, how's it doing?

2781
02:39:16,430 --> 02:39:19,670
It's doing really well. Yeah, but
you're really happy. Yeah. But you know,

2782
02:39:19,671 --> 02:39:22,690
because like you, they go, you want
to do another? You're like, man,

2783
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:25,670
I must want it pretty well. Now if you
do a special on there and you're like,

2784
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,320
how are we doing? Like all right.
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, man. Yeah.

2785
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:33,250
Do you want to do another workout? We're
all set. It's probably didn't go well.

2786
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:37,430
You don't have exact numbers,
which I feel like is a little hairy.

2787
02:39:37,431 --> 02:39:41,840
A little dicey because you have no
negotiating power. Yeah, Super Dicey.

2788
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:44,720
Because if you're like, hold on, let's
say you for instance, you're like,

2789
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:48,940
hold up 100 million people, watch
this, I need more fucking money. Right?

2790
02:39:49,310 --> 02:39:52,760
Like to them is 5 million watching good
is 100 million. Where are we at here?

2791
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:56,210
No we negotiate.
That can't be right.

2792
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:59,850
Like they can't be good but it's
their business. They started it. It's,

2793
02:39:59,851 --> 02:40:02,060
that's the thing is like
you don't have to do it.

2794
02:40:02,061 --> 02:40:06,200
They're trying to do it on HBO and then
you get real numbers or you could do it

2795
02:40:06,201 --> 02:40:10,100
on showtime and you'd get real
numbers or I could do it on Amazon.

2796
02:40:10,101 --> 02:40:14,220
Jeff Bezos tells you to go fuck yourself.
Do you think you're at a disadvantage

2797
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:16,890
for your non Netflix these
days? Cause, cause here's,

2798
02:40:16,891 --> 02:40:19,140
here's my argument that I
had with Brian about things.

2799
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:23,610
Shoot special is net don't give up.
Netflix is the king man. And if your row,

2800
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:27,600
if you're, you, if your bill burr, if
you're Kevin Hart, if not Kevin Hart,

2801
02:40:27,601 --> 02:40:30,540
if you're fucking Chris Rock,
any of those guys, right?

2802
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:33,240
They're paying you mass amount of
money and they're promoting it.

2803
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:38,270
But if you get lost into that shuffle
because they have so much content now it

2804
02:40:38,581 --> 02:40:42,990
does pay off. I Dunno, you know,
I'm Gaffigan interestingly enough,

2805
02:40:42,991 --> 02:40:46,460
decided not to do it and he could do
it anywhere and he decided to do it on,

2806
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:49,800
on all platforms.
So he doesn't have it on Netflix,

2807
02:40:49,801 --> 02:40:51,540
but he has it on a bunch
of different things.

2808
02:40:51,541 --> 02:40:54,930
So you see where Gaffigan put his
specialist, but he did it on his own site.

2809
02:40:54,931 --> 02:40:58,800
Right. And released it very Louie CK
style. Yeah. I think um, he actually,

2810
02:40:58,801 --> 02:41:00,690
I think it's available on Amazon.

2811
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:02,550
I think it's available on a
bunch of different things.

2812
02:41:02,551 --> 02:41:04,740
He's so established though. Yeah, sure.

2813
02:41:04,741 --> 02:41:08,580
Dapkins that mother fucker people still
ask them to do is hot pockets. Yeah,

2814
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:11,910
that's a good point because I think that
they probably, no matter where he goes,

2815
02:41:11,911 --> 02:41:13,920
his fans are very loyal.
They'll go seek it out.

2816
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:16,860
He's one of the biggest in the world.
Yeah. But I'm saying if you're like,

2817
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,430
let's say you're a guy like Brian Cowen,

2818
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,520
like where are you gonna
get the most exposure?

2819
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:23,900
Honestly Youtube the most exposed free,

2820
02:41:23,901 --> 02:41:27,720
which is be release it for free for three,
but that's very expensive to do.

2821
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:29,730
He says Gaffigan's Nobel ape.

2822
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:33,690
Initially it will be released on multiple
pay TV and digital platforms including

2823
02:41:33,691 --> 02:41:36,720
Apple's iTunes, Amazon video at
t and t charter communications,

2824
02:41:36,721 --> 02:41:41,700
Comcast Cox Communication, direct TV,
Holla at Directv dish network. Oh Shit.

2825
02:41:41,820 --> 02:41:46,020
Google play. And Sony playstation
says war rise almost. Well,

2826
02:41:46,021 --> 02:41:47,910
Walmart has rooted thing.

2827
02:41:48,210 --> 02:41:53,010
Microsoft's Xbox and album version will
also be released on the same day in

2828
02:41:53,011 --> 02:41:57,240
digital and physical formats.
That Emma fucker.

2829
02:41:57,390 --> 02:42:02,090
Good Fan Sizzler,
a $5 download via the Louis C K now.

2830
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:07,350
Hm. Yeah. It's interesting. It's
interesting because I think that uh,

2831
02:42:07,380 --> 02:42:10,740
he could do it. So if he does it
and then it really works out well,

2832
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,800
maybe Kevin Hart might do that
too. They might say, listen,

2833
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:17,520
I could try it for 99 well, he can do
whatever he wants. He might be like, Hey,

2834
02:42:17,521 --> 02:42:21,060
I'm Kevin Hart. I could just have,
people are going to go watch my special.

2835
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:24,330
I just don't put someone can do that.
Yeah. There's a small hand, if you're,

2836
02:42:24,331 --> 02:42:28,320
if you're a smaller level comic,
let's say B list,

2837
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:31,500
you can't do that and make money. People
are going to see it. So maybe you get,

2838
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:34,590
you get money back when you go on
the road. It's like, Holy Shit,

2839
02:42:34,591 --> 02:42:37,800
that was great and it's free. So we got
on the road and in theaters now maybe.

2840
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:38,670
Well that's the thing.

2841
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:42,420
Do you know how many comics I've done
that and had a youtube video that became a

2842
02:42:42,421 --> 02:42:45,210
giant smash and then we're selling
out theaters. What does that girl,

2843
02:42:45,211 --> 02:42:47,670
Angela Johnson, you know
Angela Johnson? Yeah.

2844
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:51,240
She was on that TV shows at hilarious
bit about the Vietnamese girls doing her

2845
02:42:51,241 --> 02:42:55,830
nails. Yeah, that bit got on Youtube
and she was selling out crying Gel.

2846
02:42:55,960 --> 02:42:59,850
Yeah. Quit told jail. She's hilarious.
Very funny. Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

2847
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:03,170
She was selling out giant plays
to that extent and how that,

2848
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,030
Christina is similar to that,
but Chris Delea on snapchat,

2849
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:11,070
his videos were so funny. Yeah. It made
him insanely popular amongst other stuff,

2850
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,010
but that's one of the,

2851
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:14,100
you know, he had millions
of followers on there. Yeah.

2852
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:18,130
So you go into a city and he's a brilliant
comic and you know these one in the

2853
02:43:18,131 --> 02:43:22,690
biggest of the world now. He's so silly.
He's a unique kind of silly, so weird.

2854
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:26,260
Silly. You would hate us if you saw our
texts everyday about shoes and fashion.

2855
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:31,930
Easy Dad shoes came out. I'm like, dude,
I can get you want a peer? He's like, yes.

2856
02:43:32,130 --> 02:43:35,920
And what are Yeezy Dad's shoes?
Jamie, you're going to hit well.

2857
02:43:35,921 --> 02:43:40,480
You might like him. You like him more
than the three 50 booths. Sweat these boy,

2858
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:46,330
just sweat peas, boy, converse
with these balls. Dude,

2859
02:43:46,331 --> 02:43:49,450
I'm not so sterile. Red Suede. I
know I'm wearing these just for you.

2860
02:43:49,451 --> 02:43:52,200
When did you get those converse?
Send it to me. I would never,

2861
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:54,640
I was going to say there's no way
you in a story. He sent me those,

2862
02:43:54,641 --> 02:43:57,370
but I put on my saw where these mother
fuckers, those are fucking daisies.

2863
02:43:57,371 --> 02:43:59,530
Those things. Those are
usually easy. Gee, dad shoes.

2864
02:43:59,531 --> 02:44:03,250
And you liked those San Jose sharks
fan? I do not. It's like a shark. No.

2865
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:06,280
Let me just say this.
That was the first easy and I can,

2866
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:09,930
I can get them to coming out. But I went,
I'm going to pass on a pass on those,

2867
02:44:09,950 --> 02:44:12,070
you know you to go Chris, you
want these. And I went, Chris,

2868
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:15,760
these only good on small guys. He
goes, you're right, but I'm smaller.

2869
02:44:15,761 --> 02:44:18,910
I go with the right outfit in small
genes can wear mills. You're right Brent.

2870
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:21,330
We're going back and forth and
you're series shot or serious.

2871
02:44:21,331 --> 02:44:24,420
I sent to Brian went fuck you.
Ah,

2872
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:27,190
because Brian likes to wear those boots
to make him look like he's an Italian

2873
02:44:27,191 --> 02:44:29,650
painter. Correct. In
wishes. He is taller. Yeah.

2874
02:44:29,651 --> 02:44:33,520
He's got those boots with wooden heels
with leather soles that are really

2875
02:44:33,521 --> 02:44:35,800
slippery strand and they have
zippers on the side. So I'm like,

2876
02:44:35,801 --> 02:44:37,390
what the fuck are you wearing?

2877
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:40,030
You're supposed to wear these when
you were in Catholic school. Like why,

2878
02:44:40,031 --> 02:44:43,630
why are you wearing this as a grown
man is 51 years old. He's crazy.

2879
02:44:43,631 --> 02:44:46,780
He never had a period of time.
We dressed like his age. Never.

2880
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:49,810
He's like finally old as his dress.
Yes.

2881
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:52,240
Like he is now the age
she's supposed to be.

2882
02:44:52,290 --> 02:44:56,590
He like got older and fell into is
establish wardrobe. Not anymore, bro.

2883
02:44:56,680 --> 02:45:01,210
Oh my God. No fuck is happening. That's
not, why is he dressed like a skater?

2884
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:05,350
Wait a minute. Are those slides identical?
Him? Wait a minute. That's Brian. Dude.

2885
02:45:05,351 --> 02:45:09,430
That's fucking Brian's. Brian.
Count. Cool. Make that face bigger.

2886
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:13,570
Very blurry dude. What's Brian
Cowen? And that's three sizes.

2887
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:18,520
Here's leaving or those slides. Is
that black socks and slides. Oh my God.

2888
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:21,580
That's Brian Cowen for special.

2889
02:45:21,581 --> 02:45:24,910
He wants me to dress him and I'm going
to get Tom Special. Don't, don't, don't,

2890
02:45:24,911 --> 02:45:28,390
don't let him be himself pulled. No, he
dress for where you want to dress, bro.

2891
02:45:29,050 --> 02:45:33,430
That's what I told that it's him. It
is him. There he is. Where's that?

2892
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:38,260
Those are, those are black
socks and sandals or others. No,

2893
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:42,200
they're not. Those are, uh,
those are skate shoes too.

2894
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:45,490
Those wearing skate shoes.
Slow roll down those shoes.

2895
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:49,270
I was hoping that those were
black socks to Asian style.

2896
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:55,000
I thought they were black socks and slides
because they're so gross with a white

2897
02:45:55,001 --> 02:45:57,430
stripe goes over the top.
What are those slides?

2898
02:45:57,780 --> 02:46:00,730
Is that the property was black socks
type? Let's do it. Yeah, there you go.

2899
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:03,010
Is that everybody does
it? Yeah. Tight Move Joe.

2900
02:46:03,070 --> 02:46:05,590
You can do it with slides but you
can't do it with flip flops. Correct.

2901
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:08,920
Like slides and socks is okay? Correct.
Why do they have rules like that?

2902
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:12,140
It's the streets bro. Know
what it is. It's gross.

2903
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,600
If you liked that sock
in between your toe,

2904
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:19,810
would that bar with a flip flop like
master splint or some shit like a Ninja do

2905
02:46:20,700 --> 02:46:25,130
that. Remember those Ninja
shoes? I'm Adam as well.

2906
02:46:25,131 --> 02:46:29,210
They called tabbies or something like
that. Oh God. Oh that's hilarious.

2907
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:31,760
And everyone, dudes, you'd go,
Oh, where those kung fu shoes.

2908
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:34,780
Do you remember those Kung Fu shoes?
Did you,

2909
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:39,790
you didn't grow up in the east coast to
do now a lot of dudes in like the 1990s

2910
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:44,840
and certainly in the 80s would
wear where Kung Fu shoes.

2911
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:49,640
She just does whatever dress up. Like they
knew Kung Fu, my contents and parents,

2912
02:46:49,641 --> 02:46:53,180
those things. Oh, I bought you. Those
are Todd's, those are called pods.

2913
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:57,590
Those are Kung Fu shoes.
Sun dews would where Kung Fu,

2914
02:46:57,591 --> 02:47:00,550
like they knew Kung Fu because they had
those shoes on and be like, Damn Dude,

2915
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,020
I'm not mad. I was, oh shit.
Like those, those are different.

2916
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:05,120
Those are the lives of more fashionable.
Yeah.

2917
02:47:05,121 --> 02:47:07,040
That's like the first ones
you show or some bullshit.

2918
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:11,690
Somebody had a bit about it. About
dudes show, I think it was. Um,

2919
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:15,320
do you remember that guy
that had a bunch of fucking,

2920
02:47:16,250 --> 02:47:20,780
he had a bunch of bunch
of specials on Hbo.

2921
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:23,690
Robert Townsend. Remember
that? Remember Robert Townsend,

2922
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:27,500
remember he had a bunch of a HBO specials
where a bunch of different comedians

2923
02:47:27,501 --> 02:47:28,334
on.

2924
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:32,390
I feel like someone on one of those did
a bit of Kung Fu bit about dudes in the

2925
02:47:32,391 --> 02:47:35,720
ghetto who dressed up like
they were Kung Fu outfits.

2926
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:38,900
I'll tell you who I don't fucking
trust dudes that were aqua socks.

2927
02:47:39,560 --> 02:47:43,190
What do you mean by aqua socks?
Like blue socks? No Bro. Aqua socks.

2928
02:47:43,191 --> 02:47:46,780
Like if you went to waterworld
or like a waterpark, aqua socks,

2929
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:50,120
wearing them out in public,
do nothing drudged up fucking girl up.

2930
02:47:50,121 --> 02:47:54,770
Worse than Aqua.
A mood bring a fucking rare there.

2931
02:47:54,890 --> 02:47:57,290
You can still give him at
Walmart and shit. Who wears them?

2932
02:47:57,350 --> 02:48:00,250
My Dad wore them when I was a kid.
Those lawyers,

2933
02:48:00,350 --> 02:48:03,250
those you walk around with those
long. Yeah, I forget the waterpark.

2934
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:07,430
So you attraction. Okay, that makes sense.
But dudes where I am in real life. Yeah.

2935
02:48:07,530 --> 02:48:09,920
Hmm. Like some asshole. You
didn't want to be a superhero.

2936
02:48:10,250 --> 02:48:12,290
Maybe they're just ready
for water at all times.

2937
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:14,810
Like what is the purpose of those?

2938
02:48:14,811 --> 02:48:18,830
So you don't slip on the outside of the
pool yet? Cathol hot and shit. Okay.

2939
02:48:18,860 --> 02:48:20,720
To quit being a pussy.
How about that?

2940
02:48:21,170 --> 02:48:24,410
But those are like very similar to
like minimalist shoes. Those are cool.

2941
02:48:24,470 --> 02:48:28,370
So you bring up cool ones.
Fucking hold on. How was that?
Cause those are dope bro.

2942
02:48:28,371 --> 02:48:32,150
Like that. Well that's some shit you
would run in Sagwan. Yes, I would.

2943
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:34,660
I know that's what I'm saying.
I'm talking about the original aqua sock,

2944
02:48:34,661 --> 02:48:38,030
but it's different. See that one right
there that you just showed that last one.

2945
02:48:38,330 --> 02:48:41,990
The last one. The one above that. The one
that looks like a normal sneaker. Yeah.

2946
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:43,340
Like that. Like that. Yeah.

2947
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:47,660
That's dealt those look very similar
to the shit I wear when I run some TVs.

2948
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:51,380
I run the with those, uh, they,
they have like nothing to them.

2949
02:48:51,381 --> 02:48:54,170
They're still rolling with
those. Yeah. I love those dude.

2950
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:58,520
My feet are way stronger
because of running that way.
100% made a big difference.

2951
02:48:58,670 --> 02:49:02,060
It definitely made a difference. Yeah.
Because your feet have to work way harder.

2952
02:49:02,270 --> 02:49:05,390
It's not like a,
if you run in a pair of like,

2953
02:49:05,391 --> 02:49:10,391
I like to run in like speed cross
shoes cause they got a lot of traction.

2954
02:49:10,561 --> 02:49:11,640
You could run on anything.

2955
02:49:11,641 --> 02:49:15,870
You don't worry about where step and
you just dump on Shit but you don't,

2956
02:49:15,871 --> 02:49:19,080
you don't,
your foot doesn't have as much engagement.

2957
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:22,260
Like when there's no cushioning
at all and it's a thin layer,

2958
02:49:22,380 --> 02:49:25,320
your foot is like pushing
off and gripping some shit,

2959
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:28,920
but you can't just jump strengthens
your feet can't go fucking full. No,

2960
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:33,750
can't tie. No, I tried you little fuckers.
You get that plant. You got that planner.

2961
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:38,760
I did that. Plantar Fasciitis is no joke.
Simon, son, I'm back to cushy shoes.

2962
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:41,790
Yeah, easiest and shit. Oh, you like
those, but you don't run anymore, right?

2963
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:45,330
I need some. I need, I need to
inject some shit and in my leg.

2964
02:49:47,480 --> 02:49:50,190
Oh fucking, well, I'll
tell you in my leg, dude.

2965
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:52,610
I'm telling you they can do that now.
They're doing it.

2966
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:54,750
They're doing every homeboys
around here, right? Oh yes.

2967
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:56,540
They're doing all kinds of shit now on,

2968
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:58,500
you know what else we should do
with your shoes? Don't cover that.

2969
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:02,390
We should do it on air. We
should get a Nad drips. Yeah.

2970
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:06,360
Maybe they'll do it in here and do it.
It's supposed to be insanely painful.

2971
02:50:06,361 --> 02:50:08,670
If you do the push nav
where it's like 15 minutes.

2972
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:10,620
It'd be funny if we did a podcast.

2973
02:50:10,621 --> 02:50:13,560
It's supposed to make your guts wrench
like someone stomping on your stomach,

2974
02:50:13,890 --> 02:50:17,430
but if you get through it, you get through
it in 15 minutes versus eight hours.

2975
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:19,740
Hold up 15 slow dreads and what to do.

2976
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:25,160
It's supposed to be incredible
for anti aging. I'm down
for that. Yeah, 15 minutes.

2977
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:28,920
15 minutes of like just the
worst podcast of all time.

2978
02:50:28,921 --> 02:50:32,850
I think it'd be a fun podcast because
for the rest of the time he'd be fine.

2979
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:36,630
So like beforehand he'd be fine and
then for 15 minutes you'd be like, ah,

2980
02:50:36,650 --> 02:50:37,740
I shit my pants.

2981
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:42,390
And then to do that for 15 minutes and
then how happy will be after minute after

2982
02:50:42,391 --> 02:50:44,780
it's over. You feel great talent
and they're making fun of us. Yeah.

2983
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:48,220
Eating cheese and shit. No, you
can't eat cheese anyways says rise.

2984
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:52,320
This is too bad. What? He just horrible
psoriasis. He can't eat cheese. No.

2985
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,120
What's he eating?
He's on some weird diet.

2986
02:50:54,270 --> 02:50:58,380
Refused to take like the proper
medication. Which one of those guys? Huh?

2987
02:50:58,730 --> 02:51:01,260
Isn't it funny that he would make fun
of anti-vaxxers but he wouldn't take

2988
02:51:01,261 --> 02:51:04,830
medication? That's fucking crazy. He's
crazy. What medication does not take?

2989
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:06,360
Does it fuck with him or something?
No,

2990
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:09,870
he says that it solves it for a little
bit, but it's not complete problems.

2991
02:51:09,871 --> 02:51:13,230
My Diet. I'm like, dude,
whatever you're doing, just
use the goddamn ointment. Well,

2994
02:51:20,210 --> 02:51:22,710

psoriasis with a carnivore diet.

3001
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:48,000
He did that carnivore die. We'll all
