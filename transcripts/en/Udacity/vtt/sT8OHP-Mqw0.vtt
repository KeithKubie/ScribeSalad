00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.800
Okay, I want to walk you
through another example.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.510
This is a weight truck
app I built a while ago.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.210
And I notice that when I open
the menu on the left hand side,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.790
that it sticks and Janks.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.290
Watch.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.230
So now with the timeline open,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.120
I'm going to see if I can
find out what the cause is.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.470
The first thing I'm going to do
is refresh the page, just so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.510
that I know I've got a fresh start.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.550
Now what I'm going to do is, hit record.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.260
Come over here and
bring out the menu and stop recording.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.570
Immediately, I see that there
are three big spikes of yellow here.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.690
So, I'm going to select one of those and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.620
I realize that I am spending
a lot of time in JavaScript.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.460
Once you zoomed in,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.920
you can also get details of
what's going on in those frames.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.870
Let me start by dragging this up
a little bit more, so we can see it.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.250
You can see what it is,
how long it's been working,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.360
when it started and a little bit
more about how it's broken down.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.850
The time itself and any child records.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.560
Lastly, you find out where the task
was triggered In your code.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.820
The details will differ depending on
the kind of record you're looking at.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.360
For example, recalculates dial,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.360
tells you the number of elements
that were affected, as does layout.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.860
With layout, we see the tree size,
the scope, where it started and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.090
in this case,
we also see an additional warning.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.360
Which we'll talk about in a little bit.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.640
Lastly, we see where in
the code we triggered layout.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.410
In this case though,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.340
I would be most concerned about
these large yellow blocks.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.860
They seem to be what's causing me
to stop hitting 60 frames a second.
