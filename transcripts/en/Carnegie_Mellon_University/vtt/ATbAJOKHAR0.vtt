00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.252
I think at Carnegie Mellon we're
really looking at problems that

00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:06.580
matter to the world.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.960
We're looking at climate change, we're
looking at health insurance decisions,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.720
decision making among
teenagers about safe sex,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.730
we're looking at workplace discrimination.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.410
And we're looking at trying
to understand these issues.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.080
Why they happen, but
also really about how to change them.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.870
And I think that's really unique
about our group is that we're really

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.670
interested in change.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.370
Our brand of behavioral
economics is much more mixed.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.350
It's about 50% economics and
50% psychology.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950
And I think it's not just
that we have economists and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.920
we have psychologists, but the
psychologists know a lot of economics and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740
the economists know a lot of psychology.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.970
&gt;&gt; A lot of the work we do
begins with concrete problems,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.846
like the earned income tax credit,
how to increase savings.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:56.130
Our colleagues, Saurabh Bhargava,
just worked with a local bank to try

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.520
to encourage their employees to
take up their retirement benefit.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.630
The employees weren't taking
advantage of that and

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.220
they were losing out on
thousands of dollars.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.180
Saurabh found that if he
offered employees $10 to get on

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140
the site and sign up for
this benefit, they did it in droves.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.270
That's an example of behavioral economics,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.100
where thousands of dollars of benefits
can't compete with a $10 gift certificate.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.700
That's a good example of how
the details really matter.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.350
&gt;&gt; It's really the way in
such such incentives and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.020
policies are framed and
presented and communicated.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700
And that basic insight has
a potential to radically improve

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.556
the ability of policies to
lead to better outcomes.

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:46.270
&gt;&gt; There's a tremendous amount
of interaction between people.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.929
I've never seen a department that's
as interactive as our department.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.980
&gt;&gt; I'm around such bright people like
experts in organizational behavior,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.040
marketing, psychology, decision making.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.940
And every week we meet.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.680
Everybody comes there, we share ideas,
and I haven't seen that in other places.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.940
It's such an amazing experience,
the feedback from an audience that is so

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.220
diverse, this is truly amazing.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.585
&gt;&gt; Well a lot of our research does
use Carnegie Mellon undergraduates

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.055
as research participants,
it's nice to go out in the community and

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.643
get a different type of population.

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:23.505
&gt;&gt; I think we have the only mobile
lab that we can drive into different

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:27.536
neighborhoods, which is another example
of the uniqueness of our program.

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:32.964
&gt;&gt; Carnegie Mellon is really one of
the few institutions in the world

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:39.580
that has these intimate relationships
with government agencies at the local,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.391
state, and federal levels, through which
we can communicate these findings and

00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:52.830
directly reshape actual policies in
a way that is measurable and impactful.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.782
