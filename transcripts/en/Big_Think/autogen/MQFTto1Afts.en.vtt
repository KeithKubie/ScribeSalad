I think the question is are we

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
I think the question is are we
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.949
I think the question is are we
allocating our money correctly across

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959
allocating our money correctly across
 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.170

the question is are we really optimizing

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760
the question is are we really optimizing
 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.560
the question is are we really optimizing
on that so if you think about getting

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570
on that so if you think about getting
 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.920
on that so if you think about getting
lattice and getting cable which one of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
lattice and getting cable which one of
 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.240
lattice and getting cable which one of
those is actually giving you a great

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250
those is actually giving you a great
 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.190
those is actually giving you a great
greater happiness and if you had to cut

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200
greater happiness and if you had to cut
 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.050
greater happiness and if you had to cut
in one of those which one would you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060
in one of those which one would you
 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.490
in one of those which one would you
would you cut and so I think thinking in

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
would you cut and so I think thinking in
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.260
would you cut and so I think thinking in
terms of concrete in concrete terms

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
terms of concrete in concrete terms
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.390
terms of concrete in concrete terms
would would help us a great deal

cheaper plus all in the bytes you eat

but how much fun will eating be not very

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919
but how much fun will eating be not very
 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.640
but how much fun will eating be not very
fun right why because it turns out that

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650
fun right why because it turns out that
 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.519
fun right why because it turns out that
this simultaneity of eating and

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529
this simultaneity of eating and
 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.330
this simultaneity of eating and
consuming or enjoying and paying

consuming or enjoying and paying
 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.950
consuming or enjoying and paying
actually makes things less happy here's

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960
actually makes things less happy here's
 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.269
actually makes things less happy here's
another example imagine you go on a

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279
another example imagine you go on a
 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.519
another example imagine you go on a
cruise to Alaska and you can either pay

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529
cruise to Alaska and you can either pay
 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.129
cruise to Alaska and you can either pay
six months in advance or the moment you

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139
six months in advance or the moment you
 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.230
six months in advance or the moment you
get off the ship it's much more

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
get off the ship it's much more
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.240
get off the ship it's much more
reasonable economically to pay the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250
reasonable economically to pay the
 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.369
reasonable economically to pay the
moment you get off the ship but how much

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379
moment you get off the ship but how much
 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:58.809
moment you get off the ship but how much
would you enjoy the last day of the

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819
would you enjoy the last day of the
 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.459
would you enjoy the last day of the
cruise it will be kind of miserable

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469
cruise it will be kind of miserable
 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:01.899
cruise it will be kind of miserable
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay
 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.629
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay
all this money so what happened is that

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639
all this money so what happened is that
 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.550
all this money so what happened is that
this simultaneity is very important and

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560
this simultaneity is very important and
 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.649
this simultaneity is very important and
we can use it in two ways we can think

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659
we can use it in two ways we can think
 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.510
we can use it in two ways we can think
about how we reduce the pain of paying

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
about how we reduce the pain of paying
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.490
about how we reduce the pain of paying
so for example credit cards are

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500
so for example credit cards are
 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.469
so for example credit cards are
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain
 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.450
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain
of paying if you go to a restaurant and

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
of paying if you go to a restaurant and
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.670
of paying if you go to a restaurant and
you pay in cash you would feel much

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680
you pay in cash you would feel much
 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.230
you pay in cash you would feel much
worse than if you pay in a credit card

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240
worse than if you pay in a credit card
 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.059
worse than if you pay in a credit card
why you know the price there's not

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069
why you know the price there's not
 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.369
why you know the price there's not
surprised but if you frame cash you feel

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379
surprised but if you frame cash you feel
 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.079
surprised but if you frame cash you feel
a bit more guilt it's a bit more

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.089
a bit more guilt it's a bit more
 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.969
a bit more guilt it's a bit more
difficult it's kind of more painful to

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979
difficult it's kind of more painful to
 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.800
difficult it's kind of more painful to
part with your money with the credit

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810
part with your money with the credit
 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.700
part with your money with the credit
card adds another time so you can think

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710
card adds another time so you can think
 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.649
card adds another time so you can think
about this is good or bad if you want to

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659
about this is good or bad if you want to
 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.510
about this is good or bad if you want to
spend more money in restaurants use

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520
spend more money in restaurants use
 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.339
spend more money in restaurants use
credit cards more than cash if you want

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349
credit cards more than cash if you want
 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.629
credit cards more than cash if you want
to spend less use cash more than modern

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639
to spend less use cash more than modern
 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.510
to spend less use cash more than modern
credit cards but in general we can think

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520
credit cards but in general we can think
 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.339
credit cards but in general we can think
about how to use the pain of paying and

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349
about how to use the pain of paying and
 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.959
about how to use the pain of paying and
how much if we do we want and I think we

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969
how much if we do we want and I think we
 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.209
how much if we do we want and I think we
have like a range credit cards have very

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219
