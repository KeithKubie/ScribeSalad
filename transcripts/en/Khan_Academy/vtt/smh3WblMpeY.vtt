00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.930
- [Instructor] Though they
seem like an unusual way

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.830
to extinguish a fire, engineering students

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.610
are designing low frequency
sound wave devices

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.680
to put out flames.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.610
All right that was really strange

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.300
because they're saying though they seem

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.670
like an unusual way to extinguish a fire.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.260
So they're referring to they

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.060
as something that's an unusual way

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.320
to extinguish a fire.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.560
And then right after that
they say engineering students

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.340
so they're implying that
the engineering students

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.310
are the they.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.460
So let me put a little.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.550
The way the sentence is constructed

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.430
it makes it sound like
engineering students

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.620
are the they, that engineering students

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.720
are an unusual way to extinguish a fire

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.910
and that would be an unusual way indeed.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.320
But what they're really trying to say is

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.853
that low frequency sound wave devices,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.330
that low frequency sound wave devices

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.253
are the unusual way to extinguish a fire.

00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:54.460
So I would like the second
clause to start with

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.550
low frequency sound wave devices.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.450
So let's look at the choices.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.650
So I definitely don't like it as is.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.870
So though they seem like an unusual way

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.810
to extinguish a fire, engineering students

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.860
so they're doing that same thing again.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.660
Though they seem like an unusual way

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.760
to extinguish a fire, low
frequency sound wave devices,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.390
okay I'm liking this so far

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.540
because it's clear that the they

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.270
is referring to low
frequency sound wave devices

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.140
designed by engineering students

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.880
are being used to put out flames.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.800
So I'm liking this choice right over here.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.750
So let's look at this last one,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.240
though they seem like an unusual way

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.410
to extinguish a fire, flames are,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.150
and so this is implying
that flames is the they.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.320
And so you can just
replace they with flames

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.180
and see if that makes sense.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.370
Though flames seem like an unusual way

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.050
to extinguish a fire,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.740
once again that would be an unusual way.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.100
That's not even what they wanna say.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.070
They wanna say that the
low frequency sound waves,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.260
that's the they, so I
don't like this one either.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.023
So I'm definitely liking that choice.
