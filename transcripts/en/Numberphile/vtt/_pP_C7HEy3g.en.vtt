00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.980
Alex Bellos: So this is one of
Dudeney's famous puzzles,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.420
which, you know, still making money
to the carpenters of Greece,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.860
but there's another one which is probably
my preferred puzzle of his.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280
And I've given this puzzle
to loads of people.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.980
In fact, sometimes
I've given them to like, professors...

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.300
There's some really smart people,
and it's not totally obvious how to do it.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.660
And this is a Dudeney puzzle...

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.920
It's very very simple.
All you need is...

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.020
Six.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.540
One, two, three, four, five...

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.080
Six

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.780
coins.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.080
And, the idea is to get them
into the hexagon like that.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.960
That's what you're aiming to get...

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.440
And you must start from this.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.740
Okay?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.520
And the single rule is that
you can move something anywhere by sliding,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.420
so you can't pick it up,
just by sliding

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.660
anything you move you can only put somewhere
that touches two other coins.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.600
So, you couldn't move this to he-
to- we could-

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.840
to here.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.640
You couldn't do that because it's not moving to a p--
it's not touching two other coins.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
So this one here,
you can move it to there,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.280
you could move it to here,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.440
You could move it to here...
It just has to be touching two other coins.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.220
and what I want,
I want you to get from there to...

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.500
here, in three moves.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.320
You can do it in 4 or 5 moves pretty much straight away,
but to get it in three moves,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960
Does take a bit of thought,
does take a bit of thought.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.820
And, quite often you forget how to do it,
so you could be on another train journey

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.240
and get it out, and...

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.500
This puzzle here was really the beginning of...
There are lots of other in the genre of,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.780
you've got a certain amount of coins,
they're in one pattern,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.680
you've got to make another pattern,
and you can only do it by sliding it to a place

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.520
that's touching two others.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.180
What you don't want to do,
is lots of people start like this:

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.440
they think,
"Well, I can do this, but then this one's trapped."

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.960
Because you can't move that one out
because these two are doing it.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.440
So you- you've gotta-
And you can't take it up.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.560
So you can only do it by sliding,
and you're not allowed to move any others.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.860
So, the way that you would solve it,
if I could just remember how on earth I did it, is...

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.260
Yeah, you put-
No you don't...

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.560
[Chuckles]
This is hilarious.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.000
I haven't done this in a while, and I say the reason why I really enjoyed this puzzle is that you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140
You forget -- I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it, I'm gonna find it.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.820
Brady Haran: I know!

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.000
Alex: This is like stage fright this one goes here

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.960
this one goes here. And that one goes there.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.940
I just assumed people were doing this for

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.420
hundreds of years or that there was no kind of someone actually it had to go and invent it but

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.940
Like so many other puzzles this one was invented by a Henry Ernest Dudeney.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.500
most puzzles try and - well, most mathematical and logical puzzles try and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.849
express some mathematical ideal to give you some insight and there have been some puzzles that I have invented to try and

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.458
Express some mathematical idea which I've not seen before but what I also have done

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.209
Which is what every puzzle writer has been doing since the beginning is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.649
That you have to rewrite and adapt all the old puzzles for a new age

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.800
so

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.780
You know I think the interesting thing about puzzles is that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.220
we've been doing pretty much the same puzzles for last 2,000 years

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.660
And a good puzzle is something that that goes viral people want to share people want to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.520
Either ask how to do it or they want to see if the other person is as clever as you

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.800
And this is something that with the Internet has really shown that and I first started writing about puzzles when I realized how

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.839
viral they could go and as I researched it I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.359
Realized that every puzzle that I was reading from someone was actually a rewritten puzzle from someone else

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.060
And then you can kind of trace it back so being a journalists really by profession in the vein of

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.319
"Can you solve my problems?"

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.409
I try to sort of tell the history of how these things work, and it's a little bit like jokes so jokes

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.370
you know

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.909
It's not often that someone actually invents a whole new joke. Essentially what they're doing is they're retelling that joke.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.329
You know with the few new words in it, and the intonation is a bit different puzzles are exactly the same that they are

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.399
They're like a living thing and they can they carry on going and they get better in the retelling

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.009
Brady: Hi there everyone, thanks for watching do you have a coin to hand? If so,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.529
Why don't you toss it, if it comes up heads, click on the left for our coin playlist.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.349
And if it comes up tails, click on the right

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.274
That's an objectivity video about a whole box of puzzles featuring Matt Parker

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:50.399
so these are very much loose papers

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.190
[Oh!] exactly as they were presented to the Royal Society

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.000
So there's a lot of very miscellaneous material in here

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.300
Brady: if you haven't got a coin

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.900
Well just choose, I guess
