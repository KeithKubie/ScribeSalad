00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.570
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.330
Thank you for joining
today's program,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.360
discussion by there Washington area
authors, so-called "Bonsai Trio,"

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.710
[laughter] Ann McClellan,
Sandra Moore, and Stephen Voss.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.880
And I think everybody has
already gotten the book,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.290
but I don't see many
books on your hand.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.160
[Laughter] So for sale even after
the lecture, so please get it.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.210
If you haven't, no worries.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.800
My name is Mari Nakahara.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.330
I'm a curator for the
Architecture Design and Engineering

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.630
at the Library's Prints
and Photograph Division.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.370
I also serve as a coordinator
for today's program;

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.680
and this program is one of the 2017
National Cherry Blossom Festival,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.240 position:56%
co-hosted by the Library's Prints
and Photographs and Agent divisions.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.640 position:56%
Library has been participating in
the National Cherry Blossom Festival

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.310
from 2012, when we celebrated
the hundredth anniversary

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.400 position:56%
of the Cherry Blossom Tree Gift from
the city of Tokyo to Washington,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.200
D.C. And I decided to
continue hosting events

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.470
and programs coinciding with the
National Cherry Blossom Festival

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.470
every spring, even if the
scale is much smaller.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.920
This is my effort to pursue
one of the Library's goals

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.640 position:56%
of providing a general understanding
of American culture, intellectual

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.400
and social life, and of
other peoples and nations.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.110
I'm also hoping that these events
and programs will, in the future,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.310 position:56%
inspire greater interest in Japanese
culture, the US-Japan relationship,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.760
and also the Library's diverse
collections in the general public,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.470
including K through 12 students.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.070
We have a saying in Japan, "[Speaks
Japanese]," which means that,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.490
"Something will blossom
if we are persistent."

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.410
This is another reason that I
continue these events and programs.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.490
Here you will see on
the [inaudible],

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.020
one of my favorite collections
related to cherry blossoms,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.110
"Eleven Varieties of the Cherry
Blossom Trees," sent from the city

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.570
of Tokyo to Washington, DC in 1912.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.180
These are facsimile copies,
but the originals are held

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.810
at the Library's Prints
and Photographs Division.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.950
Today, Stephen Voss is going
to donate six photographs

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.550
of bonsai trees, two of
which are shown here --

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.940
that's why I asked you
to move to the left side,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.840
as well as a photograph of our new
Library of Congress, Dr. Hayden.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.780
They will be added to the Prints
and Photographs collection.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.710
Thank you, Stephen.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.790
[Laughter] Many people
may think that Library

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.250 position:56%
of Congress collections are not open
to the public, which is not true.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.340
We welcome everybody if
they are 16 years or older,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.650
with [inaudible] readers card.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.500
The Library's Young Readers
Center is open to the public,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.410
but much younger generations, where
our children are able to read books

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.710 position:56%
like one by today's speaker, Sandra.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.540
[Laughter] They host reading
programs periodically.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.810
I host a Japanese Culture Day
there every spring as part

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.380
of the cherry blossom celebrations.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.610
What I introduce now is a little
bit of the tip of the iceberg

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.300
of the Library's collections
and activities.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.550
I would strongly recommend you
explore the Library's collections

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.950
via our website first,
and visit the Library.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.340
Ann McClellan is one of our
patrons who uses the Library

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.120
of Congress collection frequently.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.120
She will show a few Library
items in her presentation today.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.910
In 2014, she kindly
accepted our favor to talk

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.280
about her cherry blossom
book at the Library,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.820
which is also for sale today.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.770
Today she returns to speak
about 53 bonsai trees Japan gave

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.460
as a bicentennial gift to
the United States in 1976;

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.310
and will also moderate
the panel discussion.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.070
Well, I should stop now and
give the microphone to Ann.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.170
Thank you again for joining today,
and I hope you enjoy the program

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.050
and the lecture, and leave
here with a great inspiration.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.510
Thank you.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.880
[ Applause ]

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.180
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Thank you, Mari.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.590
It's really a pleasure
to be here, a thrill.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.150
And as Mari said, I have a
frequent flyer here at the Library

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.280 position:56%
of Congress, and it's wonderful to
be back and share what I've learned.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.880
What we'll do today is I'll give
an overview, because the book

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.330
that I wrote, "Bonsai and Penjing:
Ambassadors of Peace and Beauty,"

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.120
that's this one, is an overview
of the collection of bonsai

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.710
at the National Arboretum.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.710
And then Sandra Moore will talk
about one of the trees there.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.150
And then Stephen Voss will
talk about his experience

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
as a photographer of the bonsai.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.300 position:56%
And then I'll wrap it up talking
about some of the other collections,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.430
and then we'll go to
questions and answers.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.730
So without further
adieu, let's get started.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.180
And just to start things off,
here's an image from the Prints

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.680
and Photographs collection, which
I dearly love because this was --

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.010
it's a woodblock print from
1861, less than ten years

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.670
after Commodore Perry opened
Japan to trade with the West.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.460
And there is an American merchant
admiring a cherry blossom tree

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.050
that's in a bonsai
form, a small tree.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.300
So it's everything all in
one picture that I love.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.130 position:56%
And it's a foretelling, actually, of
the gift from Japan, first of all,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.050 position:56%
of the cherry blossom trees in 1912,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.330
and then the bicentennial
gift of bonsai in 1976.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.990
So before we get any
further, what is a bonsai?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.820
A bonsai, it can be -- the word
"bonsai" can apply to a small tree

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.780 position:56%
in a pot from anywhere in the world.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.990 position:56%
You could have a bonsai from Brazil.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.320 position:56%
The reason that the museum is called
the Museum of Bonsai and Penjing is

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.080
that there are Chinese versions.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.900
And the original examples
were from China.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.660
That's something -- an art form
that the Chinese have been pursuing

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.220
for 1,000 years, maybe more.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.820
And the word "pensai,"
"Penjing,", "bonsai,"

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.720
they all mean "tree in a pot."

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.630
So what happened was that --

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.840
so what it is, is the idea of
experiencing a tree small-sized.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.470 position:56%
If you think about it, in the world,
in nature, we're usually smaller

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.400
than the trees that we see.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.800
So there's not ever a point where
you can experience the whole thing

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.600
at one view; you have
to look up and down,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.440
or left and right, or something.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.900
But a bonsai, you can
get in one fell look.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.590
The other thing that it does
is it provides the illusion

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.320
of old, of ancient.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.280
And I chose this example because
I think it really shows that.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.190
It's a Japanese white pine, and it
comes from the island of Miyajima.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.730
And can't you just see
how it's sort of been --

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.680
it gives the illusion of
having been, you know,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.570
leaning into the winds off
the water, you know, for eons,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.500
with that thick trunk
and the chunky bark?

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.890
So in my mind, what this is,
it's a way of expressing --

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.320
of experiencing, you
know, almost a once upon

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.850
at time in the Western idea.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.300 position:56%
So it's a way of experiencing a time
before, and it gives you a bridge

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.040
to the world that's outside of
your daily concerns, that takes you

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.250
out of your -- you know, sort
of the daily grind, if you will.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.400
This tree has been in
training since 1879.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.790 position:56%
And what we mean by "in training"
is at some point, someone, a person,

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.680
chose that tree, took it either
from the wild, or from a nursery,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.550
set it aside, cut away
its top root so all

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.670
that was left are the feeder roots.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:46.310 position:56%
And from that that point on the tree
needs a person to take care of it

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.780
for the rest of its life.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.010
We'll all be talking about
this in our various talks,

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.570
but it's really one of the
great treasures about a bonsai

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.020
because these trees live
for hundreds of years,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.710 position:56%
and it means that there's a constant
sequence of people who take care

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.000
of them through that time.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.040 position:56%
When you think about it, this living
off its feeder roots is really

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.840
something, because a tree in
nature could have tens of feet --

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.690
hundreds of feet of area of roots.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.700
But in -- if you look at it, this
is reduced to just a small pot.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.200
And that's why it's so important
for humans to pay close attention

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.100
to the trees that they're caring
for when they're a bonsai.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.900
The great thing about
having the bonsai Museum

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.360
at the Arboretum is you
can find large versions

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.070
of the small trees right outside.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.930
And here's a Japanese white pine,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.820
really at the front door
the Museum at the Arboretum.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.230
You'll walk through an
alley of cryptomeria,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.620
which is just what you
would do if you were

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.910
in Japan visiting a
shrine or a temple.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.630
And it's, again, another way of
leaving the daily cares and worries

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.170
of your life outside, in this
case, you're leaving them

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.810
in the grounds of the Arboretum.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.750
You enter into the museum area.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.050
And it gives you a chance to
kind of reflect and, you know,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.240
lose yourself in the
beauty of the moment.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.070
The museum is set up in a Japanese
style to honor the gift of trees

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.630
in 1976; so that was
a choice they made.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.540
The entrance, as you can
see, is a Japanese --

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.470
well this is the inner
part of the museum.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.750
And like any museum, it's
set up in rooms and spaces,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.140
many of which don't
have roofs or ceilings,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.470
because these are living works
of art, and they need to have --

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.220
they need to experience sun, rain,
you know, snow to a certain extent.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.460
And most of the year, there
will be a tree on display,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.060
just as you can see this
gingko through the gate.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.740
And that means that there is a
tree that the person in charge,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.650
the curator or the bonsai master,
feels is particularly noteworthy.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.990
So when you go the museum,
which I hope you will,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.240
do check out the tree
that's on view there.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.490
So how all this started, as Mari
said, was with a gift from Japan

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:55.040
in 1976 to honor the
bicentennial of the United States.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.900
But actually it started in 1975
when this picture was taken,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.670 position:56%
when it shows the Japanese dignitary
handing the American ambassador

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.350
at the time, the paperwork
that made the gift official.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.670
And the reason it was a year in
advance is that the trees needed

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.770
to be in quarantine for a year.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.110
And so this was all
happening in Tokyo in Japan.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.630 position:56%
The tree on view is tree number one,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.370
and the reason it was tree number
one, it's a Japanese black pine,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.200
but they thought at the time that
it had been in training since 1776,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.000
which would make it the same
age as the United States.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.950
They found out later that it's only
been in training only since 1895.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.140
[Laughter] So it's -- but
it's still tree number one,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.450
even though it's not as
old as the United States.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.330
There were 53 trees, and 51
for each state, and then three

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.900
from the Imperial Household.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.220
When the emperor and his
family learned what was afoot,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.820
they wanted to be part of it.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.590
So there were 50 trees from
the government and three trees

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.510
from the Imperial Household,
and this is one of them.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.800
It's a Japanese red pine.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.000
And don't you love
that zigzag trunk?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.910
I think it's really extraordinary.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.210
It's one of a pair.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.170
The other one is in the
Imperial Household in Japan.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.990
It's been in training since 1795.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.290
It's huge.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.650
Bonsai can be as small as my thumb,
or more typically, about this big.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.610
But they can be also as --

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.360
this is almost as large
as I am, maybe larger.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.320
And of course, for
the Imperial Palace,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.560
which has big spaces,
you'd need bigger trees.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.810
But it's still smaller than if
you experienced a tree like this,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.360
particularly of that
age that -- in the wild.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.480
So here's a funny story
about that tree.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.520
The Emperor Hirohito and his wife
came to the United States in 1975.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.530
And the one thing the emperor
wanted to do was visit the tree.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.600
And of course, an itinerary
for an emperor is not going

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.250
to include enough time to
go out to suburban Maryland,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.240
which is where the
tree was in quarantine.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.140
So they had to find a way
to get the tree to him,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.200
and they had to find a way to do
it so that it wasn't going to be

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.560
around any other plant material.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.070
So of course, you know, getting it
into a truck is no problem, and,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.370
you know, getting the truck

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.530
to the White House was no
problem; but then what?

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.150
Well, somehow they found either a
back staircase, or some private way

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.050
to get the tree up to the
Ford's private residence.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.430
And that's where this picture
is taken with President

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.620
and Mrs. Ford meeting
with the emperor

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.730
and the empress with the tree.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.010
And I'd like to think that if
the -- if it was a White House --

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.530
if it was a Department of
Agriculture photographer,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.260
their tree would be more prominent.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.230
[Laughter] But anyway,
it's there, it's proof,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.670
and we know that it all happened.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:39.610
In 1975, the Japanese Suiseki
Society also gave this beautiful

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.910
viewing stone.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.100
And you'll find a collection of
viewing stones at the Museum.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.440
I bring it up just so if you go to
the Museum, you're not surprised.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.840 position:56%
But I also think they're
associated very closely with bonsai,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.180
because what these are, these are
rocks found in nature that, again,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.810
take a big idea and
show it in a small way.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.310
And there's this kind of magical
quality, for lack of a better word.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.800
In this case, the crystals in the
rock look like chrysanthemums,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.140
and the color of the rock
make it look like, you know,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.060
a full moon night in the fall.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.550 position:56%
And so if you think about it, if you
were going to have something like --

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.120
experience something like this in
the wild, a garden would be huge,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.910
much bigger than a rock, this big.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.090
And not only that, we're
looking at this picture in April,

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.540
and you wouldn't see chrysanthemums
blooming until October.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.900
So again, it's a way
to experience --

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.470
to take yourself out of your
daily life, you know, be expanded,

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.810
have a change, a transformation,
if you will,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.830
in your mind and in your heart.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.150
So back to Tokyo.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.250
The trees were put on view
for everyone to say goodbye

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.180
to before they came
to the United States.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.490
And here's one of the oldest tree
-- well the oldest tree, on view.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.740
And you can see the Japanese fellow
just in awe of how old it was

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.090
when he realized what it was.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.470
This took place in Ueno
Park, for those of you

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.150
who are familiar with Tokyo.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.670
And everyone knew that
this tree was very old,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.810
but no one knew its real story
until this gentleman turned

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.960
up at the Museum in 2001
and told an amazing story,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.470
which Sandy's book talks
about in more detail.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.510
So hold on, and she'll take over.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:33.440
[ Background Sounds ]

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.740
&gt;&gt; Sandra Moore: Good morning.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:41.510 position:56%
I'm the author of a book for
children that adults can also enjoy,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.620
but it's primarily a book for young
audiences called, "The Peace Tree

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.210
From Hiroshima: The Little
Bonsai with a Big Story."

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:55.680
And my connection to the
bonsai world really began

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.820
when I took a fall tour of
the Arboretum with a curator,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.200
then curator Jack Sustic.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.240
And I saw how delighted the
children were by the koi fish

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.770
in the reflecting pool,
and how charmed they were

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.980
by the small colorful bonsai
trees; this was in the fall.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:22.310
And oh as Ann was saying, you know,
what delights us and is, you know,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.870
informative to us about
seeing a bonsai is

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.310
that we can see the whole tree,
which we can't do in nature.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.120
But for children, it's
especially exciting to be bigger

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.480
than a tree, you know, after all.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.050
And most of the bonsai in the
Arboretum's collection could fit

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.370
on a child's school desk.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:47.510
So I had a feeling that there was
children's book magic in the air.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.530
[ Background Sounds ]

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.110
While I was impressed by the
incredible variety of bonsai

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.520
that masters from China
and North America had

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.450
in the Arboretum's collection, I
was really smitten by the trees

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:10.420
in the Japanese Pavilion, because
there were so many stories,

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.200
fascinating stories connected
to each of the trees.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.650
The two here are a gingko,
which you can see on the right,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.770
and then the trident maple on the
left, and they had been planted

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:29.280
and sculpted by bonsai masters
for well over a hundred years.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.510
The trident maple on the
right was a gift from a member

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:38.770
of the royal family and has
been in training since 1896.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.370
Although, the final stop on the
tour -- it was building up to this,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.950
was really the crown jewel
and the oldest resident

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.830
in the Arboretum, the Yamaki pine.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.880
The Yamaki pine is named after
the family that donated it.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.060
And this magnificent white pine is
actually quite large for a bonsai,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.320
with a wide and deeply-grooved
trunk.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.340
The curator was clearly
fond of it, Jack was,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.490
and delighted to share
its life story with us.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:23.140
First, he explained that the tree
had been in training since 1625.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.310
Wow. Most Americans, I
think, consider themselves

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.800
to have a green thumb
if they're able

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.980
to keep a potted plant alive
for three years, maybe?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:42.090 position:56%
But the idea of keeping a tree alive
for 350 years is just unheard of.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.800
But the Yamaki family
had that distinction.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.190
And it occurred to me -- oh let's
see, there's the -- this is the --

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.910
sorry, the plaque that's
underneath the white pine.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:02.040
And it is mostly referred to as the
Yamaki pine in honor of the family,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.310
but it's also sometimes
known by its name,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.360
part of the scientific
name "Miyagima."

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.820
It occurred to me that this tree
is amazing witness to history,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.780
from the days of samurai
and castles in Japan,

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.290
to the age of modern cell phones
in America, it's seen it all.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:31.800
The Yamaki pine was also cared for
by one family for five generations.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.150
And the illustrator of my book,
Kazumi Wilds, you can se here

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.810
in this illustration,
did a great job

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:44.320
of showing how the care-giving
was passed down from father to son

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.570
from the Edo period,
until in the 1970s.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.770
And the family would later provide
me with a genealogical chart

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.160
that had all the names
of their ancestors.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.150
So we could use names
like "Itaro" and "Yajiro,"

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.340
who are their ancestors
in our story.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.730
Perhaps the most amazing and
shocking thing that I learned

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:16.100
that day was that the Yamaki
pine was a Hiroshima survivor.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:23.050
The Yamaki pine, the bonsai, was on
the porch of Masaru Yamaki's house

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:27.400
in Hiroshima in 1945, and
survived the atomic bombing,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.850
though it was only two
miles from ground zero.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.010
This photo shows Mr.
Yamaki being interviewed,

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.940
probably by Japanese
radio reporters.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.800
He was well-known as a master
bonsai artist, and of course,

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.880 position:56%
after the stories that we're talking
about, the impact on families

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.420
and all the deaths, there were also
concerns about these special trees.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.620
This is Mr. Yamaki.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:03.400
And this is on the occasion of
his visit to the United States.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.880
All of the donors of the
bonsai were given a free trip

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.430
to the United States.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.270
Unfortunately, he had been ill.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:17.920
By 1979, three years after the
donation, he was able to come.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.270
And one of the things that moved me

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:26.370
about the story was how
devoted his family was to it,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.930
as if the tree were really
a member of their family.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:35.910
The curator told us one
anecdote that I'd like to share

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.820
that demonstrated the
strong connection

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.230
between the Japanese family
and this beloved tree.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:48.880
When Mr. Yamaki came to visit,
the story goes that he came

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.650
in a black limousine, and
he toured the collection.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.180
He was with hosts from
the Arboretum.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:02.930
But then he stopped in front of the
white pine, and his hosts noticed

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.540
that he had tears in his eyes.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.050
And of course, you know,
they were worried, you know,

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.200
"Is there something
we've done wrong?"

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.490
And the translator asked Mr.
Yamaki, "Is everything all right?"

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:23.130
And in just a moment's time, you
know, after pausing, he said,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.350
"Oh, yes, everything's fine.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.420
These are tears of
joy because I can see

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.370
that my tree is happy
here in its new home."

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.260
Phew. [Laughter] I share this
story with everyone I knew,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.360
and it never failed
to make an impression.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.160
And I think that was
really the moment

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:47.070
when I decided I was determined to
turn it into a story for children.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.900
First I knew I needed to be in
touch with the Yamaki family.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.470
And fortunately, I had a
friend Chisou [phonetic],

00:22:53.470 --> 00:23:00.810
who was a reporter at Reuters, and
she and a native Japanese speaker,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.870
she helped me translate my
letters to the Yamaki's.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.590
And, you know, I was asking them,
"May I tell your tree story?"

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:20.500 position:56%
In response, I received an e-mail
from Yasuo Yamaki, actually his son.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:26.490
And his son wrote me an e-mail, and
the e-mail said, "It is a delight

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.640
that the Yamaki pine
attracts public attention.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.210
I think my grandfather
must rejoice in heaven."

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:38.820
So of course, I put this note on
my bulletin board to motivate me

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.010
as I searched for a publisher

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:46.300
that would share my
enthusiasm for this tree story.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.040
In March of 2014, I received
word from an editor in Singapore

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.000
that Tuttle Publishing
would produce my book.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.050
I was, of course, delighted.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.600
And then the next thing, as
a children's book author,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.400
you are always really
anxious to find

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.660
out who they would choose
to illustrate your book.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.500
And I felt strongly,
and as did Tuttle,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.960
that we needed a Japanese
illustrator to ensure

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.360
that the book was culturally
sensitive and authentic.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.650
I wanted someone who
had been to the places

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:24.940 position:56%
that we would be writing about, that
had sensitivities about the war.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.830
And that person, fortunately for
me, turned out to be Kazumi Wilds.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.470
Kazumi had actually lived in
the States for a short time,

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.470
but she was living
in Japan at the time.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.480
And in a stroke of good luck,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.030
she was just beginning a graduate
program in the United States

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.610
in Iowa, and that meant that
she could come to Washington.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.100
So she came and stayed
with my family.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.000
And the first job was to
meet the tree, as she said,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.790
"I need to meet the tree."

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.370
And then she looked at photographs
in the Arboretum's archives,

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.310
and toured Washington, all
things that she needed to do,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.840
and things she needed to sketch
so that when she returned home --

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.840
or actually when she returned
back to Iowa, in this case,

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.410
she could begin the paintings

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.380
that would become the
book's illustrations.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.260
This is one of the
illustrations from the book as well

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:33.390
of Masaru Yamaki as he's
saying goodbye to Miyajima.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.910
I wanted the book to be about
reconciliation and peace.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:45.340 position:56%
And the significance of the Yamaki's
gift is that it demonstrates

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.220
that peace is really
built between people long

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.050 position:56%
after the peace treaties are signed.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.320
And answers the question
-- I wanted it

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.870
to answer a question I
sometimes ask children which is,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.930
"How do you make friends
with someone

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.750
after you have been enemies?"

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:12.900
Mr. Yamaki chose to make a
peace offering with not just one

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.930
of his very large collection
of bonsai trees, but, you know,

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.600
what his family said
was really his favorite,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.020
and the oldest in his collection.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:31.170
But given the tree's history,
we could not skirt the fact

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.340
that America and Japan
had been in a bitter war.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.480
And somehow, you know, I had
had to think about that a lot

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.530
when I was writing the text,
and then it became the challenge

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.230
for Kazumi, the illustrator,

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:52.570
how to portray the atomic
bombing in a book for children.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.350
As I'm sure, you know,
many of you are familiar,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.260 position:56%
there are so many images, many of
them that would be really disturbing

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.680
or frightening to a young audience,
so we had to be very careful.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.180
This, from the Library
of Congress's archives,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.770
is a photo that I'm sure you're
all familiar with of the dome

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.540
that survived, the "Peace Dome"
it's now often referred to,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.770
and it's part of the Hiroshima
Peace Memorial Museum.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:30.680
That actually is shown in
the very distance in one

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.870
of the illustrations of our book.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:39.640
Out of the 32 pages in the
book, just four are devoted

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.590
to the Hiroshima chapter
of the tree's life.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:51.690
And in this image, which is
difficult, but I think gentle

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.050
as we could be in a
book for children,

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.100
Kazumi shows Hiroshima
reduced to rubble.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.120
And she chose, you know,
two images in particular

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.360
that she thought children
would resonate with,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.470
which is there's a little
dog in the lower part

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.360 position:56%
of the illustration, and a tricycle.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.610
It's followed, the
next page in the story,

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.650
by a picture that shows
Masaru bowing in gratitude

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:28.280
because his family and their
beloved bonsai were spared.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.390
As the reviewer for the Kids Post,
The Washington Kids Post said,

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.230
"In her art, Wilds doesn't show the
horrible details of the bombing.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:44.670
Instead she uses darker colors
to set a sad, quiet tone,"

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.850
which you can see in this
illustration, "and brighter colors

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:54.950
to reveal hope as the
city recovers."

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.460
This beautiful illustration,
probably my favorite from the book,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.630
shows postwar Hiroshima,
and is full of hope

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.470
and spirit, and cosmos flowers.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.880
The painting sets the stage
for a much happier chapter

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.510
in the tree's life at
the National Arboretum.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.660
As our story comes to an
close, Mr. Yamaki arrives

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.440
at the Arboretum, as
he did in real life.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.470
But in our story, he is
accompanied by his grandson.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:36.720
We were pretty much slavishly
attached to the true story

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.430
in our book, which is, you
know, about 99% nonfiction.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:50.400
And but the one way in which we
change things is that we used --

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.420
he actually has a grandson
that's named "Akira,"

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.990
and that's the name
of the character here.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:04.820
And Akira now is in I think his
maybe late 20s, and he also --

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.300
and there was a photo in the
beginning that Ann showed you

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.820
of him visiting the Arboretum.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.040
But I wanted to have a
young character in the book,

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.830
so we have Akira coming with
his grandfather as a young boy.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.860
And as you can see in
this final illustration,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.970
he is giving his family's
tree a loving pat.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:33.580 position:56%
Our book was published seven decades
after the bombing of Hiroshima.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.790 position:56%
And I think it has special resonance
now because we're at a time

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.410
when reconciliation and peace

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.770
between our two countries
continues to deepen.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.720
This was evident when Barack Obama
became the first American president

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.540
to visit the Hiroshima
Peace Memorial.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:59.850
And like the gentleman who is
embraced by Obama in this photo,

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:08.520
the Yamaki pine is a Hiroshima
survivor, and has contributed

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.640 position:56%
in its own small way to the
process of reconciliation and peace.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.850
And when I share this book with
children, they seem to understand

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:23.250
and appreciate the significance
of the tree as a peace symbol.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:29.800 position:56%
And I'd like to turn the podium over
to Stephen, who found great peace

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:35.510
in photographing the bonsai.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:42.390
[ Background Sounds ]

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Voss: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.990
I am thrilled to be here.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.310
I want to thank everyone at the
Library of Congress and Mari

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.020
for all your help in
making this work.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.550
So my name is Stephen Voss.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.830
And I am a photographer here in DC,

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.960
and make my living mostly
shooting portraits of people,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.920
actually spending a lot of
time in this area with a lot

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.870
of politicians doing
that sort of work.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.950
And I've done this
work for a long time.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.530 position:56%
I have -- and, you know, I've always
sort of had a personal project

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.460
on the side, something I did when I
wasn't doing my professional work.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.610
And a couple years ago, I had just
finished this personal project

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.680 position:56%
where I had walked the entire border
of DC, the 40 or so miles sort

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.160
of meeting people, photographing
people and trying to, you know,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.710
understand my city in a way.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.310
And as I had finished that
up, I started to think

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.280
about what's the next
thing I wanted to do?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.220
And at the time I had
some frustrations

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.520
with my professional work.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.490
When you shoot portraits
of people, you know,

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.790
you want to make a connection.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.180
You want to do something
that, you know, it is --

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.730
get a response out
of them, you know,

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.740
have them reveal something
of themselves.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.540
And what you find in
Washington often is that,

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.840
you know, people are busy.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.840
So often, you know, you
schedule a time you're going

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.690
to photograph someone, you think
you're going to have 30 minutes,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.080
and then in one example -- and
this is the one I always come back

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.990
to is I had an appointment to
photograph Mikhail Gorbachev,

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.040
which I was very excited about,
I was looking forward to;

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.930
we got in there three hours
early, set everything up,

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:11.390
and then before I knew it, we
were being told that we were done.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.590
And I looked at it, I
had shot eight frames,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.720
and I had had all of
90 seconds with him.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.270
[Laughter] And so I was
-- this is frustrating.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.770
And so as I started to think about,

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.070
"What is the next thing
I want to do?

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.920
What's my personal project next,"
I thought of the bonsai museum.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.040
And I had known about this
collection for a long time.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.060
When I went to school
here, I used to visit it.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.720
I've had a few bonsai of my own,

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.850
which have all met their
untimely demise at my hands.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:40.290
And so I thought about
that question.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.050
I thought, "Let me go have a look.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.980
I'm not sure what's going to
happen, but let me go out there

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.990
and see what I can find."

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.800 position:56%
And so this first image from my book
is of the Japanese white pine that,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.150
you know, we've all
been talking about,

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.800
one of the most stunning
trees in the collection.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.880
And I encourage you
-- you know, the --

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.360
we're not that far from
the Arboretum here.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.080
It really is -- if you
haven't been there,

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.270
now is a really wonderful
time to go in the spring

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.540
when things are starting
to bloom and blossom.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.870
And so I would go to the
Arboretum on days I wasn't working,

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.830
wander around for a little bit,
and try to find a tree that,

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.640
you know, on that day spoke to me.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.650
And, you know, what these
trees gave me was time.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.950
You know, I could spend as
much time as I want with them.

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:26.630
I could appraise them
fully, stand before them,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.020
no constraints, no one walking out.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.490
And, you know, the bonsai seemed
like the opposites of the subjects

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:33.790
that I usually photographed.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.580
They stand before me fully
present, and, you know,

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.520
their sense of time is measured in
decades, even centuries, you know,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.590
not minutes, and I love that.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.260
So when I stand before these
trees, you know, I see the trees,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.880
but what I really started to see

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.150
after a while were the
people behind them.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.180
Ann and Sandy have alluded to this,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:57.120
but these trees not self-sufficient
once they become bonsai.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.180
You know, they need
care every single day.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.640
And you think about a bonsai
master who makes a tree

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.820
like this his or her life's work.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.000
They put everything into this tree,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.960
but knowing that at some point
this tree is going to outlive them;

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.480
it's going to be passed
onto someone else.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.300
And this work of art that they
have created is now going to be

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.600
in the hands of someone else.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.300
And I love that there's
something very hopeful

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.600
to me about that, you know.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.900
a belief in the future, a belief

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.880
that this tree will
continue to exist past you.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.670
And also I think there's
this great sense of empathy,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.030
of letting go of your work

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.530
and letting someone
else take control of it.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.630
And those are the things that,
you know, as you spend time

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.640
with these trees, I think these
things will reveal themselves

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.940
to you.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.750
And so these trees became
sort of this window into all

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.480
of that history, you know,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.670
a connection between
events a hundred years ago

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:46.890
and you standing right
in front of that tree.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.460
So what I was looking for was a
way in for each tree, you know,

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.970
a way to sort of understand
the tree, to photograph it

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.960
in a way that felt meaningful.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.750
Early on, I -- you know, as I
began photographing these trees

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.780
and going back and back, I had a
lot of doubts about this project.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.550
I had a lot of doubts about
the value of these photos.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:11.560
Part of me was concerned that this
was not so dissimilar to going

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.090
to a museum and taking a
photograph of a painting.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.240
Like, you know, it's kind of
like a fully-formed piece of art.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.770
Like what would I bring to it?

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.700
And that was, you know, just sort
of the things that I was churning

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.730
over in my head as I
began this project and,

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.940
you know, kept photographing them.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.150
And what I realized -- you
know, it took a long time,

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.810
but what I realized as I
stood before these trees is

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.190
that it was not my job
to document them, per se.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.300 position:56%
What really felt important to me was
to capture something of the spirit

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.340
of them, what it felt
like to be near them.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.910
And this sort of little bit of a
conversation you'd have with a tree

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.370
when you spend enough
time in front of it

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.160
where it would reveal something
to you, you'd kind of start

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.510
to see the sort of invisible hands
of the bonsai masters who worked

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.140
on it and all the little
decisions they made

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.270 position:56%
that made the tree what it is today.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.350 position:56%
And, you know, it's remarkable to
see -- when you go to the arboretum,

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.450
sometimes, you can see people
working on these trees.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.170
And they make these cuts,

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.470
these decisions the way they
wire the branches in anticipation

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.170
of something that might not
really happen for a year,

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.010
five years, even ten years.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.750
And I love that scale of time
to be thinking about things

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.840
in those terms, instead of sort
of the, you know, minute to minute

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.970
that we often live our lives.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.280
And so I kept going back to
the collection, you know,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.750
as the seasons change,
the leaves emerge.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.170
This was -- this crape myrtle,

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.730
I think this photo was taken
almost exactly two years ago.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.620
And just to go back to
one of my original places,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.700
now is a great time to visit.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.600
The leaves are just starting
to emerge on the trees,

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.350
and it's a really beautiful time

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.840
where you can still see
the underlying, you know,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.330
structure of the tree, but you can
also start to appreciate the color

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.030
and the growth that they
have at this time of year.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.250
So at this point, I had made about
a hundred trips to the Arboretum,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.570
and I've taken about 12,000 images.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.870
And at that point, you know,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.760
I realized that this personal
project maybe was something more

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.410
than just a personal project; maybe
something else could come of it.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.470
And I started -- you know,
I talked with colleagues,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.450
started editing these photos
down, and realized that, you know,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.340
maybe there was a book in this.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.860
And so I worked with the
designer and made this book.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.830
And, you know, when
I share this book,

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.900
it's a way of me sharing my
gratitude for this place,

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.990 position:56%
sharing my impression of this place,
and hopefully trying to pass on some

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.250
of the gift it gave
me to other people.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.050
And I think when you look at these,
you know, trees they kind of --

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.350
they speak their own language.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.750
You sort of -- I don't know, the
more time you spend with them,

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:42.430
the more you understand
where they're from.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:46.100
And so one of the really
great pleasures of this book,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.290
it's a book about 85 photos or so.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.360
And I was also able to go into
the archives of the Arboretum

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.160
of the Bonsai Museum and look and
see where these trees came from.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.180
And it's remarkable some of these
beautiful magnificent trees what

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.860
humble beginnings they had.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.190 position:56%
There's a, you know, blue atlas
cedar that I think was found growing

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.220
in a coffee can in
the back of a nursery.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.330
And it was bought for five dollars.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.490 position:56%
And another tree was found along the
side of a highway, and, you know,

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.340
someone, they pulled over, grabbed
it, and, you know, with the --

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.170
I think one of the gifts of a
bonsai master is to see potential,

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.670
you know, see that maybe
this isn't a bonsai tree now,

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.480
but maybe ten years,
20 years down the road,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.910
this is going to be
a magnificent tree.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.520
And so one thing I really
wanted to include in this book

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.960
in the back sort of as appendix
was a little bit about this tree

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.120 position:56%
that I photographed, about its past,
its history, and where it came from.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.630
So I went on this image;
this image was --

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.720
I chose as the cover of the book.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.240
And I love this image.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.320
It sort of kind of distills
to me like my favorite photos

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.170
of these trees are
somewhat abstract.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.970
The trees in some ways become
something else more than just,

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.310
you know, a tree, but they also --

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:05.860
you can sort of appreciate the
ancientness of these living things.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.150
And one thing that was
pointed out to me that I loved

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.640 position:56%
that I didn't realize at the time is
if you take the shape of this tree,

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.840
the curve of it, and you
overlay it on a map of Japan,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.830
it fits almost perfectly.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.760
[Laughter] And I thought
that was just a wonderful bit

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.420 position:56%
of serendipity that I love about it.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.720
And so in closing, I just --

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:28.160 position:56%
I want to share something that I had
written as a foreword to this book.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.790
And I wrote, "If I'm able
to share anything of my time

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.760
or on the bonsai, it is the
grace and the passage of time,

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.490
their peace, and the invitation
they extend to include one's self

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.540
in the natural order of things."

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.510
Thank you.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:47.680
[ Applause ]

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.070
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: So just
shifting gears just a little bit,

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.690
here we are back in 1972 when
Richard Nixon went to China.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.640
And as you can see in the photo,

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.360
there is a Penjing
in the background.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.450 position:56%
As I mentioned earlier, the practice
of Penjing, could also be called

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.480
"bonsai," had been practiced
in China for thousands

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.670
of years, a thousand years anyway.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.300 position:56%
And it was one of the art forms that
moved to Japan along with things

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.900
like calligraphy, the tea
ceremony, Zen Buddhism.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.140 position:56%
But it was continued to be practiced
in China throughout all that time.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.700
But then in more recent turbulent
history in the Chinese world,

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.910
most of the specimens were lost.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.810
So they are not examples of
hundreds of years old Penjing

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.930
in China the way there
are of bonsai in Japan.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:39.380
However, you can see that in 1972
when President Nixon when to China

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.800
and is toasting [inaudible],
they had a Penjing in the room.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.930
And I think that it -- who
knows where it came from;

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.410
it was obviously important to them.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.730
I think it was used in the same way
that we used flower arrangements

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.820
to adorn special occasions.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.330
And we know that Richard
Nixon was given three Penjing

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.630
when he left China.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.060
We don't know what happened to
them; they're no longer existing.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.390
But the whole idea of using them

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.230
as diplomatic gifts was
something the Chinese did,

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.170
as well as the Japanese.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.800
So the Chinese version of
bonsai is a little different;

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.510
it's a little looser, slightly
less geometric, a little less --

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.690
maybe in one word would
be "refined."

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.650
And the other thing is it's
a little more directive.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.150
As you can see in this picture,
it's a Pauper's tea tree,

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.520
and there's a little figure.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.490
That's a philosopher
scholar in the bottom.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.900
And so it's suggesting to you
to put yourself in the spot

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.550
of the philosopher scholar.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.110
Remember, the Japanese
ones we've seen

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.060
so far don't typically
have a figure,

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.240
so you can use your
imagination to interact

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.800
with the tree as you would like.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.610
But this one's a little
more directive.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:45.710
And I think a poem
from the 8th century

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.660
in China speaks to
it, so here it goes.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.980
It's from the Chinese
poet, Wang Wei.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.400
"I sit alone in a bamboo grove,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.190
strumming on my loot
while singing a song.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.070
In the deep forest, no
one knows I am here.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:02.890
Only the bright moon
comes to shine on me."

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:08.010
Don't you think that fits
with that picture; that tree?

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.000
This one there is no figure.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.810 position:56%
But again you get that looser style.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:17.250 position:56%
This was styled by Dr. Woo, who was
the donor who gave the original gift

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:22.970
of Chinese Penjing that makes
the Museum Bonsai in Penjing.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.460
He was a banker in Hong Kong.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.180
He had a fabulous collection,
several museums have examples

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.560
of it, but we do here too.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.000
And here's an interesting thing.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.910
This is an image from the Freer.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.200
And you can really see how the
two arts relate to each other.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.500
Isn't that amazing?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.910
You could just picture that
female figure easily transposed

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.770
onto the tree.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.770
So it's -- while there are
connections in Japanese art,

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:53.520
it's much stronger in Chinese
art to see this connection

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.610
between the two-dimensional
and the three-dimensional.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.310
This one is a huge tray,
was designed in 2004

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.060
by the then director of the
Shanghai Botanical Garden.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.430
And again, you get those
old, wizened, you know,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:09.840
gnarly-looking trees,
rocks, little figures.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.820
And here's an example.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.110
This happens to be on a fan,
but it's a scroll-type painting.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.360
And you can see the rocks, the
trees; there's a little house.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.020
But it's the same notion.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.080
Penjing doesn't have to have plant
material; it can be rocks only.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.390
Can't you just see that dragon
coming up from the Earth?

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.050
[Makes Sound] [Laughter]
But it also --

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.810
you have a dragon form
in plant material.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.010
Jack Sustic, the curator we've
all been talking about said this,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.230
"You'd only find this in a museum."

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:43.310
And I think what he means
is this is a lot of work.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.830
And at the museum, there are people
doing bonsai all day every day,

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.130
seven days a week.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.920
And to maintain this figure
requires that kind of constant,

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.220
constant care and clipping.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:59.390 position:56%
This was designed by Stanley Chin,
a Chinese American, who was renowned

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.270 position:56%
for doing really extraordinary works
of art, and this is a great example.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.210
This is perhaps the most famous
bonsai in the collection.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:09.730
It's actually from North American.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.540
It's designed by John Naka.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.970
It's called "Goshen," which
means "protector of the spirit."

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.400
These are Chinese junipers.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.130
And where you get the
illusion of age is

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:22.250
in the wild the trees are zapped
by lightning, which kills the tops,

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:26.180
and then the middle part of the
foliage continues to survive.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.150
There are 11 trees
in this forest grove,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.130
and one for each of
his grandchildren.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.340 position:56%
The wider ones are in the front, and
the narrower ones are in the rear.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.090
So it gives you the
illusion of great depth.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.470
So it's -- I've seen people
who just stand there, you know,

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.260
mesmerized by imagining
themselves in the middle

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.690
of this grove; it's
quite astonishing.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.350
Here is a picture of John Naka
with it, which I'm showing both

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:54.470
for scale, and also
please notice the foliage.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.920
The foliage in this case --
this photo might have been taken

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.190
at this time of year where there's
new growth, so it's kind of,

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.730
you know, a little bit
scruffy, or it could be

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.740
that that's how the bonsai master
in charge at the time preferred

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.570 position:56%
to see foliage; whereas this
picture, this bonsai master wants it

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.480
to be more firm, if
you will, more solid.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.650
There's nothing right or
wrong about either of these.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.560
That's just -- that's a
choice, and that's part

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.600
of what we've been talking about,
how these trees live for hundreds

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.260 position:56%
of years, so they can -- and they're
living works of art so they change.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.680
This is one of my personal
favorites.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.950
It's a ponderosa pine
designed by Dan Robinson,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:36.140
a Pacific Northwestern
American bonsai artist.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.920
It was a gift from the US
Forest Service to the arboretum

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.190
on the occasion of the Forest
Service's 75h anniversary.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.210
Now, what's -- there are
two things about this tree.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.780
First of all, this is the view
that the artist wants you to see.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.260
And every bonsai has a view that
the artists wants you to see.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.510
It's like, you know, Stephen taking
a photograph, that's the view.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.110
Sometimes there can be more views.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:07.140 position:56%
And in this case, the tree is, you
know, roundish, square-ish, biggish.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:10.560
And from 360 degrees,
there's something of interest.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.550 position:56%
So they frequently put it on
display in a place that you can walk

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.870
around and see all those views.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.470
So if you have a chance to see it,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.160
do do that because it
changes dramatically.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.460 position:56%
The other thing I love about this is

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.730
to me it expresses the Western,
I don't know, character.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.030
And I could just see it's almost

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.920
like a guy walking
into a bar, you know.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.530 position:56%
[Makes Sound] [Laughter] And in fact
I was just out at the Arboretum.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.060
The tree was on view and I
was asking how it was doing.

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.360
"Oh, that's tree's fine.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.910 position:56%
It takes everything we throw at it."

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.150
[Laughter] This one is a California
juniper designed by Harry Hirao,

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.040
who is another Japanese American.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.070
He and John Naka both were the
people who were among those

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:53.950
who were very strong and promoting
bonsai as a study for people

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.460
who are not Japanese and
here in the United States.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.270
Harry Hirao is no longer
with us, unfortunately,

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.990
but a lot of his work is at
the Huntington in Pasadena.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.080
What's unusual about this tree is
the bottom looks completely dead,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.380
doesn't it?

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.120
I mean, you can't even believe that
there's that foliage at the top.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.840
And the lifeline, I don't
know if you can see,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.880
but there's a little brown
line just on the edge,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.920
and that is where the water
and nutrients go from the base

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.180
to the foliage at the top.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.980
Now, this tree you can look at the
silhouette, and you can imagine it

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.190
from the rear, it would also
be interesting; you know,

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.620
turned around, it would
be interesting.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.990
But if you looked at
it from the side,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.260
it would be about as
interesting as a Fig Newton.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.770
That doesn't make it less beautiful
than the one I just showed you,

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:36.030
it's just this is just
a different approach.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:40.220
This tree is by Vaughn Banting from
Louisiana, and it's a bald Cyprus.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.330
It started out life as
a Christmas tree shape,

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.790
and over years he pruned it
and encouraged it to grow

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.940
so that it would look like
an ancient bald Cyprus

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:53.600
like the one photo on the right,
with no limbs on the lower part,

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.270
limbs reaching up to the light on
the top, and then it has a knee.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.570
Now, what are those knees for?

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.360
Well, if you think about, trees
breathe through their roots

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.290
in addition to their
leaves, if they have them.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.170
And if you're a bald Cyprus,
what are you going to do

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:08.180
if your feet are, you know,
up to your ankles in water?

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.850 position:56%
You lift up your knee and the air
can come through the roots that way.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.270
So that's what the roots are
about, and I think it's neat

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.480
that he put one into the bonsai.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.110
Here's that zigzag trunk again.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.980
This is a bougainvillea.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.760
And it proves that any tree with
a woody stem can be a bonsai.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.060
The other thing I'd like to
point out about this image is

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.030
that this shows clearly that the
bonsai master has put this tree

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.330
on formal display.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.570
And for formal display,
it's like putting someone

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:39.870
in their wedding clothes.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.630
You know, the trees clip to a never
do well [phonetic] and, you know,

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.490
there's no little stray
little, you know, twigs,

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.810
or dead pieces, or anything.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:52.240
The tipoff for when you see
a tree that's on a rocky slab

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.870
like this one, or if it's on a
raised tray, something like that,

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.010
that's the clue that this
is on formal display.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.850 position:56%
If you see the tree is just lined up
on a counter, or even on a pedestal,

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.850
but if they're not with
the rock slab or tray,

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:09.890
that shows they're just,
you know, there to be seen.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:14.840
Often also they will make sure that
the moss is especially beautiful

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.970 position:56%
for a tree that's on formal display.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.460
So when you see a tree like that,

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.410
pay attention because that
means the bonsai master feels

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.780
that this tree is in tiptop
shape, it's one of those minutes

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.200
in its long, long life
when it's, you know,

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.200
worthy of your close
attention, and he hopes that --

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.110
he or she hopes that
you will take a look.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.480
So thank you very much
for coming today.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.810
We'd love to answer any questions.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.740
And we hope you've enjoyed this,
you know, sort of round the world

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.590
and from three different
people [laughter] in the world

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.240
of bonsai here in Washington.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.040
Thank you.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:51.290
[ Applause ]

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.590
Any questions?

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.580
Oh, surely someone has a question.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.880
[Laughter] No?

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.720
&gt;&gt; I'd just like to mention --

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.020
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.930
&gt;&gt; That the festival is
coming up at the museum.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.550
And I think Stephen
was there last year.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.300
Do you know the dates
this year, May 14th, 15th?

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.710
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: It's
Saturday, May 14th or 15th.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.400
But yes it is coming right,
and we'll all be there.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.700
&gt;&gt; Right; we're open on Sunday.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.040
&gt;&gt; The arboretum is very close.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.340
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Right.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.640
&gt;&gt; Yes. [Laughter]

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.940
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Right.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.240
We'll be there, and lots
of other people doing lots

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.540
of other things too.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.140
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.440
Thank you.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.740
Anybody else?

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.040
Yes.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.980
&gt;&gt; That was certainly fascinating.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.730
Thank you very much.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.310 position:56%
I was wondering if you could say
something about the training process

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.860
and particularly how
the shapes are created.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.110
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes; the question
is how are the shapes created?

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.310
And actually there are
several different ways.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:57.300
Sometimes -- most often
today they use wire.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.250 position:56%
They trim and then they help the
new growth by using wire to shape it

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.110
in the way that they want it to go.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.470
Do you remember that wonderful
tree that Stephen showed you

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.140
where it looks like all the
limbs are going back that way?

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.060
Well, actually how that started,
it was a Stanley Chin creation.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.580
And when Jack Sustic got it, it
had that wonderful curving trunk,

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.650
remember that, but all
the limbs were like this,

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.230
so they're like a little triangle.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:25.050
And Jack thought, "How could
I make this more interesting?

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.000
I can make the limbs go this way."

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.080
And he did it by wiring them
so that they'd all go that way.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.940
And you get that breathtaking
effect.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.530
The other thing to do
is what's called "clip

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.620
and grow" that's more
typically used by the Chinese

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.200
so that the trees are
trimmed, as opposed to wired.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.860
And the way I think about penjing

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.890
versus bonsai is it's
like calligraphy.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.540
You know, if you have block
print, you can read the sentence,

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.450
but if you have it in copper plate,
you can also read the sentence.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.770
So it's -- you know, they're not --

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.780
they're in the same
bracket that way,

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.260
just sort of different
ways of treating it.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.380
And it's similarly with
the training, you know,

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.750
they use the wires in Japan and
here in the States, but then clip

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.050
and grow is more typical in China.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.350
Thank you for your question.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.650
Anybody else?

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:09.950
Yes? Yes.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.250
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.550
Thank you.

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:15.900
&gt;&gt; Well, my question, which
is related to this one.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.200
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.730
&gt;&gt; What kind of fertilizer
or, you know, mulch,

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:23.850
or nutrition [inaudible]?

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:25.150
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: That's
a good question.

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:29.520
The question is what kind of mulch
or fertilizer is typically used?

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.460
And the answer is it
depends on the tree.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.770
I just asked that the other
day when I was out there,

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:37.410
because when you see them, some of
them have what looks like teabags

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.180
on their bases, other ones have
pellets, others have nothing.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.660
And so they use particular
planting material for some trees

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.250
that is enough nutrients
for the tree.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:53.320
Others need different supplements.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.670
And so it really depends
on the type of tree,

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.550
and makes all the difference
actually.

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.910
Because when you think about it,
if you have just this much space

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:06.820 position:56%
to get all your nutrients as opposed
to acres, it's really essential

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.330
that you get the right mix.

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.570
So it varies from variety
to variety.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:12.800
Great question; yes, thank you.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.660
&gt;&gt; Yes. I can just add to that
that it's very interesting,

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:20.370
one of the bonsai masters
that was responsible

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:30.850
for getting the Brooklyn Botanical
Gardens their first bonsai tree

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:39.640
in the 1950s, he has actually
regularly talked to his trees;

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.670
like that was part of the care.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:46.380
And when you read about bonsai
masters, that's one of the things

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.080
that you find out that, you
know, some of them, you know,

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.580
it's much more of a -- they feel

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.970
like they really do have a
relationship with the tree.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:02.470
And I think the quote that I
saw in his obituary was he said,

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:05.360
"If you listen carefully
to the tree,

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.590
it will tell you what it needs."

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:08.890
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Aw.

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.060
&gt;&gt; Now, so I'm not sure that the
tree would tell you, you know,

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.750
what kind of, you know, fertilizer,
exactly, [laughter] but certainly

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:17.900
if it needs more light,
or if it needs more sun,

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.810
you know, that might be something.

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.110
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Right.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:22.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.710
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Okay, thank you.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:25.010
Yes.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.660
&gt;&gt; Well, hearing that I would like
to ask Stephen, you felt that kind

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.820 position:56%
of conversation where you are trying

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.810
to capture the picture
of the bonsai?

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Voss: Yes;
I definitely felt

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:36.410
like I had conversations
with the trees.

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:40.510 position:56%
And I think, you know, this book and
these photos are sort of in praise

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.970
of like taking time, like spending
a lot of time with one tree,

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:47.050
standing before it and
having that give and take.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:50.690
And, you know, I would often go to
the Arboretum and be unsuccessful,

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:53.120
you know, and photograph a tree
and it just would not work out,

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.210
and that would be a
failed conversation.

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.250
[Laughs] So, you know, my hope was
with each tree to have that sort

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.370
of point where I feel like I
understood this tree in a way

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.150
and I can make a photo to
express that understanding.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.310
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Please; yes.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.600
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.330
Thank you.

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:18.280
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:34.520
So all [inaudible] that you
showed us screens by the --

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:46.100
care by professional bonsai
artists, or how you call "curator."

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.400
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.580
&gt;&gt; Are there people
doing this as a hobby?

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.590 position:56%
It sounds like it's a really, really
huge serious commitment every day.

00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:01.120
And given the current society,
the time it took always busy,

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.570
and you don't really feel
like [inaudible] every day

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:08.040
for a long time to take
care of this bonsai?

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.440
If I want to do it as a
hobby, is it possible,

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.740 position:56%
and is there any way to [inaudible]?

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.040
[Laughter]

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.290
&gt;&gt; Well, okay, I think
the question is --

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:19.590
but thank you, yes
it is a commitment

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:21.490
on the part of the curators.

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:23.970
Yes; there are lots of
hobbyists who do practice it.

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:28.090
There's the Potomac
Bonsai Association.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.090
And yes most of the
people are older,

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.380
because they are the
people who have time.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.180
But then there are younger
people who get into it

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.650
because it's extremely rewarding.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.580
You know, you're creating
a living work of art,

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:49.810
and it's got the challenge,
the beauty of nature, you know,

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:55.130
it's a wonderful way to be
expressing your creativity.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:01.920
And those people tend to have
assistance or someone, you know,

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:08.050
friends who can -- like a
group of people who will do it.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.610
But you're right, I think
especially in Japan, I believe,

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:20.150 position:56%
that it's not as popular as it used
to be, because people are busy, and,

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:22.740
you know, there's a
space issue, because,

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.990
you know, they need to be outside.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.530
They can't just -- it's
not like, you know,

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:31.270
a house plant that can be
just stuck in a window.

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:35.420
And, you know, some of them,
a tropical bonsai could live

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.750 position:56%
in a window, but most of them prefer

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.470
to be outside because
[overlapping] --

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:44.540
&gt;&gt; At World Bonsai Day, which
you were mentioning earlier,

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:49.480
which is coming up in
May at the Arboretum,

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.990
there are people there selling
bonsai, and many hobbyists there,

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:56.170 position:56%
I think, who are, you know, excited
to -- you can hear people, you know,

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:01.900
sort of trading stories about, you
know, their experience, you know,

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.200
learning to raise bonsai.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.850
And I think a number of the
nurseries in the area have someone

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.610
on staff who is more,
you know, experienced,

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:15.430
who can sort of give
you some guidance.

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:19.610
I know I have a bonsai tree, and
there's a Korean bonsai master,

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:21.550
Du Kee Hong [phonetic], who is

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.260
with Behnke's Nursery,
you know, for a while.

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:33.180
And so, you know, I would ask him
for advice if I was worried of,

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.080
you know, am I doing
the right thing?

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.260
But the -- you know, at the World
Bonsai Day, that's a good time

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:47.320
to come, because you can learn
about it if you were interested

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.900
in it as a hobby, you know?

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.880
&gt;&gt; May I respond to that, please.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.790
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes, of course.

00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:56.140
&gt;&gt; I'm a member of two
of the local clubs.

00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.440
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Great.

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.740
&gt;&gt; Most of the members are retired.

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.950
However, there are some
young people who are joining.

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.810 position:56%
For instance, the Northern Virginia
Bonsai Society there are 50 members,

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.110
and is growing.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.410 position:56%
[Laughs] The other club at Brookside
-- and they both have websites.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.710
The Brookside Club has
-- it's a smaller group.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.010
But we each gather at each
meeting and usually once a month,

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.310
and sometimes twice a month
and we help one another.

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:12.610
The more experienced and wonderful
curators of the Bonsai Museum

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:13.910 position:56%
to use its member of Brookside Club.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.210
And so his expertise
is always available,

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.510
and there are two fantastic experts
on the Northern Virginia club,

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:17.810
who are constantly
helping the junior members.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.110
And we [inaudible] our trees.

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.410
We work on them, we wire them,
we [inaudible], we prune.

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:21.710
And we have other experts
come in who speak

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.010
and perhaps demonstrate
at the same time.

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.310
So we're constantly learning.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.610

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.510
&gt;&gt; Looks like it's almost
like a therapeutic process.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.110
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: I
think so; I think so.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:33.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:34.710
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: I mean,
it's all encompassing really.

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.010
&gt;&gt; It takes you out into
nature even at your own home

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.630
when you're working on a tree.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.530
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: That's a -- I'm
going to repeat that for the video,

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.010
it takes you out into
nature even when you're

01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:43.400
in your own home, so yes.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.960
&gt;&gt; Yes; even if you
have a little patio.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.070

you have a little patio.

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.370

And yes, in the back?

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:50.970

big some of them were.

&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Yes.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And my -- you mentioned
repotting, and that was my question.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.100
How often how do you
have to repot them?

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.400
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Well -

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.220
&gt;&gt; Can you keep them
small, you know --

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.120
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Well, they
-- repotting doesn't mean --

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.810
it's not like a house plant that
you repot into something larger.

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:09.580
It goes back into either the
same pot, or if the curator

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.600
or bonsai master wants
to change the pot,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.610
it's not going to be
to a bigger one.

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.660
So what happens is that
the tree gets removed.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.790
And if -- you know, honestly for
that big imperial pon [phonetic],

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:23.120
that requires, you know,
slings of -- and a big --

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.010
you know, a good contraption to
lift up and take the pot away,

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.170
then they scrap away the excess
earth, they cut away a lot

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:36.200
of those feeder roots so that new
ones will grow, and replace it

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.580
with fresh potting material
that's specific to that tree.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:47.430
And really, you know, it's
reduced I think almost by a third.

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.920
It depends on the tree.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.990 position:56%
But it's very -- it's very important
-- it's important to do it right,

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.160
and it's important to do
it when you're supposed to,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.460
which varies from tree to tree.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.540
I think the imperial pon
it's every, you know,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.190
five years or something like that.

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:04.040
Some of the smaller trees
it might be more often.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.070
But it depends on the variety
and how quickly their roots grow.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:10.330
But if you're living -- I'm
talking as if I'm a tree,

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.940
if you're living just, you
know, on those feeder roots,

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.280
you need lots of fresh ones.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.090
So that's, you know, why it has to
be repotted fairly often; you know,

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.390
more often, then you probably have

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.560
to do a houseplant
typically, I would think.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.990
Yes. Well, these have
been questions.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:27.290
Thank you very much.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.590
Thank you, Mari, and --

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.890
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank you.

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:31.190
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Okay.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:32.490
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: I
want to wrap up quickly.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.790
We have great resources.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.870
We don't have any technical
material resources at the Library,

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:41.500
but I have experience to receive
a couple of the bonsai creations,

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.950
especially for the [inaudible] that
researchers continue to contact me

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.660
like for two years to
ask about [inaudible].

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.960
So I did some research.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.460
But, you know, we also have a
Prints and Photographs division,

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.690
collections -- have other
collections in the Library.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:56.810 position:56%
So if you keep interested, you know,

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:58.770
please come back and
do some research.

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:03.510 position:56%
And please join me in applauding
the three speakers, bonsai curators.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.020
[Laughter] So you thank
you very much [inaudible].

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.400
&gt;&gt; Ann McClellan: Thank you.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.930
Thank you.

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:14.870
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
