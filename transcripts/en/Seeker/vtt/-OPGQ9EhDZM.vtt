00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.799
Architects are constructing wooden skyscrapers
and transforming high rises into living gardens.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.570
And these designs...could go a long way in
improving how we live in the future.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.750
Skyscrapers are symbols of modern ambition.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.300
But the race to be the tallest is fueled by
steel and concrete, two materials that account

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.230
for an estimated 8% of global C02 emissions.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.829
Two countries in particular - Singapore and
Canada - are attempting to transform the urban

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:39.829
skyline.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.190
In Singapore, engineering firms like WOHA
are coating their buildings with lush, native

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.190
plants.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.069
“To deal with high densities in cities,
particularly Singapore where we are land-limited,

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:57.420
it is actually important to bring landscape
greenery and nature very close to where people

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.879
alive and interact.”

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.030
Aside from the aesthetics of this building,
these towers of green are also helping to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.659
bring biodiversity back to our urban centers.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.950
Because this building has vertical gardens
integrated into its design, it actually contains

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.009
1000 percent more plant life than could have
existed on the original plot of land.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.299
And having buildings that integrate nature
in this way within our dense cities could

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.930
have a measurable impact on quality of life
and the quality of the environment.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.640
Some of us may have experienced New York in
the summertime.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.679
One of the reasons why we get a heat build
up in cities like this is a process known

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.179
as Insolation.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.549
When the sun hits a concrete skyscraper, heat
is stored within the building and then re-radiated

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.060
back into the environment causing the air
temperature to rise.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.530
However, when WOHA designed the Oasia Hotel,
they used plants to combat this problem.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.659
“In our projects, we have always tried to
aim for more than 100% green replacement.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.140
We need to find plants that can handle not
just the wind, but maybe also need to be quite

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.760
hardy as well.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.220
Tropical high-rise building skyscraper, when
you elevate it, you actually get nice breezes

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.420
and nice wind.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440
And that actually makes it very comfortable.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.470
There's no reason why, I think, when we have
high density in the city that we should forget

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.610
about gardens, parks, and nature.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.520
In Canada, architects and engineers are piloting
new designs out of a familiar material: wood.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.920
“Wood is clearly an advantageous material,
because it requires much less resources to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.700
be extracted from the forest.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.980
It requires less resources to transport on
site.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.520
It allows for faster construction.”

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.730
To construct a wooden skyscraper, engineers
use mass timber, which is engineered to handle

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.330
loads similar to concrete and steel.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.980
“Wood has a very, very favorable strength
to weight ratio.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.180
Compared to how heavy it is, it is almost
as strong as steel.”

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.100
They'll use a technique called cross-laminated
timber, where different layers of wood are

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.370
glued together in a cross-based orientation.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.200
Wood isn’t a new material by any stretch.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.490
It has ancient roots in medieval European
churches and temples in Japan.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.770
But it has had a major historical drawback.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.980
Fire.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.460
Urban cities were wiped out in the early 19th
century, and steel and concrete eventually

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.980
became the dominant building materials.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.581
But mass timber today doesn't ignite as easily.

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:51.320
“All these structural wood elements, that
need to be protected from fire, they're encapsulated

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320
in drywall.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.500
These elements cannot burn anymore, and they're
just as safe as if it were a concrete structure.”

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.610
And wooden buildings have huge environmental
benefits too.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.010
In all of Canada, the U.S., Europe, the amount
of wood growing is significantly larger than

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.510
the amount of wood that is actually harvested.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.820
If we harvest our trees and put them in structures,
we actually give an incentive to reforest

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.810
more areas, and regrow more trees.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.030
This trend has spread to countries like the
U.K., and Japan, kickstarting the next race

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.910
for the tallest timber tower.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.030
By 2050, there will be nearly 10 billion people
living on this planet, and two-thirds of us

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.630
will be in cities.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.101
To handle the rise of human population and
global temperature, native plant designs and

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:50.880
timber skyscrapers could go a long way in
curbing environmental and economic impacts.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.750
And they’ll make us feel better too.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.280
