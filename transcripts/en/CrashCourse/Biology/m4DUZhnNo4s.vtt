00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.930
Hello and welcome to the wonderful
world of fungi (fuhn-gahy),

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.589
or fungi (fuhn-jahy).
Both are acceptable pronunciations.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.549
But I say fungi because it's fungus.
Not fun-jus.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.040
Though fun-jus is also fun to say.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.740
Fungi are a little bit like plants,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.120
and more like animals
than you might think.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.410
They diverged from protists
about a billion years ago,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.210
and today scientists estimate
that there are about 1.5 million

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.429
species of Fungi on the earth,
though in a formal, taxonomic way,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.980
we only know about
100,000 or so of them.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.140
And those that we have met
are wonderful, weird, and,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.420
in some cases, deadly.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.149
And the fact is, death is pretty
much what fungi are all about.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.760
Sure, there are the fun fungi,
like the single-celled Saccharomyces,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.360
also known as yeast.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.370
Without them, we wouldn't
have beer, wine or bread.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.420
It's also true that fungi are
responsible for all kinds of diseases,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.399
from athlete's foot to potentially
deadly histoplasmosis,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.609
aka spelunker's lung,
caused by fungus found

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.289
in bird and bat droppings.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.100
Fungi can even make people crazy.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.780
When the fungus Claviceps
purpurea grows on grains used

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.090
to make bread and beer,
it causes gangrene, nervous spasms,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.900
burning sensations, hallucinations,
and temporary insanity.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.690
One compound in this fungus,
lysergic acid,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.050
is the raw material
used to make LSD.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.470
And finally there's the destruction
that some fungi bring onto

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.220
other animals: More than 6 million
bats in North America have died

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.230
since just 2007, due to a fungal
disease called white nose syndrome.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.940
And a fungus has been
implicated in several extinctions

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.860
of amphibians and
threatens many more,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.540
perhaps as many as a third
of all amphibians on Earth.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.390
But none of this is what I mean
when I talk about fungi and death.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.190
While some members of the
fungus family are total bummers,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.920
all of them together perform
perhaps the most vital function

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.610
in the global food web: They feast
on the deceased remains

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.000
of almost all organisms
on the planet.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.820
And by doing that, they convert
the organic matter that we're

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.730
all made of back into soil,
from which new life will spring.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.850
So, fungi: They thrive on
death, and in the process,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.500
make all life possible.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.520
Aha! You Didn't expect to see
me in the chair so soon!

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.340
But before we go any deeper
into the kingdom fungi, I wanted

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.340
to make a toast to Louis Pasteur
in the form of 
a Biolo-graphy.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.210
By Pasteur's time, beer had been
brewed for thousands of years

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.420
in cultures all over the world.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.040
Some experts think it may have
been the very reason that our

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320
hunter-gather ancestors started
farming and cobbled together

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.050
civilization in the first place.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.550
But for all those millennia,
no one understood how its most

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.700
important ingredient worked.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.250
Until brewers could actually
see what yeast were doing,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.100
the magic of fermentation was...
essentially magic.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.940
Pasteur himself was never a big
beer drinker, but part of his

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.710
academic duties in France required
him to help find solutions to

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.460
problems for the
local alcohol industry.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.450
And as part of this work, in 1857,
he began studying yeast under

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.450
a microscope and discovered that
they were in fact living organisms.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.190
In a series of experiments
on the newfound creatures,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.150
he found that in the absence of
free oxygen, yeast were able to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.460
obtain energy by decomposing
substances that contained oxygen.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.790
We now know that Pasteur was
observing yeast undergoing the process

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.680
of anaerobic respiration, aka
fermentation, breaking down the sugars

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.430
in grains like malted barley,
and converting them into alcohol,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.180
carbon dioxide and the range of
flavors that we associate with beer.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.950
Along the way, Pasteur also
discovered that beer was often

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.470
contaminated by other
bacteria and fungi.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.280
The growth of these beer-spoiling
microbes, he found, could be

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.090
thwarted for up to 90 days
by keeping beer between

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.690
55 and 60 degrees Celsius
for a short period of time.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.540
Today, we call that heating process
pasteurization, and it's used

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.520
in everything from milk, to canned
foods, to syrups, to wines.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.180
For our purposes, the thing
to hold onto here is,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.740
Pasteur discovered that yeasts
decompose sugars to get energy.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.510
And it turns out, most fungi spend
most of their time decomposing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.640
all kinds of organic matter.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.380
Often the matter is dead when
fungi get to it, but not always.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.569
When a tree, or a person,
or a deer keels over,

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.360
fungi move in and start
the work of decomposition.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.940
Same goes for that orange you forgot
at the bottom of the fruit bowl.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.859
If it weren't for this fungal
function, plants, and the animals

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.620
that eat them, couldn't exist
because the elements that

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.770
they take from the
soil would never return.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.440
Thankfully, the decomposition
performed by fungi recycles

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.340
the nutrients for the enjoyment
of plants and animals

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.750
as well as for other fungi.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.200
All of this points to
one of the main traits

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.980
that all fungi have in common.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.340
From single-celled yeast to giant
multicellular mushrooms, fungi,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.310
like us, are heterotrophs.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.470
But instead of eating, they absorb
nutrition from their surroundings.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.270
They do this mostly by secreting
powerful enzymes that break down

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.070
complex molecules into
smaller organic compounds,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.580
which they use to feed,
grow, and reproduce.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.400
Most multi-cellular fungi
contain networks of tiny,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.169
tubular filaments called
hyphae that grow through

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.030
and within whatever
they're feasting on.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.110
Unlike plant cell walls,
which are made of cellulose,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.639
the cell walls of fungi are
strengthened by the nitrogenous

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.840
carbohydrate chitin, the same
material found in the exoskeletons

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.650
of insects, spiders,
and other arthropods.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.760
The interwoven mass of hyphae
that grows into the food source

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.560
is called the mycelium, and it's
structured to maximize

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.560
its surface area, which as we've
learned in both plants and animals

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.050
is the name of the game when
it comes to absorbing stuff.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.010
Mycelia are so densely packed that
1 cubic centimeter of rich soil

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.419
can contain enough hyphae
to stretch out 1 kilometer

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.699
if you laid them end to end.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.060
So as hyphae secrete the digestive
enzymes, fungi use the food

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.540
to synthesize more proteins,
and the hyphae continue to grow,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.780
allowing the fungi to conquer
new territory and grow even more.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.710
As a result, fungi can get crazy big.
Record-holding big.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.400
A single honey mushroom in
the Blue Mountains of Oregon

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.090
is thought to
occupy some 2,386 acres.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.310
By area, the largest
organism on the planet.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.440
Now there are all kinds of crazy
ways that fungi are classified,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.400
but probably the easiest and most
useful is organizing them by how

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.270
they interact with other organisms.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.540
The straight-up decomposers
that break down dead stuff,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.300
the mutualists, which
form beneficial relationships

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.550
with other organisms,
especially plants,

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.510
and then there are the predators,
and the parasites.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.910
Decomposer fungi secrete enzymes
that break down and absorb

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.919
nutrients from nonliving organic
material, such as that tree

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.440
that nobody heard
fall in the forest.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.820
In fact, the ability of fungi
to break down lignin,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.800
which is what makes wood woody,
and break it into glucose

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.410
and other simple sugars is
crucial for the cycle of life.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.380
They're pretty much the only
organism that can do that.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.570
They can even decompose proteins
into component amino acids.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.500
Basically, all the black bits in
the soil in your backyard

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.410
are tiny fragments of former
plants digested by fungi.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.060
Mutualist fungi are a smaller group.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.389
Many have specialized hyphae
called haustoria that tangle

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.060
themselves with plant roots for
the benefit of both organisms.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.639
These guys help plants absorb
nutrients, especially phosphates,

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.199
by breaking them down
more efficiently

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.639
than the roots can themselves.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.820
In turn, the fungi send out their
hyphae into the plant's root

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.740
tissue and withdraws a
finder's fee, basically,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.199
in the form of energy-rich sugars.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.139
These mutualistic relationships
are known as mycorrhizae,

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.919
from the Greek words "mykes," or
fungus and "rhizon" or root.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.690
Mycorrhizae are enormously
important in natural ecosystems,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.169
as well as in agriculture.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.520
Almost all vascular plants,
in fact, have fungi attached

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.940
to their roots and rely on
them for essential nutrients.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.870
Growers of barley,
the main ingredient in beer,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.520
will even inoculate barley
seed beds with specific

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.970
mycorrhizal fungi to
help promote growth.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.590
Other fungi aren't nearly
so kind to their hosts.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.660
Predatory fungi actively capture
prey with their hyphae,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.100
the soil fungus Arthrobotrys uses
modified hoops on its filaments

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.590
to snare nematodes and
absorb their inner tissue.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.430
Then there are the parasites,
those fungi that feed on living

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.000
organisms without killing
them, at least for a while.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.310
Take one of my personal favorites:

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.190
the zombie ant fungus,
or Ophiocordyceps.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.660
It shoots spores into an ant,
where their hyphae grow into its body

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.889
and absorb nutrients from
non-essential ant organs.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.039
When the fungus is ready to
reproduce, it invades the ant's brain

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:58.630
and directs it to march to a cool,
moist location in the forest

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.190
where its so-called
fruiting spores erupt

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.009
through the ant's head to
spread even more spores.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.449
And just to prove that
even fungi have superheroes,

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:10.850
in 2012 scientists discovered
that these zombie spores

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.060
have themselves been targeted
by another parasitic fungus.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.530
Not a lot is known about
this ant-saving fungus,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.850
other than it sterilizes
many of the zombie spores

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.850
through a process likened
to chemical castration.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.240
That is so messed up. Weird!

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.190
Alright now, since
I brought that up,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.500
we should talk briefly
about fungus sex.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.189
Fungi reproduce any way they can,
either sexually or asexually.

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:34.689
Some species even do it both ways.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:37.079
But whichever way they
choose, most propagate themselves

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:40.389
by producing enormous numbers
of spores, much like we saw

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:42.699
in nonvascular plants
and the simplest

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.490
of vascular plants, the ferns.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.899
But, and this is a big but,
sexual reproduction in fungi

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:51.360
isn't like sex in any other
organism we've studied so far.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.459
The concepts of male and female
don't apply here. At all.

00:08:55.459 --> 00:08:57.339
Some fungi reproduce on their own.

00:08:57.339 --> 00:08:59.670
Others can reproduce with
any other individual

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.089
that happens to be around.

00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:03.660
And still others can only
mate with a member of a different

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.619
so-called mating type:
they're not different sexes,

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:08.779
they just have different
molecular mechanisms that

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.059
either make them compatible or not.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.860
Sometimes these types are
called plus or minus,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.699
and other times 1 and 2.

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:17.040
In any case, it's still
considered sexual reproduction,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.519
because each parent
contributes genetic information

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.759
when they make with
the spore-making.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:23.699
It all starts with this
beautiful chemical mating dance,

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:27.170
as the mycelium from one fungus
sends out pheromones that are picked

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.769
up and bound to receptors by
another willing and able partner.

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:34.869
This binding compels each mycelium
to send its hyphae toward the other.

00:09:34.869 --> 00:09:37.490
When they meet, they fuse the
cytoplasm of their cells,

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.079
a stage of reproduction
called plasmogamy.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.209
Sometime between hours
and centuries later,

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:46.699
yes, it can literally take hundreds
of years for fungi to have sex,

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:49.499
this union leads to the
production of spores

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:51.319
that each fungus is
then able to disperse.

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:54.149
Certain types of fungi,
including the tasty morel,

00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:56.550
produce spores in sac-like
asci contained in

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.869
fruiting bodies
known as ascocarps.

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:01.279
That is the part you pick when
you're wandering through the forest.

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.360
Some fungi shoot their
spores off into the breeze,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.509
other spores float
away on the water.

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:08.709
More enterprising spores will
hitch a ride on passing critters,

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.239
hopefully to be dropped off
somewhere where there's plenty of

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:15.660
nutrients to absorb, so they too
can grow, send out sexual pheromones

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.139
when their time comes and let
their hyphae do the tango.

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:22.119
Finally, for some fungi, sexual
reproduction just isn't all

00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:23.009
it's cracked up to be.

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:25.589
They'd rather just get
it on with themselves.

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:27.220
Some of these grow
filamentous structures

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.089
that produce spores by mitosis.

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.679
These structures are visible,
and they're called molds,

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:33.730
the stuff on the orange in
the bottom of the fruit bowl

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.670
or the heel of the piece of bread
that you left for a roommate

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.429
who decided to leave it
for the other roommate

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.050
who thought that you'd
rather have it.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.999
In the unicellular yeast,
the asexual reproduction occurs by

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.269
old-fashioned cell division
or the formation of buds

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:48.470
that get pinched off
into separate organisms.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.720
Since some species of yeast,
like our beer-making friend,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.149
Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
convert sugars into alcohol,

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:57.290
brewers create conditions that
encourage high rates of yeast

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.769
production, like giving
them lots of sugar and oxygen,

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.509
since more yeast means more alcohol.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:03.839
So, yeah, fungi!
They feast on death,

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.129
and they can make us go
insane and turn ants

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:08.149
into unholy zombies of the night.

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:10.800
But because of their hard
work and strange ways,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.819
they make possible stuff
like agriculture and beer

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:16.189
and everything else
worth living for.

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:18.319
So thanks to the fungus.
And also thanks to you

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.410
for watching this episode
of Crash Course Biology.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.480
And of course, thanks to the people
who helped me put it together.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.790
They're awesome. Thank you guys!

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.149
There's a table of contents over
there if you want to click on it

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:30.249
and go review any of the stuff that
you want to reinforce in your brain.

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:32.429
And if you have questions
or comments or ideas for us,

00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:34.389
we're on Facebook and
Twitter and of course,

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:35.239
we're down in the comments below.

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:35.569
We'll see you next time.
