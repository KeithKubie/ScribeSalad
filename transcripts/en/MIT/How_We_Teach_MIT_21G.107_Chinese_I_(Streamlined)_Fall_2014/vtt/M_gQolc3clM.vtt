MIN-MIN LIANG: My
name is Min-Min Liang.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm from Taiwan.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.190
And I'm a Chinese
lecturer at MIT.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.340
And I graduated my
college in Taiwan.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910
And I came here to
the United States

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.200
to get my master's
degree at Harvard.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.370
And after the master program,
I went to UPenn for the Ph.D.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.810
That's where I started
teaching Chinese,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.009
because I have a
scholarship there.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.080
And even though my major
is Chinese literature,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.190
but I find teaching Chinese
is really fun and stimulating.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.230
And my total years of
teaching is 21 years.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.050
And I find it interesting,
because every school

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.100
is different.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.570
And so I constantly have
to adapt my strategy

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.970
to a different
group of students.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.620
And I find that's very exciting.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.990
It's not things so mundane.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.230
It's so routine.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.150
In that way, there's
a routine there,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.180
but you have to
change up according

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.490
to the audience, the group.
