00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.010
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to this review course,

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.730
which is a prep for my graduate course on

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.000
operating systems. When I teach graduate students on campus

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.720
at Georgia Tech, I often find that there's a

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.010
gap between the knowledge they have of operating

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.750
systems at the start of the course and what

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.240
they really should know in order to get the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.570
full benefit of my graduate class. This is not

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.110
being judgmental. But it is just that, not

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.190
all undergraduate operating systems courses are the same.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.600
And you may have taken a course on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.450
undergraduate operating systems a long time back. Or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.270
maybe you were not that enthusiastic about operating

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.590
systems at the time that you took the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.450
course. This review course is not meant to

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.270
be a substitute for an undergraduate education in systems.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.450
Rather, it cover the topics many students have expressed that they

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.820
wished they had it before starting to take my class. Helping

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.239
me with this review course is Charles Brubaker, a PhD graduate

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.810
from Georgia Tech, now turned into a course developer for Udacity.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; Hi there. With this course, I'll try to give you concise

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.230
explanations that will quickly put you

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.280
into a better position. To fully understand

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.700
the vectors and complete the projects of the advanced

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.130
operating systems class. With these goals, let's get started.
