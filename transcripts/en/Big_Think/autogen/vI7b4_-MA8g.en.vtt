you're currently working on it at one
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.730
you're currently working on it at one
time so you don't forget what your

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
time so you don't forget what your
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.050
time so you don't forget what your
strategy is or forget what you already

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
strategy is or forget what you already
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.960

did and then redo it the executive
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.190
did and then redo it the executive
attention Network is also helpful for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
attention Network is also helpful for
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.430
attention Network is also helpful for
inhibiting obvious responses or the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
inhibiting obvious responses or the
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930
inhibiting obvious responses or the
first things that come to your mind and

is usually not the most creative so they

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
is usually not the most creative so they
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.840
is usually not the most creative so they
they tend to like wait for the second or

network but I like to call it the
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.520
network but I like to call it the
imagination network because it's a very

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
imagination network because it's a very
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860
imagination network because it's a very

solanell so it's it's very important for

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
solanell so it's it's very important for
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.990
solanell so it's it's very important for

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
having compassion for someone else
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
having compassion for someone else
because it allows us to imagine what

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010

someone else is thinking or feeling and
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.770
someone else is thinking or feeling and
that's the imagination brain network and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
that's the imagination brain network and
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.360
that's the imagination brain network and
they're their third major brain network

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
they're their third major brain network
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.650
they're their third major brain network
that's important for creativity that I

network it's called the salience brain

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989
network it's called the salience brain
 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.220
network it's called the salience brain
network and that's associated with what

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230
network and that's associated with what
 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.289

is most interesting to us before we
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.009
is most interesting to us before we
think through consciously about a

creative activity and even before we
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.720
creative activity and even before we
activate our imagination there's a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730

have a subconscious process where the
salient brain network tags things is

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
salient brain network tags things is
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.680
salient brain network tags things is
interesting or not interesting in our
