&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for
everybody coming today, both here and I guess

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.139
we've got some, some video links as well.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:28.929
I'm Bill Wile and it's with great pleasure
that I welcome you to Green@ Google which

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:41.820
is our speaker series that welcomes authors
to Google to talk about various environmental

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.720
and sustainability topics.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:57.150
First I'd like to introduce our speaker who
is one of the most remarkable environmental

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:09.550
advocates living today. He's inspired at least
one if not two or three generations of, of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.060
people over the last many years, including
myself.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:30.060
As I was writing this I was, I was kind of
struck by the number of parallels between

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:43.780
our speaker's pioneering work and biography
and our own Google history. I should say that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.920
I could probably spend the entire hour summarizing
his biography -

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.920
[laughter]

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.159
you guys don't want me to do that.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
[laughter]

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:15.790
So, first of all he's a Stanford graduate
the place where Larry met Sergey. Thirty nine

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:32.080
years before Google Earth was launched he
initiated a campaign which resulted in NASA

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:48.090
releasing the first color images of earth
from space. These pictures also helped to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.410
inspire the creation of the first Earth Day
celebration.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:13.230
He is best known as the founder of the original
Whole Earth Catalog. Some of you are probably

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:27.660
too young to know what that is, some of us
aren't.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.819
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: Fossil.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:40.150
&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: Thank you. Yes, fossil. I'm guilty.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.200
[laughter]

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:54.920
It was likened to and I quote "Google in paperback
form." I don't think that was said in the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:10.180
'60's but more recently. And he received a
national book award for it.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:21.409
He was the original organizer of the Hacker
Conference popularizing the famous phrase

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:34.379
"information wants to be free" an idea which
continues to become even more popular today

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:46.479
and certainly resonates with our mission to
make the world's information easily and universally

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.939
accessible and, and useful.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:05:03.280
He also co-founded The Well, another thing
that many of you are probably too young to

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.120
know about -

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:16.669
with Larry Brilliant who was an executive
director of Google.org for several years.

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.710
It was one of the first and longest lasting
online communities and, and really paved the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:33.509
way in many ways for every online business
from Amazon to eBay to Google and, and so

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.509
on.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:49.499
Stewart is a self proclaimed environmental
heretic; so he's not afraid to challenge the

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.759
status quo.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:06:07.560
He's here today to talk about his latest book
"Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:25.729
Manifesto." A book which has been hailed as
one of the most important books of

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:50.090
the decade as well as ominous and exhilarating
and mind bending.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:07:09.420
I hope you'll find his ideas engaging and
provocative as well.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.819
Please join me in welcoming Stewart Brand.

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:17.879
[applause]

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:35.800
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Alright. How's our sound
are we okay all the way in back and stuff

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:45.099
like that? Okay. Great. Good to go.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:08:02.199
&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: One, one other point of order.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.449
[laughter]

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:15.529
Sorry. So this is being recorded and will
be put on YouTube so when you ask questions

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:23.169
please remember that; that this is public;
this is not a private Google talk and there

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.000
is on microphones.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:38.310
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: I wonder what things you
don't say in those circumstances, but I won't

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.310
ask.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.310
[laughter]

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.290
&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: We can't tell you.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.290
[laughter]

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:58.530
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Yeah, quick revisit. At age
of 10 I gave my pledge as an American to save

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:08.530
and faithfully to defend from waste the natural
resources my country - its air, soil, and

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:21.610
minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
That came from not some kind of lefty thing,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.010
but outdoor life.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:40.900
The conservation pledge was promoted by conservatives,
basically hunters and fisherman and its relative

00:09:40.900 --> 00:10:03.160
to remember the environmental movement was
basically begun in this country by duck hunters.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:18.150
And it has been a, a conservative thing from
the start and it's only lately got identified,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:27.450
I think over identified with being on the
left.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:50.510
So I went to Stanford, got a degree in ecology,
did The Whole Earth Catalog '68, in the '70's

00:10:50.510 --> 00:11:01.930
I worked for the first Jerry Brown administration.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.030
[laughter]

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:16.610
And he, that administration set in motion
the regulations and rules and norms so that

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:29.700
Californians emit half the greenhouse gases
of the residents of any other state per capita.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:38.830
That lasted through several Republican governors
and it's an impressive accomplishment.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:52.870
So a current event for me is this book called
Whole Earth Discipline. I'll just mention

00:11:52.870 --> 00:12:14.820
a couple of things that
are in it, but I won't touch on much today.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:26.950
I'm trying to move on thinking from the idea
of natural capital as a way to think about

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:36.000
ecosystems services and just to say, "Look,
it's infrastructure." Yeah, it's natural infrastructure,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:47.400
but a bridge is an infrastructure and so is
the river under it.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:13:25.270
Precautionary principle is fine if and only
if it allows things to go forward and be tried.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:36.480
So I want the precautionary principle matched
with a vigilance principle where you keep

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:48.540
an eye on stuff. You try it and then out of
precaution you watch if it's gonna do good

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.080
things or bad things.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.390
It's particularly nice to be talking here
at Google because the rethinking green I'm

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:07.340
doing basically is trying to get the whole
environmental movement and everybody who listens

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:21.650
to them to think like scientists and even
more to think like engineers. That it's not

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:28.720
always saying no to things but often saying
yes, but let's do it this particularly cool

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720
way.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:47.710
That involves thinking like a fox instead
of a hedgehog. Being able to hold a whole

00:14:47.710 --> 00:15:04.810
many things, many ideas, some of them contradictory
in your mind at the same time, instead of

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:14.310
pledging your entire life and allegiance to
one hedgehogeque ideology.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:23.000
So I'm trying to move people from romance
to science to engineering and we're realizing

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:35.150
that we are now the keystone species on the
planet and it is basically ours to guard either

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:42.710
well or badly but we don't have a choice not
to.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.470
[pause]

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:55.120
The news items in the book and ones that are
maybe more directly relevant here and these

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:03.240
were more fun to illustrate is cities are
green, nuclear power is green, genetic engineering

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.650
is green and I fear that geoengineering may
well be necessary.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.990
Let's quickly visit the climate aspects of
that.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:23.820
I won't go through the whole trip that I'm
sure Al Gore did on climate, but the point

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:35.680
that interests me most about it is the degree
to which it is a severe non-linear system

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:43.060
with various hidden positive feedbacks, tipping
points, thresholds and whatnot. This is just

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:50.350
one diagram that climatologists use to remind
themselves of the things that we don't know

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:59.790
yet. So there's a hell of a lot more science
that needs to come along on all these subjects.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:06.250
What happens when climate really affects things
is with warming you get drought; with drought

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:14.529
you get a fight over lowering carrying capacity
for, for humans, over resources, over water

00:17:14.529 --> 00:17:35.009
in the case of Darfur. If things go badly
with climate Darfur may be seen as the first

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:36.419
of the climate wars.

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:43.669
A good book on this sort of subject is called
Constant Battles by Steven LeBlanc.

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:51.059
Another potential conflict area is the glaciers
of the Himalaya, no they're probably not gonna

00:17:51.059 --> 00:18:01.460
all melt by 2035 as we heard from the IPCC,
but they are nevertheless melting and the

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:12.619
entire Himalayan plateau feeds rivers that
provide water in the dry season to 40% of

00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:20.649
humanity. Mostly those rivers flow through
several different nations, several of which

00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:28.370
are nuclear armed. If they get to fighting
over resources it could get pretty ugly.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:37.730
A couple of good climate books - this is interesting,
this is such a green presentation that all

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.399
my colors have gone green.

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:42.399
[laughter]

00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:54.320
There really are other colors in the original.
This is kind of fun, but it's a little sickly

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.809
I'd have to say.

00:18:57.809 --> 00:19:09.110
Anyway a couple books I recommend is James
Lovelock, "The Vanishing Face of Gaia" and

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.710
"Six Degrees" by Mark Lynas.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:24.460
With this group of engineers I will raise
a question that is - I don't usually raise

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:32.610
in public - which is there may be hidden negative
impacts, we hope so, in the climate system.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:40.440
There may be a flywheel of momentum effect
that slows down some of these tipping points

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240
and positive feedbacks.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:50.460
There is still carbon disappearing from the
atmosphere that we don't know where it's going;

00:19:50.460 --> 00:20:02.750
mysterious carbon sink. It may be going in
the oceans, it may be going in the soil, it

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:14.100
may be going in the trees growing because
of CO2, but we, we need to figure out what

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:23.610
that is and either at least work with it or
not into it.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.980
Lots of science.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:37.850
Likewise another possible positive feedback;
a whole lot of the book goes on about microorganisms;

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:47.059
our best friend 'cause they create the atmosphere
that we live with. There's a microorganism

00:20:47.059 --> 00:21:07.960
in the oceans called Emiliania huxleyi, EHUX
to its friends, that makes blooms that you

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:43.340
can see from space; they increase the reflectance
of the earth when they do that; they fix carbon

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:53.620
in their shells; the shells then sink to the
bottom of the ocean and they are a carbon

00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:00.200
fixer and there's some sign with lab work
that they may not add to acidification of

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.451
the oceans. Lots more science needed there.

00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:11.510
So moving from climate to the whole perspective
on demographics; the major fact that I'm trying

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:19.740
to get everybody who's thinking about these
issues, climate and green issues and so on,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:35.440
is that five out of six of us do not live
in the developed world, we live in the developing

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:56.620
world where a whole hell of a lot is going
on. People are moving to cities, they're educating

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:07.080
their kids, they're getting the hell out of
poverty and it is a demographic change as

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:23.129
large as any in the history of humanity going
on now. We've now passed the majority of people

00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:33.700
living on the earth are in cities, I call
it city planet and the expectation is that

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:47.820
by about mid-century we will be up to 80 percent
[inaudible] which is what it is in developed

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.899
countries now.

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:58.870
The overall numbers are incredible. One point
three million new people a week in cities,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:11.690
70 million a year. Some are being born there;
most are moving there. And when they move,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:19.419
they move from primarily from subsistence
agriculture situations which are beautiful

00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:30.669
to look at but they're hell to work in. They
are poverty jobs, they're ecological disasters

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:33.909
built specifically inside of marginal land.

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:42.429
When people move off this land, especially
in the tropical areas it grows back pretty

00:24:42.429 --> 00:25:01.869
fast; the animals come back because they're
no longer being killed for bush meat and this

00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:16.960
is a, a part of the green advantage of cities.
That's in the developing world.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:35.369
In the developed world, as we are increasingly
finding, cities are a great place to live

00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:51.429
if you wanna use less materials; less energy;
and by the way have a more exciting life.

00:25:51.429 --> 00:26:08.450
So people are moving away from the poverty
trap, but they're moving toward action. Now

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:26.690
they don't get to go to downtown Manhattan
right away, they start with squatter cities;

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.899
slums.

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:38.279
And there is no end of economic activity going
on there; in the informal economy as it's

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:48.460
called. I talked about this a couple years
ago, so I won't go in great depth about it,

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:56.350
but a good book on the subject is Shadow Cities
by Robert Neuwirth.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:12.180
An important point to realize is that, that
people are getting out of poverty; part of

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:23.859
what they're doing is that they're moving
to the bright lights in cities to buy electricity.

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:33.789
If it's not there, readily available, they
don't have money to pay for it, they steal

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:39.529
it. Like here in Rio. They do the same with
water and cable TV and by and by if they've

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:42.960
stole well enough gradually it gentrifies
and these things become legal, but it starts

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960
out illegal.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:28:00.249
Squatter cities are the densest social capital
activities in the world. Look at an edge like

00:28:00.249 --> 00:28:11.519
this in Sao Paulo and you start to see why
cities derive so much of their power from

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:26.379
proximity. In this case, you've got people
that live on the left in the boring part of

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:34.749
town walk to work over in the, in the exciting
part of town over the boring empty swimming

00:28:34.749 --> 00:28:51.100
pools on the right as nannies and gardeners
and guards and cooks and whatnot, and then

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:58.409
walk home to the interesting life on the left.

00:28:58.409 --> 00:29:06.340
Proximity is everything in cities. It is what
drives people to them, it's what rewards them

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.090
for being there. So here you have a, a national
scale train moving through a dense slum market

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.989
in Bangkok, and these kinds of proximities
are drivers of innovation; they're drivers

00:29:13.989 --> 00:29:23.409
of economic activity; and one of the reasons
we all move to cities is [inaudible].

00:29:23.409 --> 00:29:31.000
I love showing this to city planners. It -

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[laughter]

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.659
They're real estate guys; now where do you
begin?

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:38.659
[laughter]

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:46.210
The poor people of the world are the slums
and the squatter cities are the greatest people

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:57.479
there are. They use the least energy and the
least materials, but they're that green because

00:29:57.479 --> 00:30:08.229
they're poor and they do not chose to remain
that poor.

00:30:08.229 --> 00:30:15.820
Now this particular guy told the photographer
[inaudible]: "For toilet purposes we have

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:25.739
to go outside." This is in the Dharavi slum
in Mumbai. "It's a problem; we have to go

00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:46.510
in the road. The electricity is on for two
days and off two days or not on at all. We

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:57.299
don't have much space for the children to
play in; they use the road to play in and

00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:05.009
accidents take place again and again. I'm
not studied at all and am illiterate. For

00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:13.130
work I stitch government jeans and pants.
It's fine but the workday ends late. I want

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:22.340
to educate my kids; 'til the day I die I'll
educate them. As long as I'm around that's

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.340
guaranteed."

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:34.750
That's a world changing event. The kids getting
educated in cities, fewer of them typically

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:47.450
in birth rate drops below two point one per
woman as soon as they get into town and that

00:31:47.450 --> 00:32:12.940
combination is changing worlds. So what we're
looking at over the next 30 years is a global

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:24.429
South full of huge growing cities, new cities
full of young people and here in the North

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:31.700
basically old cities increasingly full of
people who look like me; old people.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:42.200
And where do you think the action's gonna
be? Because all the cities in the world want

00:32:42.200 --> 00:33:00.909
to get to this state which is not usually
green, it's usually a beautiful golden yellow.

00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:18.289
Cities require base load power and to get
to the power issue right now we get base load

00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:28.990
electricity from just three sources. Mostly
coal and gas, some hydro, some nuclear. In

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:45.779
terms of constant base load there is, so far
no other source. We hope it gets mass storage

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:50.860
for solar to wind, but they don't, they're
not on line yet.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.740
From the green standpoint the main argument
for nuclear is when you compare what happens

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:02.169
with base, the waste products. That beautiful
monogrammed cook pan would contain -

00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:03.169
[laughter]

00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:14.130
a lifetime's worth of spent fuel from nuclear
electricity. Whereas just one day in a normal

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:27.080
one gigawatt coal fired plant you see 19,000
tons of carbon dioxide coming out along with

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:35.181
no end of slurry and flash and the rest of
it.

00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:51.350
Where does the waste go? Nuclear waste and
20 tons of fuel becomes 20 tons of waste goes

00:34:51.350 --> 00:35:04.620
into two dry cask storage back in the parking
lot. Two point nine million tons of coal turns

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:13.680
into eight million tons of carbon dioxide
which goes into everybody's atmosphere where

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.171
we can't do anything about it.

00:35:17.171 --> 00:35:24.040
So when you compare the lifetime greenhouse
gas emissions of nuclear it's down there with

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:29.590
hydro and wind and, and still ahead of solar.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:39.850
Just a thing or two to say about wind. It's
pretty major infrastructure by now. And it

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:50.390
takes not just an ecological footprint on
the land but a physical footprint on the industrialized

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:56.790
landscape to the point of one gigawatt which
isn't constant taking up about 250 square

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.790
miles of industrialized land.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:04.910
Solar is even tougher. Here in California
take a pretty place out in the desert and

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.630
bulldoze it for solar farms and one gigawatt
takes 50 square miles. And just in case you

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.930
think that's a particularly pretty or spectacular
place in the desert there's of course a Google

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:18.840
indicator of where the photograph was taken.
It's an ordinary spot that is exactly the

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.820
kind of places that are being dozed for solar
farms.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:38.680
Not that I'm against solar or wind. But it's,
as environmentalists starting to learn the

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:46.270
trade off,
Saul Griffith has gone through the numbers

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:56.700
and figured out that to really stabilize the
climate we need 13 terawatts of new clean

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:13.100
energy and if you parcel all of that out what
it would take to do it, you get things like

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:22.660
30,000 square miles of solar electric panels,
15,000 square miles for another two terawatts

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:30.200
of solar thermal panels and on down the line
and still only comes to ten, so he threw in

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:43.780
three terawatts of nuclear for 3900 one gigawatt
reactors. You add it all up and it takes an

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:59.110
area about the size of North America which
Saul calls "Renewistan."

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.510
[laughter]

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:07.880
A really good book on this subject is David
McKay's, basically doing the math on what

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:28.180
it would take to make England green. And one
of the things he says, "Look I'm not trying

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:46.390
to be in favor of nuclear, but I am in favor
of arithmetic."

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.390
[laughter]

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.770
Everybody says what about Chernobyl? Okay.
Chernobyl is interesting. You go back there

00:38:50.770 --> 00:39:02.711
later and what you find now is it's the world's
best, or Europe's best wildlife refuge. One

00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:03.711
zoologist who went there, studied the animals
on the ground for 10 years and said that it

00:39:03.711 --> 00:39:05.620
was very interesting that the world's worst
nuclear reactor disaster was nowhere as harmful

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:19.170
for, for the wildlife as just what people
do ordinarily, farming and so on. But people

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:29.360
moved out [inaudible] was reforested. So my
expectation is that within this decade you'll

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.660
see Chernobyl National Park and we'll all
go there to see the animals and to see the

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:49.640
terrible sites and the terrible thing that
happened.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:40:05.570
Proliferation is another famous issue and
this is red, white and blue.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.570
[laughter]

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:25.980
And it's megatons, I guess they really didn't
wanna call it megadust to megawatts.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.540
[laughter]

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:47.920
But 10% of American electricity comes from
recycled Russian warheads. We haven't even

00:40:47.920 --> 00:41:15.560
started on our own stock pile yet. It is one
of the good reasons to move ahead with, with

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.600
shutting down all of the nuclear weapons in
the world because unlike most weapon systems

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:37.340
this is actually valuable. When you down-blend
the weapons grade uranium into fuel you can

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:49.870
run a hell of a lot of electricity. I think
it's wonderful that the very bombs that were

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:55.140
targeted at blowing up American cities are
now being used to light up American cities

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.430
is exquisite.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:18.320
Another big question is nuclear waste. What
will we do with that? Well it's not going

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:31.860
to Yucca Mountain. Where it stands now is
we need broadcast storage in the various reactor

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:49.930
sites in the US and around the world. Where
can we find an area 50, 100, 150 old and think

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:58.990
about what we wanna do with it, it may well
be fuel for the next generation of reactors

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:14.301
or it could just go in the ground if we wanted
to where nuclear waste has been going for

00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:46.720
10 years in New Mexico in the Waste Isolation
Power Plant which is pretty cool to visit

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:54.540
and they occasionally welcome visitors.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:07.960
The argument for the WIPP is that that sulfur
base has been there for 250 million years;

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:18.670
it's not going anywhere; water doesn't come
in or out of it; you're down half a mile;

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:39.340
and it's about as good a place as any to stash
stuff that you really wanna forget about.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.470
A good book on nuclear is Gwyneth Cravens'
Power to Save the World.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.980
A previous group would wanna see how we think
about transporting nuclear waste -

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:57.030
&gt;&gt;voice on video: Shipping containers have
been loaded on a truck that was crashed first

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:16.840
at 60 miles per hour and then at 80 miles
per hour into a 700 ton concrete wall. They

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:25.040
have been broadsided by a 121 ton locomotive
traveling at 80 miles per hour.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:33.830
Another physical test involved dropping containers
in a 30 foot free fall onto steel reinforced

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:42.770
concrete, comparable to hitting a concrete
slab head on at 120 miles an hour.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:55.970
They've been dropped onto a six inch diameter
spike and the containers have been burned

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:03.180
in a pool of aviation fuel for 90 minutes
at temperatures of more than 2,000 degrees

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180
Fahrenheit.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:28.030
The results in each case: there were no ruptures
or significant damage to the used fuel containers

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:37.680
themselves. Although dented and charred the
containers remained totally intact to protect

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.580
the used fuel they would carry.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:46.920
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: See the amount of fun we
chemical engineers can have.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920
[laughter]

00:46:47.920 --> 00:47:01.490
I think it's useful to think of, of nuclear
not just in terms of, of that it puts out

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:09.320
less greenhouse gases, but there are various
positive things that can happen with the next

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.630
generation with the fast reactors and some
of the other hotter burning reactors.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.040
So you go from what we have with Diablo Canyon
now to yellow electricity from there should

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040
go into plug-in hybrids, then it's clean,
it's not so if it comes from coal or gas.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040
The hot reactors could, can be used directly
for generating hydrogen and for desalinating

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040
water for fresh water.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040
They can also take that spent fuel and turn
it back into fuel so that the stuff we are

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.960
worried about putting in Yucca Mountain can
be just be put into the, the fourth generation

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.480
reactors and put to work.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.741
And of course there's no carbon dioxide with
managing what comes out of this.

00:47:26.741 --> 00:47:32.220
One of the elements that I'm most interested
in is the, is the new domain of down on the

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.280
lower left of so-called small modular reactors;
the SMR's; 25 megawatts and stuff like that.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.280
Here's one from Toshiba "Super Safe Small
 &amp; Simple."

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.280
The Russians are leading the way on this one.
They've got one that they're building now

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.280
for use along the Northern Sea Passage because
the ice is melting north of Russia and the,

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.660
it's opening up for shipping; they're pouring
concrete for ports; they need power for the

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.310
ports. They're making these floating 35 megawatt
reactors and they are also planning to sell

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.720
them to the developing world for coastal countries.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.720
Here's a local design from Lawrence Livermore;
the commercial design from New Mexico Hyperion

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.210
was supposed to be ready now; they're getting
sales, new scale in Oregon. These are all

00:47:54.210 --> 00:48:00.130
very typically buried in the ground; they
are modular in the sense they're built at

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:07.260
a factory instead of on-site and then trucked
to the spot; put in the ground; treated as

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.260
"nuclear batteries" relatively few moving
parts; proliferation proof, safe and all that

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.260
good stuff.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.940
Even though one of the oldest players Babcock
and Wilcox has, they're the ones who built

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:21.670
the reactors for the Navy they just come out
with a new 125 megawatt reactor. They say

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.981
they have three utilities that wanna purchase
it.

00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:50.180
Here's basically a concept for a fourth generation
reactor that's small; 100 megawatts. This

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:57.630
Integral Fast Reactor potentially could for
a small town besides providing local electricity

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:03.860
also desalinate water locally, provide hydrogen
locally if that turns out to be useful.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.750
There's many people at Google who love storing.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.750
[laughter]

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:13.080
The outfit that Nathan [inauble] does in Electrical
Adventures is working with global wood; they've

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:23.490
got a thorium design that is a true bury and
forget; it is, you put it in the ground and

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:33.490
run it for 60 years and then just leave it
there. The nature of the waste is perfectly

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:34.940
comfortable in that spot.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.440
Now will the Google goal of having some form
of clean energy that's cheaper than coal come

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440
along? I don't know. I don't know if it'll
be nuclear, I don't know what it might be.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.840
But in the meantime it's probably important
that governments that we hire to think long

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.180
term and deal with infrastructure make coal
expensive, so that the market and everything

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180
else can move ahead in making these other
things go forward and get cheap enough.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:50.990
Basically if the, if the governments in Europe,
the United States, China and India all make

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:55.990
coal expensive, we're probably in pretty good
shape for greenhouse gases and if they don't

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.990
it's gonna be difficult.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.990
One other quick subject: good old genetically
modified organisms; genetically engineered

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:07.130
food crops. For some reason my fellow environmentalists
became deeply adverse to it; frankenfood.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:28.740
And it was based on I think ignorance that,
the notion that if you take genes from one

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.240
species and put 'em in another species there's
something profoundly unnatural about that.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:43.750
It's not unnatural for microorganisms, they've
been doing it for 3.5 billion years. It's

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:50.360
how a great deal of evolution has occurred;
my translation of genes from one organism

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.480
to the next. We're just finally picking up
on that technology called a form of biomimicry.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.630
One of the things to ask with-- I love that
poisonous green color.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.630
[laughter]

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:00.640
Yeah.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.883
Okay, who's actually using this? Well the
Amish for one.

00:51:06.883 --> 00:51:07.883
[laughter]

00:51:07.883 --> 00:51:08.883
Were usually very suspicious of any new technology
but they are also some of the best farmers

00:51:08.883 --> 00:51:09.883
in America. They know good seeds when they
see it. They were one of the early adopters

00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:10.883
of Bt corn for example.

00:51:10.883 --> 00:51:11.883
Likewise all around the world it's been picked
up by many developing countries such as South

00:51:11.883 --> 00:51:13.300
Africa where engineered white maize is one
of the most popular food crops there.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.240
There's three books I'll quickly recommend
here: Gordon Conway's The Doubly Green Revolution;

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.910
two local folks Tomorrow's Table; Pamela Ronald
is a genetic engineer at UC Davis married

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.910
to an organic farming teacher named Raoul
Adamchak. They think the combination of organic

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:18.910
and engineered is the ideal way to go with
agriculture. I'd have to agree.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:19.910
A good survey of the area is Nina Fedoroff's
Mendel In The Kitchen.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.910
This is the most successful agricultural revolution
in history basically. It has taken off so

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:21.910
rapidly and my fellow environmentalists keep
saying that it's somehow bad for farmers,

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:22.910
but the farmers haven't gotten that message.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:23.910
[laughter]

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:24.910
They think these are better seeds; they like
plants that they can get ahead of the weeds

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:25.910
with, that they can get ahead of the pests
with, and that doesn't do a lot of damage

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:26.910
to the landscape.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:27.910
So in the case of soy beans, for example,
most of the world's soy beans now are, are

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:28.910
herbicide tolerant; that means that you don't
have to plow the ground to keep the weeds

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.910
down. No till agriculture is absolutely one
of the best things you can do ecologically

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:30.910
and it's a direct result of genetic engineering.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:31.910
As for the moral and ethical issues, The Nuffield
Council on Bioethics in England explored this

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:32.910
subject twice in great depth, and came up
with the conclusion that there is a moral

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.910
imperative for making GM crops readily and
economically available to anybody in the developing

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:34.910
world that wants it.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.910
Now this is not just for the developing world.
Yeah, there are a number of things that are

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:36.910
being done for especially tropical plants
that have not been bred up to their full capabilities,

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.910
and so you have some fairly lousy food like
Cassava which is good for storage but not

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.910
much else that 800 million people live on.
Or sorghum that 500 million people live on.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:39.910
Bill and Melinda Gates' Foundation put money
into BioCassava Plus. It is improved eight

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:40.910
ways including producing the damn cyanide
that is natural in the plant.

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.910
Down on the lower end of the scale you see
things that are gonna be of great interest

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.910
to us such as not only an allergy-free peanut
but a pig with omega-3 fatty acids in it.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:43.910
So it's as healthy for you, your system and
your heart as eating wild fish and it would

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:44.910
be fine with me if you didn't eat a wild fish
and ate a pig instead. Or even better there's

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:45.910
a soy bean that has this capability coming
along from everybody's favorite enemy Monsanto.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:46.910
They're finally doing some crops that are
gonna be nutritious.

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.910
And increasingly there will be medical benefits
as well in some of these engineered foods.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.910
The engineering standpoint on this is the
Rob Carlson, the Carlson curve, is pointing

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:49.910
out that even though recombinant DNA technology,
standard genetic engineering has been increasing

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:50.910
its capabilities at a faster than a morris
Law rate.

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:51.910
The new capabilities of synthetic biology,
that is of basically generating new genomes

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:52.910
somewhat from scratch; that's moving even
faster than that.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:53.910
In order words, this is a technology which
is going to increasingly dominate everything

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:54.910
including all the environmental issues we're
interested in.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:55.910
This is a generational thing. So Drew Endy
over here at Stanford is bending the mind

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:56.910
of children with comics that invite them to
get some of this stuff in just like Erector

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:57.910
sets and chemistry sets and kids kit sets
of long ago; these are now biotech sets for

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.910
the kids to make new forms of life in the
basement.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:59.910
[laughter]

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:00.910
And then they convene once they're in colleges
and form teams they get together and compete

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:01.910
at MIT every September at the iGem meetings
and what are they up to now, 100 teams from

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:02.910
26 countries. This is an amazing occasion
and of course a lot of it is frivolous. Bacteria

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:03.910
that do the wave;

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:04.910
[laughter]

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:05.910
that smell different in different parts of
their cycle of life. But at the same time

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:06.910
they've come up with things like a, a very
cheap biotech sensor for pollution in streams.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:07.910
I just threw in here a picture which is accurate
because that is a blue rose. The thing which

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:08.910
has been tried to be created by breeding lo
these many years, everybody failed and the

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:09.910
Japanese the Suntory came up with a blue rose
they call Applause. They borrowed a couple

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:10.910
of genes from pansies and petunias and that
is not a pansy or a petunia, it's a rose and

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.910
for $30 a stem you can buy one.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:12.910
[laughter]

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:13.910
One of the pleasures of working on this book
is I got to revisit ecology 50 years after

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:14.910
studying it; a lot has changed. One of the
things that's come along is this term called

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:15.910
ecosystem engineering. It's the sort of thing
that earthworms do beneficially; basically

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:16.910
in the process of making the soil better for
earthworms it makes the soil better for everybody,

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:17.910
including farmers.

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:18.910
Likewise beavers famously make ponds which
then make habitat, ecotones and all the rest

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:19.910
of it and multiply the diversity in any area
that they're permitted to do that.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:20.910
This is one of the reasons that bringing the
wolves back to Yellowstone was so great because

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:21.910
the wolves ate the, scared enough of the elk
that the elk got out of the [inaudible] areas,

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.910
stopped eating all the trees; the beavers
came back [inaudible] trees, started damming

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:23.910
creeks and the biodiversity of those parts
of Yellowstone jumped immediately.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:24.910
One of the great inspirers for me and other
greens is Aldo Leopold. He basically inspired

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:25.910
people to become ecosystem engineers by restoring
natural systems and then he showed how quickly

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.910
he's done it with his own shack in Wisconsin
in Sand County where he took a really frapped

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:27.910
out farm, planted a bunch of trees and lo
a few years later the forest was back.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.910
He undid damage on 150 acres.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.910
We're looking at having to undo damage on
a planet scale. And that's gonna get hairy

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:30.910
'cause here's why.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:31.910
We're realizing that we may not get through
the easy ways to head off greenhouse gases

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:32.910
and climate change. Mitigation may not succeed
soon enough. We see things like what happened

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:33.910
in Copenhagen and that's pretty impressive.
We keep getting more bad news than good news

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:34.910
from climate science. One still hopes that
there's gonna to be something that shows there's

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:35.910
unique stable capability there but that has
yet to emerge.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:36.910
And then as people start looking at geoengineering
the realization is that it is shockingly cheap.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.910
For example, sometimes it's free.

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:38.910
[laughter]

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:39.910
This was Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. It sent 20
million tons of sulfur dioxide, volcanic ash

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:40.910
into the stratosphere which James Hansen predicted
would cool down the planet by half a degree

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:41.910
Celsius and lo and behold next year it was
cool by half a degree Celsius; there was more

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:42.910
ice in the Arctic which meant more polar bears
and the biologists called the cubs Mt. Pinatubo

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:43.910
cubs.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:44.910
So this is the one that the climatologists
think, "Well, if volcanoes can do it, we can

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.910
do it." And of course Nathan and the intellectual
ventures guy wanted to, guys wanted to get

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:46.910
into this. They came up with a notion of blimp-supported
hoses that would carry up 100,000 tons a year

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.910
of sulfur dioxide; they figured three million
tons a year would do it; if you could do it

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:48.910
every year that would be enough to cool the
planet basically three degrees Celsius; head

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:49.910
off doubling the CO2 emitted; and I think
they low balled the price at $300 million

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:50.910
a year.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:51.910
But compare that to the cost of mitigation
and, and think about the attractions of doing

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:52.910
this sort of thing when things get really
hairy.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.910
Now there's, yeah other very cool ideas. This
is one, that's Stephen Salter, the English

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:54.910
engineer designing rotor sails for a ship
that will be robot controlled and satellite

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:55.910
guided that would course up and down; atomizing
sea water; putting the atomized sea water

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:56.910
out so it dries out immediately into little
salt crystals which then becomes the core

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:57.910
of a water droplet which goes up and joins
the ocean clouds and makes them brighter,

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:58.910
thereby brightening the whole damn planet
or at least that part of the oceans by whatever

00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:59.910
degree he wanted to make it.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:00.910
There are so many things to do with the science
on this. There, there's two whole branches

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:01.910
of this. I've been to some of the meetings
withengineering. How the hell do we actually

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:02.910
do it? There's a bunch of retired Silicon
Valley engineers who are looking at this thing

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:03.910
as a very large ink jet printer.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.910
[laughter]

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:05.910
Along with them are atmospheric physicists
and others saying, "Well, just a damn minute.

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.910
We don't know a whole lot of stuff like how
many particles does it take to actually make

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:07.910
clouds? What size are the clouds really like?
And by the way, how do clouds actually work

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:08.910
it, with climate?" We don't know that yet
so it's, lots to do.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:09.910
One that everybody sort of feels good about
remains to be seen if it were really played

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:10.910
out is biochar; that is pyrolizing smoldering
agricultural waste, turning it into charcoal

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:11.910
which is a tremendously stable molecule and
at least in the Amazon the way the Indians

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:12.910
did it stayed in the ground for 4,000 years.
That may be a way to fix carbon on a large

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:13.910
scale. And, and marginal soil becomes much
better soil you can amend with this stuff.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:14.910
So this all adds up to what Paul Crutzen is
calling the anthroposophy. We are now in a

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.910
geological era where we've ended the holocene;
the anthropocene is in humans are affecting

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:16.910
things that are visible on a geological scale.
Things we're doing with the atmosphere may

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:17.910
be with us for tens of thousands of years.
And so we are terraforming the earth and if

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:18.910
we're gonna terraform it badly that is terrible.
We don't have a choice at this point with

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:19.910
6.8 billion people to not terraform.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:20.910
So our only choice is to terraform well, hence
the realization that at this time we are earth's

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:21.910
gods and we have to get good at it. I think
we're shifting toward pragmatism.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:22.910
The way I would sum it up is to say the ecological
balance is too important for sentiment. It

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:23.910
requires science.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:24.910
The health, health of natural infrastructure
is too compromised for passivity. It requires

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:25.910
engineering.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.910
What we call natural and what we call human
are inseparable.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:27.910
We live one life.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:28.910
Thank you.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:29.910
[applause]

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:30.910
There's a slide that will come up automatically
with some of the book references if you wanna

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:31.910
look any of this stuff up and I would point
you that the Eskie notes a link on the right

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:32.910
gets you to the augmented, illustrated, updated
online version of the book which only a few

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.910
people know about. But if you like the book,
you'll find it. All the sources are there

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:34.910
with live links and lots of other things I've
stolen from all over the Web thanks to you

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:35.910
at Google images.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.910
[laughter]

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:37.910
&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: So we have, we have time for
some questions. Please come up and use the

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:38.910
mic and when we're done with Q and A then
I believe we have a number of copies of Stewart's

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:39.910
book that he'll be signing. So, here's the
mic.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.910
Well while we're waiting well-- so one of
the issues that we've been paying a lot of

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:41.910
attention to here is the cost of clean energy.
What can you say about the cost in particular

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:42.910
of nuclear and whether we can afford to deploy
it at the massive scale that would be needed

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:43.910
toget the mitigation that we need?

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:44.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: This is one of the reasons
I like the small modular reactors is the sticker

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:45.910
shock of building a 1.6 gigawatt machine for
multi-billions of dollars is now answered.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:46.910
Al Gore likes to say that nuclear power comes
in only one size extra large. And that has

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:47.910
been the case, but it is no longer. Recently
the case with down to 25 megawatts is one

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:48.910
small town, one reactor.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:49.910
The advantages on that are that you don't
have a huge capital cost to get really going

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:50.910
because these things are modular they're built
to work in series so you can if you like the

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:51.910
one, get another, get another, and the whole
process becomes of a much more manageable

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:52.910
scale.

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:53.910
And the other great advantage is if you can
have it locally it means you're not dependent

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:54.910
on the problems of the grid which is famously
where all the breakdowns occur.

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:55.910
You get more resilience in the grid; you shortcut
the 20% or so losses that you have running

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:56.910
your electricity long distances like where
doing and so on.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:57.910
So that's the story. I seem to get a lot of
questions.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:58.910
So next.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:59.910
&gt;&gt;Q: Yeah. One of your quotes had to do with
having less emotion and being more scientific

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.910
about this, but it seems like part of the
challenge.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:01.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: I thought it might be emotion.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:02.910
&gt;&gt;Q: Right. Yeah, part of the challenge with
nuclear energy is people have very strong

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:03.910
emotional feelings about it and I was wondering
whether they're based in fact. How, how do

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:04.910
you propose that that particular problem gets
addressed?

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:05.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: To some extent it's, it's
kind of offsetting emotions 'cause people

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:06.910
are getting emotional about climate. And the
environmentalists that I've seen change their

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.910
mind; and I'm one of them, typically got brought
to thinking differently about nuclear by thinking

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:08.910
differently about climate than they had before.

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.910
An example is Stephen Tindale in England who
was head of Greenpeace UK and when he heard

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:10.910
about the positive feedback of methane coming
out of the melting permafrost he freaked out.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:11.910
And it got him looking at nuclear and it,
with him as with me he realized there's a

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.910
lot more to nuclear than he thought. He started
asking around his other environmentalist friends,

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:13.910
especially the younger ones, and they were
having the same, what he called "religious

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:14.910
conversion."

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.910
And Stephen went all the way. He is now a
paid consultant and a spokesperson for the

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:16.910
nuclear industry. [laughs]

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:17.910
[laughter]

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:18.910
I'm not doing that.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:19.910
[laughter]

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:20.910
&gt;&gt;Walker Kelly: Hi Walker Kelly. Thank for
coming. I've yet to read your book.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:21.910
You have contributed with the books also here
and in your book to help me change my mind

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:22.910
about some of the things I felt very strongly
about. So thank you for that.

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:23.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Wow.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.910
&gt;&gt;Walker Kelly: I did have one question, though.
As, as you mentioned previously the, the number

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:25.910
one enemy Monsanto, they have, they're, they're
driven by profits if I understand as well

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:26.910
as the, the common good. And in order...

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:27.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Are you certain about profit...

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:28.910
&gt;&gt;Walker Kelly: Monsanto and...

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:29.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: And and other companies we
might...

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:30.910
&gt;&gt;Walker Kelly: Of course.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.910
[laughter]

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:32.910
So I, I preface that by saying that one of
their, one of the reasons why they're doing

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.910
the genetic engineering is for patents on
seeds. And I'm curious how we can protect

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:34.910
farmers and other agricultural engineers you
could say, from the problems of seeing cross-pollination

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:35.910
and having farmers being pursued litigiously
for ending up with genetically engineered

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:36.910
products in their fields even though they
didn't start with it; just as a, a process

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:37.910
of nature's genetic engineering. So what have
you...

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:38.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Well it's a great question
and first of all I think environmentalists

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:39.910
trying to speak for farmers usually is embarrassing;
it should be both parties because farmers

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:40.910
are customers in this case. And the idea that
somehow all of these farmers are being hoodwinked

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.910
and they, they need to be protected by farmer
spirited environmentalists-- you're getting

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:42.910
between a vendor and a customer there in an
unnecessary way.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:43.910
Farmers are real good at sorting out their
own needs and interests and that there's,

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.910
every farmer basically gets seed from a number
of different suppliers, catalogs, local seed

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.910
dist, vendors and so on. And the minute they're
not happy with Monsanto they'll buy seeds

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:46.910
from someone else.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:47.910
And even engineered seeds are now coming from
Syngenta, Dow, Dupont. So there's real competition

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:48.910
there; I'm not so worried about that.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:49.910
But you raised a point of intellectual property
defense and I think Monsanto is...

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:50.910
it has done things like, first of all, patenting
naturally occurring genes, which always I

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:51.910
think is a strange thing to do.

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:52.910
Techniques of research that get patented and
then kept away from academic researchers around

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.910
the world strikes me as a real bad thing to
do. And once you find the ways to-- I would

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:54.910
love to see environmentalists and everybody
else go after them to keep that from happening

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:55.910
very much.

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:56.910
One advantage of patent law is that you get
your 20 years and then it's over. So for example,

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:57.910
the first Roundup Ready soy beans are coming
out of patent this year. And they're, they're

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:58.910
trying to do Roundup Ready II soy beans, but
meanwhile the thing that they developed is

00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:59.910
out there.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:00.910
Roundup itself glycosade came out of patent
around 2000 and instantly dropped a third

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:01.910
to a third of price and everybody's using
it now 'cause it's such a good herbicide.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:02.910
So I think that, Monsanto's a mixed bag.

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:03.910
&gt;&gt;Walker Kelly: Thank you.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:04.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Thanks.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:05.910
&gt;&gt;Q: And I think that nuclear, large scale
nuclear is not inherently expensive. In the

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:06.910
late '60's and early 70's they were built
for inflation adjusted prices that are cheaper

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:07.910
than coal plants are built today, so it's,
it is cheap. But what really happened is there

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:08.910
a perverse incentive the way we regulate utilities.
We guarantee them a certain profit on their

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.910
capital investment.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:10.910
So we shouldn't be surprised if they inflate
the capital investment. If there's some kind

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:11.910
of regulatory interference that they can address
by adding a new safety system that costs an

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.910
extra million dollars and they get 10.7% guaranteed
return on that investment by the CPUC they're

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:13.910
going to not fight really, really hard to
turn down that investment opportunity.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:14.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: You're right about that.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:15.910
&gt;&gt;Q: So, so we've doubled or tripled the real
cost of building power plants because we doubled

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:16.910
and tripled the opportunity for those companies.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:17.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: I would assume that some
developing countries will work around that

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:18.910
they're not dealing with US--

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:19.910
&gt;&gt;Q: China is currently building 58 or so
power plants at about a $50 a watt.

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:20.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: The numbers I hear are is
that there are something like 400 reactors

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:21.910
being planned for.

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:22.910
&gt;&gt;Q: So it, it, we don't need small nuclear
power plants to solve this problem, we just

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:23.910
need to fix our regulatory process so we allow
the building of big power plants for actual

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:24.910
costs.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:25.910
&gt;&gt;stewart Brand: Thank you.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:26.910
One point on the earlier question; I meant
to point out is the, the question of gene

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:27.910
flow. What happens when BT corn pollen goes
over to the organic corn guy nearby and he

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:28.910
winds up getting some of these [laughs] better
genes in his corn -

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:29.910
[laughter]

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.910
and complains vociferously that he can't sell
organic anymore?

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:31.910
Well that is one way of thinking about it.
But it's interesting how it played out in

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:32.910
India.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.910
There's a book called "Hybrid" that I just
read that in the chapter toward the end said

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:34.910
that the future was creole. And what he pointed
out was when BT cotton came to India and over

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:35.910
the vociferous complaints of the pesticide
companies who saw that there was going to

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:36.910
be a lot less pesticide used in India, and
by anti-globalists like Sheba who said these

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:37.910
are suicide genes, they're horrible, the usual,
and Monsanto set up a of couple of test plots

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:38.910
of BT cotton in India and immediately started
losing some of their plants from these test

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:39.910
plots, quite a lot of shrinkage.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:40.910
And then pretty soon suddenly there's a lot
of land raised cotton around that part of

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:41.910
India and then all over India which is caterpillar
proof, because the guys had stolen the BT

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.910
cotton plants then bred it with their own
land raised cotton, the local stuff which

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:43.910
was now caterpillar proof and that's the creole
effect. There was suddenly 50 different versions

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:44.910
of somewhat BT land raised cotton all over
India.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:45.910
So is, these robbers are not working against
their own interests. And it is, it's a kind

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:46.910
of a squatter city sort of thing. People find
their way to make stuff actually work.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:47.910
Yeah.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:48.910
&gt;&gt;Q: I wanted to thank you for the wonderful
work that you've done over the years, but

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:49.910
today I had a question for you since you seem
to be sort of crunching numbers. I wonder

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:50.910
if you're familiar with Klaus Lackner's synthetic
trees?

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:51.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Yeah.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:52.910
&gt;&gt;Q: Yeah. Have you looked at that and do
you have some analysis of whether or not that's

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:53.910
even feasible?

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:54.910
&gt;&gt;stewart Brand: I am nowhere near competent
to guess whether Klaus Lackner's carbon eating

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:55.910
trees will really work. I hope they will.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:56.910
&gt;&gt;Q: Me too.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:57.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: And by the way I will, I
will put forward a, another carbon capture

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:58.910
technique that Gregory Benford came up with
with someone else; the science fiction writer

00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.910
and physicist, Gregory Benford.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.910
He said, "Well, hey let's just do it quick
and easy . What you do is you take about a

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.910
third of your agricultural waste from any
place of any agriculture and take away; it

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:02.910
won't harm the soil and you go through all
this process of pyrolizing it in a bio jar.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.910
Christ why not just bale it, put it in a truck,
take it to the ocean, dump it in the ocean;

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:04.910
bales will sink to the bottom; the carbon
will stay there for thousands of years, what

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:05.910
about that?

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:06.910
And it doesn't work out in terms of the cost
of transportation and so on-- yeah it does.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:07.910
So basically I love that and you can just
start doing it; today; without even pyrolizing;

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:08.910
just truck it, bale it. Imagine that.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:09.910
&gt;&gt;Q: Hello. I keep hearing very good arguments
for using chlorium as a nuclear fuel. Like

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:10.910
ranging from the amount of waste to all sorts
of may making fuels and arms control and,

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:11.910
and the availability of chlorium which is
much, much larger than, than uranium.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:12.910
On the other hand, it seems that the industry
as it stands today is not really looking into

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:13.910
that and I'm wondering if this is because
they are not actually selling nuclear power

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:14.910
and nuclear reactors but they are selling
the, the, the uranium fuel cycle, but that

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:15.910
is like that--

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:16.910
&gt;&gt;stewart Brand: There's probably many here
who saw it; the Wired article several months

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:17.910
ago on chlorium and there's a fad going for
it which I think is just great. Some fads

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:18.910
are hula hoops and some fads are jogging;
you never know which it is until you've had

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:19.910
it for--

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:20.910
[laughter]

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.910
But indeed there's supposedly three times
as much chlorium as there is uranium around.

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:22.910
India in particular has very large quantities
of chlorium and is one here is going ahead

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:23.910
on developing program which is great.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:24.910
James Lovelock tells me that everybody says
there's no proliferation aspect to it, but

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.910
he says there is a U235 process, a model U235
that comes out of using chlorium reactors

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:26.910
that if you were a really hard working inventive
military type you could figure out a way to

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:27.910
make weapons, concentrate that and make weapons
out of it.

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.910
So it's not perfect. But guess what [laughs]
if something were easy and perfect we would

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:29.910
have already have done it. So it remains to
be seen how chlorium plays out when it, when

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:30.910
it's added to the mix.

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:31.910
How's our time. It's just about one o'clock.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:32.910
&gt;&gt;Bill Wile: Pretty close. Anymore questions?

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:33.910
Okay. Well please join me in thanking Stewart.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:34.910
&gt;&gt;Stewart Brand: Thank you.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.911
[applause]
