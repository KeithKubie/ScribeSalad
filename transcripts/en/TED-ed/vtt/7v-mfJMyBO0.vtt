00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.070
In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,
"The Handmaid's Tale,"

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
a Christian fundamentalist regime
called the Republic of Gilead

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.491
has staged a military coup
and established a theocratic government

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.513
in the United States.

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:24.241
The regime theoretically 
restricts everyone,

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:30.123
but in practice a few men have structured
Gilead so they have all the power,

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:33.331
especially over women.

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:37.711
The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls
speculative fiction,

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.712
meaning it theorizes 
about possible futures.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:42.582
This is a fundamental characteristic

00:00:42.582 --> 00:00:46.181
shared by both utopian 
and dystopian texts.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:50.863
The possible futures in Atwood's novels
are usually negative, or dystopian,

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:57.413
where the actions of a small group
have destroyed society as we know it.

00:00:57.413 --> 00:01:02.273
Utopian and dystopian writing
tends to parallel political trends.

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:05.624
Utopian writing frequently depicts
an idealized society

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.525
that the author puts forth as a blueprint
to strive toward.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.325
Dystopias, on the other hand,

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.723
are not necessarily predictions 
of apocalyptic futures,

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:18.604
but rather warnings about the ways
in which societies can set themselves

00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:21.902
on the path to destruction.

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:26.335
The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,
when many conservative groups

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:30.255
attacked the gains made 
by the second-wave feminist movement.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:34.375
This movement had been advocating greater
social and legal equality for women

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.615
since the early 1960s.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.605
The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future
in which the conservative

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.586
counter-movement gains 
the upper hand

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:47.376
and not only demolishes the progress
women had made toward equality,

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:51.805
but makes women completely 
subservient to men.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:55.576
Gilead divides women in the regime
into distinct social classes

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.072
based upon their function
as status symbols for men.

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.476
Even their clothing is color-coded.

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.211
Women are no longer allowed to read

00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.581
or move about freely in public,

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:08.757
and fertile women are subject
to state-engineered rape

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:13.697
in order to give birth to children
for the regime.

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:16.086
Although The Handmaid's Tale
is set in the future,

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:19.197
one of Atwood's self-imposed
rules in writing it

00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:21.506
was that she wouldn't use any event

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:25.387
or practice that hadn't already 
happened in human history.

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:28.357
The book is set 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:30.987
a city that during 
the American colonial period

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:34.633
had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.702
In many ways, the Republic of Gilead
resembles the strict rules

00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:40.407
that were present in Puritan society:

00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:41.667
rigid moral codes,

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.159
modest clothing,

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.039
banishment of dissenters,

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:50.349
and regulation of every aspect 
of people's lives and relationships.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.709
For Atwood, the parallels 
to Massachusett's Puritans

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.399
were personal as well as theoretical.

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.348
She spent several years studying
the Puritans at Harvard

00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:01.919
and she's possibly descended from
Mary Webster,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.549
a Puritan woman accused
of witchcraft who survived her hanging.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.180
Atwood is a master storyteller.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.639
The details of Gilead, 
which we've only skimmed the surface of,

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.549
slowly come into focus through the eyes
of its characters,

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.402
mainly the novel's protagonist Offred,

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:23.689
a handmaid in the household 
of a commander.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.740
Before the coup that established Gilead,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.900
Offred had a husband, a child, a job,
and a normal, middle-class American life.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.580
But when the fundamentalist regime
comes into power,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.210
Offred is denied her identity,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.500
separated from her family,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.202
and reduced to being, in Offred's words,

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:46.231
"a two-legged womb for increasing 
Gilead's waning population."

00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.271
She initially accepts the loss 
of her fundamental human rights

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.871
in the name of stabilizing 
the new government.

00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.276
But state control soon extends
into attempts to control the language,

00:03:57.276 --> 00:03:58.142
behavior,

00:03:58.142 --> 00:04:01.642
and thoughts of herself
and other individuals.

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:03.631
Early on, Offred says,

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:07.202
"I wait. I compose myself.

00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:13.413
My self is a thing I must compose, 
as one composes a speech."

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:17.362
She likens language 
to the formulation of identity.

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:21.652
Her words also acknowledge 
the possibility of resistance,

00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:26.363
and it's resistance, the actions of people
who dare to break the political,

00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:27.315
intellectual,

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:28.625
and sexual rules,

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.273
that drives the plot 
of the Handmaid's Tale.

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:37.403
Ultimately, the novel's exploration
of the consequences of complacency,

00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:40.422
and how power can be wielded unfairly,

00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:45.383
makes Atwood's chilling vision
of a dystopian regime ever relevant.
