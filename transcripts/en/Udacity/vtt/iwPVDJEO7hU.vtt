00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's pick a second exercise, we have now a loaded coin

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that mostly comes up tails with 0.1 chance it comes up heads.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I gave you the formulas for how to compute the mean of the outcome.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The mean is just the probability and the variance.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This comes without proof, but in the next optional units, we'll prove this expression together.
