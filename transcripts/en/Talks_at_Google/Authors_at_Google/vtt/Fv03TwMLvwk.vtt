RACHEL O'MARA: Hi, everyone,
and thanks for coming today.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.930
I'm Rachel O'Mara,
and I'm really

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.310
excited to host
Tosha Silver, who's

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.175
here to talk today at Google
about her book, "Outrageous

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:13.500
Openness."

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.079
And I'm excited because
I got introduced

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.720
to Tosha and her
work last spring.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.190
I got a copy of her earlier
version of this book

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.630
and was fascinated by all
of the tales and anecdotes

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.090
that Tosha had experienced that
really told a really good story

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.840
about things that happened
in her life serendipitously,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.410
and just ways that were
more open than others,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.230
and coincidences.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.120
And I just really liked it
from a world of figuring out

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.590
how that related to me
and all the coincidences

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.320
that I've also
witnessed in my life.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.550
So I'm very excited
to bring her in today

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.040
to talk about her book,
and to answer questions,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.270
and to learn and share
a little bit more

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.850
about outrageous openness.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.550
So without further ado,
let me introduce Tosha.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.160
Thank you!

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.068
TOSHA SILVER: Hi.

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:05.109
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.570
Let me talk first about what
this book is really about,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.700
and then I'll give
you a few examples.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.810
The nature of what drove me
to write this, in some ways,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.840
really came originally from
growing up in a very type

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.470
A sort of family, where there
was enormous amounts of drive.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.390
It was like an East
Coast Jewish family

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.710
where you really had
to prove yourself.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170
I went on to Yale.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.530
I had to prove myself there.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.980
You know, all that
typical stuff-- living

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.520
on the East Coast, the
ideas of competition,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.560
the ideas of making
your mark, making it all

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.330
happen, what, in a lot of ways,
spiritually is called doership,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.590
because it's the small self.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.520
It's the ego trying to take
the lead and prove its worth.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.690
So I'm not saying that there's
anything wrong with that.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.110
However, by the time I got to
the age of 30 living that way,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.220
I had adrenal failure.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.060
And I'd become quite ill.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000
And I write about
it in the book.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.880
And I had actually
done everything

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880
exactly the way that I
was trained to do it.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.180
And I was very ill.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.010
So at that juncture,
I had to begin

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.470
to take apart what
I had been taught

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.110
and go on a spiritual journey
to learn a different way

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.170
to live that involved this
outrageous openness, which,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.090
really, when you get
down to is actually

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.750
how to let this force
of love-- it's called

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440
different things in
different systems-- the dao,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.370
or the shakti, or God,
or love, or eternity.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.860
How to let that force actually
take the lead instead of how

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.330
to let the small self, the
mind, the push, the force, the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.280
"do it now," the
"if I don't do it,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.510
it won't get done," how
to let that energy lead.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.820
Which, living in a culture that
is very alpha-driven, oriented,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.920
that's what's rewarded.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.920
However, ultimately,
that's what can make you,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.486
as it happened to
me, quite sick.

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:33.360
Now, it doesn't always
happen that the person

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.810
gets physically sick, right?

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.430
I mean, you can
just get overwhelmed

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.039
because it's such a burden.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.455
And the burden of
it-- and this is

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:43.529
like, it doesn't matter even if
you're a super person, which,

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.820
in some ways, I'm figuring
anybody that works at Google

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.490
is sort of a super person.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.510
Just like when I was
at Yale, everybody

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.730
considered themselves
super people.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.090
And what was happening was
that the burden of doership,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.720
this idea that if you don't
make it happen, it won't happen,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.190
is exhausting.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.170
And so many things
have come in now.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.160
Like, I know this is the
week that people are talking

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.750
about mindfulness
training, and yoga has now

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.269
infiltrated the culture.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.050
I've done yoga for
about 20 years.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.214
However, very few people
talk-- even when you're

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:26.130
talking about mindfulness,
or even when you're

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.870
talking about yoga,
or even when you're

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.450
talking about meditation,
very few people

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.980
say, how do you actually
let go on a practical level

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.690
and let anything larger
than the ego run things?

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.320
How do you actually
invite this force of love

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.800
or invite this great
self, this great mind?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.060
How do you do it?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.410
That's the voyage I was on.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.302
Once I got sick and
I began to open up,

00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:57.960
I realized, there was lots
of information out there.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.460
Like, oh, you should
just surrender.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.890
You should take more vacations.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.210
You should learn to let go.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.670
But that's not actually
what this is about.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.590
This is about the
act of invitation.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.670
And this is really what
this book is about.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.050
How do you actively
invite in the divine?

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.410
I'm calling the divine love, the
dao, you can call it anything.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.150
How do you actively invite this?

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.400
Almost nobody is
writing about that.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.610
So this book goes way beyond
synchronicity and coincidence.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.250
I'm saying, how do you
actually build a relationship

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.450
to this force of love so that
it can begin to guide your life?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.920
Because it all sounds good.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.020
It's like, oh, yeah,
surrender sounds great.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.790
Or letting go sounds great.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.360
But on a pragmatic
level, how do you do it?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.480
And so especially
in a culture that

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.620
only rewards you
carry the burden,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.450
you make it happen,
it's all on you,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.820
if you let, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.850
And what I began
to find is that you

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.850
can engage with
this force of love

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.970
just like you would an
individual person that you

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.670
are very excited to meet.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.020
You can engage with
this force of love

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.650
on even the most mundane topics.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.310
And it will begin
to respond back.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.280
That great it, that
great one is sort

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.270
of waiting to engage with us,
which is why Walt Whitman said

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.270
in his poetry,
"the sidewalks are

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.060
littered with
postcards from God."

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.400
Everywhere you go, this
force is waiting to engage.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.550
And all that it's taking
is this act of invitation.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.050
And because it's a culture
that's not about invitation--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.460
those are considered
very passive things.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.380
It's about invitation
to that force.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.190
It's about offering
to that force.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.070
So I'll give you an example.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.700
On my way here today,
somebody said, well,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.190
you know-- I was talking
to a friend on the phone

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.250
as I was driving over.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.457
And she said, well,
aren't you worried?

00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:16.040
What if there's a
lot of people there?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.640
Aren't you worried?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.090
What if there's no people there?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.190
And I said, it doesn't matter!

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.260
All the people that need to
see this, all the people that

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.404
need to be in the room
are already selected.

00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:28.820
And they're all
going to be there.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.820
That's why whoever's
here is here.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.590
Anybody who needs
to see the video

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.480
later is all going to
see the video later.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.900
So it sounds like fatalism.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.790
But it's really so
far beyond that.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:47.640
In the book, it's a term
that I call divine selection.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.900
And some of these things
came from, originally,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.030
from a book with a really hokey
name called "The Game of Life

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.570
and How to Play It" by this
writer back in the 1940s

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.990
named Florence Scovel Shinn.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.090
But these ideas of divine
order, divine selection,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.460
they all tie to surrender,
because what they mean

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.000
is the perfect route
is already picked.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.520
It's really how to move with
the dao, if you know anything

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.990
about-- or how to
surf the wave, or how

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.847
to, rather than-- I have
friends that are surfers.

00:08:21.847 --> 00:08:23.555
And they're always
saying, oh, this stuff

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:25.120
is just like surfing.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.050
It's not that you
don't go in the water.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.660
It's not that you don't
train to be a great surfer.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.470
But once you're in
the wave, you're

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.049
not there controlling the wave.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.539
In fact, if you try to control
the wave, you will crash.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.049
So it's actually about how to
let go and move with things.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.300
And the way to move with them
is invitation and offering.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.530
So that's a lot of what I'm
writing about in the book.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:57.430
In a way, you could say it's
the divine feminine that's

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.930
available to everybody,
regardless of gender.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.660
You're inviting the
force of receptivity.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.449
So for example, to go back
again to this idea of,

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:09.490
well, aren't you worried?

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.320
Who's going to be--
who's gonna hear this?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.330
Is it a lot of people,
is it a little people?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:19.120
If it's offered, if I think that
the talk-- this talk, whatever

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.380
it is-- belongs to me,
the small self Tosha,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.310
that will go nowhere.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.960
But if I think--
which is honestly

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.930
how I think, and it's
what's in the book--

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.570
this is an offering
to the divine.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.130
No matter what you do, it's
an offering to the divine

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.450
if you're in the
right head space.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.790
So whoever's meant to
hear it will hear it,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.080
because it's now a
gift to the divine.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.830
I love the statues where
you see the goddesses,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.670
and they just are holding the
lotus in their hands like this.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.710
Or you see the Buddha holding.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.670
Everybody is that Buddha to me.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.370
Everybody is that
goddess or that god.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.700
So you're taking whatever it is.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.640
And it can be something
as mundane as a talk

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.640
you have to go give to
your supervisor or the date

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.100
that you have to go on.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.900
I love using examples like
dates or a real estate deal,

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.430
because this is all the stuff
we're told isn't spiritual.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.560
And it's completely spiritual.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.800
There's no separation of
mundane and spiritual.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.170
So let's say you take
something like you're

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.380
going to go on a date.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.120
And everything in the
culture will be like, wow,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.380
you really better look amazing.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.757
And you better wow them.

00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:36.590
Same thing, you're going
on a job interview.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.100
Oh, you better be spectacular.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.330
All of that is the small
self controlling the show.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.020
And because it's a culture
revering the small self,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.850
that's everything we're taught.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.670
Now, again, it has nothing to
do with not preparing or not

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.760
making yourself however
way you are your best.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.130
But it's that the action is
actually offered to the divine.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.910
We'll do a meditation
on it in a little bit.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.460
But you take this burden.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.800
I'm not a big Bible person,
but the Bible talks about it

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.050
directly when they say,
you cast the burden.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.575
You cast the burden
to this great self.

00:11:22.575 --> 00:11:25.076
You cast this
burden to the light

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:27.930
or to this power of
love, whatever it is.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.750
You're in a horrible marriage.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.700
You cast the burden of the
marriage to the divine.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.870
Or the interview, you cast
the burden, or the date.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.440
Because if you keep
going back to that idea

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.810
that every single
thing we're taught

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.330
is that we have to do
it-- and even when I

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.220
was 12 years old, growing up
in my very driven Jewish home,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.910
there was a little
sign above my bed

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.600
when I was 12 years
old that I picked--

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.670
nobody made me have it.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.200
And I had a sign that
said, if you don't do it,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.512
it won't get done.

00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:00.470
That was how I grew up.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.820
This sometimes really gets
mistaken for passivity.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.840
And it has nothing
to do with passivity.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.810
This invitation and offering
and surrender, all of which

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.320
really fill this book, what
it really has to do with

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.340
is letting something
greater than yourself,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.230
which is you-- it's
your high self instead

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.220
of the small self, which
is filled with insecurities

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.510
and fears and competition
and scarcity, and oh,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.810
my god, what if somebody
else gets my job?

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.250
And what if I don't get the
promotion I'm supposed to get?

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.790
And what if somebody
takes my partner?

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.140
All that is the small self.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.465
The high self, the great
self, is the one that goes,

00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:55.480
everything that's meant
for me will always happen.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.170
There's that quality of
destiny guiding everything,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.700
that quality of,
I'm now offering it.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.410
Once it's offered
to this greatness,

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.510
once it's offered
to this great self

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.410
that you are,
beyond all illusion

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.200
that you're only that
grasping thing that

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.130
has to keep making sure
that everything that's

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.180
meant to happen
happens, once that part

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.300
is no longer the identity,
then what takes over

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.420
is the great self.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:33.230
And what was happening for me is
that even though these are not

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.340
new ideas-- you can go back
in scriptures from Hinduism,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.600
Buddhism, Christianity
in some ways, Judaism,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.660
lots of religions,
Islam, they're

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.690
really speaking about how
do you offer things over.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.750
But I'm not a religious person.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.790
I'm really a
spiritual pragmatic,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.540
a spiritual pragmatist.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.010
And so to me, it was
like, how do you do it?

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.060
How do you let go
of control and begin

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.550
to trust that something larger
will guide your actions?

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.320
Because it's not doing nothing.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.470
It's offering it so that
the right actions always

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.180
arise at the right time.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.532
You begin to move with the flow.

00:14:14.532 --> 00:14:15.490
That's what it's about.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.650
And that's actually how
synchronicity emerges.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:23.290
So you can take any single
thing that you're in

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.396
and imagine, really,
whether you even

00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:28.020
think of yourself as
a spiritual person

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.460
or not, you can take any single
thing you're in-- I kind of do

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.300
it all day long with
everything-- and say,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:40.290
to this force of love,
I now offer this to you.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.250
You decide, show me the way.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.800
If it's not meant to happen
now, sometimes it's the timing.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.630
It's meant to happen later.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.930
If this isn't the
right person, open

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.300
me to trusting that the
right person is picked.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.600
If this isn't the
right opportunity,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.680
open me to knowing that the
right opportunity can come.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.910
It really starts
to become, like,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:08.970
a general language--
not just a language.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.660
It really opens
everything into being

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.550
a dance with this
divine instead of a push

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.930
and a force, which,
ultimately, for me,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.020
took me to adrenal failure.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.450
And then I got better
from an acupuncturist.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:33.990
And this is really
how it happened.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.900
And one thing I like to
say, because I really

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:46.290
think this is how it works, is
as you begin to live this way,

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:52.240
this is actually a line that's
from a great non-dualist saint

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.490
named Nisargadatta
Maharaj, from India.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.990
He lived earlier in the century.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.980
He had this line where
he said, "life begins

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:06.880
to happen for you and through
you rather than by you."

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.970
And this is it.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.770
It's like everything we're
taught in a culture of go, go,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.800
go, get it all, it
has to happen by us.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.320
And then here's the problem with
having it to happen all by you,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.650
is that then you
can also lose it.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.860
Then all these things, like,
oh, get it, get it, get it,

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.300
you could lose
them at any point,

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.860
because the nature of this
world is so impermanent.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.000
But if you're offering, and
you're inviting the divine,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.740
and you're giving it
over, and you're saying,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.820
make me a conduit, let
everything happen through me--

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.880
anybody can say this.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.720
I'm not special.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.700
I just was desperate
and had to learn

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.690
how to live like this
because I got sick.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.010
When you begin to do
that, it's just what

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.970
Nisargadatta Maharaj said.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:57.060
Everything begins to happen
through you and for you,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.220
not by you.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.520
And not only for you.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.090
They begin to happen
for everybody else.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.310
This is the thing, is you
start to actually become

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.530
a conduit for the good.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.710
In really weird ways.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.890
Like, you get on a bus, and
all of a sudden the person

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.020
next to you ends
up-- something you

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.349
need to say to them happens.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:20.180
They end up being next to
you, because you say one line,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.869
and they're like,
wow, thank you.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:22.849
I needed to hear that.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:24.770
I'm sure you've all
had that experience.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.200
But it begins to happen
more and more and more,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.850
because you're actually
inviting the universe

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.130
to begin to use
you as a conduit,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.750
because you're offering
rather than saying,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.900
you have to do it
all, the small self.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.879
I'll give you a really
funny example of that.

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:44.170
Actually, I don't have a watch.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.205
So I don't even know
what time I'm on here.

00:17:46.205 --> 00:17:47.754
Might want to tell me.

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.572
RACHEL O'MARA: Yeah, it's 12:20.

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:50.655
TOSHA SILVER: OK, perfect.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.230
Somebody reached me this week.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.460
It's just a good example
of how to do offering,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.900
because I do it for everything.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.010
Somebody reached me this week
who has a number of books out.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.880
And it's really
common for authors

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.360
to collaborate and hook
up with each other.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.320
And so somebody
reached out to me.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.600
And I got this message.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.010
Do you want to collaborate
with this person

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.130
and maybe do some
events together?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.590
Now, if I was thinking of
this from my small self,

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.610
from the mind,
which is how we're

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:30.560
taught to think, the small self
is going, oh, I don't know.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.110
Our writing doesn't really
have that much in common.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.870
Now, from a
marketing standpoint,

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.300
it would be, well, you
have to because there's

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.134
a big market there.

00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:40.800
And you'll bring your
market, and she'll

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.460
bring her market,
and blah, blah.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.030
But again, when you're offering
things to divine order,

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.520
you're not doing it
purely for marketing.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.960
And you're not doing it even
from the small self going,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.630
oh, I don't know if
we'd be a good fit.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.350
So what I did is I offered it.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.970
And I just said, on
a practical level,

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.250
OK, god, universe,
this is yours.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:10.660
If it's your idea that I'm meant
to collaborate with this woman,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.790
make it clear.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.560
I'm open.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.210
If it's supposed to happen, yes.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.220
If it's not a good
idea, let it go.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.810
So about 20 minutes
after I did this,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.470
I open up the "San Francisco
Chronicle" or the "Weekly,"

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.420
and here's this story
with Elvis Costello.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.460
And Elvis-- you
know, the musician.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.850
And he's talking
exactly in this story

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.690
about how he's had to
learn-- he's, like,

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.010
written between
400 and 500 songs.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.520
And even though he really comes
from a background of rock,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.180
he's learned how to
collaborate with almost anyone,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.520
because his feeling is, this
is how you really learn.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.500
But at the same time,
he said, but the key

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.970
to collaborating with
anybody is knowing

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.690
you never have to
lose who you are.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.010
So his thing is he'll
basically collaborate

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.530
with the San Francisco Symphony.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.460
He'll collaborate
with jazz musicians.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.170
He'll do anything
as long as he knows,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.660
I don't care what
they think of me,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.970
and I don't have to
modulate my own message.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.110
Then, anybody-- it's
a kind of fertility

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.552
comes, because you're not
changing your essence.

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:30.690
And I knew in that moment--
because I had, to be honest,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.106
never opened up a newspaper
with an article from anybody

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:36.980
about why you should
collaborate with people.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.570
It was crazy.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.190
And there's Elvis Costello.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.010
So it was like, in that
message, I knew in that moment,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.390
you should say
yes to this woman.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.230
You know, that my fear
was coming from the place

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:56.180
that I would have to lose the
purity or the essence of what

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.890
my work was about and
somehow accommodate her work.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.180
And he's saying,
oh, absolutely not.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.620
I'll go work with the
San Francisco Symphony,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.710
and I just come as
a rock musician.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.455
And then we have
this great dynamic

00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:14.280
of bringing together
these different worlds.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.000
Anyway, it's the kind of
thing that happens for me

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.920
and can happen really for
you, for anybody all day long.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.050
Because as you're
taking something,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.200
say, like, a simple
question, do I

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.370
collaborate with somebody who
I'm not so sure I want to?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.860
I could have opened
the paper and I

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.140
could have gotten a
message that said no.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.070
No, don't.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.940
Because that equally can happen.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.160
It's like, each case
is so different.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.450
And then you end up not having
to come from just a stock

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.750
response that says, oh, yeah,
I don't know about that.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.450
Let's just say no, I'm scared.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.100
Or yes, I better
say yes to anything,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.460
because every
opportunity is needed.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.370
You start to be able
to respond to each case

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.120
because it's offered
to the divine.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.350
So I'll say one last thing.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.020
It's actually a
story from the book.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.240
I truly think that this
energy, this force of love

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.360
is always trying to interact.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.840
And one of the stories
that I have in here-- I

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:29.024
have a friend who's very
cynical about this stuff.

00:22:29.024 --> 00:22:30.440
And we're very,
very good friends.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.160
So he's actually fun
to hang out with,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.280
because he's always
making fun of me.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.280
And so he teaches
economics at a university.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.660
And he's always
teasing this idea

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.400
of inviting this
force of the divine.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.150
So in the story, I'm
asking him, I'm saying,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.050
OK, you want to
make fun of this.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.150
But haven't you ever had
this experience where

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.470
you feel like something
greater is clearly

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.390
trying to get your attention?

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.810
And so he told me the
story that's in the book

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.100
that when he was
in college, he had

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.770
a roommate that he was close to.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:13.960
And one night, the roommate went
out to a party or something.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.250
And it was a big snowstorm.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.160
And sometime by
midnight, the roommate

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.820
still hadn't come back.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.539
And my brother
Michael went to sleep.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.330
And by 3:00 in the
morning, all of a sudden

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.605
he woke up with a
start, realizing the guy

00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:32.480
didn't come back.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.380
But he's hearing this voice
in his head screaming,

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.600
Michael, come find
me, come find me!

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.600
And there's nobody in the room.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.040
So he thinks he's going nuts.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.480
So he gets in his car.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.840
He's just operating
on automatic,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.750
which I think many of you
have had that experience.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.310
The great self takes over.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.030
It's the example.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.230
The small self is useless.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.420
He's going on automatic,
getting in the car.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.310
And he just starts
driving, half asleep.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.500
And he ends up
about a quarter mile

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.430
down the road in the
middle of a snowstorm

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:23.480
finding his roommate plowed into
a snow bank, drunk, and stuck.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.140
So he gets him out,
gets him in his own car,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.570
gets him back to the room.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.930
So he's telling me
this whole story.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.735
Like, OK, that happened,
but I made that go away.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.050
What I said to him
is, how could you

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.850
have an experience
like that and not

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.970
have some curiosity to
want to open up to more?

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.970
Some force sent you
that message that

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:57.430
screamed your name while
you were in this room.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.140
He said, look, if I
opened up to that,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.380
I'd have to change
my whole life.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.610
Everything I've done
has been to just

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.640
have my small self take the
lead and go, go, go, go, go,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.660
and claw my way up.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.140
He goes, if I open to this idea
that there is this force that

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.150
knew somehow, clairsentience,
clairaudience,

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.760
whatever you want
to call it, let

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.550
a guy who's a quarter mile
away scream in my ear,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.210
I'd have to rethink everything.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.390
So I love that.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.590
Because you kind of
go, you don't really

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.770
have to rethink everything.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:41.040
All you actually have to do is
put out the barest invitation

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.010
to say, hm, maybe you'd like
to interact with me more.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:53.150
Maybe I can invite you to
run the rest of my work day.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.270
Maybe I can invite you to take
over the relationship I'm in.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.490
Maybe I can invite
you to show me

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:05.310
what the next steps are that you
want to have happen in my life.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.780
It's like, it really starts--
and then, believe me,

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.310
it becomes second nature.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.340
It becomes, I
can't even imagine.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.936
Like, somebody said
to me, oh, where

00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:16.060
are you going to live next?

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.180
I've been talking about
I might be moving.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.240
And I said, oh, I've
offered it over,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.280
and I'll be shown where
I'm going to live next.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.026
And again, I was
saying it to somebody

00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:28.150
who doesn't think this way.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.460
And he's like,
well, that's novel.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.560
And I was like, no, no.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.650
Because if you
offer it genuinely,

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:41.630
and you're saying the highest,
most right place for you

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.600
to live is already
selected, and you'll

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.106
be guided in the perfect
time and the perfect way,

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.950
this is so different than
thinking your small self

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.730
has to run around like a lunatic
figuring out what that place is

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.150
or what that home is.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.630
You're offering it, then you'll
be shown the right action.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.460
So I'm really not
here to convince you,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.650
because I think if you
take it on as a game-- this

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.630
is how I really advise people
do it, with the book as well.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.540
If you try this
as an experiment,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.310
say, for three weeks, to
start living like this,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.880
you may be very, very
surprised by what unfolds.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.090
Because for a lot of
people, all you have to do

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.290
is unlock the door.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.120
You don't have to open it.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.110
You just have to turn the key
in the lock in the barest way.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.140
And maybe we can do
a short meditation.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.430
And I'll just get you started.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.754
Because you can
feel how to do it.

00:27:40.754 --> 00:27:43.045
Although, you don't even have
to do this in meditation.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.620
So just focusing on your breath.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:03.041
And taking in a deep
inhale and a deep exhale.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.920
Breathing in deeply
and breathing out.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.940
And I'd like you just to bring
into your mind something that's

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.920
a big burden right
now, some issue

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.571
that you're really carrying,
that the small self is

00:28:38.571 --> 00:28:39.070
carrying.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:49.690
Whether it's another person, a
job, a family issue, a health

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.430
issue, anything.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:08.680
And I'd like you to imagine
that you can take that issue

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:14.140
and offer it just as if
your hands were cupped.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.710
And you are giving a
present over to a friend.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:28.320
That there is some force of
love, kind of eternal dao,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.630
this great wave of energy
that holds everything,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:41.170
that you can offer just like
a gift, that burden over.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.450
You may even feel,
as you do that,

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.400
as if a certain weight
is leaving your body.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:59.120
Whatever this thing
is, it's so exhausting

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.120
that as it's offered, a
certain lightness comes in.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.990
And that this force perhaps
has been waiting all this time

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:17.970
to take it off your hands and
show you, in the right time

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:23.310
and in the right way,
the actions to take.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:32.470
And just feel for a moment as if
it now belongs-- that problem,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.530
that weight now truly belongs
to this force of love.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.570
It's no longer yours.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.870
The perfect solution, whatever
it is, is already selected

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.772
and will be shown.

00:30:49.772 --> 00:30:51.320
It's completely offered.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:58.890
You might even feel a deep
breath coming into your body

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:04.100
that you can just deeply
exhale as you give it over.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.210
No longer needs
to belong to you.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.350
Whatever the highest
resolution is,

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:24.730
you've now created space
for this great force

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.860
to carry the energy
and show you the way.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.100
And as you're ready,
you can slowly come out.

00:31:41.222 --> 00:31:43.440
And bringing that
awareness with you.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.450
So you can offer things
over as much as you want.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.490
When it's a topic that's
really loaded for me,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.360
and because I have a kind
of obsessive frame of mind

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.020
sometimes, I've offered
it 100 times in a day.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.520
You know?

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.570
Because the training
of the brain is,

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.040
oh, this is your problem.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.237
You have to solve this.

00:32:08.237 --> 00:32:09.070
You better solve it.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.903
You better solve it.

00:32:09.903 --> 00:32:12.090
A lot of times, that
isn't what solves things.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:18.420
But the offering creates
synchronicity in a way

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.620
that almost nothing
else can, because you're

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.502
making the room for
the solutions to come.

00:32:24.502 --> 00:32:26.210
Sometimes what you're
shown is you really

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.310
have to work your butt off.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.680
And you're shown the actions.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.540
So it's not passivity.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.120
But sometimes what you're
shown is do nothing for now.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.940
Wait.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.110
It's not honored in this
culture to do nothing and wait.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.810
Everything is go, go, go,
get it, get it, get it.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.810
But sometimes you could
feel that when you offer it,

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.650
the message you get is nothing.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:48.760
Wait.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.670
Be still.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.967
It's not time yet.

00:32:53.967 --> 00:32:55.050
That's the beauty of this.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.670
You start to be able to move
the same way the seasons

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.310
move or the same way animals
even know how to move.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:06.700
We just get a little
confused, as people, I think,

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.220
because that's how we're taught.

00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:12.320
Anyway.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.694
And I think if
you read the book,

00:33:13.694 --> 00:33:16.240
you'll get a much deeper
sense of how to do this,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.100
because it's really
part of our birthright

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:25.760
to reclaim that ability to
offer and invite and receive,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.420
bring solutions that sometimes
almost nothing else can.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.380
Also, it reminds you
who you actually are,

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.430
which is not the small self.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.880
It's the great self.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.380
Anyone.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.840
So I'd love to open
this to questions, too,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.430
because that's fun.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.206
If you have any.

00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:52.860
AUDIENCE: So if you're doing
this and you read the book,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.310
how do you practice this?

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.600
Is there any way to get
support in doing this?

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.060
TOSHA SILVER: Yeah.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.180
One of the things that
happened on the website-- I

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.620
have a website that you
probably can see on the book.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.479
But it's toshasilver.com.

00:34:13.479 --> 00:34:17.159
And one of the things that
we created on the website

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:22.590
were courses and ways for people
to learn how to practice this.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.860
Because again, very
little in the culture

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.409
says to think this way.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:37.469
So especially if you go on to
the website in the near future,

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:44.300
we have a forum starting that
is basically a way that anybody

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:52.389
can join and work with support,
and answering questions,

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.510
and it's sort of an
intentional community

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.800
online for learning how to
let the divine take the lead.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.840
Because it takes practice.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.360
It really is like
developing a muscle.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.530
It's almost like
developing a dormant part

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.140
of the brain, the
part of the brain

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.220
that rules surrender,
openness, invitation, offering.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.280
And yet knowing
that that's actually

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.320
where a lot of the most
inspired action comes from.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.990
So yeah, if you
go to the website,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.120
there's a forum starting
in about two weeks.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.200
There's a new course
on outrageous openness

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.510
that Simon &amp; Schuster
just put together

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:40.050
that is good basics of how to
follow the ideas in the book.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.930
So there's help.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.224
AUDIENCE: Let's say I,
just like your friend--

00:35:45.224 --> 00:35:46.390
like, it sounds interesting.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.910
I'm open to this idea.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.590
But I just feel like
it's not for me,

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.280
and I'm not sure I
believe in the divine.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:59.280
It's not something I
really feel rooted in.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.490
If I were to just
say, how would I

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.700
know if that's just coincidence?

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.450
Or why should I try
this if I'm happy,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:10.660
if I'm doing what I do, and
it's all working for me already?

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.430
What would you
say to me or those

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.159
that think along those lines?

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:14.950
TOSHA SILVER: Yeah.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.780
Well, the good thing
is despite the fact

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.590
that I come from a
family with six rabbis,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.030
I'm actually not an evangelist
for this way of living.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.570
What I would say
is if you're really

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:31.640
happy with the way your
life is, don't use this.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.570
I'm getting this message
to really the people

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.490
that sense something lacking.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:44.050
And I think that everybody's
in a different place.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:48.180
So if you get a message
inside-- I think also

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:53.120
part of the problem is that
words like "god" and "divine"

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.216
really trigger some people.

00:36:55.216 --> 00:36:56.590
And I write about
it in the book.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.840
Because actually,
what's really funny

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.200
is this book has a fan base
among atheists and agnostics,

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.346
because you don't actually
have to use the word "god."

00:37:08.346 --> 00:37:10.720
I have somebody else that I
know, and he's always saying,

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.178
oh, I don't believe
in any of this.

00:37:12.178 --> 00:37:17.180
And I said to him, imagine
that the same force that

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.200
makes a tree grow-- you
really can't say you

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.260
don't believe in trees.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.910
Something is making
that tree grow.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.700
Something is keeping a
bird aflight in a way

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:33.369
that-- what I did with
him, and it's funny

00:37:33.369 --> 00:37:34.660
because he lives this way, too.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.320
And he was about as
skeptical as you can get.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.070
What I'd really
say to anybody is,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.050
if you have no interest
in this, don't do it.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.470
Doesn't matter to me.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.572
If it's sparking something
in you, that's how you know.

00:37:49.572 --> 00:37:53.110
You get that place
inside of you that goes,

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.570
this is speaking to
something in my heart that's

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.780
an undeveloped part
of this culture.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.110
Now, it's not for everybody.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.890
But if you feel that, then
what I'll say to people is,

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.620
try it as an experiment.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.620
If you really feel
that skeptical

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.070
but you have a
curiosity-- curiosity

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.760
is a beautiful thing--
try it as an experiment.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.430
You don't even have to
know who that force is

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.670
that you're inviting.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.510
Because to me, there's
a great line that says,

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.590
"the god that atheists
don't believe in never

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.610
existed anyway."

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.380
So that's how I see this.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.590
It's not this idea of
the god in some sky

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:41.430
with a long beard
issuing orders.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.140
It's a force of love.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.030
Most people believe
in love somewhere,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.260
because they've
experienced love somewhere.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.840
So what this is
actually about is

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.880
inviting in that force
of love as an experiment

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.474
and beginning to offer
pragmatically things to it.

00:38:59.474 --> 00:39:00.890
AUDIENCE: Do you
think that people

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:05.840
who practice living
their life in this way,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:11.430
that they ultimately
end up making decisions

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:15.720
and living their life in a way
which is for the greater good?

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.840
I was thinking
about the examples

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.260
you were giving
about the business

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.800
deal or the contract
or the-- and I was just

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:30.640
trying to imagine, if you
were asking for the divine

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.972
to lead the way,
then I don't know,

00:39:36.972 --> 00:39:38.430
I just felt like
I had a revelation

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.140
that it seemed like then
that it would be always,

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.590
whatever you did, would
be for the good of all,

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.590
because you wouldn't
make decisions

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:51.200
that would be somehow hurtful.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.470
TOSHA SILVER: Yeah.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.990
I love that question, actually.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:58.819
Because I have had
examples of that.

00:39:58.819 --> 00:40:00.360
Since the book came
out, there's just

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.700
been all these
thousands of letters

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.283
that have come from
all over the place

00:40:03.283 --> 00:40:06.090
with kind of crazy
examples of people that

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.630
were beginning to
live this stuff.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.910
And this woman
wrote me just that.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.280
And she said that she had
taken a job that she really

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.740
didn't like, because she
was getting paid really,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.720
really well and the
perks were great.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.215
And that as she started
to use the book,

00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:25.780
the book isn't
saying, quit your job.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.610
And it's not saying,
stay with your job.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:31.550
It's saying, invite this force
of love to show you the way.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.037
So what happened for her was it
really-- once she offered over

00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:38.820
and she was like, do you want
me to keep this job or not,

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.570
the message started to
come again and again.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.200
Wow, you are
miserable in that job,

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.510
no matter how much
money you're making.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.930
It was an inescapable
message for her.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.430
And so she just wrote me.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.390
She said, in the end, she took
her savings-- she had a lot.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.030
She opened a boutique.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.530
And it was something
she never would

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.946
have had the courage to do,
because she would have thought

00:41:01.946 --> 00:41:05.050
her friends thought a
boutique was ridiculous.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.240
And she's really happy.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.220
So it wasn't like she
was hurting anybody

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.110
by having that job.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.570
But she was hurting herself.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.640
And I think what
you're talking about,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.260
it expands out in a lot
of different dimensions.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.120
Because the way we're taught
to think is, what do I want?

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.470
How do I go get it?

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.345
It's very different.

00:41:22.345 --> 00:41:23.720
Even when you're
looking at books

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.780
like "The Secret," that some
people might be familiar with.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.780
And the whole focus is, how
do I manifest what I want?

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.990
This is very different.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:35.260
This is saying, I'm inviting
in the great self that

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.840
lives inside everybody,
not the guy in the sky,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.280
but this force of
love, and saying,

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.240
you show me the highest,
most inspired actions.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.880
I think you're right.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.050
Over time, the more
you're aligning with that,

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.910
the more people are benefiting.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.300
There's a really
good line from Hafez,

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.050
the Sufi poet some
people may know.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:59.910
And he said, "be the person
that everybody's luck changes

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.490
when you walk in the room."

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.820
And I don't think you have
to go be some saint in Persia

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.670
to live like that.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.290
I think anybody can
live like that once you

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:14.830
stop thinking just, how does
my small self go get everything

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.690
at once?

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.510
And you're actually
thinking, how

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:23.180
do I offer this over to be
shown what actions to take?

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.540
If that's an idea
that intrigues you,

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.180
I would just say,
go play with it.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.622
That's all.

00:42:29.622 --> 00:42:31.080
AUDIENCE: This is
more of a comment

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.100
and a request more
than a question.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.540
So I've read the book,
given it to lots of people.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.100
Don't know if they've read it.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:44.060
But a comment is-- the
request is could you talk more

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.160
about the format of the book
and the inspiration for that?

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.790
And the comment is,
the format of the book

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.480
really worked so well for me.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.940
It's two-, three-, four-page
little anecdotal stories based

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.100
on your life, on the
stories of your friends.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.240
I think they were
excerpts from columns

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.540
that you used to write in
the "San Francisco Examiner."

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.030
And so sometimes I tell
people, like, open the book.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.360
Just pick it up.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.540
Whatever you open to is perfect.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.210
You can read a
little bit at a time.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:22.380
For me, each story, because
it's about real life

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:26.570
and real people,
it's entertaining.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:27.480
I could sit with it.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.920
And the message sometimes
would appear to me immediately.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.900
Or I would sit with it, and
it's just a really cool format.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.870
So I just wanted to say
that and ask you maybe

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.599
if you could speak
about it a bit.

00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:39.390
TOSHA SILVER: Yeah.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:45.560
I love that you're saying
this thing about this joke

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.730
that the book is an oracle.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.850
And I'll say this to people.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.420
I'll say, it's not a book
you have to read start

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.880
to finish like a
conventional book.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.570
You can have a question, and
you can simply say, you know,

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:07.190
what I need to know about
right now about my landlady.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.940
And then you just open it up.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.960
And it's really kind
of fabulous that way,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.120
because you can get-- in a
sense, you could use any book.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.100
You could go use a phone
book that way, too.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.058
You could use anything.

00:44:18.058 --> 00:44:22.650
But this book has
a certain alignment

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.280
with using it that way.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.180
And the other thing, I think,
about what you're saying

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:33.700
is that it kind of goes back to
what Rachel was saying earlier.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.380
People come to this
book when they're ready.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.190
That's why I don't believe
in twisting anybody's arm.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:42.950
When somebody's ready for
it, they're like on fire.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.690
And I get these letters
from all over the world.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.210
And they're like,
I started the book.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.020
I've destroyed my
life now, because I

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.150
missed two days of work.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.960
I did nothing but read it.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.680
I'm completely obsessed with it.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.984
I went and I bought 40
copies for everybody I know.

00:44:57.984 --> 00:44:59.150
There's that kind of person.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.740
Then there's somebody else who
reads it, and they're like,

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.595
I don't relate.

00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:03.170
And I'm like, that's OK.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.000
And then somebody else
says, I picked up the book.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.260
I read two pages.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.680
It wasn't my thing.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.130
A year went by.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.660
Oh, my god, a year later,
I can't stop reading it.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.550
Because they went through
an inner revolution

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.830
that made their soul hungry for
what the message of the book

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:23.870
was.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.420
Or somebody else
writes, and they'll

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:30.480
say, going back to what you
just asked, they'll say,

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.389
somebody gave me this book.

00:45:32.389 --> 00:45:33.430
It's an interesting book.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.530
A lot of people give
it to their exes.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.570
Like, here, I want
you to evolve.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.300
Here's this book.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.920
And it's like, screw you,
I'm not reading this book.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.180
So somebody said, my
ex-husband gave me this book.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:52.190
And I thought it was
sort of witty and funny

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.970
and a good time.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.210
Thanks for writing it.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.570
Then they write me a year later.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:00.080
And they're like, oh,
my god, I read it again.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.890
I actually read it
three more times.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.230
I understand what
you're doing now.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.500
It's not just witty,
funny stories.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:14.690
You're actually showing people
how to hand their lives over

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:18.400
to a force greater
than themselves

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.350
and how to let a force
of love guide things

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.840
so that the burden that
the ego's always carrying

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.770
doesn't have to
struggle like this.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:33.250
But for some people that write,
they're reading it three times.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.500
And then they're ready.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.730
So I kind of love that.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.990
It's like movies that you
like, sometimes you see them,

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.270
they keep meeting
you wherever you are?

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.270
I mean, "Groundhog
Day" is even that way.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.760
I kind of love that crazy movie.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.020
And each time you see it, you
see a different piece of it.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.980
So that's what I
say to people is

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.920
it comes to you
when you're ready.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.170
Go experiment with it.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:04.440
And it will meet
you where you are.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.880
AUDIENCE: I just have one other
comment, question to make.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.860
And it reminds me of
just the whole control

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.270
issue, and how much
are you willing to let

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:17.050
go of your own control of
your life, whatever it is,

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.740
or your aspect, or
this certain question.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.410
And it's hard.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:22.940
Everybody wants to control.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.270
I know I want to have
say in what I'm doing.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.380
That is my goal sometimes.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.630
And if I don't, it's
a freak-out moment,

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.690
or I don't want to be there.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.130
It gets resistance.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.470
Even the simplest
way, I would say

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.950
it's like an example of control.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.390
It's an experiment of
control, if nothing else.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.140
TOSHA SILVER: Yes.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.350
And it's a good
point because what

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.410
I would call it is the
illusion of control

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.520
in the first place, the absolute
and utter illusion of control

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.150
that the culture indoctrinates
into us moment after moment,

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.560
that we're actually
making everything

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.310
happen from the
place of the ego.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.900
And in fact, that's what any
good surfer will tell you.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.660
I mean, I got so influenced by
this very good female friend

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.520
of mine who's a
wonderful surfer.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.880
And she's like, this is
like a surfing treatise,

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.370
because any surfer
worth their weight

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.700
knows how to go into the ocean.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.320
You can develop all the skills.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.870
It's not saying, don't get
good at what you're doing.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.060
But you ultimately only
become a great surfer

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.760
when you know how to
let go into the wave.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.650
And so that's actually
what this is about.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:36.230
It's that there's this
illusion of control.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.270
You're not letting go into
something outside yourself that

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:41.500
wants to hurt you.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.176
That's, again, the illusion
of a culture that, I think,

00:48:45.176 --> 00:48:49.690
is maybe teaching fundamentalist
religious ideas of a divine.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.480
But when you're starting to
talk about a force of love, what

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:59.010
you're letting go into
is your highest good.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:05.630
And so the best thing
I can say about it

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.900
is that if you approach
it as a playful experiment

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.640
as opposed to this big,
heavy thing-- like, oh,

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.130
how can I go force
myself to let go?

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.530
But you're taking it as
a playful experiment.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.100
Like, oh, here's this issue,
and I keep trying to control it.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.900
Let me playfully offer
it over to the divine

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.080
and see what happens.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.840
I have a second
book, by the way,

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.710
that's coming out in May
from Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.720
And it's called
"Change Me Prayers."

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.170
And it's a continuation
of these ideas,

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.870
because it's going along with
what Rachel's bringing up,

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:44.350
that you can actually
do prayers that

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.470
invite the divine to shift you.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.780
So if you're somebody
who's always saying,

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.810
I have to control
everything, I freak out

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.690
if I don't control everything,
it's another invitation.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:50:00.410
You can actually say, help
me shift into allowing things

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.720
to occur in the way that's
for the highest good.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.200
Because it's the reiteration
over and over of,

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.440
oh, I'm a control
freak, oh, I freak out,

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.680
that keeps telling the small
self that that's the truth.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.990
But all of this is about what
happens when the invitation is

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:22.830
made to begin to make
these things safe.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:26.714
I kind of love Brene Brown's
work on vulnerability.

00:50:26.714 --> 00:50:27.880
People are familiar with it?

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.410
And it's very
similar, very similar,

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.170
from a different
perspective but compatible,

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:39.150
where you're saying what happens
when you begin to make yourself

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:43.970
vulnerable to a force of love,
not just something that wants

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:47.190
to harm you, but to a force
that actually wants your highest

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.690
good.

00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:51.500
RACHEL O'MARA: Thank you, Tosha.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.500
TOSHA SILVER: Thank you.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.450
[APPLAUSE]
