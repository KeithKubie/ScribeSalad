[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.150
All right.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.110
Here we go.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.510
So before my life
here at Google,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.360
I used to be a creative
director at Pogo.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.370
And in the process, I
created a lot of games.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.036
And most of them,
they were pretty good.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.610
But there were a
few flops as well.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.350
Now, the hit games, those
are great because those

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.599
are the ones I feature very
prominently on my LinkedIn

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.300
profile.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.070
But the flops were
the valuable ones,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.530
because those are the ones
where I learned everything.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.830
And I started to notice
patterns with some

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.990
of mistakes I was making.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.865
And as I discovered,
these were mistakes that

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:36.360
were not just specific to me.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.390
Lots of people were making them
in lots of different games.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.670
And so I wanted to share
three of them with you today.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.920
So first mistake I often
see, one of the most common,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.312
is kitchen-sinking your design.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.270
This is a term I use when
you have a game where

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.170
you're basically throwing
everything but the kitchen sink

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.700
at it.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.070
And generally, this
is because you're not

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.770
confident with the
core game design,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.820
and you are trying to compensate
by covering it up with junk.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.350
The most common
symptom is this-- hey,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.430
let's add more power
ups in our game.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.850
If you keep throwing more and
more power ups at your game,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.880
that's a good sign you are
probably kitchen-sinking it.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730
I suppose if you're
more of the academic,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.580
theoretical-game-theory-type
of person,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.534
it manifests itself
this way-- hey,

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:14.450
we should add some more
risk-reward mechanics,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.051
because those are
always good, right?

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:16.550
Yeah.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.090
They're good.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.215
But you know how many you
should have for any given

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.080
system in your game at most?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.710
One.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.210
Right?

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.850
Any more than that, and
your audience gets confused.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.370
So what do we do if we're
kitchen-sinking our game?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.554
We need to fix our core.

00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:31.970
You are adding all this crap
because deep down you are not

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.315
confident in your core design.

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:34.809
It needs to be fun on its own.

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:37.100
So take away all your power
ups, all your bonus levels,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.400
and just play your game.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.460
Are you having fun yet?

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.010
No?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.730
Then make it fun first.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.056
Once you've done that,
then, yes, it's OK go ahead

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:45.180
and your power ups back in.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.200
They're great.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.390
My advice here is
concentrate on power ups that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990
change the way the
user plays and not just

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.320
the same but better.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.250
Think of the super
leaf in Mario,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.890
or the power pellet
in "Pac-Man,"

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.430
or the gravity gun
in "Half-Life."

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.894
All very, very nice power ups.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:01.060
Oh, and by the way, if you
find that your game isn't

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.650
any fun without a
particular power up

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.590
or a bonus level, that's OK.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.137
Just take that and make that
your base game experience.

00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:09.220
And then kind of build up
your end-game conditions

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.600
and scoring and everything
else from there.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.849
We did a couple times at Pogo.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.930
It worked out.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.630
Second big mistake I often
see-- holding onto good ideas

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.770
longer than you should.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.397
So sometimes we find this great
hook, this new twist, whatever,

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:21.230
and we're so proud of
ourselves because it's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.690
the most clever idea ever.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.230
The problem is that it is
ruining everything else.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.646
Let's say, for
instance, we've got

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.120
a really clever way of adding
a time limit to our level.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.134
And so it's really
neat and innovative,

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:33.300
but the problem is our
end-game isn't very good yet,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.775
our scoring needs
work, and the power ups

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:35.800
are also kind of boring.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.300
But every solution
we come up with,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.210
we put in the reject
pile, because it doesn't

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.402
fit our time-limit system.

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.110
Or to put it another
way, let's say we're

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.200
trying to make a sandwich.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.880
I've got some great mayonnaise.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.950
But then we've also got say some
peanut butter, and some jelly,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.750
and maybe a banana, none of
which we put on our sandwich

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.459
because none of it
really goes with mayo.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.458
But what ends up happening
is instead of getting

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.120
to eat a delicious
PB&amp;J, you're at home

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.980
eating mayonnaise out of a
jar because you couldn't find

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.197
anything that went with it.

00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:01.780
So the solution here
is hold the mayo.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.114
I'm sure it's great mayonnaise
and/or time-limit system.

00:03:04.114 --> 00:03:05.613
But it's preventing
you from getting

00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:06.790
your sandwich or game made.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.061
It's not doing you any good.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:10.060
And so this happens all
the time in game design.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.704
You are going to have a ton
of ideas both good and bad.

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.120
I think any run-of-the-mill
game designer can kill the bad

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.732
ideas.

00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:17.190
But a good game
designer is the one

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.920
who can kill the good ideas
that don't serve the core

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.530
or perhaps are preventing
better ideas from coming along.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.810
As the saying goes, sometimes
you have to kill your darlings.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.270
So moving on to
the third mistake

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.350
I often see, rejecting
bad suggestions

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.860
just because they are bad.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.214
So here is the issue.

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:35.380
Play testers are going to
find fault with your game.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.490
But, you know, they're probably
your friends or your fans

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.570
and so they want to be nice.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.736
So instead of telling you,
hey, your climbing system

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:43.010
is kind of poopy, they're
going to say, hey,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.900
have you thought about maybe
adding a grappling hook gun?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.300
Well, here's what happens.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.890
You know your game way better
than this other person does.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.650
And so your mind
immediately latches on

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.007
to the five perfectly
legitimate reasons

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:55.840
why a grappling hook
is the worst idea ever,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.966
and it will ruin your game.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.464
And, you know, we're
game designers.

00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:00.020
Sometimes we're a
little defensive.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.200
Sometimes we're a little petty.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.866
And maybe there's
some of that going on.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.260
And we tell this person who
dared criticize our game why

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.551
their idea is so terrible
and it's never going to work.

00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:09.690
And the thing is, we
are absolutely right.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.560
But here is the problem.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.650
Of course their
suggestion is bad.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.867
They've been playing your
game for all of 10 minutes.

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.950
They don't know any of the
underlying systems that

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.079
are going on underneath.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.250
They're just trying to help.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.210
And so if you say, well,
grappling hook, that's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.940
a dumb idea, and
you move on, then

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.640
you have missed a
golden opportunity

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.119
to notice that you're climbing
mechanic isn't any good

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:29.660
and needs to be
fixed, because no one

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.180
else is going to tell you this.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.625
So don't shoot them down,
silence those voices that

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.820
are telling you-- again,
totally legitimately--

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.480
why their suggestion is bad.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.035
Instead, stop and
consider why they

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:40.570
are giving you that
suggestion in the first place.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.069
What are they trying
to fix for you?

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.965
Or, you know, you
could just ask them?

00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:45.360
That works, too.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.050
So, in summary, one, don't
kitchen-sink your design.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.950
Fix your core.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.310
Two, don't hold onto a good
idea just because it's good.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.820
Sometimes you have
to hold the mayo.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.380
Three, don't reject a bad
idea just because it's bad.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.350
Look at what problem your users
are trying to solve for you.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.600
Incidentally, the great thing
about all these problems

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.690
is that the best defense
is simply being aware

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.606
of the fact that they
exist in the first place

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.240
so that you can
identify and call them

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.664
out the next time they happen
to you, which they will.

00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:09.330
So look at that.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.250
You've all become better
game designers simply

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.291
by showing up and listening
to this presentation.

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.030
And with that, I am out of time.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.166
Thank you very much.

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.594
