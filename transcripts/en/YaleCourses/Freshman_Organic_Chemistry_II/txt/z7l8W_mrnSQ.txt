Speaker 1:          00:01          Last time of a about try fennel methyl. So I thought you might like to see the, um, see a space filling model of triathlon on methyl and feel it how it works. Remember it was very difficult to find a way of making Tetra fennel methane, right? Which means you have to take this fennel with its little hook there and get it into their right. So I'll pass this around and you can try twisting it and see if you can make Tetra federal methane better than the people before Gomberg did. Okay. And then there's the question of whether you can make hex of fennel ethane. So here are two triathlon on methyls. One has the hook in it and one doesn't. So the question is, can you put those two together? Okay. So Debbie, you're the first. So whoever gets it should bring it up and show it to us. Okay. The projector is warming up here. Uh, so, uh, we're speaking about tryfan methyl and then, uh, I have a little, a second thought about Friedel crafts reactions that I'll give to you. And then we're going to go onto the next subject, which is carbon compounds. Once I get once the uh, senator projector gets warmed up here.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:35          I want to go. Okay, so we talked last time about how a Steri Kendra, how are you doing? Is Your steric hindrance? Sarah? Debbie. Pretty poorly. Okay. It's really tough to get these things together when you have these three propellers that all have to twist because of the way they run into one another. And I still don't have my projector. I don't know how it got turned off. I guess I did it somehow. So it makes, as Debbie's finding out, it makes Tetra Federal Efa. And did you try Hex, the fennel ethane? What? That's even worse. It's even worse. Okay. So let us see. I don't know how long it looks like it's on up there. How are you guys doing Helen? Antonio, can you get them together? Maybe you could get a picture of that. I'm trying to hold it up so that he can get a picture there. Just just turn it between you work on it as you're doing it.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Don't hold your hand in the way of the camera.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Part quiet a minute. Yes. Yeah, it's true. It's true that the models have fixed angles and don't distort easily these bottles. If you made it with fishers models, the ones that had rubber tubing, you'd have no problem making it cause they're not space filling either. And there's the question of how big the atoms are. They're a little bit crushable, right. These models obviously are more or less rigid. Right. And in fact you can make Tetra fennel methane, but as we'll see shortly once we get the projector going for us, you can't make hex a fennel ethane.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Any luck.

Speaker 1:          03:46          I don't know why this is taking so long. I turned off the side one and somehow the center one went off to,

Speaker 2:          04:01          yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:04          I want to turn on one of the other projectors just in case.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:10          this one doesn't come on. In fact, I'll turn them all along this. See where, where are we getting any luck?

Speaker 1:          04:28          Ah, there we go. Okay, so here you'll see what we were just saying. Steric hindrance and try ethyl methyl causes, twists that reduce overlap by 25% from the what they would be a dye fennel methyl and makes Tetra fennel very difficult to prepare, not to mention hexa fennel ethane. Okay. So, but Guttenberg was able to make tetra fennel methane using this trick that he'd learned in Munich of knocking nitrogen out and having the two radicals come together. And He tried, as we've mentioned last time to prove that that's what he had. The analysis was correct. He was good at analysis, remember? And he got the right molecular weight almost. So then he went back, he spent just one year in Germany, not like a free del who spent four years first and then 17 years in Paris. Okay. Uh, then he went back to Ann Arbor and got back to work, stayed there the rest of his life and he confirmed the molecular weight by doing an even better measurement. He got three 18 versus three 20. So he was really confident he had tetra federal methane. But there was one thing that was funny. He'd nitrated it did uh, uh, aromatic electrophilic aromatic substitution on the four phenols got the Tetra nitrile compound and he got to the 99 and a half percent yield. Okay. But there was a problem he wrote, unlike try Nitro, try fennel methane, it does dissolve

Speaker 3:          05:58          in sodium athelete that's f oxide and iron strong base, nor does it give any coloration. So his tapped. So these nitrile compounds with a lot of federal seem to dissolve and strong base and to give colors. Right. But his compound didn't. Now why does this the dissolve in strong base? Any ideas? What does base do with it? Strong base

Speaker 2:          06:32          tech.

Speaker 3:          06:35          Yeah. It takes off h plus. This is a very good and on it's triply been Philly plus it. What? Electron withdrawing nitrile group. So it's easy to pull off the Proton and get the an eye on which then dissolves. And this colored, he has an unusually high bone and Mo Lumo nearby, so it'll absorb like drugs, move, absorbing light to the colored region. Okay. So it was possible to get that. Of course he didn't know this theory. We know. So for him it was just funny that it does all been based the way others NightPro phenol compounds.

Speaker 3:          07:11          But he wondered how about Pexa fennel ethic. If you're nitrate, if will it be color? Well lit. It was all good things. So he set about trying to make mental effort. Now how did he try? He tried using the technique but fail to make Tetra fennel method. It's very much like boards public, right? You put a metal in, pull out two chlorides. The things come together as the idea here. It's plausible because it's easy to pull that chloride off as we'll see later. Okay, so in fact he did get, he thought perhaps a federal ethic. Okay, so we did analysis, so we got this, the total of carbon plus hydrogen that is co two and water that he burned it in got was 93.97 by one method. This is a method, not a run. He did many, many analyses using the same method. Their average was 93.97 he tried another method. 94.2 94.0 94.574 different methods, a lot, maybe 20 an hour, right? But he could never get it near 100% and he was confident that visibility as an analytical chemist over all that time you spend in lab, ultimately he used more than 17 different methods to analyze it and none of them would give 100%. So we concluded that there's something else there besides carbon and hydrogen and that something else is oxygen. Because if you have two oxygens between the tribe dental methyl groups, then the sub

Speaker 1:          08:59          them, the psalm of uh, Cnh is 90 pride will come away to give the trifocal methyl cad I n and then o two minus, we'll go between so you can get the, the uh, authentic peroxide, uh, and it was the same compound. So then he knew how to prepare the hydrocarbon. You do it by preparing it without oxygen present. It reacts to easily with oxygen. So we used a special apparatus, he said with ground glass joints. Then they used corks and sometimes rubber stoppers, but never ground or rarely ground glass joint. That was really high tech. But he did it and he got the compound that analyzed correctly. But he found it was very funny because this substance not only reacted with ode to it reacted easily with cl two with br too. And even with I two which you remember doesn't add to alkenes.

Speaker 1:          10:09          So this is us of weird unsaturated compounds. So one saturated react spontaneously even with I two and certainly Hex, a fennel ethane shouldn't do that. Tetra fennel, methane didn't do anything like that. So this is the, this is from his paper in 1900, just at the turn of the century. He said, try fennel methyl. The experimental evidence presented above forces me to the conclusion that we have to deal here with the free radical. Remember where radicals came from. Remember it was the nomenclature in the 1830s and the organic, uh, radical. And at first they thought they were real things. Colby thought he had made methyl, but in fact he had made the dimer ethane. Right. And then from then on, radical was just a name. It wasn't something that was real. It wasn't the organic element right here. He tried to make the dimer hexa fennel ethane, but concluded that he had the monomer try fennel, methyl free radicals, right?

Speaker 1:          11:10          Not just names. Okay. On this assumption alone to the results described above, become intelligible and receive an adequate explanation. The action of zinc results as it seems to me, in the mere abstraction of the halogen leaving the free radical, the radical, so formed as apparently stable for it can be kept both in solution and in the dry crystal state for weeks. So he had prepared a free radical. Now of course, when you do a reaction you can do, you either have to go association, dissociation or dissociation and association. And when you dissociate from carbon, you get something that's try Vaillant. And this was the first example of, uh, of, uh, authentic try Vaillant carbon compound. So this was, this is the, the, the, uh, the, uh, watershed between the 19th century when it was just making compounds and things being mysterious. And the 20th century when you can begin to understand mechanisms in terms of actually knowing something about these try Vaillant carbon compounds.

Speaker 1:          12:15          And this was the first, okay, so this launched the American century of chemistry because this experiment was done in America, in Ann Arbor, right. And here in October, 1900, he wrote the paper and published it in America, received October 4th and instance of try Vaillant carbon, try fennel methyl, but at the same time he published it in Germany, a preliminary paper try federal methyl a case of uh, try Vaillant carbon received the 1st of October, 1900. So he published at both places to cover his bases. Now you remember we talked about the, uh, about, uh, American organic chemistry and about James Mason crafts and that essentially everything he did, he did in Paris. And people thought many people thought he was French, right? He did essentially nothing in the u s and that was not, he was, maybe there were people doing more than that, but not a lot more than that.

Speaker 1:          13:12          All the center of gravity was in Europe, especially in Germany. At the end of the, of the, uh, 19th century. But Gomberg comes along, born 25 years later, right. And, Oh, I should have said that there's an exception, which is Yale, because Gibbs really made it complete international splash with his equilibrium of heterogeneous substances, which was published the same period as the Friedel crafts reaction. But that was in France and this was in America. So in physical chemistry, America had done something and it was Gibbs, but in organic chemistry, Gomberg was the first one to really do something and these are gone Berg's publications and contrast that with the previous one. So here, uh, he went for just one year to Munich and Heidelberg, where he did this work and prepared this compound, the Tetra fennel methane, which was itself notable, but much more drastic, was the preparation of the radical tryfan all methyl, which he did after.

Speaker 1:          14:13          He obviously, after he got back to America, so he published these things in German because that's where the big readership was. But within 10 years or so, he was doing all his publishing in the United States and a lot of publishing. So in that 25 year period between Friedl on Gomberg, things started really happening in this country. And then after the Second World War, of course Europe had such difficulty that things really took off here and it was a long time for them to catch up again. So this launched the American chemical century and incidentally one other thing about it is the big German journal for organic chemistry was erected there, Deutsche and Cayman Gazelle shop, the reports of the, of the uh, German chemical society. And in 1900 there were 4,290 pages and I leaf through them to see how many graphs there were, how many quantitative things were being discussed.

Speaker 1:          15:10          This was mainly a journal of organic chemistry. And there were very, very few graphs. In fact, in a sense, two of the papers from this period here, he gone Berg's papers had more graphs than all those things in, in all of 1900 and the German main literature. So it showed not only was thing where things coming to America, but physical, organic chemistry or the quantitative approach to organic chemistry was rising as well. Now, I said I had second thoughts on the Friedel crafts reaction, what I told you last time. So I'm going to take just a minute to tell you about those. So we talked about rearrangement happening and Friedel Crafts alkylation uh, and the idea that that you have, uh, the, that the, that you can get the, uh, uh, chloride being complex with try fennel methyl chloride, which makes it a good leaving group, which means that you can, that the fennel can come in and displace that.

Speaker 1:          16:07          It's essentially an sn one reaction. Here's the sub strait with it's good leaving group and the high home, Oh, here comes in and displaces, and then you lose a hydrogen from the same place and get the product. You get the normal appropriate product, the first one there. Okay. But if it dissociates a little bit and rearranges with a hydride shift, right, then you get the other product. We talked, this is what we talked about. Okay. So we said that this is what gives the primary product. It's essentially an sn one reaction. But this sn two reaction after rearrangement, when you get the more stable secondary, uh, cat, and then it can dissociate and then you get the, uh, the, uh, so-called Q mean I Sunpro benzene. Now that may be true, but it may be wrong too. I've got thinking about this. Okay, so suppose it rotated, right? So that methyl was on the backside. Then what might you expect to happen?

Speaker 3:          17:08          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          17:09          what happened over here to get the secondary cad iron. It was a hydride shift, right? What might you get now? A method shift and methods and hydride rearrange it about with about the same rate. So why not do this? Right? So why not do meth? I'd shifts. So what do you get if you do a myth? I'd shift.

Speaker 3:          17:34          You get that,

Speaker 1:          17:37          but it's the same thing you had before. It's a degenerate rearrangement. It's still the primary compound. And then you could, uh, you could do the sn one and get the product. So that doesn't make any difference that you do have math. I'd shift, but suppose the Meth I'd shift gets stuck halfway across.

Speaker 2:          17:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:56          Suppose it stops there. Right? Because another way to draw that is as protonated cyclo propane, right? It's Cyclo propane that's taken on a pro extra proton, right? And that substance has been studied, right? And it's known that it's stability is between the primary cad ion and the secondary cad. I am. Right. So suppose you got that, what would that do? Well, uh, if you could have a nucleophile attack that, I mean, the methyl plus is a great leaving group, right? So you could do that. And again, it would still give that same product if you had the protonated Cyclo probate instead of this thing doing the alkylation. Okay. Now in fact, Norman Dino at Penn State University in 1968, unbeknownst to me, had actually done that reaction. He's took benzene and Cyclo propane and reacted it with acid and got these products

Speaker 2:          18:58          right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:59          And he used deuterated deuterium here. So there's deuterium in the, in the, in this normal propyl benzene, just one deuterium. Now what I want you to tell me is where you expect it to be on which carbon should that do teary of B? Which of the three carbons, let's suppose that it happens by making protonated Cyclo. Propay. Chris, what do you say? It should be the terminal one. Cause if you put it on here, then you displaced. That'll be the methyl group and the deuterium should be there. One Deuterium, right? Here's what he found. Where is it?

Speaker 2:          19:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Three sevenths of it is where Chris said two sevens here and two sevens here. It's completely scrambled, right? There are three mouths, three hydrogens here, two here and two here. And that one, deuterium is completely scrambled among those positions, right? How did it get scrambled? Well this corner protonated cyclo propane, very easily reorder, arranges to edge protonated, cyclo propane, and then that can become protonated at this corner. And then this edge and then this corner, and then this edge, and then back to where you started. And it does when it's that ch three, it doesn't have to be the deuterium you added that moves. It could've been the hydrogen. So everything gets scrambled very quickly going around there. And in fact, this was shown in a key experiment by a man named Richard Baird, who was a assistant professor here in this department in 1964 and that was on the basis of that, that Dino tried this experiment. So that explains it. So it's pro, so proteinated cyclo propane does give this compound. So now we have a question. Which of these is the thing that gives the Friedel crafts product? Is it an sn one sn. Two reaction with this or an sn one reaction that involves the protonated cyclo propane. And it could be either right. And no one knows. As far as I

Speaker 2:          21:07          am aware, right.

Speaker 1:          21:10          I've just been, we'll do it going through the literature in the last two days on this, I don't think anybody knows this. I tried to call professor Ola and wasn't able to get him at the University of southern California who got the Nobel Prize for free to all crafts things that I haven't been able to get him yet. But Professor Saunders who knows a lot about this, doesn't think he knows. We'll see. Uh, but any, I think it's not known. So what I want you guys to do is to try to think up an experiment that can tell you whether it's the sn two or the sn one mechanism.

Speaker 2:          21:47          Bye.

Speaker 1:          21:48          And I'll give you a hint. I think the good experiments involve isotopes, right? So here's a problem for you. So maybe you can become famous and know and determine the mechanism of the Friedel crafts reaction after 143 years. Oh, okay. Now onto the next subject, which is carbon eel compounds. Now, uh, I didn't bring the texts, the, uh, the, uh, uh, Joan's textbook along, but the carbonyl compounds are discussed in chapter 16 to 19, which is 268 pages. It's about a quarter of the textbook, I think. And that's not a typical, you have many other texts and you can check, but there's a lot of stuff in there about carbon eel compounds. Uh, the good news is that almost all of it is review because we've talked a lot about the reactivity of carbonyl compounds. So chapter 16, for example, is aldehydes and ketones. So for the rest of this lecture, I'm just going to go over the big view of this.

Speaker 1:          22:46          And then in the next lecture is we'll, we'll take a more detailed view of some of the lore. Okay. So we talked about before that the carbonyl compound is stable, but it's reactive. Those things we've said before seem contradictory. It's that the, you have the average bond energies we've looked out before for the single and double bond and for the single and double bonds to oxygen. And we've seen that the second bond in carbon is very much weaker than the first bond. But the second bond for oxygen is stronger than the first bond, right? And it's not all due to the, to the Pi bond there, because the, it has also to do with the change at hybridization of the carbon. The sigma bond changes when you form a double bond. So it's very stable compared to carbon, carbon double bonds, but it's also reactive because it has a very low, uh, Lumo the Pi Star.

Speaker 1:          23:44          Okay. Now, just a bit on the, uh, on, uh, just to give you something to practice with about Nmr. To see how people figured out chemical shifts in an Mr. They did it by taking a compound, a known compound like acid aldehyde where n is three here, you'll see why I use then and they found it had two peaks, 199.6 and 31.2 right in the CMR spectrum, carbon magnetic residence. And then they put another carbon on and found peaks at those positions. And then another one on and found peaks that those positions. And then they did a ketone acetone, right. And found peaks at those positions. And with one more carbon to Buton own, they found that and with two Penta known, they found that and with three penton known, they found that now with that empirical evidence behind you, I want you to figure out what this is CMR spectrum is of right and, and which peaks or which, right.

Speaker 1:          24:46          And that's taken from that chem two 20 problems site that we've mentioned before, right? So there's a problem, there are the values of the chemical shifts in this proton decoupled CMR spectrum and use the table to identify what each of those carbons is. Okay. And in the process you'll figure out a what regularities there are within this table and how you go about figuring out new things. Okay. And just to give you an extra hint, here's the Proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the same compound. Notice this is 400 megahertz for protons. It was a 100 megahertz for carbon. That's the same magnet because the Proton is four times as strong as carbon. Okay? And just to help you out with this, we can blow up each of those peaks and see what the spin spin splitting is. And there they are with the values of their chemical shifts.

Speaker 1:          25:40          And here's the scale in the for the detail. That's 20 hertz. And so this splitting here is 1.8 hertz and the one over here is 6.8 hertz just for reference. So there's a problem. There are two problems for you, right? Make your name by determining the Meccan devise and experiment to prove the mechanism of the free del crafts reaction and figuring out what this compound is. Okay. Now, so carbon eel is very stable, but it's also paradoxically reactive. And we know that's because of Pi Star for it. We'll see other ways as well. So the nucleophile comes in, we've done this a zillion times and we have nuclear Philly condition. And last semester we talked about the Borghi done its angle and all of this is discussed in chapter 16 and you remember this contrasts with c double bond. See where the addition reactions are. Electrophilic not nuclear filling.

Speaker 1:          26:36          Okay. So then you bring a proton on and you get an alcohol, right? And especially interesting alcohols that be discussed in chapter 16 are ones where you form a new bond to our, where the nucleophile nuclear files an Al Kill Group, for example, methyl lithium as that property. And we talked about that some last semester or where the nucleophile is h minus as in lithium aluminum hydride. So here are some sections that talk about that. And again, we'll talk more about this now, a different kind of reactivity is when one of the substituents on the carbon eel is elite, can be a leaving group in an sn two reaction. So it's an okay an ion. Okay. Because when you do that, there's something else you can do at this stage. Of course, you can reverse it. You can bring these electrons into reform, the double bond and lose the nucleophile and go back. But as in sn two reactions, you can also lose the leaving group if it's a reasonable and ion, right? So you can go like this and now what you've done is not an addition. What's, what kind of reaction is this instead of

Speaker 3:          27:42          in addition, what's overall Linda? It's a substitution instead of in addition, nuclear

Speaker 1:          27:51          Felix substitution of things that are called acid derivatives. These things, when l is a leaving group, when that thing is the leaving group are called acid derivatives. So it's association dissociation. It's not like sn two where you go through, uh, pentavalent intermediate pentavalent transition state, right? This has an actual intermediate, this has a finite lifetime, so it's association and then dissociation as an aromatic substitution. Remember the elect electrophilic aromatic substitution goes through a Tetra Vaillant carbon. Then the proton gets lost and you have the electrified left on there. And that's what's discussed in chapter 18. But there are other ways to go at it too, because the oxygen has unshared pairs, so acids can attack it. So you have an acid come in, for example, a proton to protonate it and get that cat ion. And then you can have electrophilic addition, right? So a nucleophile then can come in in a second step.

Speaker 1:          28:51          In the previous slide, we had the nucleophile come in first, right? And then brought a proton in later. Now we're bringing the Proton in first on the oxygen and bringing the nucleophile in later. So we get compounds that have o h and a nucleophile on there. Now what nuclear files can you use? Notice that this is much easier than for c double bond. See, uh, okay. So you can have the nuclear file can be, Ooh, in which case this thing over here is called a hydrate, right? It's h two o added to the carbon eel. Right? And or it's sometimes called a gem dial. Gem for [inaudible] for Gemini is twins, right? So it's twin Oah is on there. Okay. Or it can be oh are, and we've already talked about that Hemi asset towel or on the way to an asset towel or it could be nitrogen.

Speaker 1:          29:41          And then the, the equivalent of how many assets towel for nitrogen is called a carbon ola mean. And if you then you can unzip this of course to go back to the carbon deal. But if you have two groups on there, you could unzip losing the other group and keeping the nucleophile. And then you have a nucleophile double bond. That's what the mean is a carbon nitrogen double bond. Or you can have a by sulfide addition product or a CN. That one's special because you formed a new carbon carbon bond. You're always on the lookout for things that will form new carbon carbon bonds, not just change the functional group. So that's called a Cyan. Oh hydrant. Hey, so their section 16 six to 1611 or about that in the Jones book, but it'll be covered in any of the, all of these things will be covered in all these textbooks.

Speaker 1:          30:32          Okay. Uh, now the reason, the reason this was stable, that it was easy. One reason it was easy to protonate that was you have this resident structure, but notice that if you have a proton here on the carbon adjacent to the carbon eel, that's the Alpha position. So if you have an Alpha Proton, then a nucleophile can act as a base, right? So the base can come in and take the proton. So instead of attacking here, it can attack here, right? And generate this double bond. And you remember what those things are called? Enols. Right. Okay. So that this is an al rearrangement. The fourth pattern of reactivity is Al Lily Cree arrangement. Ketone to Ian. All I, as I, as I've been going along, I've been numbering all the different ways. Carbonells react. Okay? So now you could bring, uh, a low Lumo in here and have the electrons and the double bond attack it.

Speaker 1:          31:29          So this is a, this is a double bond. So this is like electrophilic addition to a double bond, right? Except it's especially good because you have the unshared pair on the oxygen that can help out. And make this easy to do that. So it's better than other, uh, than other carbon carbon double bonds. So the Enal is essentially a carbon nucleophile. It can attack low lumos especially easy. Okay, so you get something like this and notice that after you lost the Proton, then what you have, what you've done is to do a substitution at the Alpha position and electrophilic substitution at the Alpha position of a ketone. So that's, or an Aldehyde. So that's another pattern of reactivity. And that's chapter 19 these reactions of enols. Okay? So enols analytes and analization a little bit from chapter 19 here. Okay. So here we have this Alpha hydrogen.

Speaker 1:          32:26          We bring the base in. As we said last time, this time we're doing it without having first put something on the Oh right. And having a double. So that, so that this is, so what we've made now is an an on, it's PKA is 19 pretty acidic. Well, what's it normally for for alkanes if you didn't have the carbon deal there? Jesus, over the last little over 50. Right? So here we've got a 31 powers of 10 advantage. So the equilibrium constant. So that's, that's how easy it is to make the enal late. The an ion, right? Once you have the know late with, uh, with the double bond here and a charge on the oxygen, then you can put the Proton on the oxygen and you have an ea knoll. So another number that's interesting is the equilibrium constant between here and here, right?

Speaker 1:          33:17          So this is for forming the, an eye on this is for the alcoholic rearrangement of the Proton. So it's five times 10 to the minus ninth. So it's it, you're going to have very little anal compared to the, to the, uh, to the ketone. But notice at equilibrium there'll be in equilibrium with the same man ion, right? Because if you lose the proton from here, you get the same ina late and I, and that you get from losing the Proton here. So if this is ever so much more energetic, higher in energy than this, then this one is going to be unusually acidic. It's going to be easy for it to lose that Proton. Uh, since the Ketone is about 11 kilocalories below the eternal, the PKA of this is about 11, right? Very acidic. Remember, normal alcohols are like 16 and 17 Pka, right?

Speaker 1:          34:18          So this is a very, is very acidic. Now let's go to if one is good, more is better, right? Put two carbon hills adjacent to this, these, this Alpha thing. So now both of them can stabilize it and now the PKA is nine and the equilibrium constant is now three. It's better to have this than to have this, right? Whereas here it was a 10 to the minus eight of this compared to this, now it's three times as much. This is this at equilibrium, right? Notice that suddenly this would be hydrogen bonded. And you can imagine that the hydrogen could shift from here to here, this double bond to hear this double bond, to hear the hydrogen could bounce back between those two things. In fact, it's even conceivable it would be halfway in between. And Professor Vaccaro in this lab is, is doing a lot of work on that kind of thing, compounds of that sort.

Speaker 1:          35:13          So here are the ketone is approximately equal to the eternal because of the help from conjugation, right? And from hydrogen bonding. Okay? Now, if you have these double bonds in there, now this compound is favored by a factor of 10 to the 13th this Enal is 10 to the 13th favorite at equilibrium over this. So you got none of this. It's all here, right? Why? Because this one is, so you've gained the air materiality, that 30 kilocalories per mole that you didn't have over here. Okay? So the ketone is now 17 kilocalories above the enal. Here are the ido was 11 kilocalories above the ketone. So you have a complete range of, of a ketone to anal. The Pka of this thing here is 10 it's the same as this, right? The anti and is only about 13 kilocalories per mole of a above funnel. So it's very easy to lose that.

Speaker 1:          36:18          Then funnel, if you ever get it on your skin, Burns like fire. It's just terrible because as an organic compound, it dissolves in your lipids and then it's a strong acid. So if you ever get it, you'll know. Did you ever get into nettles? Stinging nettles. That's funnels for you. Okay. Okay. And the PKA in this case is minus three so this is very, this really easily loses of Proton. Okay. Now how about reactions of carboxylic acids? Okay. What patterns do we, we we went through was that, I think it was five patterns of reactivity of carbon eel groups. Now we're going to look at the carboxylic acids, which are in chapter 17 and see what patterns of reactivity we're going to expect. Well first you can get addition just as if it were a carbonyl group. So you could imagine doing that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          37:11          And there we'll see examples, right? Another possibility is to do substitution at carbon. So this is like the Oah was, became a leaving group somehow, right? And then Olr came in, so it was like, just like the ketones. We said if there was a leaving group here, here, the leaving group is o h or we, or we make it into a better leaving group somehow. Maybe by protonating it, something like that. So we can get substitution at carbon, but there's another possibility in the acid you could get, you could start here and you could do the substitution at oxygen, get the same product our on our OCO, right? You get the same thing, but make this bond rather than making that bond. So you can have substitution at Karbon, you can have substitution that oxygen. Okay. And there's another possibility of course substitution that the Alpha carbon.

Speaker 1:          38:04          So if you have an R, a chair and Alpha hydrogen, then as we saw with aldehydes and Ketones, you can do a substitution there. And the good news in all this is almost all of this is review. In fact, I should have said one thing on the previous slide that when you have the Oah and put the are odd making the [inaudible] bond, that's an Alpha substitution also, it's just that it's an oxygen rather than a carbon that has the Alpha hydrogen, right? So you can have that or on the side. And the good news is very much of this is review. For example, if you look at pages seven 85 to seven 87, section 69 to 1610, and the Jones' book, you'll find that it's an old favorite of ours. So let's just conclude the, uh, our here by going through that again, it's the mechanism for acid catalyzed hydrolysis of asset towel. We've already done this, but it doesn't hurt to do it again and it's this part of the text. Okay? So we have this asset towel and the idea is to hydrolyze it, to go back to an Aldehyde and how do we do it? Do you remember acid ketalysis? Where do we start in?

Speaker 1:          39:17          Even at home

Speaker 3:          39:18          was out here where it's an acid attacks this compound, h plus [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          39:30          What is it about the oxygen that makes the h plus want to go there?

Speaker 3:          39:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          39:35          so for the goal is going to be, it's two steps. First we're going to remove orr and replace it by Oah. Then we're going to remove the other Olr and replace it by Oah. Okay? So the way we do it is with h plus this Kate tells us and we have the unshared pair. And we do that and we get here. This is exactly one we went over before, but it's the old ones are the best ones, right? Okay. What's going to happen next? Uh, John, what do you say?

Speaker 3:          40:07          [inaudible] well, the goal is

Speaker 1:          40:13          what are we trying to do in the first

Speaker 3:          40:14          sage? John [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          40:18          tomorrow. How are we going to do it?

Speaker 3:          40:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          40:28          leave now, right?

Speaker 3:          40:31          Remove Lumara wage. What do we leave behind? [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          40:44          where do the electrons go? It's this bond. We're going to break. Where are the electrons going to go? Are they going to go on the Oh, are they going to go on the seat?

Speaker 3:          40:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          40:57          plus it's going to gain full, full ownership of that pair of electron. So it becomes r o h neutral. Right? So what's left behind on the carbon

Speaker 3:          41:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:10          right? The electrons went away. So what do we draw that

Speaker 3:          41:16          [inaudible] och two left. What do we draw the ch two. Okay,

Speaker 1:          41:23          so it's going to do that and we'll get that. Now this if this word Aro if it were just h say right, that would be a crummy reaction, right? Why does it work here?

Speaker 3:          41:35          What's good about that? The bacon

Speaker 1:          41:41          middle is able to stabilize those electrons. So the thing gets unusually stable, right? So you have that and Bingo. Okay, so we've got, we've got the first aro off. Now we have to replace it by Oah. Uh, Cassie, how are we going to do that?

Speaker 3:          41:59          How are we going to put Oh, H on here after we took our o off [inaudible] the Oh, hi. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          42:25          Uh, okay. So we want it, we want to put Oah on that carbon. How do we do it?

Speaker 3:          42:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          42:44          I'm not sure what Pi's star you're talking about. There's, there's a, there's a pie here in this resonance structure. But the important thing that we have is a vacant orbit. A lot in carbon,

Speaker 3:          42:56          which what? Oxygen.

Speaker 1:          43:01          So suppose that attacks the unshared pair on the alcohol. You form a bond here. Now you're here,

Speaker 3:          43:08          right? Let's go backwards. So we're going to need something else. Water each. What would you use? Water. Water.

Speaker 1:          43:24          Okay. So if you put water in that Kat Heins unusually stable as John told us. So we bring water in. Now we make that bond and now we have Ooh, there. But we also have h is that a problem?

Speaker 3:          43:41          We want o h here, not h two o no, just loose proton.

Speaker 1:          43:47          All right, so we've done the, we've accomplished our first step up here, right? We have a Hemi asset towel and we can check that one off. Okay. Now we have to take the second aro off and replace it with, with, Ooh, how are we going to do that? Nathan

Speaker 3:          44:07          said, tell me what do we eat? What we're going to do? What's the first step?

Speaker 1:          44:15          Okay, where do we want to put the h plus here or here? The top one. The top one. Okay, so we removed the second one, okay. By bringing h plus in, put it on the top. Next

Speaker 3:          44:29          lose water

Speaker 1:          44:32          are, but probably lose alcohol, right? Uh, to get this and now and water. No, we don't need to add water. If we wanted to put the second one in true, I misled you, right? But really where you go is here, right? So you just lose a proton. Now you, so you've taken the, the key towel to a carbonyl by way of a Hemi, a towel or a Hemi Ke Tau. Uh, okay. So the overall transformation then is water plus asset towel acid catalyzed to give carbon old plus two Roi ages. And we wrote at different reward at this way before. Right. They come together and, and pull it apart. And so the h two o and resolved all three molecules. Okay. That's how much we wanted to do today. We made it, we made it to the end and we're caught up actually with where we were last year.
