00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.440
All right. Now that we've learned the basics of visual

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.780
cues, different data types, and different skills that we might

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.720
use to plot those data types. Why don't we focus

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.940
in more on time series data? Since that's the format

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.390
that our New York City subway data and weather data

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.480
will come in. We'll discuss different things we can include

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.430
in the plot for time series data Starting with something

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.560
simple like a scatterplot, and adding more complex features like

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.350
maybe a Louis curve. With each iteration, we'll

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.870
show how we can combine visual cues, data

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.300
types, and appropriate scales in our charts to

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.420
achieve visual excellence. Again, why don't we use baseball

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.960
data as an example. Let's plot the winning

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.400
percentage of my least favorite team as a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.020
Yankees fan, the Boston Red Sox, from 1960

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.490
until 2010. Let's start with a simple scatter plot.
