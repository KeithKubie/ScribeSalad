00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.200
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.610
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.890
This program is made
possible by the Office

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.810
of Equal Employment Opportunity
and Diversity Programs.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.940
Our guest speaker, Sam
Martinez, served 26 years

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.560
with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation as a special agent.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.890
Over the years the FBI assigned
him to a myriad of postings

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.820
in San Francisco, Chicago,
Denver, Mexico City, Los Angeles,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.220
Washington, D.C. and
Montevideo, Uruguay.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.650
He worked cases involving white
collar crime, domestic terrorism,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.450
narcotics, foreign
counter intelligence

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.030
and undercover assignments.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.620
He worked on the Patricia Hearst
Kidnapping, the Black Panther Party

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.690
and the FALN, a Puerto
Rican terrorist group.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.500
In Mexico he was the FBI case agent
and supervisor to the kidnapping

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.150
and murder of DEA agent
Enrique Kiki Camarena.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.780
His last assignment was
supervising, coordinating

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.840
and authorizing oversea
drug cases with the DEA.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.270
He joined lead plaintiff Mat Perez
and 310 other Hispanic agents

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.360
in filing a class action lawsuit

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.030
on employee discrimination
against the FBI.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.220
The lawsuit was not about
hatred or bigotry, but subtle

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.500
and unintentional discrimination
which became evil

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.100
when management retaliated

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.560
against those investigative agents
it relied on for its success.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.080
The court-ordered systems
implemented

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.610
after the trial benefited the
FBI with greater opportunities

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.200 position:56%
for all agents, developed
transparency and promotion policies,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.220
and caused the FBI to promote
women at an unprecedented rate.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.080
He is the author of Systemic Evil:
Mat Perez v. the FBI and he plans

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.600
to write books on a
less serious subjects.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.430
The book won the Southwest
Book Award

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.540
from the Border Regional
Library Association.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.730 position:56%
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.740
in welcoming our guest speaker
retired FBI special agent

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.540
Sam Martinez.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.870
[ Applause ]

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.170
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez:
Thank you everyone.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.490 position:56%
Since it's being video, would you
please make sure you get the Library

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.010
of Congress so I can
send it to my mom.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.810
She'll be very proud of me.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.360
[ Laughter ]

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.250
Thank you Roberto Salazar
and the Library of Congress

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.120
for inviting this starving
artist to be here today at noon.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.740
I appreciate you being here.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.730 position:56%
I appreciate the Library of Congress
for having me here at lunch time.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.870
So we all have something in common;

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.510
you're a hungry audience
and I'm a hungry author.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.170
[ Laughter ]

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.660
I am sincerely honored with the
opportunity from the Library

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.440
of Congress and for you taking the
time to listen and ask questions

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.620
at the end of my presentation.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.280
I'm also honored that we
have retired agent Ed Mireles

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.620
in the audience.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.900
I will read you his story and
invite him here at the end

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.190
to answer questions that
you might want it ask him.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.270
Has anyone of you had a
chance to discriminate today?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.960
Good I see some people.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.370
&gt;&gt; I did in the cafeteria.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.010
I got the ugly food instead
of the super ugly food.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.420
[ Laughter ]

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.720
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: Good.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.080
I'm glad you raised your hand
because people are afraid

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.480
to talk about discrimination.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.410
And discrimination- I'm going
to talk about the good side

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.380
of discrimination and the
bad side of discrimination.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.600
Has any of you seen at least
a dozen movies of the FBI?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.710
Seems like we all raised our hands.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.910
Have any of you seen an agent
cry in any of those movies?

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.130
I didn't think you would.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.410
Have any of you had your
judgement wrong about people?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.750
I see hands going up also.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.060
Look up the word discrimination
and you'll see

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.870
that humans discriminate every day.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.420
Discrimination is a
decision making process.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.080
It's a natural process within us.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.130
Good discrimination are
choices and actions that we make

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.730
that don't affect others.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.910
People used to say,
"He's a distinguished man

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.560
with discriminating taste."

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.990
There's nothing evil about that.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.880
There's nothing bad about that.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.570
We use discrimination
as a survival instinct.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.820
Mark Cuban tried to
discuss discrimination

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.090
as a survival instinct when he
said, "I know I'm prejudiced

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.410
and I know I'm bigoted
in a lot of ways.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.190
If I see a black kid in a hoodie
walking down the street on my side

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.570
of the street, I'll cross over
to the other side of the street.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.440
If I see a white guy with tattoos
and a shaved head on my side

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.520
of the street, I'll walk back over
to the other side of the street.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.730
None of us have pure thoughts."

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.260
He intended no harm to others.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.560
He spoke his truth.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.860
He spoke his beliefs.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.710
He spoke his security.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.130 position:56%
And the blacks and the media and
others jumped all over his comments.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.750
The much needed discussion ended.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.430
A better way towards mutual
respect is to engage directly

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.870
with the moral conviction
citizens bring to life rather

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.420
than leave moral convictions aside.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.810
We have to listen first, understand
and engage in dialogue not

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.550
when we're angry, but engage
when we want to listen.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.430 position:56%
Mild discrimination are stereotypes.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.890
Stereotypes such as food.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.140
Some people would say, "Do
you want chili on your tacos?"

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.330
But there's some Mexicans that
don't put chili on their tacos.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.230
Some people don't like the taste.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:41.790
We stereotype people with
noodles or fried chicken or curry.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.320
Those are mild forms
of discrimination.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.180
They still don't affect others,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.990
but people are unaware how
they can effect someone

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.340
or pigeonholed someone even by
surnames, culture, language,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.690
looks, or color of the skin.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.270
Harmful discrimination
is protected by law.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.070
I know Lorena Sierra is here.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.980
She an EEO officer.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.080
She protects the disability,
the age,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.340
people of gender, race, ethnicity.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.290
Those are protected by laws.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.570
Some people use discrimination
to make themselves feel better

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.060
or making others feel less.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.200
When used this way it's the
attackers that are making less

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.050
of themselves and less
of this country.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.360
When you define others,
you define yourself first.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.580
Negative discrimination
is an attempt

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.480
to steal your identity
of who you are.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.450
No one talks about white on white
discrimination, but it happens.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.410 position:56%
Just ask William S. Sessions, former
director of the FBI, about persona

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.680
and his identity theft
by discrimination.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.150
Our persona is more
important that our data.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.890
Who we are is more important
than what someone else believes.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.760
No other person is invested
in us more than we are.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.240
Don't let anyone steal
your identity.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.790
Oppression and injustice
are discrimination.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.630
This book is about
work discrimination

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:30.220
where agents were trying to get
a fair deal, fair assignments,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:36.230
fair promotions and we
were being held back.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.370
The worst type of discriminations
come

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.860
from hate, fear and retaliation.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:53.340
I was assigned to Mexico City when
the lawsuit began and I transferred

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.640
in from the Denver office.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.050
When I transferred back
in from Denver to testify,

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.870
an agent who I had worked with,
a friend of mine, pulled me aside

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.290
and said, "Hey, I want to talk
to you about this lawsuit."

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.220
He took me to a room where
they kept the work boxes.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.230
We went there and he said,
"What's this lawsuit about?

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.540
We don't hate you guys?

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.270
We may hate the blacks,
but we don't hate you."

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.520
[ Laughter ]

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:32.240 position:56%
And I found out that he was kidding,
but our case was not about hate,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:41.200
that was the last thing the bureau
felt against the Hispanic agents.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.950
They just set us aside
and forgot about us.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:52.830
And it wasn't just management, the
FBI Agents Association was formed

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.780
for the purpose of attacking

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.040
or defending themselves
against management.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:07.780
In the late 70s when the cointel
program and other programs started

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.600
and the FBI agents were accused
of what they call black bag jobs,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.250
going in without warrants
and things like that,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.450
and they started making
the agents scapegoats,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.560
so they started the
Agents Association

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.420
to protect the agents
against management.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.510
Well when the Hispanics
filed a lawsuit and it was

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.080
against management, it wasn't
against our colleagues,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.300
the FBI Agents Association
decided to side on the side

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:43.450
of management and not the agents.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.830
FBI agents are supposed
to be strong, ethical,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:53.560
just, truthful, inquisitive.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.680
Let me read for you just
a minute from the book

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.920
about Ed Mireles who
is our guest here.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.220
This is one day in the life if Ed.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.840
Two FBI agents, Jerry Grove, Ben
Grogan, died in a hail of gunfire

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.740 position:56%
as five other wounded agents battled

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.830
through the carnage
of April 11th, 1986.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.340
A crime perpetrated by two armed

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.190
and dangerous U.S. army
rangers trained killers.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.970 position:56%
Face with the superior firepower of
assault rifles, the FBI agents stood

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.640
as a team with a purpose
and defended one another.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.140
Agents lay dead and
wounded in a quick exchange

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.900
as over 130 bullets
created blood chaos.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.680
As the two bank robbers attempted
to escape in a stolen FBI car,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.760 position:56%
Special Agent Edmundo Mireles Jr
despite being dazed from one gunshot

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.630
to the head and another that left
his left arm paralyzed while still

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.710
under fire sat up, supported
himself off a nearby car.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.260
Then using his body, his knees,
and his right hand cocked

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.110
and fired all the rounds in
a shotgun at the suspects.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.800
Faced with death his
fear dissolved into anger

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.890
and determination to
stop the killers.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.100
Ed dropped the empty shotgun,
pulled his revolver out

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.330
and staggered towards the
getaway car, shot and emptied all

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.840
of his ammunition leaving
the perpetrators dead.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.100
He had survived and in recognition

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.020
of his actions the FBI awarded him
the first ever FBI Medal of Valor.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.620 position:56%
Yet even before that dark and tragic
day Ed had survived other shots,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.420
wounds of discrimination,
when he sensed rejection

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.360
from within his FBI community.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.250
Ed would testify on the
discrimination at the bureau,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.560
but not as a class member.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.850
I remember Ed's testimony
on the day he testified.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.520
He was wringing his hands.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.300
He was crotched.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.770
His head was down.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.320
He spoke in a low voice.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.240
His voice cracked at times.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.870
He was nervous.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.230
You may want to ask him why
a different Ed than the one

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.880
that won the Medal of Valor?

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.820
Let me add that three agents
cried while testifying.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.620
One of them was my
compadre Greg Rodriguez.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.300 position:56%
Greg and I were partners in Chicago.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.190
We worked the FALN cases.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.480
We knocked on doors
morning, day and night.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.990
We worked 16 hour days.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.250
Michael Deutsch, who was
an attorney for the FALN,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:57.710
every time he sued the FBI they
would have Greg's name and my name

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:05.030
on the affidavit, but some
days we weren't even present,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.650
some days we weren't even working.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.760
We had a reputation of going
out there and knocking on doors

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.060
and trying to solve cases.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.470
Try testifying against
a dysfunctional family

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.580
or a dysfunctional school you
attended or a religion you follow

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:34.150
that convers up abuse or an agency
that represents Lady Justice,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.460
mother burial [phonetic],
father faith,

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.050
fidelity, bravery and integrity.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.020
Testifying against the
bureau wasn't easy for me.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.270
It wasn't easy for Ed.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:53.980
During the trail there was a lot of
words that came out; tamale squad.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.770
Tamale squad was when agents
first came in in 1970.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:03.710
The bureau didn't know what to do
so they put them all in one squad

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:09.990
and so we started called
ourselves the tamale squad.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.290
The Taco Circuit started.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:20.620
The Taco Circuit -a friend of
mine last weekend, Evan Dobbs,

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.980
told me he says, "That's the
first time I've heard taco used

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.530
as an adjective."

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.620 position:56%
And what was happening was that the
bureau was -the supervisor was going

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.830
out into the bullpen and
saying, "You Mireles,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.970
go out we need you [inaudible] 90
days in Puerto Rico, in Los Angeles

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.320
or New York or wherever on a case."

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.220
But in that bullpen was
also Adams, Williams,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.760
Jones who also spoke Spanish, but
it was easier for the supervisor

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.200
to see Ed Mireles because
of the color of his skin,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.950
Ed Mireles because his surname
for him to get those duties.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.400
He wasn't thinking
it was out of abuse.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:18.390
But it became abuse when we started
telling how come it's not happening

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.690
to them.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.370
And that's when they got upset
that you question management

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:29.340
and so that's when
the retaliation began.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.600 position:56%
On promotions there were agents that
were more qualified than others,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.050
and it was a good old boy system.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.910
A good old boy system;
picking your friends is easier,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.830
working with your friends is easier

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:46.960
than somebody who's touched all
the bases and you don't know them

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.070
and you say, "Well I'll
just pick my friend."

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.390
And that happens quite a bit.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.220
So it was that type
of discrimination

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.290
that was going on in the bureau.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.390
The other word that came up in
the bureau was angle helper.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:13.220
And angle helper was because
we would get assigned cases

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.300
and we would have responsibility
for them.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:23.460
When the responsibility came,
let's say Smith had a case

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:29.840
that needed Spanish speakers,
they would take us off our cases,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.720
go work with them, come back,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.780
and since they didn't speak Spanish
we would have to transcribe them.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.790
So we actually became what
they call angle helpers.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:46.350
There's also in the book there's
when Mat Perez was in El Paso

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:51.050 position:56%
as the ASAC he told his SAC he
says, "We need more Spanish speakers

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.130
because these people are
getting drained from their work.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:00.770
And the SAC said, "Well who's
going to talk to the bankers?"

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.920
As if Spanish speakers
don't talk to the bankers.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.830
Spanish speakers speak English too.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:15.120
El Navajo [phonetic] in his
book testified to the fact

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.970
that he was assigned to Puerto
Rico and was an angle helper

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.380
because agents were
being sent to Puerto Rico

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.560
that didn't speak Spanish so he
would have to go work their cases,

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:38.670
work his cases, and the term
angle helper came up in trial.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.970
FBI director Comey visited El Paso
and said, "Anytime you have people

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.070
in power, you're going to have at
some point people who go sideways

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.750
as a result of that power.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.190
You just have to hold
people accountable."

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.580
That's what I was doing,
holding people accountable.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.810
I did not testify against
the bureau.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.440
I did not testify against
colleagues.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.440
I love the bureau, I
love my colleagues,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.390
I testified against management.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.940
The people I worked for.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.950
The people I worked with.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.250
I was in management.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.060
The FBI is perfect.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.590
Individuals are less than perfect.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.580
I am less than perfect.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.730
Director Comey knows that
the FBI is constructed

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.740
as a perfect organization.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.290
I want to keep it that way.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.610
Educated, experienced

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.970
and responsible Hispanic agents
had the ideal work ethic required

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.210 position:56%
for premiere law enforcement agency.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.690
Hispanics had learned to
accept their humble beginnings,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.220
their accents, their language,
their culture, their surnames,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.790
their skin color, who they were.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.770
It was time for FBI
management to learn Hispanic men

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.430
and women deserve career
opportunities.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.000
Hispanics are just as good as
any other agents in trench coats,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.990 position:56%
wingtip shoes, fedoras, or FBI raid
jackets whether they have blue eyes,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.740
green eyes, or beautiful
brown eyes like mine.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:10.700
Let's see if you agree with me that
the actions of some supervisors

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.660
within the FBI were evil.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:22.690
I got assigned to Mexico City as a
case agent for Kiki Camarena and in

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.360
between that time I got a
call from a person who wanted

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.580
to give me some information.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.990
Apparently he had given the
information to the office before

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.790
and nobody did anything about it.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:40.440
So I called him in, listened to
him, spent the whole day with him

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.490
and told him I needed about
three days to write it out

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.880 position:56%
and I would call him back so I could
make sure I got everything right.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.400
I did and he came back
and we made some changes

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.010
and sent it out to the bureau.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:21:00.310
And he was hiding -he
was a bodyguard for one

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.990
of the president's cousins
who was running drugs.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:12.640
And so he decided when the
earthquake came he decided to hide

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.920
out and he decided he wanted to
get out of what he was doing.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.940
At that time we had two good
cases that were FBI cases

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.170
that we could have used him for,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.560
but my boss said, "Hand
him over to DEA."

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.710
He didn't want anything
to do with him.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.360 position:56%
So we handed him over to DEA and DEA
was working the Kiki Camarena case,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.910
which was a high priority case.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:48.680
He was running financially low
on his money, and so I told him,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.980
I said, "Why don't you just leave?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.320
Go to the U.S. now and
wait for DEA to call you."

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.630
And he said, "Well I
don't have any money.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.530
I have two guns."

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:05.430
And so I fixed it up for a security
guard company to buy the guns

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.050
from him, which they
were authorized to do.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:13.710
They bought the guns, I got the
money, gave it to the informant.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.950
And the guns ended up in the
truck of the car the first day

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.100
and my boss saw it and I had
told him what had happened

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.890
and did nothing.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:30.770
A year later I was accused
by customs and the DEA

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.380
that I was selling guns to
informants, which was false.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.990
And my boss I told him, I said,
"This has to do with the incident

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.800
about the two guns from Kermit."

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:52.640
Kermit is just a name
that I used for him.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:23:00.860
So Kermit left Huston and became an
informant for customs and for DEA

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.950
and that's where that
information came from.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:12.940
So my boss sends a note out to
headquarters and I was accused

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.680
of criminal activity, lack of
candor and insubordination to cover

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.720
up an event that occurred
a year earlier.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.350
I knew I could prove
I committed no crime.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.420
I also knew unless its
orange of my alma mater UTEP,

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.510
I wouldn't look good
in an orange jumpsuit.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.270
[ Laughter ]

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.230
However, the insubordination
and lack

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.270
of candor charges we're
my boss's word against me.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.400
I requested the FBI polygraph me

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.230
to prove I follows all my boss's
instructions and that I was candid

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.750 position:56%
at any inquiry of the investigation.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:56.070
The 1, 2, 3 levels above my
boss refused to polygraph me.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.490
Who's running this place?

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.790
Kim Jong-Il?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.090
[ Laughter ]

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.390
I was alive.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.690
I had to pinch myself.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.990
It was not a dream.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.750
I had to do something.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.760
I paid a retired FBI
polygrapher to examine me.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.570
I passed. The bureau
paid no attention

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.810
to the results and demoted me.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.850
Attempts to fix things
within the FBI failed.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.910
All 1, 2, 3 levels of leadership
management weren't interested.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:28.480
I could not understand what
integrity or the FBI meant

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.470 position:56%
to those managers, what emotion was
destroying their sense of reasoning,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.330
destroying their sense
of responsibility,

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:42.530
destroying the essence of
investigations within the FBI.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.740
I knew what the FBI meant to me.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.370
I was embarrassed and sad
that I had to take my case

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.200
to an outside agency, the
Merit Systems Protection Board,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.210
who reviewed my case and
overturned my demotion.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.550
The story of Mat Perez is worse.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.100
I'm going to deputize all of
you and make you SACs in charge

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:13.290
of an office, an office of 62
people; 55 in your field office

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:17.060
and the rest out in the field.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.820
Just to the north of us
you have a Navy shooting

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.370
where 10 sailors are shot.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.820
2 are killed.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.720
That's a major case.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:33.310
On the south of us you have
an [inaudible] Air Force base

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.820
that's bombed.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.170
25 planes are destroyed,
12 completely.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:47.910
Just on the east of
us -east is this way.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.710
Just on the east of us you have
a Navy ship that was bombed.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:59.950
And to the west of us you
have a police corruption case

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.190
where you're investigating
over 40 officers for corruption

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.460
and they're assigned to help
you with investigations.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:13.300
Now what would you do now that
you're in charge of your office?

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.950
You ask for help.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.090
You ask for help from headquarters.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:22.100
Headquarters sent him support.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.340
He was asking for specifically
for Spanish speakers

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.570
and for 90 days they
turned him down.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:34.160
They sent him whoever
they could for 30 days.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:42.130
If you've ever been to
Puerto Rico, you have streets

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.310
that don't make any sense,
the language is different.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.890
It's a difficult place
to get situated.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.780
So you had agents that were
coming it, you had to situate them

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.060
and then they would
turn around and leave

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.070
in 30 days -they weren't
being much help.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:05.590
So if they turn down manpower is

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.850
that discrimination
or mismanagement?

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.240
I'd go with mismanagement
at the beginning.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.840
Now you need computers
and you ask for computers

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:26.410
and the executive director says,
"Well you're behind Springfield.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.310
You're 7th on the list
behind Springfield division."

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.670
Springfield division
is a small office too.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:38.460
But instead of looking
at what the situation is

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:45.040
in Puerto Rico they put
you 8th on the list.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.530
There were 7 people ahead of you.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:53.920
The admiral on the base
seeing that people have died,

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.720
people are getting Purple
Hearts, knows the urgency,

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.530
so he contacts the CIA
and the CIA gives us state

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.170
of the art computers right away.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.640
Mat calls headquarters, asks

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.670
for computer personnel
to run the computers.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.530
They say no.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.100
Is that mismanagement or
is that discrimination?

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.050
Then he hears from a
friend of his who's

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.850
up in headquarters the
executive director says,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.830
"Let's see how he plans to
man those computers now."

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:41.050
For me that's discrimination
and that's evil.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:51.690
No leader, no manager, no one
is as important as any agency.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.140
No one has the authority

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.700
to undermine agency values whether
it's the Library of Congress,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.990
a corporation, or the FBI.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.950
Trump was recently
elected as president.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.750
He came out and said that
Mexicans are rapists.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.770
That Mexicans are murderers.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:19.670
That Mexicans are bringing
drugs into this country.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:25.620
And I'm OK with that because
Scottish people are rapists.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.220
Scottish people are murderers.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.520
Scottish people also bring
drugs into this country.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.490
What bothered me was when he said,
"I assume some of them are OK."

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.730
When he said that I
said, "I've been living

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.870
in this country for a long time.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.260
I've got five generations
on my father's side that are

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.400
from the New Mexico area, which
at one point was part of Mexico.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.150
I've been in this country
longer than many others."

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.490
When he said, "I assume
some of them are OK"

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.580 position:56%
that means he doesn't know Mexicans.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.250
He doesn't know Mexican Americans.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:13.660
He accuses a judge of Mexican
heritage that he would be unfair.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.430
He doesn't know Mexicans.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:22.520
My parents -not my parents, but my
grandparents had land taken away

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.170
from them in Mexico, in New Mexico.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:32.810
They took it away because
the deeds were in Spanish.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:38.120
And now we became part of the U.S.
so they said, "We can't read that.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.420
We don't honor that."

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.610 position:56%
So they gave it to settlers that
were moving into the New Mexico area

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:48.700
and other parts of the west.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:57.340
I grew up in Lakeside, a
subdivision of El Paso.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.460
Now you may think that
sounds aesthetically great,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.690 position:56%
but my view was a view of the ditch.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:11.900 position:56%
But kids in grade school made fun of
me because I had holes in my shoes.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:17.600
I had holes in my shoes,
but it wasn't me,

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.250
I didn't have holes in myself.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:27.440
I grew up in El Paso with a great
group of friends: Oscar, Joe,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.940
Ernie, or Robert [phonetic].

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.380
We went everywhere together.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.320
When we were in high
school or in college we had

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.650 position:56%
to develop our interpersonal skills.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.300
We also had to make ends meet,
so we would crash parties,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.870
weddings and quinceaneras.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.510
We'd call it networking with
food and drinks [inaudible].

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.420
[ Laughter ]

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.390
We're still waiting on the
movie The Quinceanera Crashers.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.760
[ Laughter ]

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.730
Some nights we would
crash at one of our homes.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.890
If it wasn't at Oscar's
house we would have

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.040
to stop at his house first.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.440
It wasn't to ask permission,
but it was to pick

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.840
up his blanket that he slept with.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.580
For Oscar Barajas, who we
called Cook [phonetic],

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.460
that blanket represented
his security.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.840
We complained the first night, but
then we just accepted him as is.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.940
Now before you think this
person speaking to you hung

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.560 position:56%
out with a bunch of wusses and
cried on the stand when he testified

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.020
against the FBI, let me
say that Cook was shot

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.640
and killed having dinner at
Howard Johnson's in Albuquerque

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.310
when two armed robbers came
in and threatened the cashier.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.900
They were looking for money
then they planned to kidnap her.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.680 position:56%
He intervened by trying to calm the
gunman down and protect the cashier.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.730
He did not retreat for
his security blanket.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:33:01.440
He rose to the occasion of
knowing his identity of who he was.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.580
Who he was cost him his life.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:11.310
The robbers took his life, but they
did not take away his identity.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:19.560
Ed Mireles did the same thing
when he had to stand up.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.640
Every day you are creating
a new you.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.540
Your personal identity is in
a constant state of evolution.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.750
We all have the power
to reinvent ourselves

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.580
and create a new empowered identity

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.380
that expands what is
possible in our lives.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.730 position:56%
The key is to take conscious control
of the beliefs we are creating

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:41.460
about ourselves so they can power
us towards what we desire most.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.960 position:56%
The power to tap into our tremendous
potential comes from our identity.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.330
How we define ourselves and having
faith in what we can achieve.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.400
Have faith to let go of
who you are at this moment

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.160
and accept how far you can reach.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.910
Your reach has enormous
potential beyond what's thought

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.180
to be possible.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.510
Let me do a Miami Senate.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:14.280
[ Laughter ]

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.950
Our identity is the
strongest influence

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.040
to our happiness and
our actions in life.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.540
Living inconsistent to
who you are creates a life

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.330
of disappointment,
frustration and stress.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.940
You don't want to live
someone's perception of you.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.440
You want to live and
embrace your authentic self.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.550 position:56%
Embrace your deepest beliefs, your
deepest fears, your deepest strength

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.690
to create the almighty
harmony in your life.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:45.040
I want you to please look
at the person next to you.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.580
Please vow that you won' kill
the potential in them or others.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.680
We are here to enjoy
the gift of life.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.900 position:56%
Vow the day [phonetic] from evil
thoughts that you will not diminish,

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.570
disregard, or steal anyone's
identity of who they are.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.910
None of them knows
what inside of you,

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.850
and you don't know
what's inside of them.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.180
Just as no one knew what
was inside of Oscar Barajas.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.070
In the face of death he knew
the value of right and wrong.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.230
Faced with death he cared
for someone he knew nothing

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:19.680
about more than his own life.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.560
Only you know your true identity.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.260
Only you know your true potential.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.090
Only you know who you are.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.260
Let no one steal your
identity of who you are.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.380
It's your right to inner
peace, your right to fairness,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.410
your right to the almighty
gift of life.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.710
Thank you all.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.010
I'll open it up for questions.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.490
I also want to ask Ed Mireles
to stand up here with me

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:44.510
and for you to honor him.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:36:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.430 position:56%
You can ask him any questions or ask
me any questions that you'd like.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.730
Yes sir.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:14.540
&gt;&gt; I'm here because my father
has a good friend who was

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:22.880
with I don't think the FBI
[inaudible] the Department

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.000
of Homeland Security
[inaudible] last year

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.950
or so awarded to the Mason case.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.250
[Inaudible].

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.060
My question is as your case and
any other case like that continue,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.150
what does the FBI and
Department of Homeland Security

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:45.280
or government [phonetic]
agencies do to try to make

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:52.840 position:56%
that process more justice [phonetic]
for people versus that [inaudible]?

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.080
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: I filed
an EEO case on January 1st.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:02.810
I pulled an agent from vacation
because my 90 days was going to end

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.530
on the next day on
the 2nd of January.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:11.470
So I pulled him off vacation and I
said, "You're taking my EEO case."

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.720
So I filed an EEO case and
it took 7 years to resolve.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:22.330
What I wanted for them
to do was take the lies

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.950
out of my personnel file.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.560
That's what I wanted.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.890
I took them 7 years to do that.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:35.970
I didn't see it coming and
those 7 years just chipped away

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.850
at what justice meant
to me and the FBI,

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.870
what investigations
meant within the FBI.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:45.540
They would assign people
to investigate EEO cases

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.760
and they would say, "Well
you can go over there,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.480
but just ask him this
part of the question.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.170
Don't ask him on this
side of the questions."

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.420
So, you know, if somebody
had told me and I had a badge

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.410
for the FBI, I'd say, "No.

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:57.710
Get somebody else.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.010
I'm not doing that."

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.310
I just couldn't do it.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.300
But I see it happening.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.550
I know that EEO cases
sometimes they're not as big

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:10.970
as what they -but people
get defensive.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:16.840
Supervisors get defensive when
a subordinate says something

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.760
about them and that's the
last thing they need to do.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.260
I wasn't going to talk
about it, but just think

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.210
of the Ferguson case, you know.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.850
Was it a race thing?

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.680
We hear it is, but
what about attitudes?

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.920
Could it just have been attitudes
where police had a bad day

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.100
and a young kid who had just
stolen something had a bad day?

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.810
And if we start investigating
things from that point in

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:49.750
and actually start negotiating.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.940
The EEO actually needs good
negotiators, they need to find

00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.180
out what it is, because people
get defensive, you know?

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:07.510
Racism is thrown out, prejudice or
bigoted is thrown out real quick

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:13.460
and so people get defensive,
they put up a wall automatically,

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:18.860
and so it's hard to talk through
that wall when you're trying

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.800
to get something settled.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.960
But I don't see there
any -to be honest

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.510
with you I haven't reviewed any
EEO cases, but I know that back

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:37.610
when I was doing the book
it was EEO cases less

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:43.470
than 10 percent there was
some kind of findings.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.520
So you think is it possible that 9

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.560
out of 10 people are
making up false claims?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.820 position:56%
I think there's a lot of unfairness.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.500
Just like I spoke about the
unfairness -I think it was unfair

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.940
for Judge Sessions to be removed
from the bureau as a director

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:11.910
when he flew out to San Francisco
to see his daughter in a ballet

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.060
and also visit the office.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:20.290
But the previous director would go
and talk to boys club and then go

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.720
and ski and play tennis is the
mountains of Denver, Colorado.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:33.030
So for me the system is unfair,
it's not always discrimination.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:41.090
But I really can't answer to
you if they're getting shorter,

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.330
but they should, they should.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:48.650
And if you ask for a good
negotiator to negotiate some kind

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.810
of agreement -but it's kind of hard

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.260
to prove discrimination
just like I said.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:59.890
If you're in charge of an office
and there's 4 major cases going on

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:05.220
and somebody is slow at sending
you manpower, is it stupidity?

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.070
Is it mismanagement?

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.520
When do you put the finger
on its discrimination?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.820
And discrimination
ought to be looked

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.800
at as is it unfair
for you to do this?

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:24.350 position:56%
Is it unfair for you to send people
to Nebraska on a case extra manpower

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.860
when they have less going on?

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.530
That's when you start
determining what discrimination is.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.980
I don't if Ed you want
to add something.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.120
No.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.220
[ Laughter ]

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.520
&gt;&gt; Ed Mireles: You did a good job.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.820
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: Yes.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.190
&gt;&gt; I have a question and I'm sorry,

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.490
I apologize, I came
in a little late.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:49.650
What was the outcome of the case?

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:50.950
[Inaudible].

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.830
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: The
outcome was that the FBI won,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.800
won in restauration because the
Hispanics won as the plaintiffs.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:05.770
The FBI lost as a case and
from that loss the FBI won

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:10.050
because as Roberto said
women were promoted

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.560
at an unprecedented
rate within the FBI.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.420
I had a chance to go before a
[inaudible] police seniority panel

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.980
and say, "I should be
at a grade 15 position."

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.210
And I justified my
position and I got it.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:31.190
Once you're given an opportunity,

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.230
you're basically saying,
"Hey, let me fail.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.750
Give me the opportunity to fail.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.140
That's all I want.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.570 position:56%
Just an opportunity to prove myself.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:40.870
That's what I want.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.640
Give it to me."

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.180
And there's Hispanics that
have failed and there's Anglos

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.090
that have failed and
blacks have failed.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.130
But then there's been a lot of them

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.370
that have surprised
people and been successful.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:59.080
So yes, we won the lawsuit.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.720
Hispanics didn't get any money.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.860
It was basically a [inaudible]
place seniority promotion

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.710
where we were asked to go
before an individual panel

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.930
to justify our positions.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:17.630
But the FBI won, the FBI won
because it became a better agency.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:24.080
Supervisors became more sensitive
and secret service, bureau prisons,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.950
DEA, all these other
agencies that were

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:31.790 position:56%
in law enforcement they opened their
books and said, "We need to look

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.090
at ourselves and see
what's going on.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.150
Because if the FBI can
lose with the Department

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.890
of Justice backing them
up, we're going to lose."

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.750
So there was a lot of changes.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:48.220
I spoke at the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission last week

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:55.090
and a couple of agents from the
IG's office came up and said, "Hey,

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.840
you've made it better for us."

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.140
And I think we did.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.970
I think IRS I even got notices from
[inaudible] that we did it better.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.870
So the FBI won.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.740
On the books they lost,
but the FBI really won.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.490
&gt;&gt; Ed Mireles: I just want
to echo what Sam said.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:18.380
First off, to clear the
record, I wasn't as rich

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.010
as Sam was when he was growing up.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.530
[ Laughter ]

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.010
He had shoes.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.450
[ Laughter ]

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.890
No, but Sam is absolutely right.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.520
The suit was righteous, OK?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.070
It was never about money.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.370
Never about money.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.670
I mean nobody was saying, "Hey,

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:38.070
I want a million dollars
to make me whole."

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.510
It was never about the money.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.590
It was about being given
a fair chance, you know,

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:48.160
being given the same chance
that your colleagues had, OK?

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.600
And Sam is also right the FBI
became a better organization

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.000
after the suit.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.660
However, if I could take
you back to that era,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.010
you would think their dog died.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.350
[ Laughter ]

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:10.810
Because they were appalled
that they had lost a case.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.830
And, you know, for us
it was a no-brainer.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.930
I mean how could you
not lose the case

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.220
for all the stuff that
you were doing?

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:23.020
And like Sam said, you know,
it wasn't done out of evil,

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:29.700 position:56%
it was just done out of incompetence
or stupidity or being uneducated.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.110
It's hard to describe.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:35.270
Don't get me wrong, I ran
into some bigots in the FBI.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:40.020
I know a couple that
were outright bigots, OK?

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.110
Against Hispanics and blacks,

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:46.670
and thank god they're
retired and long gone.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:52.540
But the FBI couldn't
believe it had lost a case.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.870
And then when the court told them
what they had to do, you know,

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:02.660
it was like the remedy was
worse than the actual disease.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:09.530
And I think that -if Sam will back
me up on this- I think the fact

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.050
that the bureau had to...

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.090
[ Laughter ]

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:17.650
Had to partake in the
remedy that the court set

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.900
out that was probably worse than
having to go through the trial

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.770
because I mean it's like
dragging a spoiled little kid

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.840
down to the doctor's office
to get a shot, you know?

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.710
But Sam is absolutely right
the FBI and the government

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:38.260
in general became a better
organization and especially women.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.110
My wife was an FBI
agent at the time,

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.120
you know, she became a supervisor.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.680
And probably because of the suit
there were more opportunities

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.160
for women that came open.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.460
Thank you Sam.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.830
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez:
Any more questions?

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.370
Yes sir.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:01.640
&gt;&gt; Yes. You testified at
the hearing or at the trial,

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.510
but you weren't actually
part of the lawsuit.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.650
Can you explain why?

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.260
&gt;&gt; Ed Mireles: Well it's
like Sam said, you know,

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:15.030
I grew up -I'm a product of the-

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.850
well my grandparents were a
product of the Great Depression.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:23.680
My parents were a product
of the World War II era.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.720
And I was their product.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.250
I can't say Korean War.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:34.640
But I grew up in an environment
where family, you know,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.010
the great spirit, church,
country, respect for family,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:45.450
respect for elders, love,
honor and all that stuff.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.470
And I'm a firm believer
in in that, you know.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.920
A friend of mine told me once, "Ed,

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.510
you're the worst employee
to supervise."

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.030
I said, "Why?"

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.200 position:56%
He said, "Because you're not loyal."

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.690
He said, "You're not
loyal to any individual."

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.110
He said, "You're loyal to causes.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.980
You're loyal to the constitution.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.010
You're loyal to the Bill of Rights.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.920
You're loyal to the rule of law."

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.140 position:56%
He said, "If somebody stands in your
way and he's not following the rule

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.750
of law or not following the
constitution," he said, "Ed,

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:19.030
you'll screw him over
in a heartbeat."

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.810
And so I mean I very
truly feel that way.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.560
The rule of law, OK, that's
what we all stand for.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.460
Justice and equality for everybody.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.920
I mean that's what guides me.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.240
That's my North Star
I guess you could say.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:38.100
And I looked at the FBI
as my second family, OK?

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:43.400
And then I found out it
was like -it was a shock

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:49.630
that maybe your family wasn't
as wholesome as you thought.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:55.850
And it was very difficult for
me to actually conceive the fact

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.250
that the FBI would
be doing these things

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.740
to his children, to employees.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:10.870
And when the first started I said,
"Well I support the suit in spirit,

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.310
but I have not directly
been involved

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:17.360
or been a victim of discrimination.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.150
But then as the suit
progressed I talked to more

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:25.280
and more people involved in
the suit and then as it turned

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:32.590
out I was subject to a transfer
from Washington, D.C., to Miami

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.910
and there were some
logistical issues

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:42.570
where the FBI transferred
someone from Miami to Washington

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:47.150
at a full-paid transferred, but
when it came time to transfer me

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.720
to Miami they said, "Well
we're doing you a favor

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.020
by sending you to Miami.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.470
You have to pay your
own way to Miami."

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.140
It's like wait a minute,
isn't the government supposed

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.040
to transfer its employees?

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.090
They said, "Yes, but we're going
to send your paycheck to Miami.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.190
If you want it you
got to go down there."

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:10.230
So anyway, that happened after
the lawsuit had been going

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:15.140
on for a while so I
joined at the very end

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.070
as a witness for the Perez side.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:23.910
And it was very difficult, it
was very difficult to testify.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.520
It was like -as Sam
said- it was like one

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.380
of the most difficult things I've
done, probably more so or almost

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:38.610
as bad as getting shot because
I felt I was betraying a trust,

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.820
you know, against an organization
that's bigger than anyone.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.120
It was bigger than me.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.160
But then I stopped to
rationalize it, you know,

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.530
the trust had already been
betrayed coming this way.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.760
Trust is a two-way street, OK?

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.160
And when I realized the trust had
been betrayed coming this way,

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.180
I didn't feel so bad when I thought
I was betraying the trust going

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.480
that way.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.280
Hope that answers your question.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.360
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: I joined the
lawsuit and I had a reason for it,

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.410
but if I didn't have a reason
for it I still would have seen it

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:15.210
with the assignments and being
part of the Taco Circuit,

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.440
part of the angle helpers.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.460
I mean I was dragged
all over the place.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.190 position:56%
Agents liked me because I did their
investigations and I did their work.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.150
But I thought it was unfair

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:33.690
and that's why the judge
found systemic discrimination

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:38.230 position:56%
within the FBI because of the system
that they had in place and using it,

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:42.480 position:56%
so I would have joined even if these
incidents hadn't happened to me.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.330
Any other questions?

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:47.180
&gt;&gt; Ed Mireles: Just to
follow up on what Sam said,

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.920
our promotion system is based
on your performance, OK?

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.790
How many arrests have you
made in the year 2016?

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.860
How many people have
you interviewed?

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.230
How many people have you indicted?

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.400
How many people have you,
you know, prosecuted?

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.700
And so on and so forth.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:10.830
If you are TDY from your office,
from your cases, for 3 months

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.310
and some cases 6 months, OK?

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.820
That's 6 months of you
not working, you're stuck.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:23.260
So you have less stats, less
evidence to prove your worth,

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.970
prove your contribution
to the cause.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:31.360
And the other guys, the guys
that Sam would have to help,

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.190
they would get their
stats, you know.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:34.970
Sam would help them arrest people

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.440
and indict people and
interview people.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.740
But he never got the credit.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.950
The other guy got the credit, OK?

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:43.440
So it's like Sam's like
[phonetic], "Hey Sam,

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.110
you only have 2 arrests this
year and Bill over there has 22."

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.970
It's like, "We're going
to promote Bill."

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:55.070
It's like wait a minute, I helped
Bill with those 22 arrests.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:59.320
So that's how it affected
the individuals.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.850
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez:
What Ed's talking

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:05.330
about is your statistical
accomplishments.

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:10.460
But then I spoke last week it's
also your administrative profile.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.570
And your administrative profile
is sometimes more important

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.290
than your statistics.

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.080
If you look at some of
the way promotions happen

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.760
within an agency it's who you
know and not what you know

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.440
and so sometimes that happens.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.740
You have a question?

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.040
&gt;&gt; Just a quick follow-up.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.280
Was [phonetic] there a mechanism
now in place as a follow-up to kind

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.090
of that discrepancy where
someone assists in helping you

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:40.060
by providing translation
or arrests, etc.,

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.360
like now they get credit as well?

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.990
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez: Well now
they have Spanish speakers

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.590
that aren't agents.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:51.690
A lot of them are doing
what they call the wires;

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:54.290
interceding the conversations.

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:55.650
They have them doing that.

00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.030
But as far as -I know that
they were making attempts

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:01.330
to hire more Spanish speakers.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:06.050
One of the things I didn't mention
was that if you were Anglo and came

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.830
in under the Spanish
program, there was a period

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:13.010
where they allowed you to opt out.

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.430
Well that policy never
said it's only for Anglos

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.450
so some Hispanic read
it and said, "Hey,

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.910
I want to get out of the program."

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:22.220
I said, "No you can't
because you're Hispanic."

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.900
So it was unfair in that system.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:32.690
But yes, I'm pretty sure that
there's still cases out there

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:37.630 position:56%
where somebody needs a Spanish
speaker because he goes into an area

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:42.550
where a case agent
may not speak Spanish.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:52.790
I'm not sure how they're
accredited now, but the burden

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.030
on Hispanics has diminished.

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.930
I spoke to an agent last week
who came out to the presentation

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:05.700
and he said it's a lot
better than what it was.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.110
Yes, madam?

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.960
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice for
young Hispanics entering the FBI

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.470 position:56%
or other organizations like the FBI?

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:17.430
Is it really just networking or
are there other things [inaudible]?

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.170
&gt;&gt; Samuel Martinez:
Do I have any advice

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.890
for people coming into the FBI?

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:23.580
Yes. It's a great organization.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.510
There's a lot of excitement.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.510
Each day is different.

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:35.500
You work with good people.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.980
[ Laughter ]

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.780
Mostly good people -until they get

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:47.390
into management then
they become evil.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:52.200
But no, I have great friends and
great colleagues in the bureau.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.730
It's a great career and I
recommend that field of work.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.410
They've now gone from the
criminal side more to security side

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:02.860
because of the terrorism
threats in this country.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:08.160
But it's an exciting field and
it's a great opportunity for women

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.950
and women are promoted
and they're in charge

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.340
of offices and everything else.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.640
So it's a good opportunity.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.070
I have some books that are
signed back there to sell.

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:25.190 position:56%
It's also on audible.com, but if
you live in D.C. it's under 10 hours

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.510
so in 2 commutes you
can go through the book.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:31.110
[ Laughter ]

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.470
But thank you very much for
having me and having Ed up here.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:36.270
We appreciate it.

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:40.040
[ Laughter ]

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.690
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
