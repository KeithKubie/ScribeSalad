Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. I want to hear your thoughts on over detachment. I'm a police officer and I'm sure military personnel experience the same over detachment defined as emotional separation from moments which required emotional response in family and profession. So what are you thoughts on over detachment? Yeah, this is definitely, obviously I'm always encouraging people to be able to detach because that's how you get your emotions out of the situation. But this happens to what my brother right here is talking about this police officer's saying, hey, sometimes you know, we think about being over detached and is something you need to watch out for because you don't want to go through your life where you have no more emotions. Cause then you're not living a life, then you're a robot or a machine and, and you don't, you need to have emotions. So what as I thought about this, I thought, how did I watch out for that?

Speaker 1:          00:56          And it's something that creeps in on anybody that does anything we could add. You don't even have to be a copper or a military person. I mean you could do, if you're any job that you have where you have free, can't just get all emotional about stuff. Um, if you're in finance, if you're anything you could just become detached. So how do you do, what do you look out for? One thing that I did and still do is compartmentalize and draw little segregation between work and home. Mm. Um, and there's a really easy way to do that, especially for people that are cops or it doesn't matter what you do, whatever that uniform is that you wear at work, whether you're a cop, whether you're military, whether you were in a business suit at work, when you get home, take off that uniform, take it off.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Matter of fact, if you can take it off before you get home, you know, leave it at the office. Yeah. Cause you want to leave that there. And when you get home, put on the home clothes, right? The t shirt, comfortable t shirt, the flip flops, the the shorts B, be relaxed at home, but be physically in a different uniform at home. Not even a uniform in a different change your change your appearance and therefore change your state of mind a little bit different music, right? Whatever it is that you're listened to at work, go to something different at home, Eh, you know when you're going into work, listen to the first hour of Jocko podcast when you're coming home. He listened to the second hour, right? That's how we do it. Yo, you want to have a different attitude, a different language, right? Don't come a home thrown around the in acronyms from work. Yeah, and you know I've talked about this before. I never swore at home. I swore like hell at work, but I never swore home so I was using a different language than I was completely compartmentalizing what I was doing at work and what I was doing at home. And then checkout your posture. What are you standing around your house like? Are you standing all cross armed and glaring at people?

Speaker 1:          03:04          Let's just ask the question. Are you in a modified weaver stance when you're talking to your wife getting ready to do a quick drunk? It's like a pistol shooting stance. Like that's, no, no. You know, are you, are you digging for under hooks? If your kids trying to give you a hug, you know what I mean? Are you looking to get the take down? No. You want to relax. Right. And another thing is find some, uh, you know, what's maybe maybe a group of people that aren't involved in your work. That can be hard. I mean, and, and luckily for me, my wife made friends that were outside of the seal community. And so I got a bunch of buddies that were, had nothing to do with the seal teams. They have their friends, they were friends with my wife. Yeah. Friends and husbands of my wife's friends.

Speaker 1:          03:47          So I had a whole group of people that are still hanging out with all the time. They have nothing to do with the military at all. In fact, many of them are as bad as far as you could get from military personnel is one could imagine. Yeah. And, but that's another thing that helped me segregate the two. Now, of course, I'm not saying you've got to let your guard down 100%, cause you shouldn't do that, but you should let it down enough that you can enjoy life. Um, and you got it attach sometimes. Now that being said, cause it's kind of, it is going to help you make good decisions. But there are also times where it's not good. And if you're detached and your wife's trying to talk to you, it's not going to be good. Yup. So open up, you gotta show some emotions.

Speaker 1:          04:37          And one of the things about being detached, here's a, here's a paradox. You gotta be detached enough so that you recognize when you're not showing enough emotion. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? If you're, if you're so detached that you being detached, it allow you to realize that, oh my God, I'm not showing any emotions at all. I'm too detached. Yeah. So don't try and be a tough guy that's just being detached. Cause if you're detached enough, you'll realize that you're being too detached. Yep. Yeah. And there is two d, well obviously like if you're, you know, you're in a debate argument, fight whatever with your girlfriend wife, right? And you're detached, let's say, you know, you're right. Let's say you are right. That has nothing to do with anything when you're arguing with you. Generally speaking though, in my experience, yeah, I would agree with that in my experience.

Speaker 1:          05:28          But here's the thing though, because when you're looking at a certain way, I just want to make that same. And again, when you're in an argument with like your wife or your close friend or any gifts, your boss, your subordinate, whether you're right or not is almost, doesn't matter at all. What matters is what you're trying to do, what direction you're trying to move. And is winning the argument being right or wrong, going to help you move in a direction to move in? That's the real question. Yeah. So detach for a minute and figure out the answer to that question. Yes. Cause I never care if I'm right or wrong. That's not never my goal. Well, in an argument with something, did I say never. Okay. I usually don't care the most for the most park. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think a lot of times, a lot of times people do care whether right or wrong.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Oh my God, they do. They care. We'll go psycho or being right or wrong. Yeah. One approved beyond, you know, like a reasonable doubt. All questions denied. I'm 100% right. You're wrong. And so even when people are wrong, they'll still want to just win the argument. Right? So that's, that's, that's bad. What can be even worse is when you are right, yet the other person is it, let's say your wife is emotional cause, and this is a known thing that, okay, the girls generally speaking, they, they want to know that you care more so than they want you to fix their problem. Like if someone has, if your wife is having a problem at work or something, right? They just want you to care that that's going on with them. They don't want like all this tricking advice. You know, that generally speaking, I'm not going to category is there, it's not black and white.

Speaker 1:          07:08          But generally speaking, so let's say you're in a debate or something, I say deep, you're an argument. You're in a fight and you know you're right in, let's say you are right. If you're all detached and being like, well, here's the logic behind why I'm right and you have this airtight case that's not going to help your relationship. She wants to know first off that you care. She's mad. She said she's whatever. Do you care about that? That's the way you win, not the argument. That's the way you in this situation. Yes. You know, and so not only are you, not only do you get out of the fight intact as a relationship, but you're the good guy. And really that's part of the reason why she likes you, because you're the good guy. That's a wind, wind roof. So yeah, that, that just sometimes question why my wife likes me at all.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's a, that's it. But yeah, so detached. So you see that but be attached because you care. Yes. Yes. And show that you care. And then when you go back to work, your comp, Europe, military person, you're a businessperson. Put your uniform back on, put your boots back on, put your body on back on lock and load and get back into detachment zone and move forward. Now at the question kind of implies this too, and I will point this out. I mean at work, you also can't just be detached all the time, cause you're, you're a leader, you're in a leadership position. So you can't just walk around just detached from every, no. You got to show emotions. You got to relate to the people you're working with. You've got to be a human so that they follow you or you follow them or whatever the case may be. So the detachment, you have to be detached enough to recognize when you're being too detached. Yeah. Less erudite. Yeah.
