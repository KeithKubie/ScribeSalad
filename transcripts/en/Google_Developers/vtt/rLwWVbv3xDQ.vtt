Flutter has a powerful animations engine

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.923
for adding motion
and effects to your Flutter app.

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:17.028
But sometimes, you just need
to do something simple--

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:19.118
like fading in a widget.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.329
And Flutter has you covered.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.910
Flutter has a bunch of transitions
ready to drop into your Flutter app.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.210
Let's take a look at <i>FadeTransition</i>.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.038
<i>FadeTransition</i> lets you fade
a widget in and out.

00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:34.539
It takes a <i>child</i> and an <i>animation</i>.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.770
But where does the animation come from?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.144
Well, first, we create
an <i>AnimationController</i>

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:40.719
to set the duration,

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.822
and then we create an animation--
giving the start and end opacity values

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:48.700
and animating via the controller.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.421
Finally, we start the animation
by calling forward on the controller.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:57.070
It's a good idea to wrap
a <i>FadeTransition</i> in the <i>StatefulWidget</i>,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.261
so you can manage its state
and clean up once it's done.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.001

and other transitions,
