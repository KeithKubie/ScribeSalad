WILLIAM LI: This
year, we had a number

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.750
of students who had taken
the class before who

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.010
we are interested in
being involved in some way

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.440
and acting as
mentors for projects.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.300
And so what happened was every
week in our Wednesday afternoon

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.870
labs, the teams of students
would meet with their mentor,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.300
and give them an update,
and get feedback from them

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.380
on their project progress.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.840
[? I ?] think the one core
reason of doing this this year

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.190
was to really draw on the
experiences of our mentors,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.360
having gone through the entire
process in a previous semester

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.060
and also being very passionate
about assistive technology

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.100
and passionate about how we
go about teaching this class,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.190
and also to try to keep teams
on track, to really understand

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.750
the different milestones,
the different deadlines

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.570
and iterations that are
important to be able to deliver

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.430
a successful project,
a successful prototype

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.580
by the end of the course.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170
I think overall it was
successful in terms

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.840
of having that personal
interaction with somebody

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.197
with some experience to guide
teams along in the process.
