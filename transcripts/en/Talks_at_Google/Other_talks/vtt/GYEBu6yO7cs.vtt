00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:04.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.310
Thank you for coming.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.270
My name is [INAUDIBLE] and
I'm on diversity [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.730
sourcing team in Sunnyvale.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.690
I'm very excited to welcome
Adisa Banjoko to Google,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.830
and he's going to talk about
his latest book, "Bobby,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.550
Bruce, and the Bronx-- the
Secrets of Hip-Hop Chess."

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.110
So I met Adisa for the first
time at Rock the School Bells.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.220
It's a conference for
students and educators.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.950
The purpose was
to give workshops

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.510
to enhance their ability
to critically think

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.670
about current issues
through hip-hop.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.500
So Adisa gave one of
the presentations,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.940
and after that I learned
more about connections

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.680
between hip-hop and chess.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.980
So I'm really excited to know
more about it and his book.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.340
So I'd like to talk a
little bit more about Adisa.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.239
So he covered Eazy-E and NWA.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.750
He was one of the first
writers to cover them.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.520
And he went on to
write early rap

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.100
publications such as
Source, Vibe, and Rap Pages.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.900
And he also-- he was also
one of the first writers

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.290
to cover the articles connecting
hip-hop to Eastern philosophy

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.210
and martial arts.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.570
And he also-- he's work of
Hip-Hop Chess Federation.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.700
So it's a nonprofit
organization,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.620
and it's to help young
people overcome difficulties

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.230
through hip-hop,
martial arts, and chess,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.070
and it was covered by Rolling
Stone, Forbes, and "Good

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.230
Morning America," and so on.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.480
So without further ado, please
help me welcome Adisa Banjoko.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.630
ADISA BANJOKO: Is this thing on?

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.570
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.910
It's really awesome to
be here, so thank you.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.639
So if you notice,
the title of the book

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.590
was a little different
a couple weeks ago when

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.910
I started this thing.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.360
"Bobby, Bruce, &amp; Bam," right.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.600
So we're talking about
Bobby Fischer, Bruce Lee,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.900
and Afrika Bambaataa.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.550
So you'll see him there
and you see him there.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.800
Unfortunately, despite
being a pioneer of hip-hop,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.890
he's been caught up
in an insane scandal.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.450
So we switched it to "Bobby,
Bruce, and the Bronx,"

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.660
which is where he's
originally from.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.970
So this whole thing is changing.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.450
You can go to
BobbyBruceAndBam.com

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.840
and still buy this book as it
looks, but in about 72 hours,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.084
it's "Bobby, Bruce,
and the Bronx."

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.542
MALE SPEAKER: It's
changed already.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:49.573
I just went to it.

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:50.419
The domain's off.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.460
ADISA BANJOKO: Is it off?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.640
Yeah, see, I got good people.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.556
They're already like--

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:54.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.370
--they're good people,
like, we're switching it.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.200
So I just got the
new cover last night.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.110
So in any case,
my name is Adisa.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.790
My nickname is the Bishop.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.080
You know, my nonprofit.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.170
Hip-Hope Chess Federation,
fuses music, chess,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.230
and martial arts to
promote unity, strategy,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.930
and nonviolence.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280
Essentially, when
I was young, I was

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.120
obsessed with kung fu films.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.740
I was obsessed with
the television show

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.700
"Kung Fu," Bruce Lee films.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.400
And when I got
older, I started--

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.280
my first interview,
my first job writing,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.690
was to interview Eazy-E for
my high school newspaper.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.680
And at the time, I was
kind of hustling him.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.527
He didn't know.

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:38.110
Like, they had just dropped the
record and I called over there

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.300
and I was like, hello,
is Eazy-E there?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.340
And they were like, no.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.610
I left him a message.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.900
I was like, I'm a big-time
writer from the Bay Area.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.290
I'd love to connect with him.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.560
Can you have him call me?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.070
And then when I came
back, my mom was like,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.170
oh, this boy named Eric
left a message for you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.240
from Los Angeles.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.432
And I was like, really?

00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:55.140
So then I called.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.980
He was like, hello?

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.040
And it was his house.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.180
It was his home number.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.240
I was like, uh,
yeah, I really like

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.570
the record "Boyz in the Hood."

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.630
I think it would be good
if I did a story on you.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.190
So he was like, OK.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.950
So over the course of some
weeks, I keep talking with him,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.700
and I interviewed him.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.334
My mom was a secretary,
so she had all the stuff

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:16.209
that you could hook up
the phones at the time

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.490
to record interviews.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.410
So I recorded this
interview with him.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.600
And we just became like,
it was this odd friendship

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.520
between this gangster rapper
and this suburban black kid.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.250
And I remember one day,
he's like, so hey, man,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.640
is this going on
"The Chronicle"?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.550
My manager meant to
ask me to ask you,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.700
is it in "The Examiner"?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.600
Like, who do you write for?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.980
And I was like, I
gotta be honest, man.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.610
I'm just a 17-year-old kid, man.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.240
I just really like your music.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.290
And the song really
wasn't a hit.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.070
I mean, "Boyz in the Hood" was
only like maybe a month old.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.574
So he was like, I don't care.

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:54.240
This is awesome.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.360
Let's do the story.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.670
So I did the story,
and we stayed cool

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.600
until he passed away.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.910
But that's how I got
my start writing.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.547
And so this was before
hip-hop magazines existed.

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:05.880
You know, there was no "Source."

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.100
There was no AllHipHop.com,
no World Star.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.370
None of that stuff existed.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.572
So the more that I started
listening to hip-hop,

00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:13.780
around that same time, I'm
listening to Public Enemy,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.760
and I'm hearing them say things
like, "no matter what the name,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.250
we're all the same, pieces
in one big chess game."

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.810
And so lyrics like that, because
I liked chess-- and I do,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.460
I love chess.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.668
I'm just not that good at it.

00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:27.400
So do not think I'm like going
to wow you on the boards at all

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.020
ever.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.170
But the reason I liked
it is because I started

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.820
learning things about life,
about patience and things

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.527
like that.

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:36.610
And the more I listened
to hop-hop over the years,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.130
I made this bank in my
head of what was what.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.520
And so I started realizing
that these connections were

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.580
really deep.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.780
Later on, I created the
Hop-Hop Chess Federation, 2006,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.342
and the way that happened is
I went for an author visit

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:55.800
for one of my other
previous books,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.216
which was called
"Lyrical Swords."

00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:58.450
It was my first book.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.660
And so I went into
the juvenile hall.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.780
I was bombing,
because they wanted

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.882
me to talk about journalism as
a career, and none of the kids

00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:07.840
cared about journalism.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.504
They're like, you
ever met Snoop Dogg?

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:10.920
I talked to him
on the phone once.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.360
You ever met so and so?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.190
They didn't care
about writing at all.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.272
So I was like, all right,
so, do any of you guys

00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:20.230
know how to play chess?

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.606
Because I just started
teaching my son

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.480
chess, and I just happened
to have the pieces

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.760
in a bag in my thing.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.620
So I'm like, I'm going to waste
time teaching these kids chess,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.060
because I'm sure they
don't know how to play.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.840
I said, who here knows
how to play chess?

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.500
And like 85% of the room.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.612
I was like, OK, so,
who's the best in here?

00:06:37.612 --> 00:06:39.820
I only want you keep your
hand up if you're the best.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.600
Only the best.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.421
And then only a few
hands went down.

00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:44.046
I was like, here's
what we're gonna do.

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:45.837
We're going to have a
tournament right now.

00:06:45.837 --> 00:06:47.637
Whoever wins will get a book.

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:48.720
They were like, all right.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.010
So everybody circles up.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.709
So the first game, these
two black kids are playing,

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.750
and there was this white
kid who was in the hall,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.150
and he was in the inner circle.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
So the guy was getting
ready to move his knight,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.499
and he was like, don't
move your knight.

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:02.040
And dude was like,
shut up white boy.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.427
Nobody asked you nothing.

00:07:03.427 --> 00:07:05.760
So he moves his knight, loses
his queen, loses the game.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.301
And then everybody's like, oh,
the white boy knows what's up.

00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:10.230
We gotta pay
attention when he's--

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.859
So then when I first
asked who the best was,

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:14.150
there was this kid in the back.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.691
He was obese.

00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.436
He was like 300 pounds.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.590
He was in the back.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.920
And I was like, you the best?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.850
And they're like,
shut up, fat boy,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.510
this isn't a sandwich
eating contest.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.093
And everybody's like,
laughing at him.

00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:24.777
He's like no, no,
I'm really the best.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.110
So I said, all right, come here.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.210
Come here.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.930
I was like, all right, so
my boy says he's the best.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.160
We're going to see what happens.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.201
So he plays, and he does.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.080
He beats everybody.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.810
He gets a book.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:38.319
And what I saw was that racial
barriers, and pecking order--

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.610
you know what I mean, in the
traditional pecking order,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.380
the obese kid wasn't
really respected.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.640
But now he was respected.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.130
And I was like, man, how crazy
is it that all of these kids

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.740
actually know the
game, can play it well,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.380
but they've made mistakes in
their life that landed them

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.880
here?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.610
That doesn't even make sense.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.100
So as I was leaving,
all the rap lyrics

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.640
I ever heard about chess in
that bank that I'd been making,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.100
they all just hit me.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.800
And I was like, all right,
all right, this is the thing.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.140
If I take the rap lyrics
to lure the kids in,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.330
I can start teaching
them more about chess.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.390
But then that even
wasn't enough, right.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.220
I mean, chess is awesome.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.120
It's a great game.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.120
It's one of the few global
games that people play.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.640
If we got on a plane
and went anywhere,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.220
I guarantee you almost
in any city we landed in,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.751
we would find some people
playing outside playing chess.

00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:32.500
And then while we were
playing, somebody's

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.380
going to drive by banging
out Jay-Z, banging out

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.049
Wu-Tang, or, know what I'm
saying, 50, whoever, Drake.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:41.820
And all of those guys have
mentioned chess in their music.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.350
So I was like, well,
if chess isn't enough,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.840
it has to be about life
and stuff like that.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.520
So at that point, I started
researching chess more.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.745
And it turned into
what we have now,

00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:53.450
the Hop-Hop Chess Federation.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.200
And so we don't
just teach chess.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.020
We have a bunch of
life strategies.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.120
Some of the life strategies
are in the book--

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.820
the first 12 filters,
different ways

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.000
that you can look at long-
and short-term goal planning,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.240
look at recovering
from loss, look

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.570
at just being more patient
about the idea of what you can

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.340
do with any given situation.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.050
And emotional control.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.240
I was working-- to
create the book,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.430
I started doing research
by working at a school.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.096
But I didn't have a
teaching credential,

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.510
so I got in as a security guard.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.910
And it was crazy.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.690
I saw crazy stuff going.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.120
I learned a lot about American
education and its failures

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.360
and some of its strengths.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.740
But I also mainly learned
a lot about drug abuse,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.999
alcohol abuse, gangs.

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.290
I learned a lot about violence.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.956
I learned a lot about
how to communicate

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:46.670
with kids who are really
active gang members,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.960
you know what I mean,
or live in those areas.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.710
And one of the main
things I learned about

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.670
is how many of our children
in America, especially

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.330
in the urban sectors, they
have-- basically they're

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.940
walking around with
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.802
And it's undiagnosed
and it's untreated.

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:04.260
And then we're saying, but how
come Johnny doesn't have all

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:04.570
A's?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.111
Well, because Johnny's
thinking about

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:08.930
he might actually catch a bullet
either on the way to school

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.770
or on the way back.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.520
Or some of these girls, you
know, that carry knives,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.020
not because they're bad people
but because they get harassed

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.880
and they don't-- you
know what I mean?

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.171
They don't have any protection.

00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:21.450
And so that kind
of stuff, it really

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.170
elevates their stress levels
and their sense of focus.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.030
And so here we have
this Venn diagram here,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.980
where you can see
these overlapping

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.730
themes between music,
chess, and martial arts.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.760
Nonviolence is such a really
big part of what we do,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.870
and we do it through
teaching martial arts.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.607
A lot of times
when I say we teach

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.690
jiu-jitsu, people are like,
wait, what's going on?

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.770
Because rap already has this
frame of being super violent.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.270
So then it's like,
hey, what's going

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.080
on with the jiu-jitsu, man?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.300
And I'm like, well,
really, if you

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.230
look at-- if you think
about who are some

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.516
of the most nonviolent and
peaceful people on the planet,

00:10:57.516 --> 00:10:59.140
you say, well, you
know, Buddhist monks

00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.960
or Shaolin monks.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.210
I'm like, exactly.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.790
And they train their whole
life in blades, in punching,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.150
in kicking, in throwing
stars and all these weapons.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.989
And it's because they have
confronted all of these fears

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:14.280
and all of these concerns
about violence and everything

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.340
else that they're
completely at peace.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.084
And so people don't
understand that.

00:11:18.084 --> 00:11:19.500
A lot of the
violence that happens

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.110
is because these kids
are stressed out.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.651
They don't have any
physical outlets.

00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:28.451
They have no way and no filter
of how to assess and understand

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:29.450
what's really happening.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.890
And that's why they lash out.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:36.000
And so that's why Brazilian
jiu-jitsu is what we teach.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.630
And so this is at
one of the schools

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.260
here in the Bay, down
in East Side San Jose.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.300
And it was really crazy,
because this school,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.260
when I started teaching there,
just a few kids played chess.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.780
And then by the
time-- I was only

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.440
there for like a month or two,
I would open my classroom up

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.580
at lunch to have
games, and we would

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.020
have near riots over games.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.390
When you see this girl here, she
had just begun playing chess,

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.310
and then she ended up being
like one of the strongest

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.720
players in the school.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.750
And I remember at
one point they had--

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.420
she was basically at
the end of a tournament,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.610
and there was this boy.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.650
And then the guys had
kind of come in first,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.370
and they were all kind
of milling around,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.470
and this armada of girls came.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.170
And like, 'cause Amber,
she walked in first,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.550
and her head was kind of down.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.920
She was kind of in everything.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.290
And there were like 12
girls who came to the door.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.980
And I'm like, what's up?

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.604
And they're like,
we're here for Amber.

00:12:32.604 --> 00:12:35.030
I was like, OK, welcome.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.210
So they came in, and
they had this huge game,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.604
and then she won it after
being chased around the board

00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:42.520
with very little material,
but she figured out

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.330
how to outsmart
the dude and win.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.510
And like the school was nuts.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.450
And I used to be like, hey, you
guys got to-- it's chess, man.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.200
They were just too wild.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.830
So again, unity,
strategy, and nonviolence.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.085
When you're teaching
chess, you're

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:57.335
essentially teaching strategy.

00:12:57.335 --> 00:13:00.410
And when you're
teaching, strategy

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.530
comes from a Latin
root word, strategos,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.360
which means leader of the army.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.060
That's what chess is about.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.820
If we want to get
kids out of gangs,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.590
if we want to get them out of
doing all kinds of wild group

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.410
activities, we need to
help them to be comfortable

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.490
believing in the power
of their own decision

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.470
and trusting their own decision.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:27.570
And so leadership is such a
big part of what we do here.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.420
That's one of my
students right there.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.490
He's actually blind,
and I currently

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.350
teach him chess and jiu-jitsu.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.172
And we have a chess and
entrepreneurship class.

00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:39.630
Entrepreneurship
is such a big deal

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.720
because I think as the American
economy and the world economy

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.470
continues to become
more digital,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:50.240
that kids can actualize their
ideas for business purposes

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.500
faster than ever.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.820
And even just their
access to information

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.030
has never been greater.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.510
So I was meeting with-- I
was talking with some kids

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.660
just last week, and I was
like, my daughter taught

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.212
herself Python between the
ages of like 12 and 14.

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.670
She could make like
80 grand a year

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.128
just based on what
she knows, dude.

00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:11.040
I know you could do
something like that.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.660
You don't have to
go learn Python,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.500
but you could do something.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.850
And so this youngster
here, because he's blind,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.320
he wanted to create a phone app
that helps people order food,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.760
because his retinas
don't function.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.740
So even though he can
kind of walk around--

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.864
sometimes he uses a cane,
sometimes he doesn't-- he

00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:31.820
can't read menus.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.360
So he created this
idea for an app

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.520
called Eye Menu,
like E-Y-E, Eye Menu,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.230
and it's going to help
people read menus.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.900
And it has a Siri
component, so people,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.520
even if you can't see what's
on the phone, you can hear it.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.390
And so I helped him put
everything together.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.140
And then he went
and did this pitch,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.800
and he was awarded 100,000.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.800
And so we're working
on the app right now.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.070
This is me and Tupac.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.020
That's Pac on the
right, obviously.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.360
And he was a chess player.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.420
He was a friend of mine.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.640
We met that moment.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.350
We had only known each other
for one minute at that point.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.020
But we met through the guy on
the left with the polka dots.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.617
And you know, me and
Pac were always cool.

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:19.950
You know, he was a chess player.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:24.130
And so if you see Mr. Makaveli
moving pieces like telekinesis,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.720
if it's a chess game, let's
play with real pieces.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.340
Now that may or may not
make a lot of sense to you,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.260
but really what that's about is
something that really brought

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.140
me to love chess and this idea
of fusing it with hip-hop,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.010
and that is that a lot of really
good chess players are in jail.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.170
They're in prison.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.770
And if you go look
up, I think it

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.699
was-- was it the
Princeton chess team,

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.240
or I think it was
the Princeton chess

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.755
team went to go play at Rikers
and got housed-- housed, OK.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.640
But in most prisons,
a lot of wardens

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.290
do not like the
inmates to play chess.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.410
And they often take the
boards and pieces away

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.510
from the inmates.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.140
And it seems to be based
around this really stupid idea

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.440
that the algebraic notation,
like when you're playing chess,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.200
how you move to
e-4, e-5, they have

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.840
this idea that the inmates
will use the algebraic notation

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.150
to do something sinister.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.520
And then the CO-- I
don't know what it means.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.590
Oh, there's a riot.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.660
But that's not going to happen.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.320
And that's such an insane fear.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.470
But it's real.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.690
So a lot of times
they take it away.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.620
I know inmates who have told
me that they've played chess

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.460
through the wall
with other inmates,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.420
speaking in algebraic notation.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.320
Do you realize the cognitive
function in play to do that?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.290
That's insane, right?

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.730
And so one of the
things-- so when

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.340
he says it's a chess game, let's
play with real pieces, look,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.050
he didn't say Tupac
was playing, he

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.820
said Makaveli's moving pieces.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.940
Who's Makaveli?

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.920
Obviously the Italian
philosopher, writer,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.280
whatever, who made
"The Prince," which

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.089
changed Tupac's
life, which made him

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.609
call himself Makaveli, right?

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:12.150
So it came to Pac during this
time when he was on lockdown.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.210
And so he's talking about, I
can play with real pieces now,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.474
you know what I'm saying?

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.890
Like, let's play
with real pieces.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.599
I'm no longer in solitary.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.160
That's the kind of psychology.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.420
And the reason I mention
that is because so

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.740
many American children
are not getting groomed,

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.990
and not having their
cognitive functions

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.750
enhanced the way
that they could be.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.780
And so I want more
technology companies

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.250
and I want more
innovators to start

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.080
looking in the hood for
these kinds of people.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.460
Any kid who could
play blindfolded

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.860
speaking in algebraic
notation, they

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.310
could either be working here
or create the next Google.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.480
There's a lot of wisdom
in our local community

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.199
that we're not cultivating.

00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:06.740
And it's not their
fault that they're

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.730
from East Side San Jose.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.190
It's not their fault
that they're from Oakland

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.620
or whatever.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.411
It's not their fault
they're from East L.A.

00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:14.120
But I know we can do more.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.650
And so again, chess
and entrepreneurship.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.990
When I talk to the kids,
Jay-Z, Will Smith, Drake,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.940
J Cole, 50 Cent, RZA and
GZA, I remind the kids

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.780
that a lot of the top-tier
dudes are chess players.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.280
But the reason why kids
in hip-hop play chess

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.320
is not to win trophies.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.980
So like right now, you
know, Magnus Carlsen

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.300
is the world champion.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.770
If you say, hey, what do
you think of Magnus Carlsen,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.270
the average kid is going
to shrug their shoulders.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.103
They don't know him.

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:43.350
They don't care.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.880
They don't care because
they don't play chess

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.860
for the same reason.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.910
They're playing it to get sharp.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.110
I don't know if you've ever
seen the movie "Fresh."

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:59.350
it's a movie from the '80s about
this kid whose older sister is

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.600
being pimped out by
this heroin dealer,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.160
but his father, who's
played by Samuel Jackson,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.870
is a street hustler
who plays chess.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.720
And so the more that the kid
plays chess with his father,

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.430
he figures out how he
can get his sister away

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.480
from the drug dealer.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.340
And so it's a great film.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.590
And then the movie like
"Searching for Bobby Fischer,"

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.930
you know, it's about Josh
Waitzkin, and so, you know,

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:27.070
Josh's entry into chess
is playing in the streets.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.090
And then he gets a
classical teacher,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.400
and there's kind of like
this philosophical breakdown,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.780
and he ends up going back
to the street hustler

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.495
to help him get
his game back up.

00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:36.870
And ironically,
in his real life,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.360
he ends up quitting
chess and then going on

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.230
to get a black belt in
Brazilian jiu-jitsu,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.960
and he's a really
good dude at that.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.040
So I tell the kids, you know,
Jay-Z, Will Smith, these guys

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.241
are not successes by accident,
you know what I mean?

00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:52.490
They think about what they do.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.448
They plan what they do.

00:19:53.448 --> 00:19:56.147
And you need these
tools to be successful,

00:19:56.147 --> 00:19:58.230
and that any success that
you get that you haven't

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.270
planned for, you lose it.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.270
You see people all the
time who win the lottery.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.436
In three years they're broke
and back in the trailer

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.990
home or whatever, because they
don't know what they're doing.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.490
They didn't plan
to have that money.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.281
And so you should make
plans to have money.

00:20:10.281 --> 00:20:12.150
You should make plans
to enhance your wisdom

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.358
and figure out where you're
going to be down the line

00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:16.110
and how to quantify
it and qualify it.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.120
And so that's what's in my book.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.750
In the back they
have these 12 filters

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.980
about long- and short-term
goal planning and other things.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.560
So this is one of the
highest moments of my life.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.820
The World Chess Hall of Fame
called us, asked us to come out

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.980
and do basically an exhibit.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.326
You know, it's like a museum.

00:20:36.326 --> 00:20:37.700
And so when we
did this thing, it

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.190
was called Living like
Kings, our first day we

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.280
had more visitors than came to
the World Chess Hall of Fame

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.294
to see Bobby Fischer's exhibit.

00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:47.960
Like, there were lines
around the block.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.918
People couldn't get in.

00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:49.780
They were mad.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.600
And all of this stuff happened
during Mike Brown and Ferguson.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.980
So like, the central west
end is where we were.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.135
Ferguson was like 15 miles down
the road, and it was on fire

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.510
and there was helicopters and
there was all this madness.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.710
But RZA and I went there.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.830
We spoke to about 500
kids at this one event

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.910
about nonviolence.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.450
And the police had
killed a kid the night

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.870
before, after Mike Brown.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.310
His name was VonDerrit Myers.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.550
And so me and RZA
are like, we're

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.939
about to do this
nonviolent talk now?

00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:21.980
You know what I'm saying?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.670
It's never been harder to sell.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.492
But it worked.

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.450
The kids understood what
we were talking about.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.880
And we left there and we
went to a juvenile hall,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.260
where we played
chess with the kids

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.050
and talked to them
about chess and life.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.000
And then we ended
up-- that's where

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.624
we started our first
program, actually,

00:21:37.624 --> 00:21:40.060
was in the juvenile hall there.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.320
And the reason I say that is
because I know this works,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.110
in terms of teaching
nonviolence,

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.680
because of all the
rioting and the looting,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.510
there was a completely
skewed experience of what

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.150
was happening in St. Louis.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.982
But we were actively
and directly working

00:21:57.982 --> 00:22:00.440
with kids in the hood, helping
them understand nonviolence,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.180
and they were getting it.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.210
And so that exhibit
lasted about a year.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.810
And it was the second
biggest and most diverse

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.604
attended exhibit that they had.

00:22:16.604 --> 00:22:18.020
And so I was really
proud of that.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.120
I was really proud of that.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.760
And so the main way
that we teach chess

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.740
is through teaching the
cultural connectivity.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.237
Like, I went and did a talk at
Harvard School of Education.

00:22:29.237 --> 00:22:31.320
This guy was like-- this
Latino kid came up to me.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.010
He was like, I really like
your talk, but you know,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.000
chess is just really an
old white man's game.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.650
I don't understand why you're
using this old white man's game

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.364
to try to teach
kids in the hood.

00:22:41.364 --> 00:22:42.530
That doesn't make any sense.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.330
And I said, well, I
guess it all starts

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.970
with your
misunderstanding of chess.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.136
The idea that you think
it's an old white man's game

00:22:48.136 --> 00:22:49.180
is exactly why I teach.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.596
And he was like,
what do you mean?

00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:53.090
So I said, well, chess
comes from India.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.810
And then the Arabs learned
it from the Indians,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.460
and as they raided and traded
through the Horn of Africa

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.110
and came over to West Africa.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.050
The Africans got it.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.246
And then in 700 AD, they looked
across the Iberian Peninsula,

00:23:04.246 --> 00:23:07.500
and this German guy had
a problem with someone

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.804
who had attacked his
daughter in Spain,

00:23:09.804 --> 00:23:12.220
and he was like, I think they
got a lot of money in there,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.720
man.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.990
You guys should see what's up.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.970
So the Moors were
like, let's go.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.172
And they crossed the
Iberian Peninsula.

00:23:18.172 --> 00:23:19.880
And they came in and
they brought algebra

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.390
and they brought the Greek
classics, which they had

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.820
been translating, from Baghdad.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.160
And they brought chess boards.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.150
And that's how the Jews and the
Christians started playing it.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.280
So it goes from Spain
into France and Sicily,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.100
and then eventually
it goes into England.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.070
And you know, Benjamin
Franklin is the second American

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.340
by name known to play.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.300
And he wrote this essay called
"On the Morals of Chess,"

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.010
and it breaks down how
chess helps your character.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.736
And that small
essay alone totally

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:52.110
changed my life, like when I
started trying to figure out

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.550
that I'm going to do this.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:24:00.700
And so I said, you know, the
first complete books on chess

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.970
were written by the Muslims.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.260
But then the Jews innovated
and the Christians innovated,

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.450
and so everybody kind
of owns this game.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.930
There's not a game that so many
different cultures and races

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.780
and face completely
are connected to.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.214
And so this is why.

00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:16.880
And he was like,
that's the story of it?

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.170
I was like, yeah,
that's the Cliff Notes.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.580
I mean, it's much deeper.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.590
But there's a book called
"The Immortal Game"

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.230
by David Shank you could read.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.880
And an amazing woman
over at Stanford

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.840
wrote a book called "Birth
of the Chess Queen,"

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.965
about how the chess queen
wasn't an original piece.

00:24:30.965 --> 00:24:32.730
It was the king and his vizier.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.200
And then over time, as
the more women in Europe

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.030
started taking on
leadership positions

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.129
if the kings would die, the
queen gets on the board.

00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:44.420
And she didn't start that
strong, but little by little,

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.753
over a couple centuries, she
becomes the strongest piece

00:24:46.753 --> 00:24:47.340
on the board.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.230
Telling that story
to young girls

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.880
totally changes their posture.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.680
I see them sit up more.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.345
And we say, look,
you know, it's not

00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:55.720
enough to just
say you're a king,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.428
or it's not enough to
say you're a queen.

00:24:57.428 --> 00:24:59.896
Kings and queens move
in very specific ways.

00:24:59.896 --> 00:25:01.270
So when you're
out on the street,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.980
you can't just act any way.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.610
You have to know that
queens don't move like that.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.380
You have to move like a queen.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.330
And then you will see
differences in your grades,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.820
and you know what I mean, who
you are around and all that.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.540
And so it's been a great ride.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:20.935
So BobbyBruceAndTheBronx.com
is coming.

00:25:20.935 --> 00:25:24.790
I just got a few more swaps.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.980
And there's Emmanuel right
after he got his award,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.740
and we're working on
Eye Menu right now.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.180
We have a summer
camp we're doing.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.249
And he learns jiu-jitsu, too.

00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:40.290
He's going to have his
first jiu-jitsu tournament

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.460
in about four weeks in Alameda.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.385
And we're starting
to slowly grow.

00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:47.260
The other thing I want
to add before I finish

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.800
is just that one of the other
things that I've learned

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.140
is I started intending
this to take it

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.900
to black and Latino
kids in the hood.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.674
That was my original
plan, because I

00:25:55.674 --> 00:25:57.590
felt like a lot of the
American school systems

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.860
were ignoring them,
and there weren't

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.880
enough African-American
philanthropists

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.210
or whatever to help them.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.600
So that's why I created this.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.302
At risk-- so if I say
at risk, you know,

00:26:09.302 --> 00:26:11.010
you're thinking, you
know, Latino guy who

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.640
might be a gang member,
or a black dude who

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.240
might be a crack dealer or
weed dealer or whatever.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.820
That was my intention.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.190
After I created it and the more
that I started engaging kids,

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.950
I realized that there was the
separate group of at-risk kids,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.550
and they actually tend
to be white and Asian.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:36.020
And they're actually just--
I was kind of loud and crazy,

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.625
but I was a nerd
when I was a kid.

00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:39.500
But there are a lot of
kids who are just kind

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.924
of quiet and
reserved, and parents

00:26:40.924 --> 00:26:42.340
will start bringing
me their kids,

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.220
and they'd be like,
hey, this is my son.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.230
When he comes home, he
just sits in his room.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.980
He doesn't go out.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.646
He doesn't talk.

00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:49.970
He doesn't do anything.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.600
And I'm worried about him.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.050
He hasn't done anything,
you know what I mean,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.130
but he doesn't talk.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.190
He sits in his room all day.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.260
So I sat down with him,
talk to him about chess,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.000
get him to play a little bit.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.910
I know he's not
necessarily thrilled

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.350
about the idea of doing
jiu-jitsu because he's small

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.250
and he's not really engaging,
but I get him on the mat.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.220
And now these kids are totally
different human beings.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.040
And what I'm finding is
that this second group

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.550
of at-risk kids, they're a
lot bigger than we thought.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.000
At the school that I was at
originally in San Francisco,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.360
it was so wild with fights, with
blacks and Latinos and kids who

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.000
were cutting
themselves and kids who

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.280
were drinking and just wild,
that a lot of the Asian kids

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.100
aren't even considered,
right, because it's

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.700
like, as long as they're not
trying to shoot up the school

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.799
or start a fight,
we're happy with them.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.840
But we don't know what's
happening in their head.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.660
Like, that kid might
want to jump off

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.800
the third floor right now.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.280
We have no idea.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.610
So I would always refer to the
Asian kids as the invisibles,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.650
because just because
they were quiet,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.280
just because they were getting
A's, didn't mean they were OK.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.080
And the school was
OK with, as long

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.830
as they weren't
actively fighting,

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.500
we didn't worry about them.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.910
And so I think that there is
this second group of at-risk,

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:15.300
socially withdrawn kids, boys
and girls, that I'm noticing

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.220
in schools and in
America, and I think

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.974
that we should be working
on helping them as well.

00:28:20.974 --> 00:28:22.390
You know, we need
to start working

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.510
on helping them as well.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.880
And I think that chess is
just such a great tool.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.590
It raises cognitive function.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.460
Kids who study chess
have-- their math grades

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.960
are 15% higher.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.760
Reading comprehension goes up.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.470
There's so many
studies-- not even

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.469
recent studies, studies
that go all the way back

00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:42.580
to the '70s that
talk about this.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.970
And chess is so cheap.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.320
There's no reason
we shouldn't have it

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.514
in every school every day across
America, especially when, I

00:28:50.514 --> 00:28:51.930
mean, you've seen
the test scores.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.090
Our kids need help.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.280
Our kids need help.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.110
And this is absolutely
a great tool.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.800
So thank you for coming.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.680
If you have any questions,
definitely feel free to ask.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.549
On Instagram, I'm
@RealHipHopChess,

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:08.590
and you can see some of
the kids that I work with

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.490
and some of the
stuff we do there.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.090
And then HipHopChess.com is
the regular site for the orb,

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.690
for the nonprofit, and
"Bobby, Bruce, and the Bronx."

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.570
Look for it.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.007
Got some shirts over there.

00:29:20.007 --> 00:29:20.590
You guys rock.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.550
Any questions?

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.470
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
at-risk students.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.305
I wanted to know,
what do you believe

00:29:27.305 --> 00:29:28.930
are the characteristics
of your program

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.502
that they respond to that
maybe other programs,

00:29:32.502 --> 00:29:34.960
other activities kids could
get involved with doesn't have?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.240
Is it about personal attention?

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.560
Is it the subject matter
is interesting to them?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.270
ADISA BANJOKO: You
know what it is?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.630
I mean, most of the kids--
that's a great question,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.820
and I think the first part
is just-- there's two things.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.070
One, I don't think-- even a lot
of nonprofits that mean well,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.870
I think that they
don't connect with kids

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.590
because they're afraid of
who they're trying to help.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.710
So, we've got this great
after-school program,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.260
but don't beat me up.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.880
And so you can't teach
kids you're afraid of.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.150
And the other part is,
you can't judge them.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.740
So I didn't come in saying,
hey, so what's up, dude?

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.140
You look like you're a
Norteno, what's going on?

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.850
You want to sit?

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.630
I don't do that.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.592
I just play chess.

00:30:17.592 --> 00:30:19.050
And then little by
little, they see

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.754
that the judgment isn't there.

00:30:20.754 --> 00:30:22.420
And then they'll be
like, man, you know,

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.660
I just stopped smoking weed.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.300
Oh, for real?

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.570
OK.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:25.444
You know what I mean?

00:30:25.444 --> 00:30:26.537
And you know, that's it.

00:30:26.537 --> 00:30:28.870
That may be the only thing
you get for like two weeks is

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.530
that they stopped smoking weed.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.420
And then you'd just
be like, you smoking?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.250
No?

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.310
OK, cool.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.820
All right, that's good.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.400
Don't smoke.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.000
And little stuff like that.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.040
And so I think it's just
the human engagement.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.750
What I'm finding
is a lot of kids,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.860
whether they're withdrawn,
like some of my newer students,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:53.090
or whether they're gang impacted
or very active in the streets,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.380
the lack of judgment and
the consistent engagement

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.610
is what makes it happen.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.310
That's what makes it turn.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.170
And then when you're
playing with them

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.210
and you're talking
about, well, why did you

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.310
move the knight there?

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.935
What did you think
was going to happen?

00:31:06.935 --> 00:31:07.990
Then you're helping them.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:12.582
Because chess is helping
them reassess their flaws,

00:31:12.582 --> 00:31:14.290
and that's a hard
thing for anyone to do.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.420
And they're using chess
as a filter to self-assess

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.820
and reassess.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.230
And then when you help
them without judging them,

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.827
they want to learn more.

00:31:22.827 --> 00:31:23.660
That's what I think.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.407
Anyone else?

00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:32.170
All right, well,
thank you very much.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.647
I really do appreciate your
time, and this was awesome.

00:31:34.647 --> 00:31:35.480
Thank you very much.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.330
Thanks a lot.
