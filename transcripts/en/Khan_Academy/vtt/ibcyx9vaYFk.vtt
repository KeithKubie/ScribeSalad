00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:01.621
- [Voiceover] We have a passage here,

00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:03.490
this passage is adapted
from Richard Florida,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.490
"The Great Reset."

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.230
I've been finding these
passages interesting

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.000
so I'm excited about this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.450
In today's idea-driven economy,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.200
the cost of time is what really matters.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.460
With the constant pressure to innovate,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.840
it makes little sense to waste

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.670
countless collective hours commuting.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.970
So, the most efficient
and productive regions

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.661
are those in which people
are thinking and working -

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.840
not sitting in traffic.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.060
The auto-dependent transportation system

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.590
has reached its limit in most
major cities and megaregions.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.100
Commuting by car

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.830
is among the least efficient
of all our activities -

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.240
not to mention among the least enjoyable,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.820
according to detailed research

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.150
by the Nobel Prize-winning
economist Daniel Kahneman

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.890
and his colleagues.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.090
Though one might think

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.770
that the economic crisis beginning in 2007

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.771
would have reduced traffic

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:55.890
(high unemployment means fewer workers

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.731
travelling to and from work),

00:00:57.731 --> 00:01:00.100
the opposite has been true.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.290
Average commutes have lengthened,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.529
and congestion has gotten
worse, if anything.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:08.119
The average commute rose in 2008

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.839
to 25.5 minutes,

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:13.250
"erasing years of decreases

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.899
"to stand at the level of 2000,

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.759
"as people had to leave their homes

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.019
"earlier in the morning

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.469
"to pick up friends for their ride to work

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.490
"or to catch a bus or subway train,"

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.500
according to the US Census
Bureau, which collects figures.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.850
So this right here is
I guess a direct quote

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.240
from the US Census Bureau.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.490
And those are average figures.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.990
Commutes are far longer in
the big West Coast cities

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.209
of Los Angeles and San Francisco

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.339
and the East Coast cities of New York,

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:46.619
Philadelphia, Baltimore
and Washington, DC.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.229
In many of these cities,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.419
gridlock has become the norm,

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:54.759
not just at rush hour
but all day, everyday.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.070
The costs are astounding.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.509
In Los Angeles, congestion eats up

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.399
more than 485 million
working hours a year;

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.989
that's 70 hours or nearly two weeks,

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.169
of full-time work per commuter.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.238
In DC, the time cost of
congestion is 62 hours

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.838
per worker per year.

00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:19.948
In New York it is 44 hours.

00:02:19.948 --> 00:02:21.008
Average it out,

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:25.519
and the time cost across
America's 13 biggest city-regions

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.129
is 51 hours per worker per year.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.578
Across the country,

00:02:30.578 --> 00:02:34.008
commuting wastes 4.2 billion hours

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.008
of work time annually -

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.268
nearly a full workweek for every commuter.

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:41.468
The overall cost to the US economy

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:43.918
is nearly $90 billion

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:46.338
when lost productivity and wasted fuel

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.458
are taken into account.

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:51.988
At the Martin Prosperity
Institute, we calculate,

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:53.479
so I guess that's where he works,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.508
we calculate that every minute

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.108
shaved off America's commuting time

00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:01.478
is worth $19.5 billion

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.348
in value added to the economy.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.238
The numbers add up fast:

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:11.979
five minutes is worth $97.7 billion;

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.508
10 minutes, $195 billion;

00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:18.399
15 minutes, $292 billion.

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.029
It's ironic that so many
people still believe

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.498
the main remedy for traffic congestion

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:25.758
is to build more roads and highways,

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:28.368
which of course only
makes the problem worse.

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:32.018
New roads generate higher
levels of "induced traffic,"

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:34.998
that is, new roads just
invite drivers to drive more

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.468
and lure people who take mass transit

00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:39.228
back to their cars.

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:42.498
Eventually, we end up
with more clogged roads

00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:46.078
rather than a long-term
improvement in traffic flow.

00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:47.949
The coming decades will likely see

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.258
more intense clustering of jobs,

00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:52.468
innovation, and productivity

00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:56.428
in a smaller number of bigger
cities and city-regions.

00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:58.179
Some regions could end up bloated

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.068
beyond the capacity of
their infrastructure,

00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:02.758
while others struggle,

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:05.318
their promise stymied by inadequate human

00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:06.928
or other resources.

00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:10.088
All right, so this guy,
he is very anti-traffic,

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.228
very anti-long-commute-times

00:04:12.228 --> 00:04:13.869
and it seem like he
doesn't think the solution

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:15.568
is more roads,

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.428
because he thinks that will
just get more people driving.

00:04:17.428 --> 00:04:20.698
We have a chart here, The
Most Congested Cities in 2011,

00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:24.998
Yearly Hours of Delay
per Automobile Commuter.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.728
Year hours of delay.

00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:30.758
Yearly hours of delay
per automobile commuter.

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:34.127
Here we see DC is actually
at the top right over here,

00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:36.488
at least for this list
Phoenix is at the bottom,

00:04:36.488 --> 00:04:37.947
although there's probably
many other cities

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:38.947
if we were to keep listing them,

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:40.587
these are the biggest cities,

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:43.108
the most congested cities in 2011.

00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:44.988
The average of these very large cities,

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:48.228
look it's a little over 50
hours, they talk about that.

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:50.498
A normal workweek is roughly 40 hours

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.948
so it's saying the average commuter

00:04:52.948 --> 00:04:57.299
is spending over a week of worth of work

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:58.748
sitting in their car,

00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:00.918
sitting in traffic maybe
getting stresses and frustrated.

00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:05.018
This is the argument of this passage.

00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.782
Looking forward to doing the questions.
