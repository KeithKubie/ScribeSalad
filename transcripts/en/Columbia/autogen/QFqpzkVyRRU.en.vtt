openings are decreasing by a factor of
 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.010
openings are decreasing by a factor of
two each being one half the size of the

we pour particles in here of course and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440
we pour particles in here of course and
 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.159

be sand or mud let's stop for a second

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
be sand or mud let's stop for a second
 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.159

and talk a little bit about gravel

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169
and talk a little bit about gravel
 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.830

you can see are bigger than two

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780
you can see are bigger than two
 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.140
you can see are bigger than two
millimeters but smaller than four

next we can see that pebbles are from

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570
next we can see that pebbles are from
 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.629
next we can see that pebbles are from
four to sixty four millimeters and I'm

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639
four to sixty four millimeters and I'm
 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.810
four to sixty four millimeters and I'm
going to mark this on the chart so you

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820
going to mark this on the chart so you
 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.260
going to mark this on the chart so you
can see the range of sizes and I have

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270
can see the range of sizes and I have
 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.820
can see the range of sizes and I have
here a fairly small pebble and some

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830
here a fairly small pebble and some
 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.120
here a fairly small pebble and some
successively larger ones with this

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130
successively larger ones with this

pebble being about the biggest that you
 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.000
pebble being about the biggest that you
could get so pebbles are good for

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010
could get so pebbles are good for
 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.519
could get so pebbles are good for

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:54.940
the use of the sibs there are machines
 

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.840
the use of the sibs there are machines
that will shake these for an official

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.850
that will shake these for an official
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:04.160
that will shake these for an official
amount of time

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.170
 
 

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:27.450
 
in idea results move away some of these

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:27.460
in idea results move away some of these
 

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.520
in idea results move away some of these
particles and let's demonstrate the

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:32.530
particles and let's demonstrate the
 

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:38.900
particles and let's demonstrate the
results indeed we have some gravity

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:38.910
results indeed we have some gravity
 

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:44.160
results indeed we have some gravity
number 10 mesh sieve and if we look at

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.170
number 10 mesh sieve and if we look at
 

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.230
number 10 mesh sieve and if we look at
it we actually will find a particle here

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240
it we actually will find a particle here
 

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.750
it we actually will find a particle here
that looks like it might be the smallest

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760
 
 

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.840
 
the next the number 18 match to sieve

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
 
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:02.460
 
shows that we do have some very coarse

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.470
shows that we do have some very coarse
 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:09.060
shows that we do have some very coarse
sand and indeed it has a very coarse

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:09.070
sand and indeed it has a very coarse
 

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:27.780
sand and indeed it has a very coarse
sand to it the next sieve number 35 mesh

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:27.790
 
 

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.930
 
shows you a significant quantity of

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:30.940
shows you a significant quantity of
 

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.980
shows you a significant quantity of
course and then we have medium sand on

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:35.990
course and then we have medium sand on
 

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:44.140
course and then we have medium sand on
the number 60 mesh sieve so far that

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.150
the number 60 mesh sieve so far that
 

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.230
the number 60 mesh sieve so far that
pile seems to be the biggest number 120

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240
pile seems to be the biggest number 120
 

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.410
pile seems to be the biggest number 120
mesh sieve very fine sand significantly

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:53.420
mesh sieve very fine sand significantly
 

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.270
mesh sieve very fine sand significantly
smaller pile the very fine sand and even

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:58.280
smaller pile the very fine sand and even
 

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:08.940
smaller pile the very fine sand and even
smaller pile and if we look in the pan

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:08.950
 
 

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.510
 
there is a very small amount what we

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:13.520
there is a very small amount what we
 

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.140
there is a very small amount what we
would call mud so we can see from this

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.150
would call mud so we can see from this
 

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.760
would call mud so we can see from this
analysis that clearly 3/4 maybe even

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:21.770
analysis that clearly 3/4 maybe even
 

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.940
analysis that clearly 3/4 maybe even
more of the sand is coarse and medium

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:24.950
more of the sand is coarse and medium
 

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.460
more of the sand is coarse and medium
sand very small amount of gravel very

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.470

very small amount of mud the end member

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.350
very small amount of mud the end member
 

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.030
very small amount of mud the end member
is very fine sand and very coarse sand

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040
is very fine sand and very coarse sand
 

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.120
is very fine sand and very coarse sand
in limited quantities so anyway this is

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.130
in limited quantities so anyway this is
 

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.700
in limited quantities so anyway this is
a demonstration of the sediment size

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.710
