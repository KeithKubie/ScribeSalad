00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.480
A farm supply store carries four
different brands of pesticide.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.210
Each brand sells pesticide
of a different concentration.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.900
And each brand also has a
different size of bottle.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.640
So here we have the
different brands,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.030
they give us the bottle
size, the concentration,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.220
so that's the percentage of this
fluid volume that is actually

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.680
pesticide that's actually
active ingredient.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.302
And then they tell us
the price per bottle.

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:27.510
And they ask us if we want
the most active ingredient

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.260
for our money, you
should spend your money

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.180
on bottles of brand
question mark.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.330
So let's just think about
which of these brands

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.930
gives us the most active
ingredient for our money.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.960
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.740
and try to think about
this on your own.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:58.990
Well, let's just think
about active ingredient.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.250
I'll just write
ingred for short.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.610
Ingredient per bottle.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.730
And I'll do this in milliliters.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.130
So, we have 375 milliliters, 65%
of which is going to be active.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:30.230
So 65% of 375 gets
us 243.75 milliliters

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.280
of active ingredient per bottle.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.395
How much is that active
ingredient per dollar here?

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.020
Well, you could just
reason through it.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.480
You say I have
273.75 mLs for $22.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.950
So if I want per dollar,
I'll just divide this by 22.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.080
So let me see.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.970
If I just do that as
my previous answer,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.790
which is that divided
by 22, and I'll just

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.620
round to the nearest
penny, $11.08.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.120
Let me see.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.920
This is in mLs.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.710
11.07.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.420
Once again, this is
in mLs, not dollars.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.170
This is mLs per bottle,
milliliters per bottle,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.092
divided by $22 per bottle,
gets us 11.07 mLs per dollar.

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:22.550
Actually, let me
write it that way.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.710
mLs per dollar, just so we
can keep track of the unit.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.050
This is mLs per bottle.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.630
Now another way that we could
have thought about it is look.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.220
You have 273.75 mLs per bottle.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.740
We want to get it
to mLs per dollar.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.500
So we want to get rid of a
bottle in the denominator.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.470
So we would want to
multiply it by something

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.210
with bottles in the numerator.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.530
And we want to introduce a
dollar in the denominator,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.480
so it would be
bottles per dollar.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.250
And how many bottles
are there per dollar?

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.690
Or another way to think about
it is one bottle is $22.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.530
So you multiply 23.75 times 1
over 22, you would get 11.07.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.634
And that cancels with that,
milliliters per dollar.

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:17.050
And notice, you could have
done this through common sense.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.680
This is equivalent
to just dividing.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.740
This is how much you get for
a $22 bottle, divided by $22,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.030
you get the
milliliters per dollar.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.210
But either way, let's do
it for the rest of them.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.200
So for this one right over here,
in general, to figure this out,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.710
we just have to multiply the
concentration times the bottle

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.210
size.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.550
And then divide it by the price.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.460
So let's just do that
for the next three.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.900
So the concentration is 35%.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.770
So 0.35 times 750.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.830
So this expression
is going to give us

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.020
the milliliters of
active ingredient.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.200
And then we can divide
by the cost per bottle.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.400
So this is 12.5
milliliters per dollar.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.490
Now this next one,
they give us one liter.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.380
But we know one liter is
equal to 1,000 milliliters.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.000
75% of that is going to
be active ingredient,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.570
so we're going to
have 750 milliliters

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.026
of active ingredient.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:26.150
And it's going to cost $68.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.520
So we just divide this by 68.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.760
And we get 750
milliliters divided by 68,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.040
it gets us $11, and
if we round, $0.3.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.220
We're in milliliters.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.670
11.03 milliliters per dollar.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.070
Have to be very careful.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.390
This is milliliters per dollar.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.020
That's the whole point of this
is to keep track of the units.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.510
So this isn't dollars, this
is milliliters per dollar.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.760
And then finally, 1.5 liters.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.160
We'll times 1,000
milliliters per liter.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.360
This would give us
1,500 milliliters,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.860
30% of which is active.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.410
So 30% of 1,500 milliliters.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.690
That's 450 milliliters.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.110
And then we can
divide that by $40.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:38.760
So 450 divided by $40 gets us
to 11.25 milliliters per dollar.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.156
So which one is the best deal?

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:41.656
Well, the best deal
is the one where

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.200
I get the most
milliliters per dollar.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.970
And that's brand
b right over here.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.860
I get 12.5 milliliters
per dollar.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.603
I'm getting the most
pesticide for my buck.
