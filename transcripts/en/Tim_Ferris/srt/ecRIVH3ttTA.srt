1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,740
Called the four hour work week,

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:06,570
escape the nine to five live anywhere and
join the new rich and enjoys this line

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,100
this morning from New York. Good
morning. Good morning. Catchy title.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:11,791
I gotta tell you this,

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:16,791
but can anyone really have a successful
career at a productive business on just

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:21,570
four hours a week? Are the
surprising answers? Yes.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,900
If you'd asked me in
2002, I would've said no.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,390
I put in the usual 8,200 hour,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,390
quite literally workweeks
in Silicon Valley,

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,820
first as an employee and then as a CEO,

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,821
but a part of giving my guest lectures
at Princeton University and high tech

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:42,150
entrepreneurship led me to question a
lot of those assumptions about career and

13
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:46,740
work life balance. And after 20
countries and dozens of case studies,

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,870
the conclusion was yes, it can be done.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,930
And it's really in a world where the
average work week is now 70 hours.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,390
According to Forbes, the, the
option is either up or down.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,770
And I think a lot of people want to go
down. A lot of people want to go down,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,660
goes according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. Um,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
more Americans are working longer
and longer than we ever have,

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,180
or we have just as obsessed with the job
that we are obsessed with getting ahead

21
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,660
or do we not understand how to work
more effectively and efficiently.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,740
I think that there are
a number of issues. Um,

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,710
we have a certain dedication
in the u s to hyperactivity.

24
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,960
So it's a real fixation on,

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,200
on activity and being busy as
opposed to being productive.

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,920
And when you sit down and you look
at how, let's say Richard Branson,

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,680
the CEO version works,
uh, or you look at, uh,

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,970
the CEO of let's say Ikea,

29
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,760
you notice that there are some distinct
differences in how they operate.

30
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:42,750
They and we all have the same 24
hours. So when you break it down,

31
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,990
you see that even someone like Branson
says he can handle his business in the

32
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,110
first 15 minutes of each day if you
prioritize this properly. All right,

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,770
but for most, go ahead. And I want to
get to some of the examples because we,

34
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,060
when you talk about, uh, cutting
down a of the amount of time,

35
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,310
we don't have that much time.
So let's talk about this.

36
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:03,990
You say Americans can't eliminate 50%
of their work in the first 48 hours,

37
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,980
50% of their work in their, in just 48
hours. Tell us how that's possible too.

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,270
So the first thing you need to do is
define their work very clearly on,

39
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,390
and Peter Drucker said this was
the biggest challenge. So what,

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,030
how is my performance being
measured? Uh, once you do that,

41
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,030
you wanted to do an 80 20 analysis
and two ways. So the first,

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,290
as you look at the 20% of activities
that are really contributing 80% of the

43
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,690
desired outcomes. And then conversely,

44
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:32,370
you look at the 20% of people
and activities that are
consuming 80% of your time

45
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,550
and then work to minimize
or eliminate those.

46
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,040
And the effects can be quite dramatic,

47
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,010
especially when we cut out a lot of
the email distraction that people are

48
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,770
addicted to your socio. You're
saying focus, focus, focus.

49
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:48,771
In the book you mentioned trading your
boss to value a performance over presence

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,070
mean let's look at the final product as
opposed to the amount of time I spent at

51
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,910
the desk in the cubicle or in the
office. That's exactly exactly right,

52
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,560
so moving from a a presence based model,

53
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,260
where are you measuring ass
and seat time so to speak,

54
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,720
to a performance and results based model.

55
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,130
And so when I've spoken to companies
like Google and paypal and others,

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
they're already moving in that direction.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,290
But even as an employee you can help
catalyze some of those changes on a

58
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,670
personal level and really train your
boss to look at your output as opposed to

59
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,340
just the hours that you're
putting in your eyes.

60
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,300
So don't worry about how much
time I spent at the office.

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,770
We'll look at the final
product in the book.

62
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,690
You also say we should go to the media
fast for one week and not be anything.

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,200
Turn off the TV, magazines,
newspapers, et Cetera,

64
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,220
except focusing on your book is that
seems a little dangerous to have people

65
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,670
live in a vacuum. But are you saying
this will help us to focus on our task?

66
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,900
It's a no, you're exactly right. It's
not so much operating in a vacuum,

67
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,901
but recognizing that in a digital world
you'll always have less attention than

68
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,370
information that's imposed on you. So, uh,

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,960
going on a low information diet and
blocking out the things that are either

70
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,040
irrelevant to your, your
objectives or in actionable,

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,760
which happens to be most things.

72
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,260
So really reestablishing those barriers
and filters is key to a single tasking,

73
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,440
so to speak. All right. And when
you, I guess we were saying once you,

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,740
once you accomplish this, but can
you join the new rich, I mean,

75
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,190
will you be able to find yourself getting
the pay raises and the increases that

76
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,860
you, that you, that you think
you've earned and deserve?

77
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,470
I absolutely envy the
keyword being earned. So, uh,

78
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,510
you'll find that as soon as you start
living a lifestyle and a career by design,

79
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
it's not only possible to increase
your output while decreasing the input,

80
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,710
but it's really mandatory because people
will abuse your time to the extent that

81
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,231
you let them.

82
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,070
And time is really what makes your income
valuable or not valuable. All right,

83
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,551
