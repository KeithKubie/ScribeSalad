00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.370
they did that
yeah but it still felt kind of

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:09.380
yeah but it still felt kind of
 

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.780
yeah but it still felt kind of
challenging because I wouldn't have

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:10.790

was playing it more safer well I think
because not only do they make these

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.490
because not only do they make these
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.270
because not only do they make these
choices but they also shot it's so grand

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:22.280
choices but they also shot it's so grand
 

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.490

moments where they don't need to talk in
 

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.690
moments where they don't need to talk in

whole point of the film I think is to
 

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.610
whole point of the film I think is to
kind of remove that sense of like legend

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:57.620
kind of remove that sense of like legend
 

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.680
kind of remove that sense of like legend
