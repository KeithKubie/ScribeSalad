00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.910
September 9, 2015 I was standing outside the
Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, planning

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.379
on getting a car heading to the US Open.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.210
I do some corporate appearances and sponsor
visits and things like that.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.410
I didn't think much of it.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.029
I looked up while I was waiting for the car
and saw someone running towards me, and as

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.110
he got to me I was smiling thinking this was
some sort of friendly encounter—a fan or

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.280
someone that was just a long lost friend or
something—but he quickly dispelled that

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.970
myth in my head and put me on the ground and
slammed me to the ground and had his knee

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.220
in my back and cuffed me and told me to not
say a word and just listen to whatever he

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.220
had to say.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.220
So I did.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.220
I complied.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.100
I had seen everything in the news about noncompliance
or perceived noncompliance of anyone in custody

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.530
of the police so I stood up and did what he
said.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.060
And they said it was just a case of mistaken
identity, but it was clearly, in my mind,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.860
excessive, and it didn't need to be handled
that way when there were five officers on

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.479
the scene and could have easily just asked
me for my identification and moved on and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.110
not had any sort of an incident.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.060
As it was happening I was pretty much in shock.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.070
I try to think of myself as pretty calm, cool
and collected, and I didn't know what to do

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.509
and what to say, how to act—because I hadn't
been put in cuffs like that before, I didn't

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.560
know how else to get my point across because
they weren't listening.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.630
I was trying to let them know that my US Open
credential was in my back pocket.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.189
“I’m not someone that—whatever it is
you're looking for, for whatever kind of criminal

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.469
you're looking for, it has nothing to do with
me, it's not me.”

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.800
They weren't hearing it.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.890
They didn't want to hear anything about it.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.289
They were in power; they were in control,
and let me know that.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.310
So going through it I was embarrassed, I felt
extremely vulnerable, because they had me

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.370
cuffed and I didn't know what for, and I didn't
know what they were planning on doing.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.440
So, the blue wall of silence, from what I
understand it, is when any officer does something

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.470
wrong, inappropriate, the rest of the officers
are going to be silent.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.889
They're not going to mention it, they're not
going to go against him and turn them into

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:31.130
internal affairs or turn them into anyone
else, they're going to stick with him and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.970
that's almost like a fraternity, a brotherhood.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.950
And it's something that is hopefully outdated
and was prevalent supposedly back in the '70s,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.950
'80s, '90s.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.780
A lot of the officers I speak to now say that
it's a thing of the past, that it's not happening,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.500
but in my case it seems like it happened,
because there are five officers that all witnessed

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.090
what happened, or four that witnessed what
happened, one was that was the instigator,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.620
and none of them filed a report.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.650
Any of them could have filed a report and
said, “This is what happened on this day,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.620
this was inappropriate,” but none of them
did.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.550
So the first time the NYPD made a statement
it was that they were investigating whether

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.130
excessive force was used, and that I wasn't
even in handcuffs, and the whole encounter

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.950
took less than just a couple of minutes.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.200
And when I saw that and couldn't believe that
that was the story they were going to go with,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.949
I didn't even know at that time that there
was a videotape.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.820
There was surveillance footage that showed
what actually happened, and it was just infuriating

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.820
to see that because I knew that if there wasn't
that video they could get away with that,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.190
they could say that and they could have four
or five officers say the same thing “No,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.360
nothing happened,” and move on, and I was
very much afraid that that was going to be

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360
the case.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.720
Even as much as I feel like I'm credible—I
have no reason to lie or to make up a story—I

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.510
feel like the general public would listen
to five cops that are on the scene that would

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.400
say one thing even if it's contradictory to
what I say actually happened.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.720
After I got back from the US Open is when
I realized that there was a video, and as

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.479
soon as I spoke to the head of security at
the Grand Hyatt he said, "Well, I saw that

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.290
too and we have the timestamp on here, and
it was for 15 minutes so we know how long

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.340
you were in cuffs for, we have them leading
you away in cuffs, we have all of that."

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.280
So I was very thankful to him for helping
me and for making sure that tape stayed safe,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.870
because I think that's what helped the truth
get out and helped people realize that I wasn't

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.060
just making this up or that what they initially
said was far from the truth.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.940
And I don't blame the ones that are the higher-ups,
the powers that be because they may have heard

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.460
that story from the officers that were on
the scene, and you would expect them to believe

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.490
them to tell the truth.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.280
And without that video there was no way for
them to know that, so they had no reason to

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.520
not believe them.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.720
I just think it's sad that that would be how
those police officers that saw it on the scene

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.840
would then report that to their superior officers.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.030
It was something where I wanted to make sure
that the police officers that aren't doing

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.480
the job the right way don't take away from
the police officers that are doing the job

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.610
the right way, and the ones that are so-called
bad apples are held accountable.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.610
And that's when I decided I wanted to make
that something I was going to write about,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.760
something I was going to talk about and speak
on, the fact that it just can't keep happening.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.230
Police departments in these cases, in my opinion,
would be better off with transparency, with

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.430
letting a lot of people know, letting the
public know exactly what happened and finding

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.920
out from the rest of the officers what really
happened.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.030
And I think so many officers I've spoken to
since that time really feel like that whole

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.190
blue wall of silence is not a real thing,
that they're not all sticking up for each

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.130
other, but it seems in this case they did.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.070
And if that is just maybe optimism from other
police officers and police departments, I

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.270
hope that it's going in that direction, that
there will stop being the whole “blue wall

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.840
of silence” that they won’t just stick
up for each other no matter what's right or

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.160
wrong as opposed to just sticking up for what
is right for what actually happened for the

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.790
truth.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.620
And as far as police reform across the country—I
just hope for more transparency all across

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620
the country.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.510
And the accountability is what matters to
me, because I truly believe that the majority,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.200
over 95 percent of the police officers are
acting in an honorable dignified way and they

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.190
deserve to be called heroes, but the ones
that aren't are really eroding the trust.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.920
The ones that are doing the wrong things are
making it so that people like myself, anyone

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.660
that's been in any sort of encounter like
this may lose some of their trust for any

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.050
police officer, and that's not fair to the
ones that are doing the job the right way

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.430
that deserve our trust that we should look
to for support to keep us safe, to keep our

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.090
communities safe.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.170
And when the ones that aren't doing it that
way, the ones that are using the badge as

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.030
a shield to protect them as a way to continue
being a bully or anything else they're using

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.780
it for—those are the ones that should not
be protected by the unions, by any sort of

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.900
system that is going to just protect—“once
you get a badge you're protected”—I think

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.850
that shouldn't be the case, you need to be
accountable no matter what your job is.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.110
You're a human being and you need to be held
accountable for your actions, especially when

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.490
you're allowed to make life or death situations
with the people you interact with.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.340
And if someone is making a life or death situation
with my life I would like them to be trained

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.230
properly, I would like them to feel comfortable
in every situation, I would like them to not

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:46.580
feel scared in any situation, and I'd like
to know that they are doing so with honor

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.699
and with respect for my life and for the lives
of everyone in their community.
