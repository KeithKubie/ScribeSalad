what time is it ask that question to

someone on the street and you'll

someone on the street and you'll
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.999

answer but ask that same thing to a

because apparently the more you know
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.370

about what time actually is the harder

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
about what time actually is the harder
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800
about what time actually is the harder
it is to answer that question what time

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
it is to answer that question what time

the Sun now because our Sun is about 93

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
the Sun now because our Sun is about 93
 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.860

million miles away from us it might

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
million miles away from us it might
 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.509

so if the Sun were to explode right now

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490
so if the Sun were to explode right now
 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.800
so if the Sun were to explode right now
we wouldn't actually be able to see it

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
we wouldn't actually be able to see it
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.140
we wouldn't actually be able to see it
for another eight minute if you look

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
for another eight minute if you look
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.090
for another eight minute if you look
even further away player on nearest

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
even further away player on nearest
