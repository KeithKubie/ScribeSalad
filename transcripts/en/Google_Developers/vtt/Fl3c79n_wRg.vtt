TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.960
How's everybody doing?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.760
Hi.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.480
So thanks for coming
to this session.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.655
It is an introduction
to the +1 button.

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:15.985
If that's what you're here for,
you're in the right room.

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:19.570
If it's not what you're here
for, you're in the wrong room.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.720
These are some bits of
information that you might be

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.640
interested in.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.540
There's a hashtag for
this session,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.770
#publisher and #io2011.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.460
And there's also a link for
feedback about this session.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.730
I'd love to hear
what you think.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.070
And there's also a link for
where this session is going to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.050
live after today.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.280
All right.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.650
So this is what we're
going to talk about.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.570
We're going to talk about
the +1 button.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.690
And, specifically, up top is
what's now, which is the +1

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.580
button on search.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.470
Then we're going to talk about
the +1 button on your site.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.640
That's what's next.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.640
We going to go through getting
started, some advanced

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.765
options, and optimization.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.880
And, of course, at the
end, I will answer

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.660
some of your questions.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.240
Please note that the +1 button
on your site is not yet

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.310
launched and will not
be launching today.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.380
But I'm giving you a first peek
about what that'll look

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
like, and how you'll be able to
integrate it on your site.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.510
Sound good?

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.740
All right.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.240
Now, I'd also like to say that
integrating the +1 button on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.410
your site is super easy,
so this is going

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.880
to go pretty quick.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.690
This is me.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.500
I'm a Developer Advocate
at Google.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.130
And you can find me online.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.460
Also feel free to
at mention me.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.710
All right.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.890
So let's start with
what's now.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.050
I'm going to give a little bit
of background around the +1

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.040
button, and why we decided
to create it.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040
There are a couple different
sharing methods that we looked

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.490
at out there in the world.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.145
One of them is email.

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:43.940
I think we're all familiar
with email, right?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.490
It's an interesting
medium because it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.820
is super high value.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.900
When you write an email to
somebody, they receive that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.970
personal information from you
and that personal endorsement,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.640
but it's also really
high effort.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.150
It takes some time to write
names in that to field and

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.130
craft a message just
to those people.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.870
So there's another way to share,
activity streams. And

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.980
this is also really common.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.729
It's super easy to share to an
activity stream, very, very

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190
low effort.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.850
But, in general, for
endorsements,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.530
it's pretty low value.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.170
It's great for breaking news
or sharing funny videos.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
Things that aren't time
sensitive or time specific.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.520
But when I am looking for a
toaster oven, I may not have

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.550
seen this message because
perhaps Cami Crepe

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.660
wrote it a month ago.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.440
So when those things match up,
it's like magic, but it hardly

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.070
ever happens.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.560
So we've got this one method
that's low effort and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.960
relatively low value
for endorsements.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.950
And we've got this other method
that's really, really

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.420
high value, but also
high effort.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.640
How do we put the two together
so that we have something

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.655
that's low effort, but also
really high value?

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:52.650
And that, of course,
is the +1.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.880
So let's take a look at this.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.090
You can do this on your own.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.630
You can play the home
game by going to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.940
google.com/experimental and
opting it into the search

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.190
experiment.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.140
And you'll start to see +1
buttons on your search results

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.313
page right away.

00:03:05.313 --> 00:03:07.310
And this is what it
will look like.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.000
I did a quick search
for King day books.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.590
And I got this great article
by The Huffington Post on

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.640
books that I could read to
commemorate Martin Luther

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.940
King, Jr. Day.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.480
This is as you expect.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.050
It's a search engine results
page with links and snippets.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.210
And there's now a +1 button
just to the right.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.430
Wonder if I have a
laser pointer.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.120
Ooh, I do.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.350
They're fun.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.140
So that +1 button is
what you'd hit

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.365
to take the +1 action.

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:38.410
But there's this other new
thing, and this is the value.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.440
It's that annotation right
below the result.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.910
Say you're looking for the
same search results--

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.070
you're doing the same search.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.100
And you come upon this page, and
you see this annotation.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.430
Your good buddy Timothy
recommending

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.570
that article for you.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.620
Notice how it looks different
than every other

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.706
result on that page.

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:00.500
I got some numbers too.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.020
It turns out 90% of consumers
trust recommendations from

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.710
their friends.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.910
And 71% say friends and family
influence their purchase

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.530
decisions online.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.470
So we know that these
annotations are really

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.000
powerful, and they make your
results stand out.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.209
So it's super high
value, right?

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.750
It's also super low effort.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.855
It is one single button.

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.530
And it's just one click,
and you add your

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.696
recommendation to that link.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:29.950
And it looks like that.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.030
It just lights up,
and you're done.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.524
Pretty cool, huh?

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:34.774
Oops.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.180
It's also available
on paid results.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.740
So you'll see on the ad here, we
also got a +1 button and an

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.810
annotation under that.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.770
Now we think these annotations
are going to be great, that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.760
they may increase CTR, your
clickthrough rate, on both

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.320
paid and organic listings.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.560
And something publishers tell us
time and time again is that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.160
traffic from google.com is
typically more valuable.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.630
It spends more time on
their site, and it is

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.150
more likely to convert.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.200
And we think that that's going
to even increase with the +1

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.850
button as the user not only
comes from this unique place

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.135
on the internet, but also
with a recommendation.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.220
Cool.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.400
So that's the +1 button.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.230
Many of you may have
seen that already.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.320
Let's talk about what's next.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.930
+1 button on your site.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.986
So I followed that link, and
this is the page that I got.

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.270
It's The Huffington Post page,
but you'll notice there's

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.320
something new.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.920
Down there by all the sharing
links, you'll see a +1 button.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.890
It's off in the lower right.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.140
Yeah.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.500
Clicking this button is easy.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.830
It's just a button click.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.310
The count increments, and
you've added your

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.740
recommendation to this page.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.340
Now why would a button need to
be on the website as well?

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.010
Well it turns out we've gotten
a lot of feedback from people

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.160
after we introduced this search
experiment that they

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.890
might not know that they want
to add their endorsement to

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.890
something when they're in the
search engine results page.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.600
But when they go to your site,
and they see what it's all

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.640
about, then they're maybe
more likely to

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.096
click that +1 button.

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:19.240
And the great thing about this
is that on this search engine

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.200
results page you may have
clicked on an organic result,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.950
I may have clicked on a paid
result, and Rebecca may have

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.010
clicked on your site, and
it all goes to the same

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.260
annotation.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.000
So let's do some stuff,
shall we?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.360
It's a developer conference.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.660
How about we look
at some code?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.190
I'm afraid there's not
a lot to look at

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.620
because it's super simple.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.490
We've got two tags.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.020
We've got a script tag right
up there at the top, just

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.500
includes the script that's
going to replace the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.920
tags on your page.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.280
And we've got the +1 tag.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280
And it looks like this.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.930
Using all the default options,
we don't need to add any

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.330
attributes.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.950
And that tag will just
get replaced by the

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.000
script with a button.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.280
There's also going to be an
HTML5 equivalent to this tag

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.700
so that you'll be able to
validate your pages easier.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.510
This is what a basic
page looks like.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.880
Yeah, same script, but we've
added the surrounding tags

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.320
that are on the page.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.450
Of particular interest up at the
top is the rel canonical.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.160
Put this here for a
couple of reasons.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.640
First off, you're probably
already using rel canonical.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.390
Actually, I'm a little curious,
who is using rel

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.470
canonical in the audience?

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.060
All right.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.860
Who's not using rel canonical?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.250
That should be everybody else
raising their hands.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.570
Or maybe you're too
embarrassed to.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.770
You really should be using
real canonical because it

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.680
tells Google what the true URL
of your page is, which often

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.690
differs from the address
in the address bar.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.510
The address in the address
bar often has

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.115
state variables, right?

00:07:53.115 --> 00:07:55.440
You get that question mark,
state equals something or

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.225
other, that don't actually
represent the true URL, but

00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:00.080
are difficult to strip out.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.750
So you can tell Google what is
the true URL of this page by

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.750
specifying rel canonical.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.310
And you get to tell the +1
button what URL it should +1.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.910
And then, of course, here's
that script again.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.560
So let's take a look at this.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.920
I have a cool thing
to show you.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.510
I'm super excited about.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:28.420
This is a prototype of our +1
Button Configuration Tool.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.650
And when we launch, you'll be
able to go to this tool and

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.799
configure a +1 button
for yourself.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.010
This is how it works.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.760
See the +1 button?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480
Boom.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.929
Now it comes in a number of
different sizes, and you'll

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.860
see down here is the script.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.360
In my example, I included the
script and the tag together,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.290
but you probably want to put the
script somewhere else like

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.610
in your head or right before
the body closes.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.780
And it has the +1 tag.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.230
And you'll notice, even as I add
these options-- and I'll

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.720
go through these in some more
detail --even as I add these

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.080
options, the snippet stays
really, really simple.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.540
It can even do things like
pull away the count.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.600
And add the count back in.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.850
It's fun.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.950
So that's that.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.190
Let's get back, and let's dive
a little bit deeper into some

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.490
of those advanced options,
shall we?

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.810
First off, +1s are for URLs.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.740
And it's got to be
a public URL.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.190
Otherwise, it's not
going to work.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.660
+1s are a public action,
so they need to

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.130
operate on public URLs.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.560
And the URL is determined by
one of three things and in

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.440
this order.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.120
First, we're going to
look at the href

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.845
attribute of the +1 tag.

00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:47.440
If it's there, we're going
to +1 that URL.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.170
And you would use this attribute
if say, let's say

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.660
you're on a blog home page,
and you've got several

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.700
different articles.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.430
And you want to put a
+1 button by each

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.130
one of those articles.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.710
And that +1 button should +1
the URL of that article.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.220
You would specify that
URL in the href tag.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.270
The next thing that we look
for is rel canonical.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.120
I've already talked
about that.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.020
And then the third thing we
look for is the URL of the

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.670
page as you would see
in the address bar,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.306
document.location.href.

00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:26.200
And, of course, we much prefer
rel canonical over this

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.960
because, again, it might
not represent the

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.410
true URL of the page.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.330
And it would be sad to have some
of your users +1 their

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.980
particular URL, and other users
+1 their particular URL,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.920
and they look like
different +1s.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.140
So rel canonical is good.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.440
All right.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.680
I got a table because tables
are important.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.390
This is a table of +1 buttons.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.630
As you can see, we
have a number of

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.455
different form factors.

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:49.620
We've got small.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.215
We've got medium.

00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:51.030
We've got standard.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.210
And they all come with
or without a count.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.240
And we've got the tall button.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.990
And standard, of course, is a
really common size that fits

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.350
among other buttons of
similar sharing type.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.840
All right.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.350
Size and count are as
what you'd expect.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.545
They get to specify what the
size is, and whether or not it

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:11.690
has a count.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.220
And then we have two other
attributes here. href I've

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.140
already talked about.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.440
Callback I haven't.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.330
We're going to provide a
callback so that when the user

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.910
hits the +1 button, a function
in the global JavaScript

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.110
namespace on your page
can be called.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.720
And this could be
really great.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.803
Because perhaps you have
identity on your page, a user

00:11:30.803 --> 00:11:32.370
is already logged in.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.430
You can perhaps track their
+1s on your site to their

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.930
identity and maybe use that to
improve their experience.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.880
All right.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.342
Here are some parameters
for the script tag.

00:11:46.342 --> 00:11:47.600
And we've got two.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.650
First off is language.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.940
You'll be able to specify other

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.790
languages for the button.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.140
The second one is parse tags.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.430
Now this gets a little
bit more interesting.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.330
By default, it's onload.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.790
So all the tags will be parsed
at onload of the page.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.220
But you can also specify
explicit, which means you get

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.600
to specify when those
tags get parsed.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.230
And you can do that
one of two ways.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.900
The most common way you would
do this is with .go.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.950
And .go takes a single
parameter.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.200
That parameter is some
ID of a container.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.100
Now what you might use this for
is let's say you have a

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.150
really large page, but your +1
buttons are only maybe in the

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.010
article div.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.230
Then you can specify the article
div, and the script

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.790
will only scan through
that content.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.400
The script will have to
scan less content.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.290
And it will run faster.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.280
You might also do this if you
don't want the buttons loaded

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.380
onload, you want them maybe
a few seconds after.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.910
Maybe your page has some fancy
performance stuff that that

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.070
makes more sense.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.330
The second way you would use
this explicit parse tag is

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.160
through render.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.790
And you would do this
typically if you

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.650
had an Ajax-y page.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.530
Let's say the user switched the
content on the page, but

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.530
didn't reload a page
in their browser.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.050
And you needed to put a
new +1 button there.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.300
You could use the render method
that would then render

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.650
the +1 button in the specified
container with those specified

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.170
parameters.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.580
You don't need a +1 tag.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.690
So let's take a look at
a couple examples.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.290
This is the explicit load.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.630
And you'll see on here I've
highlighted both the script up

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.850
at the top, which includes
the +1 script.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.760
And down there we have the basic
+1 tag that specifies

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.180
where the button should go.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.930
And then below there, I just
added a script, and I hit .go.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.150
And this would work.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.850
Obviously, this is not
a perfect example.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.200
It's a basic example.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.590
You would probably want this .go
in an onload handler, and

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.985
you want to specify a subdiv.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.140
And here's another example.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.310
This is using render.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.770
Notice that the +1 tag
is not on the page.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.190
Instead, I have a div, called
the plusone-div there, down

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.440
third line from the bottom.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.450
And I have an onload specified
in the body tag.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.030
That function calls the
.render on that div.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.150
Default options, totally
works great.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.764
Does this all make sense?

00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:24.290
You guys are so easy.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.040
I don't know if that's because
it makes sense, or if you're

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.490
all using your new tablets.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.360
I hope it's because it
all makes sense.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.600
All right.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.360
Let's talk a little bit
about optimization.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.840
And this is all about improving
your traffic and

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.820
your engagement on the site.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.290
And to do that, you need to
be able to measure it and

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.330
experiment.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.540
And you got to try different
things to make it better.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.990
So we'd like to provide data to
you to be able to do that.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.520
Now I'm going to show you some
early product mocks.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.340
It'll probably look different.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.900
But this will give you an
indication of where we're

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.490
going with something inside of
Webmaster Tools that will give

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.960
you data on the +1 button.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.080
First off, we have activity.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.620
We'd like to be able to provide
to you a page that

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.320
shows how often your
content had been

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.230
+1'd and on what pages.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.110
Pretty straightforward
and cool-looking.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.360
Search impact.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.920
This is going to tell you the
difference in clickthrough

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.530
rate for annotated results and
non-annotated results.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.000
So you'll really be able to see
the power and value of the

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.250
+1 button on your site.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.280
We'd also like to provide
anonymized user data, such as

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.300
unique users and geo, where
in the world these

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.550
+1s are coming from.

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:52.520
All right.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.930
I have a summary slide.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.930
Told you it was quick.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.140
Social connections may very well
increase CTR on both paid

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.040
and organic search listings.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.950
When users see that annotation,
we think they may

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.630
be more likely to click that
result than any other.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.530
And research shows that
that's probably true.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.120
Search traffic is pre-qualified
through personal

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.000
recommendations.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.200
So remember, publishers tell
us traffic from google.com

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.000
often converts more than traffic
from other sources.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.645
Add in a recommendation from
my father to that, and I'm

00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:27.895
much more likely to convert.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.080
The +1 button on your site--

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.530
oops --the +1 button on your
site gives your users more

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.120
opportunity to click.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.300
And that +1 from an organic
result, from a paid result or

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:50.440
from your site all goes to the
same annotation on search.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.550
And, finally, integration is
straightforward and flexible.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.190
So what do you do next?

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.780
First thing you can do
is go to this form,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.640
google.com/webmasters/+1button,
and put down your name.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.319
And we'll send you an email as
soon as this is available.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.210
And you can also go ahead
and take a look at the

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.796
+1 button on search.

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:12.420
You can click a whole bunch of
stuff and see how fun it is--

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.925
google.com/experimental.

00:17:15.925 --> 00:17:17.200
All right.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.560
So it was quick, a little
quicker than I expected, but I

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.760
hope it was fun.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.260
The hashtags, feedback,
and session are there.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.819
We have microphones
there and there.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.040
And I would love to hear your
questions and perhaps feedback

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.700
on this product.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.900
AUDIENCE: Can you move
that slide back?

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.523
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's that?

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:31.613
AUDIENCE: That slide.

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:33.790
Could you move it back to the
one you had previously?

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, sure.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.090
And go.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.975
There we are.

00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:44.225
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:52.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, could
you use the microphone?

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.930
I am told today my biggest
audience is the internet.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.410
And that means that you
need to use the

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.700
microphone to ask a question.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.160
AUDIENCE: I see that it's
all done in JavaScript.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.120
It seems like that would be
pretty easy to hack where

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.980
somebody could write a little
script where every visit +1

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.960
the page, or they could write
a script that gives them a

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.170
million +1s or something
like that.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.120
What is Google doing
to prevent that?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: A lot.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.530
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I mean,
yeah, it's a concern.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.080
Abuse with any new feature
is a concern.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.690
And it's something that we're
taking seriously.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.480
And we are engineering
solutions for.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.200
What those specific solutions
are, I'm going to keep to

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.800
those engineers.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.470
AUDIENCE: And then the second
one was, it said names of

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.830
people that had +1'd that.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.960
Those are just people that are
in your gmail group or

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.770
something like that?

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.940
So the people that appear on
annotations for you are folks

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.280
that are in your contacts, your
Google contacts, which

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.080
could be your gmail contacts,
any connected sites you've

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.680
connected to your profile, and
any publicly-available social

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.410
graph data that we can correlate
with your identity.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.950
AUDIENCE: And the last question
is, would there be an

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.130
opportunity to put a +1 external
to your site, say in

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.190
your emails or on another
related page or

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.380
something where it--

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.600
I could see someone can +1 right
out of the Google search

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.550
results or off your page, but
would there be a way to +1 say

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:21.275
off of emails you send
or related pages?

00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:22.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's an
interesting question.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.770
I'm not sure what we're doing
about cross-domain +1s, which

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.720
I think sort of addresses
that question.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.530
I don't have an answer for you
on that, but I'm sure we'll

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.590
have an answer soon.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.190
The interesting thing about
email though is because email

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.705
typically, even HTML emails,
don't allow JavaScript.

00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:41.420
So even if you could put the +1
in an HTML email, most user

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.630
agents aren't going to be able
to render that button.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.700
But I think it is an interesting
use case to have

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.250
that +1 button on a variety
of different sources.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:48.420
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.590
Thank you.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.710
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.230
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.090
One quick question.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.205
Does the API allow the site to
read the count information?

00:20:00.205 --> 00:20:01.560
Or is that something
you frame?

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That is
a very good question.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.910
At launch, we are going to have
a button that will have

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.180
the count in there.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.663
We may add that feature
in the future.

00:20:12.663 --> 00:20:15.600
AUDIENCE: But is the information
framed or can my

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.481
site also read-- if I have
access to the DOM, can I read

00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:19.250
the account?

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.640
Or are you guys creating your
own iframe and generating the

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.245
count and the button
in a frame?

00:20:25.245 --> 00:20:27.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I suspect since
the count is in the

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.900
button, and it's in an
iframe that you could

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.130
do something fancy.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.120
But I think it would be more
interesting if that was

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.080
something that you really wanted
to let us know on the

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.970
Webmaster Forum, and perhaps
we could engineer a more

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.840
convenient way for
you to do that.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.175
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:41.175 --> 00:20:43.650
More social plug-ins and things
like this coming out

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.200
afterwards for people
that want to have--

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.815
be able to surface content that
I've been the most +1'd

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.500
and things like this?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I would
definitely be interested in

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.920
hearing more about specifically
those kind of

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.190
widgets that you would want.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.930
And perhaps.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.490
Yeah, that could be cool.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.160
Thanks.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And let's
go over here.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.450
Yeah.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.550
I won't forget about that
side of the room.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.640
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.320
Actually, my question is
more related to search.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.950
It looks like you guys have it
set up as kind of a social

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.560
construct right now.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.830
Do you have any plans to
integrate it with the

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.860
algorithm as far as the
actual ranking of

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.545
the sites is concerned?

00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:18.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.761
So +1s may be a signal that
we use in ranking.

00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:24.430
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And it would
be among over 250 other

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.820
signals that we use
in ranking.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.870
AUDIENCE: I think
that covers it.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm going to go
back to this just in case

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.930
you need to live tweet
any of this.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.710
Yes.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.285
Let's take another one
over there, and

00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:39.560
we'll come back here.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.710
How does the +1 sign operate
when the user

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.245
hasn't logged in?

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:51.710
What does it do when there's
no Google account?

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.210
So a user does need a
Google account and a

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.950
public profile for +1s.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.660
It's a public action, so they
need to be able to have their

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.730
name publicly available.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.610
And if the user is not signed
in, it'll ask them to sign in.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:03.815
AUDIENCE: Okay.

00:22:03.815 --> 00:22:04.735
Thanks.

00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:05.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.860
Yeah.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.350
It's a very simple sign-in flow,
and a simple onboarding

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.285
flow as well.

00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:12.950
AUDIENCE: So using your +1,
you care about different

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.660
people's influences you said.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.866
You care a lot more for your
dad if he has his +1--

00:22:17.866 --> 00:22:21.800
he gave you a +1 versus one of
your contacts that's way--

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.040
you don't really
talk to a lot.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.910
Is there any way to prioritize
which people are given +1s?

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.440
Like if you have five people you
really care about that if

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.510
they've given a +1, it's
more influential?

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.820
Can you pick and have
them added?

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.470
Like, I want these five people
always if they've given a +1

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.310
to show up.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great point.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.210
And I think it's something
that we've thought about.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.860
And obviously, we'd want to show
annotations that matter

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.680
the most to the user, right?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.530
And there's sort of two
things in there.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.270
One is that we're not going to
show annotations for every

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.530
result on the page, right?

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.940
So we're only going to show
them for the results that

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.340
should matter to the user.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.440
And, hopefully, the personal
invitations, we get that so

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.260
that that's the contact that
matters the most to the user.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.385
And we'll use the data that
we have available

00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:03.635
to try and do that.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.860
So you want to go to
the microphone?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.340
I would love to hear
your question.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.290
OK.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.040
Yes.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.420
AUDIENCE: When do we get it?

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's that?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.650
AUDIENCE: When?

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: When
do you get it?

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.430
I was waiting for
that question.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.370
In a matter of weeks.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.630
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.013
And you shared on The Huffington
Post site, did you

00:23:25.013 --> 00:23:26.990
just mock that up, or they
actually tested it?

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
mocked that up.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.170
I took that into Photoshop, and
I did fun things with it.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.920
Do you like it?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.990
AUDIENCE: I like it
better on my site.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Feel
free to tell them.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.210
Oh, I see.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.640
AUDIENCE: You mentioned callback
functionality and

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.310
that sort of thing.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.030
With social connections, are
we, as developers, going to

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.590
have any sort of access to that
on our site to show if

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.980
you're on a page, hey, your
dad liked this story.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.520
Or even broader to have an
actual page to say here's what

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.125
your friends liked on my site,
that sort of thing.

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:02.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So at launch
what you'll see is the

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.630
aggregate annotation,
which is the count.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.020
Right?

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.070
And we think that's powerful
for users.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.010
If there are other things that
you'd like to see, like, if

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.465
you'd like to see personal
annotations on your site, then

00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:13.330
we'd definitely like
to hear that.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.740
So Webmaster Tools Forum
would be a great

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.050
place to mention that.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.540
But, of course, I'll
remember as well.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.585
Thank you.

00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:20.860
Yes.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.860
AUDIENCE: So hey, this looks a
little similar to the Like

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.940
button on Facebook.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.670
So I'm just curious, what
are the pros and cons?

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.580
How does it compare
in your view?

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:29.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.290
That's a good question.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.440
How is the +1 different
than the Like button

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.520
that Facebook has?

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.600
And I can't speak
for Facebook.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.340
But I can speak for my personal
view of this.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:40.720
Yeah.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.170
And I think when I use the Like
button on the web, I like

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.810
things that I want to be
part of my identity.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.290
Right?

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.240
Because, typically, that shows
up on my Facebook profile.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.390
And I love that.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:56.090
When I +1 something, I get to
+1 anything that I like that

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.350
I'm publicly OK with saying,
this is cool.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.120
But it doesn't have to
be part of who I am.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.370
So that's how I would categorize
the difference in

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.794
my use case.

00:25:06.794 --> 00:25:07.706
Yes.

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.690
AUDIENCE: So what are you doing
to differentiate this

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.120
from say the Buzz launch?

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160
Because I can see a
public reaction to

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.210
the names that appear.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.700
It seems a little similar.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.040
And I'm just wondering what
your sort of PR stance is

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.050
going to be, et cetera.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I can't speak
to the Buzz launch.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.510
But what I can say about the
names that I think might

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.456
interest you is that when we
onboard the user, we're going

00:25:31.456 --> 00:25:33.880
to indicate to them clearly
that their +1s

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.490
are a public action.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.190
So when you +1 something,
the whole world gets

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.670
to know about it.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.130
Don't +1 something that you
don't want the world to know.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.740
And as long as you empowered
by that, there's less of a

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.740
concern hopefully.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.760
Also, the understanding that
when they see annotations in

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.150
search, they're seeing
annotations from people on

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.030
their contacts.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.810
So it'll be another indication
to the user that this is a

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.295
public action.

00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:02.240
AUDIENCE: And you said this is
different than logging in.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.980
So you have to have a
public page then?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you need to
have a public profile, a

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.525
public Google profile.

00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:11.940
And if you don't want to have a
public Google profile, then

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.490
you don't have to
use the button.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.160
But if you want to use the
button, then you agree to have

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.440
a public profile and have
your name publicly

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.315
associated with those +1s.

00:26:21.315 --> 00:26:24.940
AUDIENCE: And have you gotten
any sense of what the opt-in

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.550
rate will be for users?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hopefully,
fantastic.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.420
Yes.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.476
AUDIENCE: Well, how
do you un-+1?

00:26:35.476 --> 00:26:38.190
Let's say, you +1 on something
and you thought, oh, no, I

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.360
don't really want to do that?

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I was waiting
for that question too.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.190
There's all these ones
that I'm waiting for.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.590
So when you +1, you
hit the button.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.710
When you un-+1, you
hit the button.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.026
Isn't that great.

00:26:52.026 --> 00:26:53.276
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.690
So then you have to
hit the +1 twice?

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh no.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.520
So when you hit the
button, it +1's.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.695
If you hit it again,
it'll undo that +1.

00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:06.940
DAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.530
So when you hit the button,
it'll turn blue.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.110
And when you hit it again to
un-+1, it'll go back to its

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.780
rest state where you see it.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.070
Thank you, Dan.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.130
Yes.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.572
AUDIENCE: Why do you have to
have a public profile and will

00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:22.180
your +1s show up on your
public profile?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So since it's
a public action, and you're

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.680
associating your public name
with the +1 button, you need

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.020
to have that name be public.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.300
You don't have to have
this public profile.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.340
You don't have to have
the profile.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.260
But if you want to +1s, your
name needs to be public.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.290
It's the whole value.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.700
As far as on your profile, you
can opt in to have a tab on

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.350
your profile of all your +1s.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.990
And you can actually take a
look at how this is today.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.120
If you go to
google.com/experimental, and

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.760
you sign into the search
experiment.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.120
And you can go to your
profile, and you can

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.385
opt into that tap.

00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:57.870
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.820
And was the thought of your
having to have a public

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.215
profile just one more signal
that when you +1, you're doing

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:04.890
something publicly?

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.500
Or is there more to
it than that?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, part of
having a public profile is

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.705
having a public name.

00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:12.600
And part of doing a public +1
is having a public name.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.500
So they all require
each other.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.130
Yes.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.460
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to add a -1 button?

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: None
that I know of.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.230
Thank you.

00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:30.250
AUDIENCE: Since it'll take time
for the +1 button to roll

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.140
out across several web pages,
are there any plans to

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.325
directly integrate the +1 button
with the Chrome browser

00:28:36.325 --> 00:28:39.290
instead of the web
page itself?

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a really cool idea.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.240
I will take that back.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.760
So give me your idea, just a
little bit more detail, you'd

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.310
like the +1 button where?

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.270
AUDIENCE: Right, like
as an extension

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.340
on the Chrome browser.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.090
So that if you go to a site that
isn't regularly updated

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.610
or doesn't have a lot of social
networking widgets

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:59.930
already built in, you could +1
it without the web author

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.250
having previously coded it.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I
don't have anything

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.670
to say about that.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.980
But I think it's a cool idea.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is that it?

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.610
Those are all the questions?

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.800
I feel so successful.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.010
All right.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.440
Well, thank you all so
much for coming in.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.750
If you'd like to ask a question
of me privately after

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.730
the session, I'll be hanging
out for a few minutes,

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.460
probably at least 30 of them.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.060
Thank you so much.
