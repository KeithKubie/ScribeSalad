00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Instructor] We're
told Kenzie makes quilts

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.079
with some blue squares
and some green squares.

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:09.713
The ratio of blue squares
to green squares is shown

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:11.299
in the diagram.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.684
The table shows the number of
blue squares and the number

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:17.830
of green squares that Kenzie
will make on two of her quilts.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.912
All right, this is the
table they're talking about.

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:22.534
Based on the ratio,
complete the missing values

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.056
in the table.

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.468
So why don't you pause this video and see

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:27.517
if you can figure it out.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:28.575
Well, first, let's think

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.082
about the ratio of blue to green squares.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:33.691
So for every three blue squares

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.435
or that seem a similar color,
for every three blue squares,

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:40.367
we are going to have
one, two, three, four,

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:42.353
five green squares.

00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:46.750
So the ratio of blue to
green is three to five,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.333
and so in quilt A, she
has 21 blue squares.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.931
So she has 21 blue squares.

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.825
How many green squares would she have?

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.028
Well, to go from three to 21,

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.359
you have to multiply by seven,

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.526
and so you would take five and
then multiply that by seven.

00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:09.843
So you'd multiply five
times seven to get to 35.

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:12.542
As long as you multiply both
of these by the same number

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:13.914
or divide them by the same number,

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:16.006
you're going to get an equivalent ratio.

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:20.391
So 21 to 35 is the same
thing as three to five.

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:22.148
Now we have a situation in quilt B.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.330
They've given us the number of
green squares, so that's 20.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.233
Well, how do we get 20 from five?

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.042
Well, we would multiply by four.

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:32.685
So if you multiply the number
of green squares by four,

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:34.035
then you would do the same thing

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:35.364
for the number of blue squares.

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:37.611
Three times four...

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.910
Three times four is
going to be equal to 12.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.319
12 blue squares for every 20
green squares is the same ratio

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.559
as three blue squares for
every five green squares.

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:50.642
Let's do another example.

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:55.482
Here, we are told the following
diagram describes the number

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.142
of cups of blue and
red paint in a mixture.

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:02.781
What is the ratio of blue paint
to red paint in the mixture?

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:04.435
So try to work it out.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:05.674
All right, so let's just see.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:08.978
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:11.052
eight, nine, 10...

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.158
10 cups of blue paint

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:17.075
for every one, two, three,
four, five, six cups

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:20.793
of red paint.

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:24.138
So this would be a legitimate
ratio, a ratio of 10 cups

00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:27.324
of blue paint for every
six cups of red paint,

00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:30.166
but this isn't in I guess
you could say lowest terms

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.171
or most simplified terms

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.680
because we can actually divide
both of these numbers by two,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.327
so if you divide 10 by two, you get five.

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.399
I'll do that in blue color,

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.722
and if you divide six
by two, you get three.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:49.843
So one way to think about it
is for every five blue squares,

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:53.029
you have three red
squares in this diagram,

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.845
in this tape diagram
that's sometimes called,

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:58.878
or you could say for every
five cups of blue paint,

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.840
you have three cups of
red paint in our mixture,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.331
and you could even see that here.

00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:05.877
So three cups of red paint

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:08.641
and one, two, three, four, five...

00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:11.601
And five cups of blue paint,

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:15.574
and you see that again right over here.

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:18.423
Let's do another example.

00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:22.356
Here, we're told Luna and
Ginny each cast magic spells.

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:24.559
The ratio of spells Luna casts

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.665
to spells Ginny casts is
represented in this tape diagram.

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:31.154
All right, based on the
ratio, what is the number

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:35.431
of spells Ginny casts
when Luna casts 20 spells?

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.531
Pause this video to see
if you can work it out.

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.888
All right, so let's
just see the ratio here.

00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:44.055
For every one, two, three,
four spells that Luna casts,

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:50.673
Ginny casts one, two,
three, four, five spells.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.358
So the ratio is four to five,

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:57.407
but if Luna casts 20 spells...

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:01.852
So if a Luna casts 20 spells,
well to go from four to 20,

00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:04.614
we had to multiply by five,

00:04:04.614 --> 00:04:06.740
and so we would do the
same thing with the number

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.652
of spells Ginny casts.

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:12.335
You'd multiply that by five, so it's 25.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.966
So four Luna spells

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:16.319
for every five Ginny
spells is the same thing

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.270
as 20 Luna spells for
every 25 Ginny spells,

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.067
and so how many spells does Ginny cast

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:26.016
when Luna casts 20 spells?

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.433
She casts 25, and we're done.
