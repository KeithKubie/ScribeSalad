00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
And here is my solution.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.000
Analogous to the closed table, I make an expand table

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.940
of exactly the same size but initialized it with -1.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.680
I introduced a counter in the procedure that counts the expansion.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.180
And then finally, there's a simple statement over here which implements all I need.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:26.190
When I expand a note - the else statement - I set the expand index of the expanding note

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.330
to count, and I add 1 to the counter.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.530
This constructs the table the way I want it.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.500
When later on at the very end, I print out this table

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.570
using this command over here, I get the table down here.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.040
So your implementation should show something just like this.
