00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.149
Here's a neat little party trick, you can
do with 4 matches, that will impress your

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.229
friends, or scam them out of some money.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.479
For this party trick you're gonna need
4 wooden matches, and a friend with a little

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180
pocket change. (Rhys has $20 bill)

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.980
Start with the money on the table, and get
your matches ready. If you're using something

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.259
like these "strike on box matches", they should have a little cardboard retainer inside.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.110
Set that on the table in front of you, and push one of the matches, into the hole on the end,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.149
so that it stands up on its own. If you don't
have a cardboard strip, that's ok. Try using

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.719
the cover of the box instead. Now place the
money in front of the match, so that it butts

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.079
right up next to the bottom, then get two
more matches ready. These ones, will need

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.079
to be placed, so that the bottoms of the sticks
stand on top of the money, while the match

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.960
heads rest together at the top, forming a
very loose pyramid. Now challenge one of your

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.550
friends to remove the bill, without knocking
any of the matches over. Even the slightest

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.839
movement will make them fall, and your friends
should soon realize they can't do it, and

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.330
some might even think it's impossible. To
win the challenge, simply light the fourth

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.140
match, and hold the flame underneath the front
two, about half way down. When they both light

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.860
off, you can simply stand back, and wait for
the magic. As the flames travel down the match

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.320
sticks, you'll notice they slowly begin to
move, then suddenly levitate upward. When

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.509
both matches have lifted off, gently blow
out the flame to freeze them in place, and

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.100
simply reach in and remove the cash. You're
the winner of the trick, and if you decide

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.399
to give their money back, they'll probably
be twice as impressed. Well there's a little

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.969
party trick that will entertain your friends,
and could make you a little money doing it.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.609

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.800

learn the rules, you can have the money.
