they come out and how do they change
just briefly yeah sure so when you are

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349
just briefly yeah sure so when you are
 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.050
just briefly yeah sure so when you are
injecting your frack fluid and that may

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060
injecting your frack fluid and that may
 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.010
injecting your frack fluid and that may
be a freshwater source that's being used

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020
be a freshwater source that's being used
 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.740
be a freshwater source that's being used
to suspend the profit and the chemicals

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750
to suspend the profit and the chemicals
 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.790
to suspend the profit and the chemicals
that are used in the hydraulic

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800
that are used in the hydraulic
 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.459
that are used in the hydraulic
fracturing operation or some of that

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:20.469
fracturing operation or some of that
 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:22.679
fracturing operation or some of that
water may actually be recycled so we'll

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689
water may actually be recycled so we'll
 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.779
water may actually be recycled so we'll
come back to that in just a second

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:24.789
come back to that in just a second
 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.209
come back to that in just a second
you also have formation water or water

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219
you also have formation water or water
 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.850
you also have formation water or water
that is present in the shale itself and

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860
that is present in the shale itself and
 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.159
that is present in the shale itself and
so after the fracturing operation

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169
so after the fracturing operation
 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.490
so after the fracturing operation
actually happens you get flowback water

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500
actually happens you get flowback water
 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.019
actually happens you get flowback water
the composition of which looks something

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:37.029
the composition of which looks something
 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.909
the composition of which looks something
like the composition of the water that

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919
like the composition of the water that
 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.800

you put down the well in the first place

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810
you put down the well in the first place
 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.980
you put down the well in the first place
and then over time it evolved to look

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990
and then over time it evolved to look
 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.019
and then over time it evolved to look
much more like the water that's present

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:46.029
much more like the water that's present
 

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:48.779
much more like the water that's present
in the formation itself these shales

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:48.789
in the formation itself these shales
 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:53.249
in the formation itself these shales
have a number of different minerals that

have lots and lots of ions in sort of
 

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.119
have lots and lots of ions in sort of
trapped in that clay layer and that is

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:06.129
trapped in that clay layer and that is
 

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:08.339
trapped in that clay layer and that is
most likely the source of a lot of the

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:08.349
most likely the source of a lot of the
 

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:11.550
most likely the source of a lot of the

exciting frontiers do you see emerging

00:12:32.609 --> 00:12:32.619
exciting frontiers do you see emerging
 

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:34.769
exciting frontiers do you see emerging
from the science side of things yeah so

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:34.779
from the science side of things yeah so
 

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:36.449
from the science side of things yeah so
I think that the first frontier is

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:36.459
I think that the first frontier is
 

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:38.309
I think that the first frontier is
actually avoiding treatment altogether

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:38.319
actually avoiding treatment altogether
 

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:40.289
actually avoiding treatment altogether
or minimizing treatment treatment is

00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:40.299
or minimizing treatment treatment is
 

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:42.809
or minimizing treatment treatment is
very very costly it's also energy

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:42.819
very very costly it's also energy
 

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:44.340
very very costly it's also energy
intensive and it's hard to do and the

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.350
intensive and it's hard to do and the
 

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.439
intensive and it's hard to do and the
distributed scale that's relevant to

and then finally I think that there's a

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.010
and then finally I think that there's a
 

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.700
and then finally I think that there's a
lot of opportunity still yet to be

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:02.710
lot of opportunity still yet to be
 

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.040
lot of opportunity still yet to be
tapped in really understanding how to

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.050

from those brights eleve Veolia is an

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040
from those brights eleve Veolia is an
 

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.190
from those brights eleve Veolia is an
international company and now we're

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:23.200
international company and now we're
 

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.310
international company and now we're
talking specifically about some of the

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320
talking specifically about some of the
 

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.840
talking specifically about some of the
challenges and opportunities of dealing

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:27.850
challenges and opportunities of dealing
 

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.240
challenges and opportunities of dealing
with water in the energy sector in the

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.250
with water in the energy sector in the
 

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.430
with water in the energy sector in the
United States can you look at other

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440
United States can you look at other
 

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.560
United States can you look at other
countries as Veolia working elsewhere in

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.570
countries as Veolia working elsewhere in
 

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.910
countries as Veolia working elsewhere in
the world and are you seeing some

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920
the world and are you seeing some
 

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.210
the world and are you seeing some
interesting examples or lessons that can

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:39.220
interesting examples or lessons that can
 

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.370
interesting examples or lessons that can
be informing United States or are we

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.380
be informing United States or are we
 

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.990
be informing United States or are we
really on the forefront of dealing with

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000
really on the forefront of dealing with
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.480
really on the forefront of dealing with
some of these challenges yeah I mean

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:45.490
some of these challenges yeah I mean
 

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.250
some of these challenges yeah I mean
there is a lot of it depends the scope

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:47.260
there is a lot of it depends the scope
 

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.840
there is a lot of it depends the scope
you take I mean if you take shale gas

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:50.850
you take I mean if you take shale gas
 

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.370
you take I mean if you take shale gas
definitely I think here is at the front

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.380
definitely I think here is at the front
 

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.090
definitely I think here is at the front
of what's happening large to wet gas and

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.100
of what's happening large to wet gas and
 

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.420
of what's happening large to wet gas and
then you are not and then we have seen

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:00.430
then you are not and then we have seen
 

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.820
then you are not and then we have seen
we've seen projects in the world we have

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:02.830
we've seen projects in the world we have
 

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.100
we've seen projects in the world we have
seen very interesting projects they are

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.110
seen very interesting projects they are
 

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.320
seen very interesting projects they are
all very different the regulations are

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.330
all very different the regulations are
 

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.680
all very different the regulations are
different the but the funny thing is the

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:10.690
different the but the funny thing is the
 

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.680
different the but the funny thing is the
technologies base is similar but to make

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:13.690
technologies base is similar but to make
 

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.070
technologies base is similar but to make
the process resilient you know small

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:16.080
the process resilient you know small
 

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.860
the process resilient you know small
changes are very very

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.870
changes are very very
 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.530
changes are very very
important I think for me the keys so we

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:20.540
important I think for me the keys so we
 

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.519
important I think for me the keys so we
are in the world there is a lot

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:21.529
are in the world there is a lot
 

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:24.430
are in the world there is a lot
demanding yeah there is a lot of

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440
demanding yeah there is a lot of
 

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.320
demanding yeah there is a lot of
interesting projects worldwide we are

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.330
interesting projects worldwide we are
 

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.290
interesting projects worldwide we are
also working a lot in the power industry

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:29.300
also working a lot in the power industry
 

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.450
also working a lot in the power industry
in general you know power plants so we

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:31.460
in general you know power plants so we
 

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.480
in general you know power plants so we
could enlarge it a little bit but for

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:34.490
could enlarge it a little bit but for
 

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.050
could enlarge it a little bit but for
shale gas I mean here is is really yeah

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.060
shale gas I mean here is is really yeah
 

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.300
shale gas I mean here is is really yeah
ok you you bring up the the point that

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.310
ok you you bring up the the point that
 

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.329
ok you you bring up the the point that
water and energy are interconnected

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:43.339
water and energy are interconnected
 

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:44.920
water and energy are interconnected
through cross number of sectors not just

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.299
suddenly started to rain a lot as if
that's right it was as if they made a

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:01.309
that's right it was as if they made a
 

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:03.520
that's right it was as if they made a
big pile of money on the beach and it

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:03.530
big pile of money on the beach and it
 

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.830
big pile of money on the beach and it
set it on fire the rains came from the

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840
set it on fire the rains came from the
 

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.779
set it on fire the rains came from the
sky so that's a bad example

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:07.789
sky so that's a bad example
 

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:11.740
sky so that's a bad example
so but I think we really need to plan to

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:11.750
so but I think we really need to plan to
 

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.020
so but I think we really need to plan to
think I think also what's important

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.030
think I think also what's important
 

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.940

so what about the reuse I think we you

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679
so what about the reuse I think we you
 

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.370
so what about the reuse I think we you
should be definitely a big part of the

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:24.380
should be definitely a big part of the
 

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.490
should be definitely a big part of the
city thinking because reuse is cheaper

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:27.500
city thinking because reuse is cheaper
 

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.140
city thinking because reuse is cheaper
in terms of energy it has less you know

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:29.150
in terms of energy it has less you know
 

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.320
in terms of energy it has less you know
easier you know way cheaper so so I

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330
easier you know way cheaper so so I
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.680
easier you know way cheaper so so I
think some of our cities have not

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:35.690
think some of our cities have not
 

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.450
think some of our cities have not
planned enough in the u.s. we know that

change and the budget needed to really

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:51.230
change and the budget needed to really
 

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.020

don't think they like the old ways do we

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:56.990
don't think they like the old ways do we
 

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.310
don't think they like the old ways do we
need this mega centralized structures or

by conservation do you think
 

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:07.449
by conservation do you think
conservation is is is largely an answer

00:24:07.449 --> 00:24:07.459
conservation is is is largely an answer
 

00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:08.949
conservation is is is largely an answer
do you think they're there what's the

00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:08.959
do you think they're there what's the
 

00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:11.529
do you think they're there what's the
point of no-return with conservation

00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:11.539
point of no-return with conservation
 

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:13.689
point of no-return with conservation
yeah so I want to point out that there's

00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:13.699
yeah so I want to point out that there's
 

00:24:13.699 --> 00:24:15.189
yeah so I want to point out that there's
not just a carbon footprint but there's

00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:15.199
not just a carbon footprint but there's
 

00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:16.899
not just a carbon footprint but there's
also air mission externalities

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:16.909
also air mission externalities
 

00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:18.369
also air mission externalities
associated with this electricity

00:24:18.369 --> 00:24:18.379
associated with this electricity
 

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:20.199
associated with this electricity
consumption as well as chemical

00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:20.209
consumption as well as chemical
 

00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:22.239
consumption as well as chemical
consumption so we've done a lot of work

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:22.249
consumption so we've done a lot of work
 

00:24:22.249 --> 00:24:24.369
consumption so we've done a lot of work
to try to quantify that and in many

00:24:24.369 --> 00:24:24.379
to try to quantify that and in many
 

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.139
to try to quantify that and in many
cases we find that these air mission

00:24:26.139 --> 00:24:26.149
cases we find that these air mission
 

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:28.449
cases we find that these air mission
externalities are even larger than the

00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:28.459
externalities are even larger than the
 

00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:30.579
externalities are even larger than the
public health benefits of treating some

00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:30.589
public health benefits of treating some
 

00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:31.629
public health benefits of treating some
of these water sources

00:24:31.629 --> 00:24:31.639
of these water sources
 

00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:34.479
of these water sources
so really the smog is worse than the

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:34.489
so really the smog is worse than the
 

00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:36.579
so really the smog is worse than the
harmful smog is worse diffic

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:36.589
harmful smog is worse diffic
 

00:24:36.589 --> 00:24:39.959
harmful smog is worse diffic
applications and some specific required

00:24:39.959 --> 00:24:39.969
applications and some specific required
 

00:24:39.969 --> 00:24:42.579
applications and some specific required
best availment that's the best available

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:42.589
best availment that's the best available
 

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:44.829
best availment that's the best available
treatment technologies and there can be

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:44.839
treatment technologies and there can be
 

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:47.439
treatment technologies and there can be
some real trade-offs in the air emission

00:24:47.439 --> 00:24:47.449
some real trade-offs in the air emission
 

00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:49.119
some real trade-offs in the air emission
externalities associated with water

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:49.129

treatment especially if we're using very

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:51.499
treatment especially if we're using very
 

00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:53.499

energy intensive water treatment

00:24:53.499 --> 00:24:53.509

recompression and crystallization where

00:24:57.399 --> 00:24:57.409

00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:59.699
recompression and crystallization where
you're taking water and you're basically

00:24:59.699 --> 00:24:59.709
you're taking water and you're basically
 

00:24:59.709 --> 00:25:02.259
you're taking water and you're basically
evaporating all that water and making a

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:02.269
evaporating all that water and making a
 

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:05.289
evaporating all that water and making a
pure salt so we do need to think about

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:05.299
pure salt so we do need to think about
 

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:07.779
pure salt so we do need to think about
what those trade-offs are and I think

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:07.789
what those trade-offs are and I think
 

00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:09.459
what those trade-offs are and I think
that doing so in a quantitative manner

00:25:09.459 --> 00:25:09.469
that doing so in a quantitative manner
 

00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:12.729
that doing so in a quantitative manner
helps us to make wise decisions I also

00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:12.739
helps us to make wise decisions I also
 

00:25:12.739 --> 00:25:14.979
helps us to make wise decisions I also
think that much like in the energy

00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:14.989

apply for water utilities and if so are

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:27.619
apply for water utilities and if so are

apply for water utilities and if so are
there any clever solutions to solving

there any clever solutions to solving
 

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:33.070
there any clever solutions to solving
that problem so there's two models in

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080
that problem so there's two models in
 

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.840
that problem so there's two models in
what our utilities there is one where

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:34.850
what our utilities there is one where
 

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.729
what our utilities there is one where
the Ute doesn't own the assets so

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:36.739
the Ute doesn't own the assets so
 

00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:38.229
the Ute doesn't own the assets so
basically the utility is just an

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:38.239
basically the utility is just an
 

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:40.960
basically the utility is just an
operator of the asset that's typically

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:40.970
operator of the asset that's typically
 

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.940
operator of the asset that's typically
what we do in many many cases so in that

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:42.950
what we do in many many cases so in that
 

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.330
what we do in many many cases so in that
case the revenue I guess you will always

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:46.340
case the revenue I guess you will always
 

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.129
case the revenue I guess you will always
probably have a biased like you

00:26:48.129 --> 00:26:48.139
probably have a biased like you
 

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.739
probably have a biased like you
mentioned so yes we are but I think in

00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:50.749
mentioned so yes we are but I think in
 

00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:53.529
mentioned so yes we are but I think in
that case there is also an incentive

00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:53.539
that case there is also an incentive
 

00:26:53.539 --> 00:26:55.299
that case there is also an incentive
sometimes in different cities would

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:55.309
sometimes in different cities would
 

00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:57.399
sometimes in different cities would
incentivize consumption I think it's

00:26:57.399 --> 00:26:57.409
incentivize consumption I think it's
 

00:26:57.409 --> 00:27:01.060
incentivize consumption I think it's
very important to really look at at this

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.070
very important to really look at at this
 

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.119
very important to really look at at this
upstream reduction of usage and then the

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:04.129
upstream reduction of usage and then the
 

00:27:04.129 --> 00:27:06.249
upstream reduction of usage and then the
second second model is okay then we also

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:06.259
second second model is okay then we also
 

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:08.979
second second model is okay then we also
are a capital investor in the project so

00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:08.989
are a capital investor in the project so
 

00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:11.320
are a capital investor in the project so
but that's not what the companies like

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:11.330
but that's not what the companies like
 

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.509
but that's not what the companies like
ourselves would do but there is also

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:13.519
ourselves would do but there is also
 

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:16.330
ourselves would do but there is also
private utilities which also basically

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:16.340
private utilities which also basically
 

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.529
private utilities which also basically
put the money and only the assets and I

00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:20.539
put the money and only the assets and I
 

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.960
put the money and only the assets and I
guess but but you know what the utility

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:22.970
guess but but you know what the utility
 

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.269
guess but but you know what the utility
is I mean it's again a partnership with

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279
is I mean it's again a partnership with
 

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:30.609
is I mean it's again a partnership with
local cities with a region to define an

00:27:30.609 --> 00:27:30.619
local cities with a region to define an
 

00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:33.219
local cities with a region to define an
agenda at a certain scale and then you

00:27:33.219 --> 00:27:33.229
agenda at a certain scale and then you
 

00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:34.659
agenda at a certain scale and then you
push that agenda in and the water

00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:34.669
push that agenda in and the water
 

00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:36.909
push that agenda in and the water
utility is part of that agenda and then

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919
utility is part of that agenda and then
 

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:39.279
utility is part of that agenda and then
so conservation just becomes one of the

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:39.289
so conservation just becomes one of the
 

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:41.830
so conservation just becomes one of the
elements in water strategy yeah that is

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840
elements in water strategy yeah that is
 

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.080
elements in water strategy yeah that is
defined on a higher level and a basin

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.090
defined on a higher level and a basin
 

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.089
defined on a higher level and a basin
level maybe on a water basin level and

00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:46.099
level maybe on a water basin level and
 

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.639
level maybe on a water basin level and
then you basically abide by certain

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:48.649
then you basically abide by certain
 

00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:50.139
then you basically abide by certain
guidelines and you have certain

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:50.149
guidelines and you have certain
 

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:52.330
guidelines and you have certain
incentives to you know to minimize that

encourage audience members to send in
some questions we've already gotten some

00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039
some questions we've already gotten some
 

00:27:58.039 --> 00:27:59.379
some questions we've already gotten some
wonderful questions here and here's one

00:27:59.379 --> 00:27:59.389
wonderful questions here and here's one
 

00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:03.460
wonderful questions here and here's one
that I I like a lot the audience member

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:03.470
that I I like a lot the audience member
 

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.299
that I I like a lot the audience member
asks oh what about the use of

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:06.309
asks oh what about the use of
 

00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:08.889
asks oh what about the use of
desalination plants as a flexible load

00:28:08.889 --> 00:28:08.899
desalination plants as a flexible load
 

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:12.249
desalination plants as a flexible load
so how can water treatment be actually

00:28:12.249 --> 00:28:12.259
so how can water treatment be actually
 

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:14.109
so how can water treatment be actually
used collaboratively with energy

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:14.119
used collaboratively with energy
 

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:16.419
used collaboratively with energy
generation and energy supply Megan do

00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:16.429
generation and energy supply Megan do
 

00:28:16.429 --> 00:28:20.159
generation and energy supply Megan do
you have any thoughts on that

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:20.169
 

00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:22.950
graduate students to answer this

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960
graduate students to answer this
 

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.750
graduate students to answer this
question but he might have been the one

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760
question but he might have been the one
 

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.940
question but he might have been the one
asking the question in are now yes so so

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:29.950
asking the question in are now yes so so
 

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.120
asking the question in are now yes so so
I think that there are some trade-offs

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:32.130
I think that there are some trade-offs
 

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.470
I think that there are some trade-offs
these are typically pretty capital

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480
these are typically pretty capital
 

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.450
these are typically pretty capital
intensive treatment plants and so you

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:39.460
intensive treatment plants and so you
 

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.210
intensive treatment plants and so you
don't want to over build water treatment

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.220
don't want to over build water treatment
 

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.970
don't want to over build water treatment
capacity and if you are concerned about

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980
capacity and if you are concerned about
 

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.159
capacity and if you are concerned about
you know if you're gonna be operating a

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:50.169
you know if you're gonna be operating a
 

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:52.080
you know if you're gonna be operating a
capacity factor for your water treatment

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.090
capacity factor for your water treatment
 

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.210
capacity factor for your water treatment
facility that's only twenty percent but

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:54.220
facility that's only twenty percent but
 

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.029
facility that's only twenty percent but
you still need to supply your municipal

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039
you still need to supply your municipal
 

00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:00.299
you still need to supply your municipal
water you know your miscible water needs

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:00.309
water you know your miscible water needs
 

00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:02.399
water you know your miscible water needs
you're not going to upsize that plant by

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:02.409
you're not going to upsize that plant by
 

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:04.710
you're not going to upsize that plant by
five times so you need to think about

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720
five times so you need to think about
 

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.570
five times so you need to think about
what are the trade-offs and capital

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:06.580
what are the trade-offs and capital
 

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.210
what are the trade-offs and capital
costs and operational costs making this

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:09.220
costs and operational costs making this
 

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.669
costs and operational costs making this
a somewhat difficult play for a

00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679
a somewhat difficult play for a
 

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:14.310
a somewhat difficult play for a
desalination plant and we're doing some

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320
desalination plant and we're doing some
 

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.710
desalination plant and we're doing some
some work right now particularly in

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720
some work right now particularly in
 

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.860
some work right now particularly in
distribution systems to understand what

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:19.870
distribution systems to understand what
 

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.549
distribution systems to understand what
sort of capacity there is to shift the

00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559
sort of capacity there is to shift the
 

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:27.180
sort of capacity there is to shift the
load for pumping and what implications

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.190
load for pumping and what implications
 

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.269
load for pumping and what implications
that might have for water quality in the

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279
that might have for water quality in the
 

00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:32.879
that might have for water quality in the
distribution system as well and then I

00:29:32.879 --> 00:29:32.889
distribution system as well and then I
 

00:29:32.889 --> 00:29:36.990
distribution system as well and then I
think the other the other piece that is

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000
think the other the other piece that is
 

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.789
think the other the other piece that is
is really important to think about is

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799
is really important to think about is
 

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:41.340
is really important to think about is
smaller scale more distributed systems

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:41.350
smaller scale more distributed systems
 

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.250
smaller scale more distributed systems
and particularly that have intermittent

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:44.260
and particularly that have intermittent
 

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.799
and particularly that have intermittent
treatment needs and in those situations

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:46.809
treatment needs and in those situations
 

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:48.289
treatment needs and in those situations
I think that there's a lot more

00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299
I think that there's a lot more
 

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:52.200
I think that there's a lot more
potential for either load balancing or

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:52.210
potential for either load balancing or
 

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.159
potential for either load balancing or
use of intermittent renewable resources

00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:55.169
use of intermittent renewable resources
 

00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:58.649
use of intermittent renewable resources
to help power some of those water

00:29:58.649 --> 00:29:58.659
to help power some of those water
 

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:01.200
to help power some of those water

we believe that solar is going to play a
 

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:28.409
we believe that solar is going to play a
very important role in the future and

00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:28.419
very important role in the future and

plants are usually in Sun rich areas and
 

00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:40.419
plants are usually in Sun rich areas and
those are there's there's an array of

00:30:40.419 --> 00:30:40.429
those are there's there's an array of
 

00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:42.849
those are there's there's an array of
things and with automation the ability

00:30:42.849 --> 00:30:42.859
things and with automation the ability
 

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:45.190
things and with automation the ability
to optimize and balance things it's a

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200
to optimize and balance things it's a
 

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.019
to optimize and balance things it's a
whole new frontier so there's a lot of

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:47.029
whole new frontier so there's a lot of
 

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:49.869
whole new frontier so there's a lot of
opportunities but as I said recycling

00:30:49.869 --> 00:30:49.879
opportunities but as I said recycling
 

00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:52.299
opportunities but as I said recycling
water and desalination is really the

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:52.309
water and desalination is really the
 

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.879
water and desalination is really the
solution but desalination has tremendous

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:54.889
solution but desalination has tremendous
 

00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:57.940
solution but desalination has tremendous
scope for optimization they you know

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:57.950
scope for optimization they you know
 

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.149

Veolia do you also run power facilities

00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159
Veolia do you also run power facilities
 

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.070
Veolia do you also run power facilities
yeah we're not no power facilities we

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080
yeah we're not no power facilities we
 

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.989
yeah we're not no power facilities we
run power systems like cooling cooling

00:31:04.989 --> 00:31:04.999

have two interesting examples one from a

00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:09.379
have two interesting examples one from a
 

00:31:09.379 --> 00:31:11.830
have two interesting examples one from a
Swiss friend who tells me you know we

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840
Swiss friend who tells me you know we
 

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.960
Swiss friend who tells me you know we
have got you good you guys because what

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:13.970
have got you good you guys because what
 

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.369
have got you good you guys because what
they do very interesting you know that

00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:15.379
they do very interesting you know that
 

00:31:15.379 --> 00:31:17.229
they do very interesting you know that
the power plant you know has excess

00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:17.239
the power plant you know has excess
 

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:19.359
the power plant you know has excess
capacity at night depending how power is

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:19.369
capacity at night depending how power is
 

00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:21.310
capacity at night depending how power is
produced with nuclear you don't want to

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320
produced with nuclear you don't want to
 

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.320
produced with nuclear you don't want to
go up and down so what they have done is

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.330
go up and down so what they have done is
 

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.690
go up and down so what they have done is
fantastic they put the cheap power at

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:25.700
fantastic they put the cheap power at
 

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.269
fantastic they put the cheap power at
night you know what they do with it they

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279
night you know what they do with it they
 

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:31.450
night you know what they do with it they
pump water at night they bring water up

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.460
pump water at night they bring water up
 

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.879
pump water at night they bring water up
the Alps at night and then they resell

00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:33.889
the Alps at night and then they resell
 

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:35.680
the Alps at night and then they resell
the electricity when it's high and it's

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:35.690
the electricity when it's high and it's
 

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.899
the electricity when it's high and it's
hydroelectric power so this type of

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:37.909
hydroelectric power so this type of
 

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:39.639
hydroelectric power so this type of
thing is possible we also had a project

00:31:39.639 --> 00:31:39.649
thing is possible we also had a project
 

00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:41.159
thing is possible we also had a project
where we are looking at a power plant

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:41.169
where we are looking at a power plant
 

00:31:41.169 --> 00:31:44.200
where we are looking at a power plant
also having excess capacity at night and

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.210
also having excess capacity at night and
 

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.259
also having excess capacity at night and
then we costed a desalination plant to

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:47.269
then we costed a desalination plant to
 

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:49.239
then we costed a desalination plant to
do a storage because storage of energy

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:49.249
do a storage because storage of energy
 

00:31:49.249 --> 00:31:50.950
do a storage because storage of energy
is the big issue right energy story at

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960
is the big issue right energy story at
 

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.089
is the big issue right energy story at
the end of that is all about energy

00:31:52.089 --> 00:31:52.099
the end of that is all about energy
 

00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:55.450
the end of that is all about energy
storage so can you use water to store

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.460
storage so can you use water to store
 

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.049
storage so can you use water to store
energy and how do you do that so one way

00:31:59.049 --> 00:31:59.059
energy and how do you do that so one way
 

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:01.930
energy and how do you do that so one way
is the Swiss Way pump up but then we are

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:01.940
is the Swiss Way pump up but then we are
 

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.450
is the Swiss Way pump up but then we are
looking at this Allan 18 water during

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:04.460
looking at this Allan 18 water during
 

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.190
looking at this Allan 18 water during
night and then doing what is called

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200
night and then doing what is called
 

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.440
night and then doing what is called
aquifer storage and recovery so you take

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.450
aquifer storage and recovery so you take
 

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.999
aquifer storage and recovery so you take
this on United Water put it in the

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:10.009
this on United Water put it in the
 

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:11.979
this on United Water put it in the
aquifer and then you know your basic

00:32:11.979 --> 00:32:11.989
aquifer and then you know your basic
 

00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:13.599
aquifer and then you know your basic
that's energy that you have saved and

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:13.609
that's energy that you have saved and
 

00:32:13.609 --> 00:32:15.969
that's energy that you have saved and
then so the our project is not so many

00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:15.979
then so the our project is not so many
 

00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:17.919
then so the our project is not so many
but it's it's gonna happen more and more

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:17.929
but it's it's gonna happen more and more
 

00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:19.839
but it's it's gonna happen more and more
so wait a minute so you could you could

00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:19.849
so wait a minute so you could you could
 

00:32:19.849 --> 00:32:20.830
so wait a minute so you could you could
go to this how is it Mount Washington

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840
go to this how is it Mount Washington
 

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.409
go to this how is it Mount Washington
here you could potentially put a tank at

00:32:23.409 --> 00:32:23.419
here you could potentially put a tank at
 

00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:25.509
here you could potentially put a tank at
the top of the hill and and pump water

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519
the top of the hill and and pump water
 

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.489
the top of the hill and and pump water
up from the river in the middle of the

00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:27.499
up from the river in the middle of the
 

00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:29.379
up from the river in the middle of the
night and then so these times I suppose

00:32:29.379 --> 00:32:29.389
night and then so these times I suppose
 

00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:31.210
night and then so these times I suppose
be small there he lies to be steep you

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:31.220
be small there he lies to be steep you
 

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.129
be small there he lies to be steep you
know there are some conditions but yeah

00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:33.139
know there are some conditions but yeah
 

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:34.899
know there are some conditions but yeah
you can they got some steep hills here I

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:34.909
you can they got some steep hills here I
 

00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:38.379
you can they got some steep hills here I
think so

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:38.389
think so
 

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:42.789
think so
turning now towards maybe closer issues

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799
turning now towards maybe closer issues
 

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.379
turning now towards maybe closer issues
city of Pittsburgh I'm familiar with

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:44.389
city of Pittsburgh I'm familiar with
 

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:45.970
city of Pittsburgh I'm familiar with
with their water system it was one of

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:45.980
with their water system it was one of
 

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.279
with their water system it was one of
the water systems that my company dealt

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:48.289
the water systems that my company dealt
 

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:51.190
the water systems that my company dealt
with and city of Pittsburgh has had a

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200
with and city of Pittsburgh has had a
 

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.619
with and city of Pittsburgh has had a
range of challenges over the years with

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:53.629
range of challenges over the years with
 

00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:56.710
range of challenges over the years with
with treating and preventing water one

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720
with treating and preventing water one
 

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.190

what have what have we learned both from

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:12.649
what have what have we learned both from
 

00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:15.460
what have what have we learned both from
the specific challenges with managing

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:15.470
the specific challenges with managing
 

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.560
the specific challenges with managing
Pittsburgh systems and what do we learn

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:17.570
Pittsburgh systems and what do we learn
 

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.009
Pittsburgh systems and what do we learn
in general about older municipal water

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:21.019
in general about older municipal water
 

00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:24.129
in general about older municipal water
distribution systems so I am in a global

00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:24.139
distribution systems so I am in a global
 

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:26.799
distribution systems so I am in a global
industrial division so I have to admit I

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:26.809
industrial division so I have to admit I
 

00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:30.190
industrial division so I have to admit I
know very little about the specific here

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200
know very little about the specific here
 

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.639
know very little about the specific here
and I am NOT well-placed to talk about

00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:33.649
and I am NOT well-placed to talk about
 

00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:36.159
and I am NOT well-placed to talk about
it more on the complex industrial

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:36.169
it more on the complex industrial
 

00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:39.310
it more on the complex industrial
projects but I think what we learn all

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320
projects but I think what we learn all
 

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.279
projects but I think what we learn all
is water chemistry is very important and

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:42.289
is water chemistry is very important and
 

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:45.220
is water chemistry is very important and
so in utilities you know we need to pay

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:45.230
so in utilities you know we need to pay
 

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.810
so in utilities you know we need to pay
a lot of attention to that chemistry I

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:46.820
a lot of attention to that chemistry I
 

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.999
a lot of attention to that chemistry I
mean as the infrastructure you know is

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:49.009
mean as the infrastructure you know is
 

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:50.889
mean as the infrastructure you know is
aging we have concrete we have some

00:33:50.889 --> 00:33:50.899
aging we have concrete we have some
 

00:33:50.899 --> 00:33:54.129
aging we have concrete we have some
metals we have some and we had we had a

00:33:54.129 --> 00:33:54.139
metals we have some and we had we had a
 

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:56.169
metals we have some and we had we had a
chemistry that was optimized for that

00:33:56.169 --> 00:33:56.179
chemistry that was optimized for that
 

00:33:56.179 --> 00:33:57.850
chemistry that was optimized for that
anyway I'm talking in industries the

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:57.860
anyway I'm talking in industries the
 

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.129
anyway I'm talking in industries the
same corrosion is a big deal and so we

00:34:00.129 --> 00:34:00.139
same corrosion is a big deal and so we
 

00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:02.470
same corrosion is a big deal and so we
have to really pay attention to to that

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480
have to really pay attention to to that
 

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.240
have to really pay attention to to that
but again I cannot comment about because

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:04.250
but again I cannot comment about because
 

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.149
but again I cannot comment about because
I have I am NOT it's a different

I really am not sure well another area

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:13.730
I really am not sure well another area
 

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:18.129
I really am not sure well another area
that affected Pittsburgh was issues

oil and gas sector has sometimes been

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.410
oil and gas sector has sometimes been
 

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.350

criticized about their treatment of
 

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.060
criticized about their treatment of
water and some people suggested that

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.070

there really is no that that water and

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280
there really is no that that water and
 

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.230
there really is no that that water and
oil don't mix you know that there is no

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240

able to support full environmental
 

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.270
able to support full environmental
stewardship and and I think that

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280

producers typically want to meet
 

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.170
producers typically want to meet
environmental stewardship standards so I

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.180
environmental stewardship standards so I
 

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.260
environmental stewardship standards so I
think everything's there to do it I do

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:49.270
think everything's there to do it I do
 

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.240
think everything's there to do it I do
agree with Megan and that's what's going

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.250
agree with Megan and that's what's going
 

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:56.330
agree with Megan and that's what's going
on in the in most of the plays is that

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:56.340

people have been concerned about the
 

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.510
people have been concerned about the

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.370
think so
I mean I think that responsible

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:35.380

our drinking water so there's actually

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:46.450
our drinking water so there's actually
 

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.830
our drinking water so there's actually
some physical separation in some cases

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:49.840
some physical separation in some cases
 

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.600
some physical separation in some cases
looking ahead there's a lot of

those technologies are going to affect
 

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.350
those technologies are going to affect
how we design water infrastructure and

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:07.360
how we design water infrastructure and
 

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.690
how we design water infrastructure and
operate water treatment systems oh they

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:09.700
operate water treatment systems oh they
 

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.160
operate water treatment systems oh they
don't okay we can raise our hands a lot

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.170
don't okay we can raise our hands a lot
 

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.900
don't okay we can raise our hands a lot
have you seen some creative examples

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:15.910
have you seen some creative examples
 

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.730
have you seen some creative examples
already or any surprises that you've

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:17.740
already or any surprises that you've
 

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.830
already or any surprises that you've
seen in how those technologies can and

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:19.840
seen in how those technologies can and
 

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.370
seen in how those technologies can and
cannot affect water treatment yeah I am

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:23.380
cannot affect water treatment yeah I am
 

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.560
cannot affect water treatment yeah I am
making a presentation on that in Asia in

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:25.570
making a presentation on that in Asia in
 

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.420
making a presentation on that in Asia in
a couple of weeks I think definitely a

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:27.430
a couple of weeks I think definitely a
 

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.760
a couple of weeks I think definitely a
lot we will need sensors we are going to

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:29.770
lot we will need sensors we are going to
 

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.770
lot we will need sensors we are going to
need reliable sensors because data is

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:31.780
need reliable sensors because data is
 

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.230
need reliable sensors because data is
based on the EM information so we have

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240
based on the EM information so we have
 

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.180
based on the EM information so we have
some sensors but we need more sensors

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:36.190
some sensors but we need more sensors
 

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:42.420
some sensors but we need more sensors
reliable we have seen drones yeah there

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:42.430
reliable we have seen drones yeah there
 

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.760
reliable we have seen drones yeah there
will be a lot what is it gonna be the

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:44.770
will be a lot what is it gonna be the
 

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.770
will be a lot what is it gonna be the
industry is asking itself how is it

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:46.780
industry is asking itself how is it
 

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.710
industry is asking itself how is it
going to shape our industry in fact it's

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720
going to shape our industry in fact it's
 

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.330
going to shape our industry in fact it's
but there will be changes other

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:51.340
but there will be changes other
 

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.950
but there will be changes other
industries have been changed and the

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960
industries have been changed and the
 

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.720
industries have been changed and the
water industry will probably be also

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:54.730
water industry will probably be also
 

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.660
water industry will probably be also
changed by it so yeah Megan are you

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:57.670
changed by it so yeah Megan are you
 

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.700
changed by it so yeah Megan are you

intelligence and water yes so I think

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:04.360
intelligence and water yes so I think
 

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.930
intelligence and water yes so I think
that there's actually lots of

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:06.940
that there's actually lots of
 

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.310
that there's actually lots of

if you did want a pair of this with
intermittent energy sources and then I

00:39:52.769 --> 00:39:52.779
intermittent energy sources and then I
 

00:39:52.779 --> 00:39:54.979
intermittent energy sources and then I
think there's also applications in

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:54.989
think there's also applications in
 

00:39:54.989 --> 00:39:58.380
think there's also applications in
machine learning and and advanced
