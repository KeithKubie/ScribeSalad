00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.540
 The female lion lion is dissatisfied. She has recently added the election 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.410
 For the post of king using the first vote after the mark 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.570
 Even though its kingdom began as a sound democracy with many parties and candidates for the post of monarch 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 They quickly descended into a two-party system and the citizens ended up not liking any candidates but being restricted 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.040
 In this system because of the problem named spoiler effect 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.239
 But, one of the subjects of the Queen from a distant land claims and my father has a solution and he 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.160
 Alternative sound. what is the difference? 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.320
 Let's see that we will follow one of the voters on Election Day, the Red Squirrel. Under the two systems 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 There are five candidates to win the post of king of two major Gorilla parties 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050
 And three other candidates, the tortoise, the owl and the tiger. 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.220
 In the first system after the mark, the red squirrel gets a form that selects only one candidate 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.860
 The red squirrel loves the turtle candidate and even helped in his campaign but knows that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.780
 That his new neighbor the gray squirrel will vote for the gorilla 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.570
 And what about the rest of the animals? Red squirrel thinks to himself, who to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.690
 Will they vote? The debates on the animal news network were not presented 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.500
 The two big parties, the squirrel thinks it will be a close result of the gorilla 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.680
 Cheetah while his position of the gorilla stand neutral but he 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.220
 He fears the most fear of the cheetah, and that he can only choose one candidate 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.280
 He gives his only voice to the gorilla in the hope that the leopard will not be allowed to rule 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 This is called a strategic vote and is a necessity under the first system after the mark 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.590
 Now let's look at the alternative vote that the father of the red squirrel explains 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.450
 Rather than choosing only one candidate who can rank them from their preferred candidate 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.010
 For the least favored candidate enter the voting booth and get the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.049
 The form, but this time he chooses the turtle as his first choice, then choose the owl second and then 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.850
 The third gorilla is hates the leopard and the tiger evenly stops 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.530
 Fill in the form and place it in the box 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.460
 At this point the squirrel does not care what exactly will happen to him 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.390
 Other concerns go, but you dear citizen want to know how to count the votes 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.450
 Let's see: while the Turtle is popular at some 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.720
 Citizens receive only 5% of the vote and exit the race 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.140
 And because citizens ranked candidates by popularity we can know what would have happened 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.430
 If the tortoise did not enter the elections without the tortoise, voters would be like the red squirrel 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.060
 They chose the owl instead of the tortoise and thus moved their voices to it as if the tortoise did not enter 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 In the election originally. That is why he sometimes claims alternative sound 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 The instant replay round, because it has the ability to simulate a set of elections by being excluded 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.689
 The candidate is less popular after each tour without consuming time and cost 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.819
 Which would have resulted from a series of campaigns, one by one. 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.919
 The alternative sound method completes the exclusion of the less popular candidate until one of the candidates obtains 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.909
 A majority (more than 50%) or one candidate 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.540
 And because no one won a majority after the next candidate, the tiger, the tiger's voters were eliminated 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.209
 Choose the cheetah as the second choice and the cheetah will get the sounds of the tiger 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.930
 In the final round the gorillas are eliminated. Gorilla voters chose the owl as their second choice 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.559
 The owl will receive these votes and win the majority and crown a king 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.120
 The alternative sound system is better because it produces a better agreed winner 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.439
 Number of voters. In the case of alternative sound, some defects are important 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.430
 Be aware that all the flaws that it shares with the first mark after 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.169
 Both are subject to fraud by dividing electoral areas and are not proportional systems. They do not guarantee a winner 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.620
 In the manner of the French philosopher and sportsman Kondersie (which is something that math lovers hate but time can not explain here) 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.529
 Over time both regimes are heading towards two major parties 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.239
 However, the alternative sound has a major advantage lacking the first system after the mark 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.249
 And this feature makes it superior to the athlete on the first after the mark: the absence of spoiler effect 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.029
 Imagine elections by the two big parties, the gorilla and the leopard, and it seems to the leopard 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:19.349
 That the victory is inevitable by 55% to 45% and then shows the candidate of the third party is the tiger 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.430
 The tiger can convince 15% of the cheetah voters to support him and the result is as follows 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.829
 Under the first system after the tag wins Gorilla although the majority did not want 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.989
 To rule. Under the alternative sound and because all the voters of the tiger 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 They put the cheetah as their second choice, so the cheetah wins because a majority of citizens 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.559
 The animal kingdom prefers the rule of leopard rather than gorilla 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:42.939
 Using the alternative voice, citizens can support and grow small parties that agree with them without being concerned 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.669
 From helping someone they do not like to win. 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.839
 After understanding the differences between the two systems, the Queen declares that the alternative sound is 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:55.299
 The rule of the king's election, and everyone is happy ... not everyone is right. 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:02.299
 The two major parties can not afford to be self-sacrificing and must work hard in their next campaigns for votes 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.849
 This was an alternative voice explanation by me CGP Gray. 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.809
 Thank you very much for watching
