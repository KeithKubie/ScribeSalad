00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.800
Before moving on, I want to
address problem 180 again.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.660
Because we got it right in the
last video, but then as soon

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.260
as I finished the video, I
realized there was a much,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.840
much simpler way
of doing that.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.790
They said in a nationwide
poll, n people were

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.490
interviewed.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.180
1/4 of them answered yes
to question one.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.820
And of those, 1/3 answered
yes to question two.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.980
So then you have another 1/3.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.880
So what fraction of the entire
population said yes to both?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.470
Well, it would be 1/4
of-- or 1/3 of 1/4

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.840
which is equal to 1/12.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440
1/12 of the population
said yes to both.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.380
Or you could say 1/12 of
n said yes to both.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.330
And they ask us which of the
following expressions

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.270
represents the number of people
interviewed who did not

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.720
answer yes to both?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.030
So it's everybody else.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.600
These are the people who
said yes to both.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.800
So essentially you just
subtract that from 1.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.170
So 1 minus 1/12 is equal to
12/12 minus 1/12, which is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590
equal to 11/12 of the
population did

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.030
not say yes to both.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.526
And so 11/12 and then the
population is n, so

00:01:04.526 --> 00:01:05.790
it's 11n over 12.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.220
And that's how we
got choice E.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.430
Problem 181.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.370
The ratio of two quantities
is 3:4.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.210
So, let's say one is x, one
is y, and it equals 3:4.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.650
If each of the quantities is
increased by 5, what is the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.900
ratio of these new quantities?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.640
x plus 5 to y plus 5.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.400
Well, it really depends
on what multiple these

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.955
are of 3 and 4.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.800
Well, I already have a sense
that it's choice E.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.250
It cannot be determined from
the information given.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.540
And let's prove it.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.930
I'm going to show you two
different x's and y's, and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.730
when you add 5 to both you're
going to get a completely

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.430
different answer.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.900
So you cannot determine it
from the information.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.620
So they snuck in a data
sufficiency question into the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.750
problem solving.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170
So, x could be 3.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.120
If x is equal to 3 and y is
equal to 4, that definitely

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.490
satisfies this condition.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.030
Or we could have x is equal
to 6 and y is equal to 8.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.610
Right?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.290
That also satisfies
the 3 to 4 ratio.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890
What happens when we add
5 to both of these?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.130
x plus 5 would be equal to 8.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.840
And y plus 5 would
be equal to 9.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.290
So, the new ratio becomes 8:9.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.820
What about this case?

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.290
You would have x plus
5 is equal to 6

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.430
plus 5, which is 11.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.780
And then y plus 5 is equal
to 8 plus 5, which is 13.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.040
And 8/9 is a very different
fraction than 11/13.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.150
It's not like you can reduce
one into the other.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.810
So I can find an x and a y to
satisfy this, but when I add 5

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.480
to the top and bottom I get
two different answers.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.460
So you cannot determine this
with the information given.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.820
So the choice is E.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.520
Sneaky data sufficiency
problem.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.180
182.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.540
If the average arithmetic mean
of x and y is 60-- so

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.370
essentially you're saying x plus
y over 2 is equal to 60.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.020
The average of them is 60.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.270
And the average of
y and z is 80.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.120
So, y plus z over 2
is equal to 80.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.050
What is the value
of z minus x?

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.340
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.800
So let's rewrite this.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.120
Let's solve for x
in terms of y.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.250
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.010
We get x plus y is
equal to 120.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.780
Just multiplied both
sides by 2.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.530
You get x is equal
to 120 minus y.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.730
Now let's solve for z
in terms of y here.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.680
Multiply both sides by 2, you
get y plus z is equal to 160.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.730
z is equal to 160 minus y.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.360
So what's z minus x?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:19.970
So z is 160 minus y, minus
x, 120 minus y.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.160
So that is equal to 160 minus
y, minus 120 plus y.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.180
And it's good that the y's
are canceling out.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.560
Whenever they give you something
like this, it's

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440
usually a safe guess that if
you just go forth with the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.700
algebra that nice things
will happen like this.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.950
So these y's cancel out and
we're left with 160 minus 120

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.020
which is 40.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.970
And that is choice B.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.980
Problem 183.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.900
If 1/2 of the air in a tank is
removed with each stroke of a

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:11.830
vacuum pump-- so we have
1/2 tank per stroke.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.480
I'm guessing this is going
to be a rate of change.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.030
What fraction of the original
amount of air has been removed

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.010
after four strokes?

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.260
Oh no.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.020
This is interesting.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.710
OK.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.290
So, after one stroke, what
fraction of the original

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.390
amount of air has
been removed?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.160
Let's just figure out how
much has been left.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.030
We could do both actually.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.565
Left and then removed.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.340
So, after one stroke-- 1/2 of
the air in the tank is removed

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.100
with each stroke.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.480
So after one stroke, you
have 1/2 left and

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.510
you have 1/2 removed.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.890
But, after two strokes, it takes
out half of the air.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.810
Right.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.890
So it takes out 1/2
of this half.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.580
So if you take out 1/2 of this
half you have 1/4 left over.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.830
And you've also removed
another 1/4.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.430
Right?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.280
Because these add up to
what was left before.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.940
After three strokes, you
take out 1/2 of this.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.950
So you have 1/8 left over.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.170
And you took out another 1/8.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.210
And then after four strokes,
you have 1/16 of

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.330
the air left over.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.660
Actually I didn't even have
to do this column.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.710
After four strokes you have
1/16 of the original air.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.680
But they want to know what
fraction of the original

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.260
amount of air has
been removed.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.080
So this is what you have left.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.240
So what's been removed
is 1 minus this.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.220
So, 1 minus 1/16.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.070
Well, that's 16 over
16 minus 1 over 16.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.470
Which is equal to 15 over 16.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.110
Choice A.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.080
I didn't even have to worry
about that column.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.010
Problem 184.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:55.690
If the 2 digit integers M and
N are positive and have the

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.120
same digits, but in reverse
order, which of the following

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.000
cannot be the sum of M and N?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.680
All right, same digits
in reverse order.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.450
So M could be AB.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.390
And N could be BA.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.990
So which cannot be the sum?

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.870
I'm just experimenting.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.600
Let's see you if you
add AB and BA.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.610
So, if B plus A-- I guess
there's two assumptions.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.000
If B plus A is less 10,
let's do this one.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.590
B plus A is less than 10.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.880
Then you would have-- this
digit would be B plus A.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.470
And then this digit over here
would also be B plus A.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.290
So, definitely choices
D and E work.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.500
So we're left with choices
A, B, and C.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.150
Because none of these fit this
paradigm where we have the

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.460
same digit twice.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.080
So, all of those assume that B
plus A is greater than 10.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.330
So, if B plus A is greater than
10, then what happens?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.010
A plus B.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.920
B plus A.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.850
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:24.210
If B plus A, you'll have the
ones digit from B plus A.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.350
And then you'll have
a 1 up here.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.800
You add 1 plus A plus B.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.289
So, you'd have B
plus A plus 1.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.740
And so this will be a
two-digit number.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.850
And if you think about it-- if
we do the three digits of the

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:48.110
number, this is going
to be the ones digit

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.500
from B plus A right?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.730
This is going to be the ones
digit from B plus A plus 1.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.940
So this number is going to be
one more than this number.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.720
That's an interesting problem.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.940
This one has to be one
more than that one.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.150
And so both B and C satisfy
that, right.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.460
165.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.270
6 is one more than 5.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.570
And it should work out.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.640
We should be able to figure
out a B and an A

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.040
that satisfy that.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.070
And then C also satisfies that.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.800
121.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.430
2 is one more than 1.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.630
I want to make sure you
understand that because it's

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.980
actually pretty interesting.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.860
Deductive reasoning,
A is the answer.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.540
But if you think about it, we're
assuming B plus A is

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.050
greater than 0.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.775
So, here, you'd have the ones
digit of B plus A and

00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:32.170
you'd carry a 1.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.880
Now when you add A plus B and
that 1, the ones digit is

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.900
going to be 1 greater.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.630
This is going to be the ones
digit of B plus A plus 1.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.710
And that's why I'm saying that
the tens digit has to be 1

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.330
greater than the ones.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.890
