00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.340
Hey there!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.690
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today we’re going all the way

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:17.779
from Broadway to Off-Broadway, which Yorick
reminds me is… not very far from Broadway.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.860
Why are we going to Off-Broadway at all?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.869
Look, mid-century Broadway is great.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.950
It has incisive social dramas and dancing
girls!

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.300
Though not usually in the same show.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.180
But in the middle of the twentieth century,
Broadway only had thirty-some theaters, which

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.050
was not nearly enough for producers to take
a chance on all that avant-garde goodness.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.850
So, today, we’ll look at the history of
Off-Broadway and the genres, styles, and troupes

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.579
it supported, including the Black Arts Movement.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.579
Lights up!

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.010
Unless lights are too normal for your weird
show.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.650
INTRO
Off-Broadway theater had actually been around

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.040
for a long time before anyone started calling
it that.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.950
It is the natural continuation of the Little
Theater movement that we explored in our episodes

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.709
on American moderns and the Harlem Renaissance.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.889
In New York that meant theaters like the Provincetown
Players, the Washington Square Players, the

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.729
Neighborhood Playhouse, and the Krigwa Players.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.469
After World War II, new theaters and companies
appeared and this movement became known as

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.469
Off-Broadway.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.299
If you want to get technical, Off-Broadway
used to refer to theaters outside the Broadway

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.229
Box, a stretch that ran from 40th to 54th
Streets in Manhattan.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.299
That leaves a lot of city!

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.439
Originally, most Off-Broadway theaters were
located in Greenwich Village, often in the

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.829
same spaces that the Little Theaters had occupied.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.399
Eventually, Off-Broadway became an Actors
Equity designation concerning theater size,

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.079
referring to theaters in Manhattan that have
between one hundred and four hundred and ninety-nine

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
seats.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.380
But Off-Broadway is also a mindset.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.709
It’s against shallow, big-budget entertainment
and in favor of ensemble-driven, noncommercial

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:01.709
work.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.489
Of course, plenty of Off-Broadway stuff ends
up transferring to Broadway and turns out

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.630
to be very commercial.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
So…

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.700
I mean, you might be surprised to know that
this bit about theater is complicated.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.159
In the early days, a lot of Off-Broadway theaters
were interested in producing the European

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.400
avant-garde because America was apparently
not absurdist enough on its own!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.250
But Off-Broadway theaters also helped to develop
a new American avant-garde, and were supportive

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.090
of works by queer writers and writers of color.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.819
Let’s look at a few significant theaters
and troupes: The Living Theater, Jose Quintero’s

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.980
Circle in the Square, and Joe Papp’s New
York Shakespeare Festival and Public Theater.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.349
The Living Theater was founded in 1947 by
Judith Malina and Julian Beck.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.719
They started out producing Brecht and Cocteau
and Pirandello.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.530
But in the late 1950s, they began producing
new American work, like Jack Gelber’s “The

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.269
Connection,” an immersive play about drug
addicts,

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.540
and Kenneth H. Brown’s “The Brig,” a
brutal play about a military prison.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.319
The Living Theater then relocated to Europe—this
was partly because of an unfortunate tax thing;

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.450
anarchists do not like to pay taxes!

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.959
The company reinvented themselves as a devised
theater company, meaning a company that creates

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.709
its own original works through rehearsal and
exploration.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.590
Artaud was a big influence.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.819
The Living Theater created a bunch of pretty
shocking, occasionally nude, and very participatory

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.219
pieces like “Paradise Now” and “Mysteries
and Smaller Pieces” and brought them back

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.219
to New York.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.930
These shows are basically where all of our
clichés about experimental theater come from:

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.700
long hair, loincloths, naked screaming, naked
rolling around on the floor, naked screaming

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.329
and rolling around on the floor with long
hair...

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.510
But try to remember these weren’t cliches
when the Living Theatre did them.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.459
The Circle in the Square Theater was founded
in Greenwich Village in 1951 by Jose Quintero,

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.580
the son of Panamanian parents.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.560
It was sort of a theater-in-disguise, because
it was originally housed in a former nightclub

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.139
and licensed as a cabaret space.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.930
This meant that the actors, a bunch of whom
lived on site, also had to serve drinks.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.249
Circle in the Square made some gestures toward
the European avant-garde, but under Quintero’s

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:12.849
passionate direction, it’s best known for
cementing the legacy of Tennessee Williams

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.970
and rehabilitating the work of Eugene O’Neill,
who had fallen way out of favor.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.460
The consummate Circle in the Square work is
probably Quintero’s 1956 revival of O’Neill’s

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.910
“The Iceman Cometh,” which had pretty
much flopped the first time around.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.620
It starred Navy veteran, almost EGOT, and
awesome actor Jason Robards, who at the time

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.440
was still driving taxis.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.289
The New York Times wrote that since Circle
in the Square had originally been a nightclub,

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.320
it was the perfect place to house O’Neill’s
waterfront dive.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.599
“It seems not like something written, but
like something that is happening,” wrote

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:47.710
the critic.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.760
Take that, Broadway!

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.319
Circle in the Square became known for an intense
acting style, introducing audiences to influential

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.340
actors like Geraldine Page, Colleen Dewhurst,
and George C. Scott.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.330
The theater moved to the South Village in
1960.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.320
And then in 1972, it moved—surprise!—to
Broadway.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.110
Joe Papp was born in Brooklyn to Yiddish-speaking
parents.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.099
After a stint in the Navy and some time out
in California with former members of the Group

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.620
Theater, he returned to New York and began
to stage free Shakespeare plays in a Lower

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.490
East Side church, insisting that Shakespeare
could and should be for everyone.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.930
In 1956, the Parks Department gave him permission
to use the East River Amphitheater.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.550
Robert Moses, then the parks commissioner,
told him that he would have to charge admission

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.590
fees, but Papp refused—Shakespeare should
be free for all.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.889
The courts supported him.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.419
A permanent theater was built for him in Central
Park.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.520
It opened in 1962, and free Shakespeare is
still performed there every summer.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.979
Show up early; it gets crowded quick.

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.949
In 1966, Papp moved into what had been the
Astor Library on Lafayette Street and transformed

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.039
it into the Public Theater, which you can
visit today.

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.830
It’s adjacent to another music, theatre
and nightclub venue called…

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.160
JOE’S PUB.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.569
Some of the Public Theater’s hits include
“Hair,” “A Chorus Line,” “For Colored

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.889
Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the
Rainbow is Enuf,” “The Normal Heart,”

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.240
and yes, “Hamilton.”

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.510
which rumor has it is VERY good...

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.560
Papp’s legacy is really important.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.979
He insisted on staging the classics with diverse
casts.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.780
He championed queer writers and writers of
color.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.380
And he demanded that theater could and should
be available to everyone.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.680
“Theater,” he said, “is a social force.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.430
Not just entertainment.”

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.710
Off-Broadway also helped foster the Black
Arts Movement, the cultural wing of the Black

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.919
Power Movement.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.169
The Black Arts Movement has its roots far
from Broadway, mostly with the Free Southern

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.319
Theater, which toured plays like “Waiting
for Godot” around the Deep South.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.949
But the Black Arts Movement was specifically
about encouraging African-American artists

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.340
and suggesting that their work was part of
a tradition separate from the cultural work

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.770
of white artists.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.780
The movement allied itself with postcolonial
independence movements in Africa and around

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.780
the world.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.060
One of the movement’s leaders was the poet
and playwright Amiri Baraka, who began his

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.819
career as LeRoi Jones.

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:13.729
His 1965 poem “Black Art,” written after
the assassination of Malcolm X, became a manifesto

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.039
for the movement.

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.580
In one section, he wrote:

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.250
We want a black poem.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.460
And a
Black World.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.380
Let the world be a Black Poem
And Let All Black People Speak This Poem

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.129
Silently
Or LOUD

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:32.000
Baraka’s most famous play is probably “Dutchman,”
which opened at Off-Broadway’s Cherry Lane

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.470
Theater in 1964.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.009
It’s set on a subway car, where Lula, a
white woman, meets Clay, a black man.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:44.629
Lula mocks Clay and tempts him, finally goading
him into admitting the anger he feels toward

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.370
white people, even though he says he would
never act on that anger.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.560
Lula then stabs Clay, and with the help of
the other passengers, she throws his dead

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.720
body out of the car.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.750
She then waits for the next black man.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.639
The most important playwright to emerge from
the Black Arts Movement and one of the greatest

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.379
living American playwrights is Adrienne Kennedy.

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:08.050
Let’s take a look at her breakthrough play,
“Funnyhouse of a Negro,” which opened

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.310
Off-Broadway in 1964 at the East End Theater.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.620
Funnyhouse is another word for a carnival
funhouse or a madhouse, and the play explores

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.570
the devastating effects of racism on a young
woman.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.300
It filters the style of the European avant-garde
through the spirit of the Black Arts Movement.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.229
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:
“Funnyhouse of a Negro” is set in the

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:31.480
bedroom of a young African-American woman
named Sarah.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.572
But it’s also immediately clear that we’re
inside Sarah’s mind.

00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:35.572
The daughter of a dark-skinned father and
a light-skinned mother, Sarah doesn’t feel

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:36.572
that she belongs anywhere.

00:08:36.572 --> 00:08:37.572
She is refracted into separate selves by race.

00:08:37.572 --> 00:08:39.550
You can feel this even in the stage directions:
“in the middle of the Stage in a strong

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.110
white LIGHT, while the rest of the Stage is
in unnatural BLACKNESS.”

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.320
The action is often interrupted by a harsh,
frightening knocking at the door, the sound

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.160
of Sarah’s father trying to come in.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.460
After a prologue in which a woman in a white
nightgown crosses the stage carrying a bald

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.020
head in her arms, the play begins with a conversation
between Queen Victoria and the Duchess of

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.410
Hapsburg about whiteness.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.110
The woman in the nightgown interrupts: she
is Sarah’s mother, distraught.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.800
She says she should never have let a black
man touch her.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.830
The scene shifts to Sarah’s landlady who
tells us that Sarah’s father killed himself

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.340
when Patrice Lumumba, the Congolese independence
leader, was assassinated, and that Sarah hasn’t

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.530
left her room since.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.330
Also, Sarah’s hair is falling out.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.300
Sarah says that the landlady is wrong.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.240
She killed her father, clubbing him with a
black skull.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.330
But we later learn that he may have actually
left the family and married a white woman.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.990
The Duchess has a conversation with a character
named Raymond, the proprietor of the funnyhouse.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:44.540
They talk about how Sarah’s mother is in
an asylum, how her hair has all fallen out,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.920
and how Sarah is the product of rape.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.750
Patrice Lumumba gives a speech, and then the
Duchess talks with Jesus.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.250
The scene changes to a jungle, and the characters
reappear, haloed and screaming.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.370
The scene returns to Sarah’s room, and Sarah
is discovered hanged.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.240
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
That was upsetting.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.130
And hallucinatory.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.980
But it’s supposed to be upsetting and hallucinatory.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.601
The play is about one woman wrestling with
identity in a racialized world, but it is

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:18.880
also about how black artists and intellectuals
fight to find their own voices in a world

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.520
in which almost all of the models and precedents
are white.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.330
Adrienne Kennedy’s voice is distinct.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:31.170
Her precise, surreal style is built on personal
anguish and experience, and is deeply concerned

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.140
with what it means to be a woman of color
in a white world.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.170
Her work also expands the boundaries of what
theatre can do and finds a new stage language

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.160
for stories previously unseen in the American
theatre.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.970
And s--he is still writing today, and is widely
revered as a mentor figure by young African

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.970
American playwrights.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.530
Conclusion
By the 1960s, there was a problem.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.620
Off-Broadway had gotten… fancy.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.191
Work had become increasingly commercial, and
costs were higher.

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.550
That’s how we got Off-Off-Broadway.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.070
Like Off-Broadway, this was a more or less
spontaneous movement.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:09.050
It kicked off in four Downtown spaces: Caffe
Cino, Theater Genesis, Judson Poets Theater,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.050
and La MaMa.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.830
Caffe Cino, run by Joe Cino, was literally
a coffeehouse, but it gave playwrights, especially

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.990
queer playwrights, space to try out their
work.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:23.800
The Judson Poets Theater was run by Al Carmines,
an assistant minister, out of the Judson Memorial

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800
Church.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.790
It became a space for art world happenings
and experimental dance.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.810
Theater Genesis was housed in another church,
St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery, which was

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.480
later the home of Richard Foreman’s Ontological-Hysteric
Theater.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.210
Run by Ralph Cook, Theater Genesis encouraged
poets and playwrights to improvise with their

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.210
actors.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.230
La MaMa, was founded by Ellen Stewart, a former
swimsuit designer, in 1961.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.140
Exuberant and welcoming, she supported many
New York artists and later provided residencies

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.150
to several European companies.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.230
La MaMa is still going today.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.890
Funnily enough - I’VE WORKED ON SHOWS AT
ALL THREE OF THESE PLACES.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.990
And also I sat next to Lou Reed at La Mama
once!

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.990
Thanks for watching.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:07.490
Next time, Yorick and I will be poor and downtrodden—more
so than usual—when we explore Poor Theater

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.390
and the Theater of the Oppressed.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:23.730
Until then… wait, can we afford 
a curtain?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.620
Okay.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:38.400
BUDGET Curtain!
