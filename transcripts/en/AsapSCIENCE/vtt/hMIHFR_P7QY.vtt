00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.040
Poop

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.620
Most of us don't give a second thought to where it ends up after flushing

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.160
but what if I told you that that very poo

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.520
could be making its way back into your house

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.140
without you ever noticing?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.800
For those unfamiliar

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.360
once your food has been chewed, swallowed, chemically and physically broken down

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
and the useful nutrients have been absorbed into your body

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140
the rest is gracefully discarded as waste

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.140
This waste then gets combined with a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
mixture of with a mixture of urine, rain, shower, sink

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
and other household waters into your local

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
sewer system which surprisingly

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
contains mostly water and relatively

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.140
little faeces like a big old

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.140
bowl of soup with very few vegetables

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.140
After passing through potentially miles

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
of pipes, the soup reaches the sewage

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.140
treatment plant and is initially screened

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
and skimmed to separate out things like

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.140
sand, grit and pebbles.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.380
More importantly, this is where that cellphone you accidentally dropped down the toilet

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.440
gets caught along with condoms? and other stuff you thought would be a good idea to toss down the drain.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.080
Which by the way wasn't a good idea.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.300
For every piece of trash or item you throw down the toilet

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.180
the more likely there will be a blockage in the system which has to be removed

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.900
by hand..

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.140
And no-one wants that.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140
The pebbles and grit, on the other hand, are

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.580
dried, cleaned, and reused for things like construction

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640
Perhaps contributing to the creation

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460
of your ivory throne.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.620
The remaining poopy mixture is then left still

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.900
In a giant tank.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960
And thanks to the fundamental properties of both

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
oil and grease as non-polar substances,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740
which don't mix with water,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
it's relatively easy to skim them off.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
Still, you really shouldn't be putting

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
it down the drain, as it can clog pipes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740
and overwhelm the intricate system.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740
What's left now is some sludge and a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980
smelly liquid that looks like chocolate milk.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.880
Mmm, chocolate milk!

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.040
And that's what it tastes like to the millions of bacteria

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.880
which are set loose to feast on this

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.340
mixture. They literally eat the pathogens

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.600
out of the liquid

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
Most of these bacteria are aerobic,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
meaning they require oxygen to function,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.860
just like humans,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
so the tank is pumped full of oxygen.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.720
This water is then disinfected and

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.860
reintroduced back into the environment.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.560
The remaining sludge on the other hand,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.560
Containing mostly solid waste matter,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
goes through a final treatment with another set

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
of bacteria. These bacteria produce

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560
a variety of by-products including methane

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560
gas, which in turn is used to power

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560
the sewage treatment plant.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340
So your poop powers the plant that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.000
processes your poop.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
After eating everything, the bacteria die

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.020
and create something known as Biosolid.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.700
After all is said and done,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000
The remaining, nutrient rich faeces and Biosolid

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
can be used to make compost to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
enrich dry land, or used as fertilisers,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.220
which ultimately help grow vegetation.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220
Vegetation which makes its way

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
into your house and ultimately

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.320
into your mouth.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.320
And so begins the cycle of poop,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.340
All over again

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.000
