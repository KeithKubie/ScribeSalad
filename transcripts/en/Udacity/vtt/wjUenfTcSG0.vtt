If we run update here with the year 1969,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.940
you can see that every circle for the World Cup has disappeared.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.340
I'll close the web console so we can be extra sure, and while it may be hard to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.430
see for yourself, trust me there are no more circles on the page.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.680
So what's happened is that the filtered selection that we've made for

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.220
the year 1969, was simply empty.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.500
So when we made an exit selection,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.240
it contained every circle those on the page and we removed all of them.
