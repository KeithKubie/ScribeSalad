00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.190
Let's go back to coding the content provider. The first

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.860
of the required content provider methods we're going to implement

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.130
is getType. getType is used to return the mime type

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.420
associated with the data at the given URI. We use

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.010
the URI matcher we built earlier to match the given

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.890
URI against the expressions we've compiled in. For each match,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.690
we return a unique mime time, that starts with either

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.400
V and D Android cursor item, for a single record or

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.153
V and D Android cursor dir for multiple items.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:31.167
We've nicely already defined these strings in our WeatherContract, in

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:34.535
our tests, we're getting the type. We're going to compose

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.615
URIs, using the standard methods we have, inside of our

00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:41.440
WeatherContract. Then, we're going to pass these in to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.810
our content provider, through the ContentResolver. Which is how you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.800
call all functions in content provider. And we're going to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.380
make sure it matches what we have in the contract.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.930
I've placed the actual values as comments so you can

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830
see, really, what's going on. Note that some of these returning

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.150
type directory, which means they're going to return a list

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.030
of different items in their cursor. While others are returning type

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020
item, which means they will only return a single item.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.230
Next, we're going to have you finish up getType. You're going to add

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.970
the appropriate cases in this switch statement. But to return mime

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.270
types, the remaining URI types that we aren't yet handling. No,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.960
there are only two to add, and they

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.875
really look just like the ones in WeatherContract.
