Speaker 1:          00:00          Is there are alternatives that are getting very big. Yes. And and together like what? Like signal has tens of millions of users. I don't know what that is. It's never heard of it. That's like the encrypted messaging app that, do you know what? I don't, it's open source. What is it? Snowden is on there, but advisory board or whatnot. What is signal? It's just a messaging APP. So a messenger like whatsapp or like a Twitter or whatsapp. So it's, you have to know the person and then contact them through it. Yeah, but we're talking, we're, we're considering using the signal protocol for our messaging system cause our messaging system needs an upgrade. But all of us together are going to be, be able to create sort of like a, a group of apps that are like sort of a more open freedom supporting privacy alternative and like, so we're not gonna solve it by ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And it would be way easier if one of these big companies would just switch gears and start doing things the right way. I mean, we've spent eight years building this. If one of the big companies, Google Facebook had just been free and open source, we would have spent the last seven years building on top of them. Right? Because you know they already did something cool that they're sharing with everybody. So it's, it's actually closed source project stifle innovation because if you think we had to reinvent the wheel, we literally, we went and built in alternative with much of the similar functionality. Think about how, how much further the world would be if everyone was building on top of more common calls. But you're looking at it in terms of your own personal benefit you're looking at in terms of mine's personal benefit. I mean, you created this thing, it's not just pure for altruistic reasons, it's a business, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49          So if they had established this open source network that was Facebook and then you just came along and built yours, will that, yeah, that would be great for you. But why would that be great for them? I mean they, they're obviously in a business now the problem with the businesses, this business is the business of distributing information. And then we have to decide, okay, at what point in time do we allow these air quotes overlords to dictate what can and cannot be distributed? And how did this happen? Because in the beginning, I bet it didn't happen. I bet in the beginning you could just put on whatever the fuck you wanted and then they had to deal with that and then they had to figure out after a while, okay, maybe we shouldn't have this on like, hey, if we're going to sell advertising, we really should maximize the amount of clicks.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Okay, how do we do that? While we put things in people's feeds, they want to see, we put things that people want to debate about and argue about and political things and all sorts of different things that excite them and get them to be engaged with the platform that's, that's their business. The businesses, I mean it's no different in a lot of ways than Amazon or then any other business that wants to grow. Like how do, how do they grow while they grow by maximizing their profits and by the amount of eyes that get to their advertising. So they get more clicks and more people get engaged. That's what their businesses, you're deciding by saying if they were open source, look how much further on the world with be. They would be further along to, I don't know if they would agree with that. I don't think they're there worth fucking cajillions of dollars.

Speaker 1:          03:17          So they figured it out. Well, it just depends on whether or not you think that people have a right to know what is going on. It's, I mean it's like food transparency. Well yeah, we were. Yeah. So I'll talk about that. I like, I will talk about that until the end of time you were interfacing with this and it's affecting us. I agree. Yeah. I fully agree with what you're saying. I'm playing devil's advocate by saying that in their position they have a business and their businesses to make money and they're going to lose because of what they're doing because it's not as insistent up even at polar losing active users, are they? Yeah, but I've thought their business went up after the hearings did it, but it's not going to last. I mean, look, when I say that it's just the game's over. It's gonna take a long time for us to build it up.

Speaker 1:          04:05          As you know, all of these different organizations and companies working together. But Linux for instance, is the operating system that most banks, it is the most popular operating system in the world. It's, it's, it's, yeah, it's open. It's in your phone. It's in everywhere. It got there because of that, because everyone used it and incorporate it into their product. Facebook, they are all using free and open source software in their stacks. They're just not sharing their product with everybody else. So they're benefiting from it but not giving back. And you know, I, I almost feel like I shouldn't even be saying that they should just pivot because you know, that's their only chance to survive. So this is based on your estimations of the future. Yeah. It just seems like things are becoming more open and if is that possible because you engage with a lot of other super nerds and you guys all have these similar ideas.

Speaker 1:          05:05          You just have to look at what's happening with bitcoin. I don't know what's happening with bitcoin. It's become a bitcoin and ethereum and you know, lots of other blockchains are, are, are growing really fast. Maybe the, you know, the price is separate, the development energy, the number of people who are building apps on top of bitcoin and ethereum is growing massively. There's, there's, it's a whole new infrastructure that's like a common protocol that people can build on. So that is growing rapidly. The price is secondary. That's not even what bitcoin and ethereum are really about. It's, it's a decentralized database. So this is just where the Internet, the Internet is meant to be decentralized. It sort of started out that way. And then we moved into this like web to silo system with like just these massive companies that are controlling everything. But it's gonna, it's gonna keep waving.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Okay. Again, to play devil's advocate, the vast amount of users are not using those platforms. The vast amount of users are using these controlled platforms like Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. Like if that's, if you're, if you're talking about, I'm just guessing, but if you're talking about the, the, the gross number of human beings that are interacting with each other on social media, they're mostly uncontrolled networks. You're saying that this is not gonna last, but there's no evidence that it isn't going to last. There's tons of evidence. What is the evidence? Wikipedia, what is happening in card? I remember that desk you put in your computer, that was your encyclopedia. Where is that? No one uses it. Okay. That's, that's different. This is not a social media network. The social media networks that people are using are almost all controlled, right? Yeah. No I it's not, it's going to take a very, very long time. How long?

Speaker 1:          06:55          I would say 10 years. And what do you think is going to be the catalyst? Like what's going to cause these people to make this radical shift to open source? I think we have to be, we have responsibility to be competitive functionally. Like you know, science does. We were saying we do, we're getting, we're moving there fast. Like, we just hired a ton of new developers and it's going to take time. We're not there yet. Right. But once we have functionally competitive products that you wouldn't even know the difference and there's enough people there, then it's basically the decision of, uh, you know, am I going to choose the one that respects my privacy and freedom or are the one that doesn't? And people are all kids don't like Facebook, right? No. Everyone is sick of it. We're just drug addicts. Hmm. Um, is that what it is?

Speaker 1:          07:46          They're just sucked into this thing where you, you constantly want to check and see who's writing what and yeah, and there's monopolies, arguably. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Especially when Facebook owns Instagram. Right. Um, what if they bought Twitter as well? They almost did, I think Google almost into two steps in and buys everything. Then you're like, oh no, they probably could. Right? Yeah, they easily could. They could probably buy everything apple could with cash. Yeah. Yeah. Tim Cook had come in with a big purple pimp suit on, just slap down a briefcase patch. I just wonder and like look all the, all of these executives, you know, Jack seems like a cool person. She's a very nice guy. It's not, I just sent so much inconsistency and you know, he's talking about Bitcoin, like it's this important new internet money simultaneous, which is, he knows the infrastructure is open, but then his platforms or the opposite, why is he selling consistent?

Speaker 1:          08:52          It's like there's, it's just hypocritical to the maximum. I think it's partly because it's a giant business, you know? And I think when you have an obligation to your shareholders and to maximize profits and when you're trying to maximize profits too, and there's this universal growth model where every year just has to get a little bit bigger. Otherwise you're fucking up as a CEO. Like you don't have to experience that with mines. You were one of the cofounders. How many people are involved? Just like 15 of us now. And do you have like a board we sit around when you make critical decisions such stressful as fuck. Yeah. Luckily we've started off from the point where we're saying, okay, we're embedding principles into how we're doing things. So we're not in a position where we would ever change that, that that's for us to do. That would just be a total waste of time, right? So we're making it harder for ourselves to make money in the beginning. We're making it harder for ourselves to grow because we are not gonna compromise people's privacy in order to do those things. And so we're just going to build up slowly, steadily find and just get there when we get there.
