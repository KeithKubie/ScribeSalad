AND WE ARE SO PLEASED THAT YOU 

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:40.650
ARE HERE, AND AS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE, THOUGH, AS A LIBRARIAN,

00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:45.572
I SAID:  HAS HE WRITTEN A BOOK?
HAS HE HAD ANY?

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:49.744
AND SO I CHECKED IT OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.725
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, 
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE I'VE TABBED 

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:56.382
THINGS AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU 
SOME THINGS, WHAT DOES THE 

00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:01.684
GERSHWIN PRIZE MEAN TO YOU?
&gt;&gt; OH MY GOD, AS A SONG WRITER 

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:05.747
IT'S PROBABLY THE HIGHEST AWARD 
YOU CAN GET.

00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:09.211
IF MY MOM AND DAD WERE ALIVE 
THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE I AM HERE

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:12.033
TALKING TO YOU IN THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS.

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:15.340
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE AWARD BECAUSE
IT WAS SO DIFFICULT FOR US AT 

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.435
THE BEGINNING COMING TO AMERICA 
BECAUSE WE CAME WITH A DIFFERENT

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:22.323
SOUND AND A DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
IN A WAY AND IT WAS HARD.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.819
IT WAS HARD BUT ONE THING I 
ALWAYS FEEL PROUD, THAT THEY 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.683
OPENED THE DOORS TO US IN SUCH 
AN INCREDIBLE WAY AND THEY 

00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:33.743
CLOSED A LOT OF DOORS AND SAID 
THIS WILL NEVER WORK BUT WE 

00:06:36.655 --> 00:06:38.655
BELIEVED THAT WE HAVE SO MANY 
GREAT PEOPLE IN THE UNITED 

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.559
STATES AND THEY OPENED A LOT OF 
DOORS AND THE PEOPLE DECIDE, 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.089
WE'VE GOT SO MANY SONGS THAT 
BECAME NUMBER ONE AND IT'S A 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.295
DREAM.
A DREAM TO GET THIS AWARD, FOR 

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:48.296
ME AND GLORIA.

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:53.678
AND I WITH NOT SAY THANK YOU 
ENOUGH AND THANK YOU TO 

00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:57.111
EVERYBODY WHO DECIDED TO GIVE US
THIS AWARD.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.013
SOME AWARDS STAY FOREVER IN YOUR
LIFE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET THE

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:04.081
MEDAL OF FREEDOM.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE SAID.

00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.746
I ALWAYS SAID I WISH MY MOM AND 
MY DAD WOULD BE ALIVE BECAUSE 

00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:11.667
THEY REALLY PUSHED ME IN A WAY 
AND THEY TOLD ME ONE THING:  DO 

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:16.955
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND THAT'S 
WHAT I'VE DONE ALL MY LIFE.

00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:19.813
DOING WHAT MADE ME HAPPY WAS 
MAKING MUSIC AND IT'S A 

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.055
BLESSING.
I AM VERY, VERY HONORED TO 

00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:25.121
RECEIVE THIS AWARD.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE MORE THAN PLEASED, AS 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.570
YOU CAN IMAGINE, BECAUSE YOUR 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.106
BOOK WAS A BEST-SELLER, TOO.
THE RHYTHM OF SUCCESS:  HOW AN 

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:37.998
IMMIGRANT PRODUCED HIS OWN 
AMERICAN DREAM.

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:42.655
AND YOUR DEDICATION IS TO ANY 
YOUNG KID WITH THE DREAM OF 

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:47.190
BECOMING THE FIRST HISPANIC 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:51.091
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:07.203
WE HAVE OVER 26 LATINOS AND 
MILLENNIALS.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.420
THEY'RE SO LUCKY TO LIVE IN A 
COUNTRY WITH DREAMS.

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:13.526
EVERY DREAM CAN COME TRUE AS 
LONG AS YOU DREAM AND DO WHAT IS

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:15.571
RIGHT FOR YOU AND I ALWAYS SAID 

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.538
IN MY LIFE, THAT I HOPE MY 
CAREER AND GLORIA'S CAREER IS 

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.125
NOT ABOUT LATINOS ONLY, IT'S 
ABOUT MINORITIES.

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:27.136
PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF DREAMS.
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.230
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT CULTURE, 

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.303
AND THEY HAVE THE -- THEY HAVE 

00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.405
THE WAY TO DO AND BRING 
SOMETHING THOROUGHLY NEW, AND 

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:39.756
THEY NEVER FORGET WHERE THEY 
CAME FROM.

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.999
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
YOU'RE AFRICAN AMERICAN, YOU'RE 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.294
JEWISH, YOU'RE LATIN, LATINO, 
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MORE CULTURE, 

00:08:46.295 --> 00:08:48.741
IT'S GOOD TO SPEAK MORE 
LANGUAGES.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.370
THAT OPENS A LOT OF YOUR MIND, A
LOT OF THINGS.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.850
MY DAD WAS FROM LEBANON AND MY 
GRANDMOTHER USED TO TALK TO US 

00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:58.800
IN ARABIC AND I LEARNED A LOT OF
ARABIC BUT OF COURSE BEING IN 

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.290
CUBA, I WAS BORN IN CUBA, AND OF

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:09.454
COURSE, IMPART HISPANIC AND I 
TRY TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF 

00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:11.455
GOOD ENGLISH SO I HOPE YOU 
UNDERSTAND.

00:09:11.494 --> 00:09:12.963
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING THE WHOLE 

00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:16.488
WEEK.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:19.970
BUT YOU WILL ANSWER SOME 
QUESTIONS IN SPANISH BECAUSE ONE

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:25.362
OF YOUR, IN YOUR BOOK THE FOR
FORWORD WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF 

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:27.614
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND BEST 
FRIENDS, MR. QUINCY JONES.

00:09:29.247 --> 00:09:31.247
&gt;&gt; YES, OH MY GOD.
THAT WAS A DREAM.

00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:34.994
QUINCY IS THE GODFATHER OF MY 
DAUGHTER AND I LEARNED SO MUCH 

00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:38.586
FROM HIM BECAUSE I HAVE THE 
HONOR HE'S GOING TO BE HERE WITH

00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:40.821
US FOR THE AWARD.
QUINCY IS THE GUY THAT TEACH ME 

00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:43.278
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT DREAMS.

00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.749
IT WAS HARD FOR HIM, EVEN HE WAS
BORN IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE 

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.545
DIFFERENT RACE, DIFFERENT COLOR.
I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN FROM 

00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:56.042
EACH OTHER AND WE NEED TO BE 
SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

00:09:56.043 --> 00:09:58.917
NOT ABOUT POLITICS.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN POLITICS.

00:10:00.344 --> 00:10:01.987
BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A 
REPUBLICAN, I BELIEVE WHO IS A 

00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:06.522
GOOD PERSON, AND HOW THEY -- HE 
WENT THROUGH SUCH A HARD TIME IN

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.079
HIS LIFE AND HOW MUCH HE 
ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW MUCH 

00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:12.535
CONTRIBUTION HE'S DONE FOR THE 
WORLD, NOT ONLY MUSIC, TO THE 

00:10:12.536 --> 00:10:18.056
WORLD SO I'M VERY PROUD TO CALL 
HIM MY COMPADRE AND MY FRIEND.

00:10:19.073 --> 00:10:22.331
I LOVE QUINCY AND HE'S BEEN ONE 
OF MY HEROES.

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.035
&gt;&gt; WHEN EMILIO WAS GROWING UP IN
THE U.S. THERE WERE NO LATIN 

00:10:26.036 --> 00:10:30.111
MUSIC MOGULS FOR HIM TO EMULATE.
HE HAD TO MAKE HIS OWN DREAM.

00:10:30.926 --> 00:10:34.630
NOW, YOUR CHILDHOOD, THOUGH, 
SOMEONE SAID YOU WENT FROM 

00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:39.584
RICHES TO RAGS TO RICHES.
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR 

00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:42.788
CHILDHOOD?

00:10:45.907 --> 00:10:47.959
&gt;&gt; ABOUT, TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IN 
THE BOOK, ABOUT THE --

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.278
&gt;&gt; AT 11 YOU SAID --
&gt;&gt; AT 11 YEARS OLD I WAS IN CUBA

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:55.949
AND I REALIZED THAT SOMEBODY 
CAME TO THE HOUSE LOOKING FOR 

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.409
DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE
MONEY AND I REALIZED THAT THEY 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.787
WHEN I SAW PEOPLE COMING TO OUR 
HOUSE WITH MACHINE GUNS AND 

00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:08.076
TRYING TO FORCE MY MOM AND MY 
DAD TO SEARCH THE WHOLE HOUSE, I

00:11:08.077 --> 00:11:12.348
WAS 11 YEARS OLD, BUT IT 
IMPACTED MY LIFE BECAUSE I SAID 

00:11:12.349 --> 00:11:15.824
THE ONLY THING I REALLY DON'T 
WANT IS TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY 

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:19.048
BECAUSE EVEN WE LIVE IN THIS 
COUNTRY, WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:23.743
FREEDOM IS THE MAIN THING TO 
HAVE, BECAUSE WITHOUT FREEDOM 

00:11:23.744 --> 00:11:25.843
YOU CAN'T HAVE DREAMS, YOU CAN'T
HAVE ANYTHING.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.479
I DECIDE TO, I TOLD MY MOM THAT 
NIGHT, I CRY ALL NIGHT.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040
I TOLD MY MOM I HAD TO LEAVE 

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:38.546
CUBA IN ORDER TO LIVE BUT I KNEW
IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE I HAVE 

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:40.547
WITH MY FAMILY TO GET OUT OF 

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.318
CUBA, AND I REMEMBER, I MEAN, 
WHEN I GOT TO 14 IS WHEN THEY 

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:51.015
LET ME LEAVE CUBA.
AND HAVING A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY 

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.548
SORT OF, I MEAN, WELL, I BECAME,
I CRY ON THE PLANE FROM HAVANA 

00:11:57.549 --> 00:11:59.791
TO SPAIN.
I WENT TO SPAIN BECAUSE MY MOM 

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:02.846
WAS FROM SPAIN.
AND WHEN I GOT THERE IN 8 HOURS,

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.499
I BECAME A MAN.
BEING A LITTLE KID, I BECAME A 

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:09.985
MAN, AND I BECAME ALMOST 
HOMELESS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LEAVE

00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:13.913
CUBA AT THE TIME YOU'RE NOT 
ALLOWED TO TAKE ANY MONEY, 

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:16.961
ANYTHING, EVEN YOUR WATCH, 
ANYTHING YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE TO 

00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:19.830
LEAVE EVERYTHING WITH THE 
COUNTRY BUT I LEARN A LOT OF 

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:22.072
THINGS.
A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:24.145
MAKE DECISIONS IN LIFE.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT 

00:12:24.146 --> 00:12:26.146
IS REALLY HARD AND YOU HAVE TO 

00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:31.288
THINK, PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND 
THAT'S ONE THING I THINK I 

00:12:32.144 --> 00:12:33.972
LEARNED SO MANY THINGS HOW TO 
ENJOY LIFE, HOW TO ENJOY EVERY 

00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:37.027
SINGLE MOMENT OF MY LIFE AND IT 
WAS AN INCREDIBLE AND BEAUTIFUL 

00:12:37.028 --> 00:12:38.650
THING.
&gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT IN YOUR BOOK, 

00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:44.124
AND I HAVE TO -- REQUIRED 
READING.

00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:46.191
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.460
IT'S, LIFE LESSONS AND SUCCESS, 
AND EACH CHAPTER IS -- 

00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:52.531
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
BE POSITIVE.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:55.205
AND I HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE ONE OF 
THE MOST POSITIVE PEOPLE I'VE 

00:12:55.206 --> 00:12:59.079
EVER MET.
AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO TURN 

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:05.579
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO 
POSITIVE SITUATIONS, EVEN WHEN 

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.505
YOU WERE FINDING THAT PEOPLE 
WERE TELLING YOU:  THIS WILL 

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:13.791
NEVER WORK.
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT AT

00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:18.466
THE SONY COMPANY THAT HAPPENED 
TO YOU.

00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:22.324
I LOVE THIS ONE.
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHEN WE CAME AND WE 

00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:26.006
RECORD FIRST IN SPANISH -- WE 
WERE THE FIRST GROUP BELIEVE IT 

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:30.524
OR NOT TO DO AN ALBUM IN ENGLISH
AND SPANISH BILINGUAL AND THE 

00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.780
SONG BECAME NUMBER ONE WITH A 
SMALL LABEL IN MIAMI.

00:13:36.662 --> 00:13:37.881
THEN WE DID A SONG THAT IS 
CALLED DR. BEAT.

00:13:37.882 --> 00:13:41.144
DR. BEAT EVEN WE TOOK IT TO THE 
LABEL SAYING THIS CALIFORNIA 

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:44.453
KIND OF SOUND WILL NEVER WORK.
IT HAS A LOT OF PERCUSSION.

00:13:45.898 --> 00:13:48.992
GLORIA SAID LET'S TRY OURSELF.
WE WENT TO THE RECORD POOLS, THE

00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:50.993
DEEJAYS AND THE SONG BECAME 

00:13:55.354 --> 00:13:57.354
NUMBER ONE IN ENGLISH ENGLAND, 
HOLLAND 

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.661
AND IN THE STATES AND WE WERE SO
HAPPY, WE WENT TO HOLLAND AND 

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:03.077
EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY ABOUT 
THIS KIND OF SOUND.

00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:06.085
PEOPLE JUMPING UP AND DOWN, IT 
WAS FANTASTIC.

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:08.178
I REMEMBER WE HAVE ONLY TWO 
SONGS IN ENGLISH AND THEY CAME 

00:14:11.253 --> 00:14:13.253
OUT, AND WE WANT MORE, WE WANT 
MORE.

00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:17.483
I SAID GLORIA, LET'S PLAY THE 
CUBAN CONGAS.

00:14:20.768 --> 00:14:23.004
THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
SPEAK ENGLISH OR SPANISH.

00:14:26.068 --> 00:14:28.278
I TALKED TO THE DRUM I AND THEY 
WROTE A SOLD CONGA AND WE 

00:14:29.712 --> 00:14:31.712
RECORDED WITH A SMALL BUDGET THE
SONG.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.246
AND I TRADE TO GO TO SONY AND 
THEY SAY THEY ARE REALLY BUSY 

00:14:35.247 --> 00:14:40.129
AND FINALLY AFTER 7 TIMES THEY 
LET ME COME INTO THE RECORD 

00:14:42.979 --> 00:14:44.412
LABEL, AND THE GUY WHO WAS THERE
SAID LISTEN, THIS SOUND WILL 

00:14:44.413 --> 00:14:46.693
NEVER WORK.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TRUMPETS 

00:14:46.694 --> 00:14:50.362
OUT, THE PERCUSSION OUT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY 

00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:53.818
ATTRACTED ME WAS HE SAID YOU 
HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR LAST NAME.

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:58.968
AND I SAID, I NEVER WILL, SIR.
HE SAID YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:15:00.392 --> 00:15:02.226
YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS IN YOUR 
HOME.

00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:04.115
GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY AND I 
TOLD THE GUY:  LISTEN, I'M PROUD

00:15:04.116 --> 00:15:06.978
WHAT WE'VE DONE.
I'M PROUD OF MY FAMILY.

00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:10.249
WE'LL DO IT ON OUR OWN.
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:16.752
PROBABLY WE TRIED TO PUSH THE 
LABEL JUST TO PUT IT OUT AND 

00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:21.958
THIS SONG BECAME THE NUMBER ONE 
SONG IN EVERY FORMAT.

00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:25.082
THE FUNNY THING THE SAME GUY 
THAT WAS TELLING ME, THEY ARE 

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:28.953
REALLY BUSY, 7 YEARS LATER I 
BECAME PRESIDENT OF SONY.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.580
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT.

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:33.658
&gt;&gt; I USED TO COME IN AND SAY:  
HELLO.

00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:35.550
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:37.551
&gt;&gt; HE REMEMBERED YOU?
&gt;&gt; OH, HE REMEMBERED ME.

00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:41.201
OH, BELIEVE ME, HE REMEMBERED 
ME.

00:15:41.202 --> 00:15:42.442
I REMEMBER HIM FOR SURE, I CAN 
TELL YOU THAT.

00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:44.443
[ APPLAUSE ]
I REMEMBER HIM.

00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:46.891
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I NEVER FELT REGRET.

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.558
I FELT THAT SOMETHING, 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN MY 

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:54.501
LIFE WAS FOR A REASON.
AND PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU 

00:15:54.502 --> 00:15:59.624
LEARN, MISTAKES, BECAUSE YOU 
MAKE MISTAKES, SOMETIMES BECAUSE

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.684
A BAD EXPERIENCE, BUT IN YOUR 
LIFE, PEOPLE REALIZE WHEN YOU 

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.135
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU'RE 
ALIVE AND YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL 

00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:07.136
FAMILY.
YOU HAVE TO THANK GOD.

00:16:08.348 --> 00:16:10.348
SAY I'M READY, LET ME WORK.
AND I DO THAT EVERY MORNING.

00:16:10.988 --> 00:16:13.193
I THANK THE FANS.
I THANK EVERYBODY THAT GAVE US A

00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:16.487
BEAUTIFUL LIFE AND LET US DO 
WHAT WE LOVE ME AND GLORIA THAT 

00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:19.559
IS MAKING MUSIC.
I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER 

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.007
CHOICE.
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED PLANNING AND 

00:16:21.008 --> 00:16:23.448
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:30.571
THERE'S A AN EFFORT TO ORGANIZE 
AND DO THINGS, BUT YOU WERE WAY 

00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:34.434
AHEAD OF YOUR TIME.
ONE CHAPTER IS ABOUT PLANNING 

00:16:34.435 --> 00:16:39.329
AND IT GOES FROM THE MINUTE YOU 
WAKE UP, YOU -- WELL, TELL THEM 

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.588
ABOUT HOW YOU CAN SEE THINGS IN 
THE DARK.

00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:47.352
&gt;&gt; NO WONDER SHE'S THE BIG BOSS.
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.038
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN FIND THINGS IN THE 
DARK.

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:52.039
&gt;&gt; WHEN I ARRIVED IN THIS 

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.335
COUNTRY I WAS EMOTIONLESS, I 
FELT MY LIFE WAS DISORGANIZED.

00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:59.621
I SPENT MANY YEARS WITHOUT 
SEEING MY MOM AND I SAID HOW ARE

00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:05.093
WE GOING TO MAKE MONEY?
HOW WILL WILL I BE ABLE TO HELP 

00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:08.544
MY FAMILY COME TO THIS COUNTRY?
I SAID THE ONLY WAY I'LL BE ABLE

00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:12.444
TO MAKE MY LIFE SUCCESSFUL, IF I
GET ORGANIZED.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.159
AND I DO PLANNING BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY YOU DO.

00:17:17.212 --> 00:17:20.083
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FOCUS, YOU
SAY I HAVE A CHANCE, I LIVE IN A

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:24.046
COUNTRY THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:28.431
AND I SAY, I NEED TO WORK AND 
THE THINGS, IT WAS HARD IN A WAY

00:17:28.432 --> 00:17:31.286
BECAUSE WE NEVER WANTED TO LOSE 
WHO WE ARE.

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:35.961
I THINK IT WAS THE SOUND, THAT'S
WHY WE CALL IT MIAMI SOUND 

00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:38.440
MACHINE BECAUSE WHEN WE CAME TO 
MIAMI THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE 

00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:44.147
LEAVING CUBA BEING A COMMUNIST 
COUNTRY, AND, BUT, YOU KNOW, I 

00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:48.634
GREW UP LISTENING TO CRUZ AND 
ALL THE CUBAN MUSIC AND THEN I 

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:53.129
COME TO MIAMI AND YOU GET MOTOWN
AND DONNA SUMMER AND ALL THE 

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.024
GREAT MUSIC IN THIS COUNTRY AND 
WE COMBINED BOTH ELEMENTS.

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.295
THE RECORD LABELS NEVER LIKE TO 
TAKE CHANCES BUT I SAY I DON'T 

00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:03.560
WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS
NOT WHO WE ARE.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.567
IT'S ONE THING I LEAVE TO MY 
KIDS AND TO, I THINK TO A LOT OF

00:18:08.568 --> 00:18:11.012
PEOPLE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOURSELF TO

00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:14.924
BE SUCCESSFUL.
YOU HAVE TO BE WHO YOU ARE.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.993
YOU ARE REAL AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE
THAT ARE SMART AND THEY KNOW 

00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:21.052
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING WITH A LOT
OF HONESTY AND I FEEL PROUD 

00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:23.287
ABOUT THAT.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:25.325
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:18:29.997 --> 00:18:31.439
&gt;&gt; SO BEFORE YOU, THERE WASN'T A
TRUE MIAMI SOUND.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.881
YOU DEVELOPED THAT?
&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE MIAMI SOUND.

00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:36.563
THEY TOLD ME DON'T PUT THAT 
SOUND.

00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:39.457
THAT'S THE LOCAL.
I SAID THAT'S WHO WE ARE, MIAMI 

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:42.732
SOUND.
I USED TO WRITE SOMETHING IN 

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:47.435
HAMBURGER, THE WHOLE FUSION.
&gt;&gt; SO THE BUSINESS PART, YOU GOT

00:18:52.329 --> 00:18:53.952
INTO PRODUCING AND HELPING OTHER
ARTISTS.

00:18:53.953 --> 00:18:55.953
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:18:57.646 --> 00:18:59.899
WHEN MY SON, OF COURSE WE START 
DOING WITH GLORIA ALL THE ALBUMS

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.360
AND WE KNEW WHAT WE WAS LACKING 
FOR.

00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:05.443
WE NOW WE WOULD LIKE TRUMPETS 
AND WE LIKE THE PERCUSSION AND 

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:09.585
WE LIKE THAT, BUT THEN WE BECAME
THANK GOD VERY SUCCESSFUL AND 

00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:11.848
ALLOWED MANY PEOPLE CAME AND 

00:19:15.117 --> 00:19:17.117
ASKED ME, LATINO, LIKE DELIA FOR

00:19:19.876 --> 00:19:21.876
EXAMPLE BUT JOHN SACATA CAME.

00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:25.390
I SAID YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, 
YOU'RE BILINGUAL AND YOU CAN DO 

00:19:25.391 --> 00:19:27.391
IT.
WE DID AN ALBUM.

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:30.479
EVEN AFTER ALL THE SUCCESS WE 

00:19:33.997 --> 00:19:35.997
GOT WITH CON GEORGIA AND -- 
CONGA 

00:19:37.424 --> 00:19:39.424
CAME, SO WE WAS PLAYING WEMBLY 
IN LONDON.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.880
I SAID I HAVE A GUY THAT'S 
FANTASTIC.

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:45.111
THE GUY SAID LISTEN I'M GOING TO
BE -- LISTEN, I TOLD HIM YOU 

00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:47.367
HAVE THE CONGA.
YOU CAN COME IN THE MORNING AND 

00:19:47.368 --> 00:19:49.408
LEAVE THE NEXT DAY.
I CONVINCED HIM.

00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:53.075
I THINK ENERGY IS SO IMPORTANT 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT POSITIVE.

00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:56.757
I SAY YES YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO 
HIM BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I AM.

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:01.895
TOMORROW I'M GOING TO WEAR THE 
NEW TIE, I'M SO HAPPY LIKE A 

00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:03.956
KID.
THAT'S CONTAGIOUS.

00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:08.011
SOMEBODY WHO'S DEPRESSED GET 
DEPRESSED.

00:20:08.469 --> 00:20:09.284
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY EVERYBODY GET 
HAPPY.

00:20:09.285 --> 00:20:11.551
THAT'S ME.
I CANNOT AVOID THAT.

00:20:13.652 --> 00:20:15.652
GLORIA WILL SAY I LOVE LUCY, BUT
I'M LUCY, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:17.701

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.472
&gt;&gt; YES, TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOU 
PLAN THINGS AND PACK AND ALL 

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.310

&gt;&gt; HOW I PACK?

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:26.735
OH, MY GOD.
I'M THE BEST PACKER IN THE 

00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:30.001
WORLD.
I CAN GET MY UNDERWEAR AND --

00:20:30.002 --> 00:20:33.286
&gt;&gt; IN THE DARK.
&gt;&gt; IN THE DARK.

00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:39.368
YES.
I'M GETTING RED.

00:20:40.187 --> 00:20:41.416
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S THE PLANNING AND 

00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:45.120
BEING READY.
NOW, GLORIA, HOW DID YOU MEET 

00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:48.387
GLORIA?
&gt;&gt; HOW I MET GLORIA, WHEN I CAME

00:20:52.883 --> 00:20:55.136
TO MIAMI, I -- FIRST THING THAT 
I DID, I CONVINCED MY UNCLE, I 

00:20:55.137 --> 00:20:59.551
SAID UNCLE I NEED TO BUY AN 
ACCORDION.

00:21:00.804 --> 00:21:02.804
HE SAID I DON'T HAVE MONEY.
PLEASE SIGN FOR ME THE 

00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:06.766
ACCORDION, IT WAS $177.
MY AUNT TOLD ME HOW WE GONNA PAY

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:09.000
FOR THIS?
I'M GOING TO SEE.

00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:13.042
THEN I WENT TO AN ITALIAN 
RESTAURANT.

00:21:15.324 --> 00:21:17.324
A CUBAN GUY PLAGUE ITALIAN 
MUSIC, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.390
&gt;&gt; ON AN ACCORDION.
&gt;&gt; I HIRED THE ACCORDION.

00:21:22.743 --> 00:21:24.989
I WORKED FOR THE BACARDI FAMILY 
AND I NEWSED TO KNOW THE CUBAN 

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.682
MUSIC SO THE BACARDI FAMILY CAME
FROM CUBA, THEY'RE GOING TO 

00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:31.961
HAVE A WEDDING AND PARTY, THE 
RECEPTION, AND ANNIVERSARY.

00:21:33.621 --> 00:21:35.722
AND WE WANTED YOU TO COME WITH 
ACCORDION AND MAYBE A PERCUSSION

00:21:35.723 --> 00:21:38.997
AND I CAME AND WE PLAYED THAT 
NIGHT AND WE BECAME A HUGE 

00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:43.093
SUCCESS.
THEY TIPPED ME LIKE 120 BUCKS.

00:21:43.498 --> 00:21:47.413
THAT WAS LIKE OH MY GOD, I'M 
BLESSED, I'M SO HAPPY.

00:21:51.703 --> 00:21:53.703
I CAN BUY SOMETHING TOMORROW.
AND THE BAND BECAME REALLY 

00:21:56.601 --> 00:21:58.601
FAMOUS, CALLED MIAMI LATIN BOYS.
I USED TO WORK WITH BACARDI.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.527
HE SAID THERE'S A GROUP THAT'S 
GOING TO PERFORM IN THE CHURCH 

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:04.580
AND YOU SHOULD COME TO LISTEN TO
THEM BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF 

00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:07.463
THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THAT, 
TO COLLECT MONEY FOR POOR 

00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:09.549
PEOPLE.
SO I WENT TO THE HOUSE AND I SAW

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.565
THIS GROUP PERFORMING.
I SAW GLORIA.

00:22:13.385 --> 00:22:15.385
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED.

00:22:16.692 --> 00:22:18.692
NUMBER ONE, I LOVE THE WAY, THE 
HONESTY ON HER.

00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:21.416
GLORIA IS AN INCREDIBLE HUMAN 
BEING AND I SAW SHE WAS A LITTLE

00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:23.744
BIT SORT OF BEAUTIFUL VOICE BUT 

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.810
SHE WAS SORT OF LIKE SAD IN A 
WAY.

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:31.255
GLORIA SAID HER CHILDHOOD WASN'T
GOOD.

00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:34.420
HER FATHER WENT TO BAY OF PIGS, 
IT WAS AN INVASION, THEN HE CAME

00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:37.499
BACK AND WENT TO VIETNAM AND 
WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE CAME IN A 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.173
WHEELCHAIR SO I KNEW SOMETHING 
WAS -- IT WAS A FEELING.

00:22:42.204 --> 00:22:44.204
SOMETIMES YOU FEEL PEOPLE.
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:22:46.696 --> 00:22:47.104
THAT DAY I SAY HELLO, GOODBYE 
AND THREE MONTHS LATER I WAS 

00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:49.792
PLAYING A WEDDING AND SHE CAME 
INTO THE WEDDING.

00:22:52.268 --> 00:22:54.936
I WAS PLAYING THE ACCORDION.
AND GLORIA WAS IMPRESSED WITH 

00:22:54.937 --> 00:22:56.937
THAT.

00:23:00.257 --> 00:23:01.912
SHE SAID OH MY GOD, A CUBAN GUY 
PLAYING THE HUSTLE, THAT'S 

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:03.766
REALLY WEIRD.
I SAID COME AND SING A SONG WITH

00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:06.618
US AND SHE CAME AND SHE DIDN'T 
WANT TO DO IT.

00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:10.574
I SAID COME ON, EVERYBODY KNOWS 
YOU HERE AND WE PLAYED TWO SONGS

00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:13.452
AND I LOVED HER VOICE.
I SAID WE DO THIS WEEKEND, WE 

00:23:16.924 --> 00:23:19.177
USED TO PLAY WEDDINGS, BAR 
MITZVAHS WE PLAY EVERYTHING IN 

00:23:19.178 --> 00:23:23.465
MIAMI AND THEN I LOVE THE SOUND 
TO BE BILINGUAL, TO HAVE 

00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:27.495
PERCUSSION, TO HAVE DANCE MUSIC.

00:23:30.444 --> 00:23:31.691
AND SHE CAME, FOR THE AUDITION 
SHE CAME WITH THE GRANDMOTHER, 

00:23:31.692 --> 00:23:34.593
THE MOTHER, HER SISTER, 
EVERYBODY CAME TO THE PLACE WE 

00:23:34.594 --> 00:23:37.628
WAS REHEARSING.
I'M LIKE OH MY GOD.

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:41.582
IN CUBAN WE CALL CHAPERONE.
HAVE TO HAVE CHAPERONE ALL THE 

00:23:41.583 --> 00:23:43.570
TIME.
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET A BODY GUARD

00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:46.572
FOR THE GIRL YOU'RE DATING.
NOT NOW.

00:23:46.978 --> 00:23:50.075
THINGS CHANGE.
BUT AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW, I MET

00:23:50.076 --> 00:23:53.540
GLORIA, IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A 
GIRLFRIEND, YOU HAVE A CHAPERONE

00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:57.859
LIKE A BODY GUARD NEXT TO HER.
SO SHE SAID, LISTEN, I'M GOING 

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.552
TO DO IT AND MAY COUSIN WILL 
COME WITH ME.

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.971
I SAID OKAY, DOESN'T MATTER.
WE HARDLY MAKE NO MONEY, IT WAS 

00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:10.088
$125 WE USED TO PLAY PARTIES.
SHE SAID SHE SAID WE'LL SPLIT 

00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:12.560
THE WHOLE MONEY.
WE USED TO MAKE PROBABLY 20 

00:24:12.762 --> 00:24:14.762
BUCKS.
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:16.840
ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED EVEN
WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD 

00:24:16.841 --> 00:24:19.889
TIME, WHEN I USED TO PERFORM 
WITH THE BAND EVERY WEEKEND, IT 

00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:25.021
WAS THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS, AND I 
KNEW AND THEN THE WHOLE THING, I

00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:28.285
SAID LET'S MAKE A RECORD.
WE STARTED RECORDING THE RECORD 

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.807
AND THE FIRST ONE WE RECORDED 
BECAME NUMBER ONE IN THE SPANISH

00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:35.856
MARKET.
ALL LATIN AMERICA AND THE UNITED

00:24:35.857 --> 00:24:40.813
STATES.
AND WE BECAME REALLY FAMOUS AND 

00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:45.335
THEN SONY CALLED, AND WE GOT 
A -- WE WAS INVOLVED WITH A 

00:24:48.449 --> 00:24:49.866
LOCAL LABEL, AND WE HAVE TO BUY 
THE RIGHTS FOR THE LOCAL LABEL.

00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:53.170
WE BOUGHT THE RIGHTS FOR THE 
PUBLISHING COMPANY AND FOR 

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.604
THE -- THEY LET US GO.
THEY SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:24:59.671 --> 00:25:00.486
YOU WANT TO GO ON?
HE'S GOT THE MONEY I PUT INTO 

00:25:00.487 --> 00:25:02.487
THE RECORD, I PAID.

00:25:07.216 --> 00:25:10.006
WE SIGNED THE DEAL WITH SONY, WE
DID CONGA AND IT WAS A BLESSING 

00:25:10.007 --> 00:25:13.681
IN THE WAY BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT.
DIFFICULT THAT'S WHAT I THINK, 

00:25:13.682 --> 00:25:17.820
NOWADAYS I WOULD HAVE SO MANY 
PROBLEMS WITH THE MUSIC BUSINESS

00:25:17.821 --> 00:25:21.102
BECAUSE THE DOWNLOADING, I SAID 
GUYS LISTEN, YOU'LL HAVE THE 

00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:24.631
INTERNET AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 
SHOW YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE NOW.

00:25:24.836 --> 00:25:28.119
DON'T LOSE THE MOMENT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO PLAY AT 

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.190
HOME, JUST GET YOUR TELEPHONE 
AND GET THEM TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE 

00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:32.611
DOING.
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOOD, PEOPLE 

00:25:32.612 --> 00:25:35.067
ARE GOING TO LIKE YOU.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS HAPPENING,

00:25:35.068 --> 00:25:37.781
LITTLE BY LITTLE BUT IT'S 
HAPPENING BUT IT'S BEEN A ROUGH 

00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:41.436
TIME FOR A LOT OF MUSICIANS AND 
THE REASON I ALWAYS SAY THAT IS 

00:25:41.437 --> 00:25:44.723
BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME 
AND GLORIA AND SOMETIMES WHEN I 

00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:49.620
SEE GLORIA IS NUMBER ONE, I SAY 
OH MY GOD, WHO COULD HAVE 

00:25:50.837 --> 00:25:53.081
BELIEVED WHEN WE STARTED, PEOPLE
SAID NO, NO, IT WILL NEVER 

00:25:55.551 --> 00:25:57.401
HAPPEN BUT WITH ME AND GLORY IT 
WAS OUR PERSISTENCE AND TRY TO 

00:25:57.402 --> 00:26:01.916
DO, YOU KNOW -- THE OTHER THING 
YOU DO WITH SONGS LIKE CONGA, 

00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:05.618
THEY WANT THE LABEL TO ONLY DO 
CONGA, THEY DON'T WANT TO CHANGE

00:26:05.619 --> 00:26:08.274
FOR A BALLAD.
I SAID WE WANT TO PLAY A BALLAD.

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:13.191
SO IT WAS HARD FOR US AT THE 
BEGINNING BECAUSE THEY SAID WE 

00:26:13.192 --> 00:26:16.877
DON'T WANT TO BACK YOU UP WITH 
CONGA AND YOU COME WITH A 

00:26:16.878 --> 00:26:18.703
BALLAD.
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT ANY 

00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:23.446
MONEY BECAUSE THEY SAY WHY THE 
BALLAD?

00:26:24.462 --> 00:26:26.462
DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY KNOW.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:29.623
DON'T LET ANYBODY CHANGE YOUR 
DESTINY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET 

00:26:29.624 --> 00:26:32.706
THEIR DESTINY CHANGED BECAUSE 
SOMEBODY CAN FORCE YOU TO DO 

00:26:32.707 --> 00:26:35.994
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.
&gt;&gt; NOW, THE FIRST KISS, THOUGH, 

00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:37.995
LET'S GET BACK TO YOU AND 
GLORIA.

00:26:40.522 --> 00:26:41.980
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU, SHE KNOWS 

00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:45.457
EVERYTHING.
SHE'S KEEPING ALL THE SECRETS 

00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:49.734
HERE.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE 

00:26:49.735 --> 00:26:52.803
SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE 
FIRST KISS.

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:55.025
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
I LIKE.

00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:57.459
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:27:03.043 --> 00:27:05.043
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST
SIGHT.

00:27:05.514 --> 00:27:07.988
LOVE HAS TO DO WITH SOMEBODY 
WHEN YOU BLAKE THE DECISION TO 

00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:10.873
SPEND YOUR LIFE, IT HAS TO BE 
SOMEBODY YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR 

00:27:10.874 --> 00:27:13.302
LIFE.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED OVER 40 YEARS 

00:27:13.303 --> 00:27:17.049
AND IT'S THE BEST MARRIAGE OF MY
LIFE.

00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:20.198
IT'S BEEN UNBELIEVABLE.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:23.025
&gt;&gt; 40 YEARS.
&gt;&gt; GLORIA USED TO RIDE WITH ME 

00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:26.064
IN THE BAND TO SET UP THE 
EQUIPMENT.

00:27:28.745 --> 00:27:30.745
YOU AND ME WE GET MARRIED WE BE 
REALLY GOOD.

00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:32.990
AND GLORIA LOOK AT ME AND SAY 
WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING 

00:27:32.991 --> 00:27:34.991
ABOUT?

00:27:36.493 --> 00:27:38.724
SO IT WAS JULY 4, 1976 AND WAS 
ALL THE FIREWORKS.

00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.496
AND I TOLD GLORIA, GLORIA, THE 
4th IS MY BIRTHDAY.

00:27:46.938 --> 00:27:48.780
SHE SAID OH, MY GOD, JULY 4th?
YES.

00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:50.238
WILL YOU GIVE ME A KISS?
WELL, NO, I GIVE YOU A PRESENT.

00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:53.103
NO, NO, GIVE ME A KISS, BABY, 
COME ON.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120
JUST A KISS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:27:57.183 --> 00:27:59.183
I SAID OKAY, GIVE ME A PRESENT.
BUT GIVE ME A KISS NOW.

00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:02.058
SO THE FIREWORKS IS GOING, THE 
WHOLE THING.

00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:04.951
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR BIRTHDAY.
&gt;&gt; NO, I TOLD HER WHEN SHE GAVE 

00:28:04.952 --> 00:28:08.040
ME THE KISS I SAID IT'S THE 
4th OF MARCH.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.171
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT IT WORKED.

00:28:12.238 --> 00:28:14.238
IT WORKED.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LIE A 

00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:18.374
LITTLE BIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:20.579
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:28:21.847 --> 00:28:26.548
&gt;&gt; I'M FRAY AID WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE PAGE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:28.784
SAY NOW.
&gt;&gt; 40 SOMETHING ELSE.

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:31.599
&gt;&gt; 40 YEARS.
&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 26, FOCUS WHEN 

00:28:33.268 --> 00:28:34.484
DISASTER STRIKES, THAT WAS A 
HARD TIME.

00:28:34.485 --> 00:28:36.485
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:40.188
WE WORKED SO HARD AND A LOT OF 
DREAMS AND WE WAS ENJOYING LIFE 

00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:44.457
AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE 
ACCIDENT, THEY TOLD ME THAT 

00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:49.071
GLORIA PROBABLY WOULD NEVER WALK
AGAIN.

00:28:49.103 --> 00:28:51.103
SHE WAS -- SHE BROKE HER BACK.

00:28:52.393 --> 00:28:54.393
AND I SAID, AND THAT'S WHAT WE 
CALL A PLAY ON YOUR FEELINGS.

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.939
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE RICH 
AND FAMOUS.

00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:00.686
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR 
LIFE, YOU HAVE TO GET ON YOUR 

00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:02.687
FEET WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A 
DIFFICULT TIME.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.780
EVERYBODY GOES THROUGH DIFFICULT
TIMES.

00:29:07.105 --> 00:29:09.105
MAYBE SOMEBODY IS SICK, SOMEBODY
DIES.

00:29:09.363 --> 00:29:11.363
YOU HAVE TO LAND ON YOUR FEET.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:29:15.093 --> 00:29:16.524
I WAS LOOKING AT A PICTURE, 
DOING THE PACKAGES FOR THE 

00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:18.525
TELECAST.
THE DAY THAT THE ACCIDENT 

00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:23.451
HAPPENED, I WAS THOROUGHLY BLACK
HAIR.

00:29:24.334 --> 00:29:26.334
THREE MONTHS LATER I WAS TOTALLY
WHITE.

00:29:27.798 --> 00:29:29.746
I BECAME TOTALLY GRAY, BECAUSE I
SAID IT WAS SO DIFFICULT FOR US 

00:29:29.747 --> 00:29:31.747
AND SHE WAS SO DETERMINED TO GO 
BACK.

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:36.494
SAY, I WANT TO INSPIRE PEOPLE.
IF YOU'RE OKAY AND MY BABY IS 

00:29:36.495 --> 00:29:39.367
OKAY, I'LL BE OKAY AND IT WAS 
REALLY TOUGH.

00:29:41.044 --> 00:29:42.666
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
ONE YEAR LATER SHE WAS ON THE 

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:47.144
STAGE AND SHE WAS GOING ON A 
WORLD TOUR AND IT WAS A BLESSING

00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:50.752
OF BEING PERSISTENT.
GLORIA IS A VERY POSITIVE 

00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:54.367
PERSON, AND I ALWAYS RESPECTED 
HER AND ADMIRE HER.

00:29:55.033 --> 00:29:56.895
I THINK I ADMIRE HER MORE 
BECAUSE SHE WAS A ROLE MODEL FOR

00:29:56.896 --> 00:30:00.976
ME WHEN THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE 
SHE BECAME SO STRONG BECAUSE OF 

00:30:00.977 --> 00:30:02.977
THE KID AND THE FAMILY.

00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.302
SHE KNEW HOW HARD IT WAS TO SEE 
A PERSON IN A WHEELCHAIR BECAUSE

00:30:06.303 --> 00:30:09.569
SHE DEAL WITH HER FATHER IN THAT
SITUATION.

00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:12.586
SO AFTER THAT, YOU KNOW 
SOMETHING?

00:30:13.303 --> 00:30:15.144
I LOVE LIFE AND I EVEN LOVE LIFE
MORE BECAUSE I REALIZE HOW LUCKY

00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:18.415
WE ARE AND I ALWAYS THANK PEOPLE
THAT PRAY FOR US SO MUCH AND 

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:22.923
GIVE US THE SUPPORT SO THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT AT THAT 

00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:24.924
TIME IN OUR LIFE.

00:30:27.964 --> 00:30:32.568
&gt;&gt; AND IN TERMS OF RESPECT OF 
THAT MIAMI SOUND, WHEN YOU WERE 

00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:36.553
TOLD, THIS WILL NEVER WORK AND 
EVERYTHING, YOU PERSISTED.

00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:40.571
YOU WENT AHEAD AND THEN YOU 
STARTED PRODUCING.

00:30:42.103 --> 00:30:44.103
WHO ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND 

00:30:46.063 --> 00:30:48.063
THE GROUPS THAT YOU WORKED WITH 
THAT'S LEGENDARY?

00:30:52.403 --> 00:30:54.484
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST ONE WAS JOHN SECATA
BUT THEN JENNIFER LOPEZ WHEN SHE

00:30:59.709 --> 00:31:01.709
CAME TO ME, MARK ANTHONY, 

00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:04.947
SHAKIRA, RICKY MARINATE, IT WAS 

00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:08.441
A BLESSING IN A -- RICKY MARTIN.
IT WAS A BLESSING.

00:31:09.472 --> 00:31:11.068
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE A
SOUND THEY DON'T WANT TO SHARE 

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.556
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, WE GOT LUCKY
AND I ALWAYS BELIEVE IN KARMA.

00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:17.551
WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU GIVE, 

00:31:20.768 --> 00:31:23.044
AND HELPING THEM NOT ONLY WAS A 
GREAT MOVE FOR MY CAREER, IT WAS

00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:25.045
A GREAT BLESSING TO OUR CULTURE 

00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:30.041
AND TO KEEP OPENING THE DOOR FOR
A LOT OF KIDS.

00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.534
A LOT OF KID HAVE COME TO THIS 
COUNTRY THAT THEY COME WITH 

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.918
DREAMS.
AND THEY SEE SOMEBODY ELSE DOING

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.593
IT.
TONIGHT THIS AWARD WE'RE 

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.075
GETTING, I HOPE LIKE I SAID, IT 
CAN TOUCH MANY PEOPLE'S LIFE, 

00:31:43.076 --> 00:31:45.076
AND MANY KIDS AND PEOPLE, AND 

00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:50.631
WHEN I SAY IT, I MEAN NOT 
LATINOS, MINORITIES.

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:53.125
I SAY THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:56.424
SAW THE GRAMMYS.
I SAID I'M GOING TO SAVE MONEY 

00:31:56.425 --> 00:32:00.358
ONE DAY TO GO TO THE GRAMMYS.
THAT MR. MY DREAM.

00:32:03.017 --> 00:32:04.668
8 YEARS LATER I WAS ON THE FIRST
ROW COMPETING AGAINST QUINCY 

00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:06.669
JONES.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT.

00:32:08.188 --> 00:32:10.188
I'VE BEEN THERE ALMOST 42 TIMES.
WHO COULD HAVE SAID THAT?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.323
AND THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:32:16.328 --> 00:32:21.911
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; CINDY LAUPER AND PATTY 

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.130
LABELLE.
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY IS COMING.

00:32:25.775 --> 00:32:28.639
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
&gt;&gt; AND JUST, IT EXPANDS AND IT'S

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.952
UNIVERSAL.
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

00:32:31.976 --> 00:32:33.976
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
THAT SHOW REPRESENTS US.

00:32:37.592 --> 00:32:39.592
PATTY LABELLE, CINDY LAUPER, 
JOSÉ F.

00:32:42.101 --> 00:32:44.101
LICIANO MIKES DAUGHTER IS GOING 
TO PERFORM.

00:32:45.372 --> 00:32:47.372
I'M THE BIGGEST FAN OF MY 
DAUGHTER.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.061
GLORIA IS GOING TO SING.
I'M GOING TO PLAY CONGAS.

00:32:51.281 --> 00:32:52.920
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE WONDERFUL.
ONE THING THAT COMES THANK YOU 

00:32:52.921 --> 00:32:57.055
IN YOUR BOOK, EACH CHAPTER IS 
ABOUT A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF 

00:32:58.722 --> 00:33:00.761
BUSINESS AND LIFE.
PEOPLE SOMETIMES DON'T REALIZE 

00:33:00.762 --> 00:33:04.050
WHAT A PRODUCER DOES.
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A 

00:33:05.275 --> 00:33:08.146
LITTLE BIT --
&gt;&gt; PRODUCER IS LIKE A COACH.

00:33:15.071 --> 00:33:17.796
A COACH IN A, WHEN YOU SEE A 
FOOTBALL, AND THEY'RE TELLING 

00:33:17.797 --> 00:33:21.525
ALL THIS, A PRODUCER IS IN 
CHARGE FROM BEGINNING TO END.

00:33:21.727 --> 00:33:25.577
PICK UP THE SONGS, WHAT KEY IT'S
GOING TO BE.

00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:28.817
MANAGE THE BUDGET, WHAT TEMPO IS
GOING TO BE.

00:33:30.143 --> 00:33:34.156
SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS.
ALL THE THINGS FOR THE UNIONS, 

00:33:34.157 --> 00:33:37.644
YOU KNOW, GET EVERYTHING READY 
AND THEN MAKES THE WHOLE ALBUM, 

00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:40.901
GET IT READY.
SO IT TAKES IT FROM BEGINNING TO

00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:42.902
END.
LIKE WHEN YOU PRODUCE A MOVIE.

00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:45.571
I WORK ON A LOT OF MOVIES.

00:33:50.226 --> 00:33:52.226
I WORKED, I DID A SONG FOR THREE
MEN AND A BABY.

00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:57.331
POCAHONTAS.

00:33:59.854 --> 00:34:01.682
A MUSIC PRODUCER THEY GIVE ME 
ONLY THE IMAGES WITHOUT MUSIC SO

00:34:01.683 --> 00:34:07.028
I HAVE TO CREATE MOST OF THE 
MUSIC, THE MUSIC FOR THE MOVIE.

00:34:07.649 --> 00:34:09.649
SO THAT'S WHAT THE PRODUCER 
DOES.

00:34:11.577 --> 00:34:14.447
TRYING TO FIND A UNIQUE SOUND.
WHEN I PRODUCED RICKY MARTIN 

00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:21.241
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SHAKIRA, OR 
NOBODY HAS THE SOUND OF GLORIA'S

00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:24.310
SOUND.
TO ME I WAS LOOKING OUT BECAUSE 

00:34:27.923 --> 00:34:29.923
I PRODUCE ALL THESE PEOPLE, 

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:34.829
CARLOS BIBE, CASTRO, ALEJANDRO 

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:38.116
FERNANDEZ, SOME OTHERS FROM 

00:34:39.275 --> 00:34:41.338
BRAZIL, I LOVE WHEN A PRODUCER 
DOES DIFFERENT MUSIC BECAUSE 

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:46.807
WHAT PEOPLE NEVER KNOW, I NEVER 
GOT STUDIED MUSIC.

00:34:48.862 --> 00:34:50.567
EVERYTHING I GOT MUSIC IT'S 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN MUSIC 

00:34:50.568 --> 00:34:53.223
AND TO WRITE MUSIC AND TO 
PRODUCE AND EVERYTHING BUT I 

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:55.698
NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THAT.
THAT'S WHAT I TELL PEOPLE, 

00:34:57.143 --> 00:34:58.993
SCHOOL IS A GREAT THING TO 
HAPPEN, LIKE I TELL MAY DAUGHTER

00:34:58.994 --> 00:35:02.097
SHE WENT TO BERKELEY BUT THAT'S 
NOT THE MAIN THING.

00:35:03.338 --> 00:35:05.077
IT'S ABOUT THE PASSION YOU HAVE 
TO DO THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING 

00:35:05.078 --> 00:35:07.789
TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU 
REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:11.666
IN A WAY I WAS SO LUCKY THAT I 
WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT.

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:13.667
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED YOU DETERMINE 

00:35:17.175 --> 00:35:19.175
THE KEY THAT AN EARTHIST SINGS 
IN?

00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:24.142
HOW DOES -- ARTIST SINGS IN?
&gt;&gt; FERNANDEZ FROM MEXICO HE HAD 

00:35:24.143 --> 00:35:27.432
A BEAUTIFUL VOICE BUT THE KEY 
WAS REALLY LOW.

00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:30.466
HE SOUNDED TOO DEEP.
THEN I CHANGED THE KEY TO A 

00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:33.341
BRIGHTER KEY AND THE SONG 
BECOMES MORE PRESENT.

00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:37.555
THAT'S WHAT A PRODUCER, WHO 
PRODUCES, OVERALL NOW, BEING A 

00:35:37.556 --> 00:35:41.457
PRODUCER I MANAGED SHAKIRA FOR 
11 YEARS.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.090
I WORKED WITH GLORIA.

00:35:46.764 --> 00:35:48.201
I MANAGED JOHN SECATA FOR 20 
YEARS.

00:35:48.202 --> 00:35:49.855
HE'S LIKE MY BROTHER.
IT'S NOT ONLY WHEN YOU FINISH AN

00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:52.956
ALBUM, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
ORGANIZE?

00:35:54.797 --> 00:35:56.797
WHEN I STARTED DOING MUSIC THERE
WAS NO INTERNET.

00:35:59.554 --> 00:36:01.554
HOW ARE WE ABLE TO PROMOTE 
WORLDWIDE MUSIC?

00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:05.470
WITH GLORIA SOMETIMES WE USED TO
HAVE BREAKFAST IN PARIS, LUNCH 

00:36:05.471 --> 00:36:10.243
IN ITALY AND SLEEP IN GERMANY.
YOU ONLY HAVE A MONTH TO PROMOTE

00:36:10.244 --> 00:36:13.912
AN ALBUM WORLDWIDE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RECORDED IN

00:36:13.913 --> 00:36:16.997
4 OR 5 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.
YOU HAVE TO HIT DIFFERENT 

00:36:18.616 --> 00:36:20.616
MARKETS, THE SPANISH MARKET, THE
ENGLISH MARKET AND IN THE 

00:36:22.157 --> 00:36:24.157
SPANISH MARKET WE HAVE CROSS-
CROSS-OVER.

00:36:26.098 --> 00:36:28.098
DOMINICAN USIC IS DIFFERENT FROM
SALSA.

00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:31.270
BRAZILIAN MUSIC IS DIFFERENT SO 
WE WAS PROBABLY AS A PRODUCER 

00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:36.183
WAS ONE OF THE FEW FIRST 
PRODUCERS TO DO A SONG THAT 

00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:40.541
TRANSLATE TO EVERY SINGLE LATIN 
MARKET, BEFORE I WAS A PRODUCER 

00:36:40.542 --> 00:36:44.637
YOU HAD TO DO THE MEXICAN 
VERSION, THE PUERTO RICAN 

00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:48.679
VERSION, AND IT'S LIKE ANOTHER 
ALBUM.

00:36:49.118 --> 00:36:51.216
I MIX A LOT OF THINGS.
I THINK LIKE I WAS SAYING AT THE

00:36:51.217 --> 00:36:54.519
BEGINNING, WHEN YOU HAVE 
DIFFERENT CULTURES, YOU LEARN SO

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.221
MUCH FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND 
PEOPLE, MUSIC HAS NO LANGUAGE.

00:36:58.222 --> 00:37:01.709
IT'S ABOUT THE ENERGY YOU PUT 
INTO THE RECORD, THE MESSAGE YOU

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:05.585
WANT TO SEND.
AND I REMEMBER WHEN I DID A SONG

00:37:08.912 --> 00:37:11.596
IN SPANISH AND I IN THE MIDDLE 
PUT BLACKEYED PEA, IT WAS SUCH 

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:18.326
AN INCREDIBLE FEEL BECAUSE I 
BROUGHT PEOPLE, PEOPLE LISTEN TO

00:37:18.327 --> 00:37:23.898
DIFFERENT, SOMEBODY WHO I ADORE 
AND RESPECT.

00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:27.773
HERE WAS THE FLAVOR OF MIAMI AND
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:37:28.588 --> 00:37:30.435
MOTOWN HAS A FLAVOR.
MIAMI HAS THEIR OWN FLAVOR AND 

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:32.682
THAT GOES WORLDWIDE AND THAT'S A
BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:37:33.905 --> 00:37:35.905
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST 

00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:39.192
TIME YOU HEARD YOUR FIRST SONG 
ON THE RADIO?

00:37:39.228 --> 00:37:41.464
&gt;&gt; IN THE RADIO?
I STOP THE CAR, I STILL COULDN'T

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:43.729
BELIEVE THAT.
OH, MY GOD, GLORIA, WE'RE ON THE

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.730
RADIO.
WE'RE ON THE RADIO!

00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:49.516
YOU KNOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT'S
STILL NOW WHEN I DO A SONG I WAS

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.472
LUCKY ENOUGH, I JUST HAD A GROUP
FROM ITALY THAT WAS THREE TENORS

00:37:55.473 --> 00:38:00.046
AND THEY WENT TO NUMBER 3 ON THE
CHARTS AND IT WAS -- WHEN I 

00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:03.427
HEARD THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE SONG ON THE RADIO, NOW AFTER

00:38:03.428 --> 00:38:06.284
SO MANY YEARS, I STILL HAVE THE 
SAME FEELING.

00:38:08.355 --> 00:38:10.068
I ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW 
SOMETHING, I ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE

00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:12.955
MUSIC, IT'S LIKE MY FIRST ALBUM 
WHEN I DID IT OR THE LAST ONE 

00:38:12.956 --> 00:38:16.239
I'M GOING TO DO BECAUSE I FEEL 
IF YOU LOSE THAT ENERGY, IT 

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.460
DOESN'T COME THROUGH THE WAY IT 
SHOULD BE.

00:38:20.536 --> 00:38:21.963
&gt;&gt; SO YOU STILL FEEL THE TINGLE 
OR THE EXCITEMENT.

00:38:21.964 --> 00:38:24.100
&gt;&gt; FOR SURE.
EVEN WHEN I BUY A TIE, I TOLD 

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:29.021
YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:38:31.672 --> 00:38:33.295
&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO THOUGH HAVE BEEN 
DOING THINGS IN PHILANTHROPY AND

00:38:33.296 --> 00:38:35.296
HUMAN RIGHTS, TOO.
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:38:36.296 --> 00:38:38.296
&gt;&gt; SO COULD YOU TELL A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT THAT.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.669
&gt;&gt; WHEN I COME TO THIS COUNTRY, 
I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT 

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.396
WE HAVE TO GIVE BACK, HOW LUCKY 
WE ARE THAT WE LIVE IN THIS 

00:38:45.025 --> 00:38:46.279
COUNTRY, THAT GIVE US 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LIVING, TO

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.583
BE FREE AND IN THE END GLORIA WE
COMMIT OURSELVES, WE DO A LOT OF

00:38:50.584 --> 00:38:53.747
CHARITY, A LOT OF THINGS AND 
EVERY TIME THERE'S A PROBLEM 

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:57.431
WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND THINGS, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO SEND A MESSAGE TO 

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:01.950
PEOPLE, AND ESPECIALLY THINGS 
HAPPEN LIKE IN VENEZUELA AND 

00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:04.558
CUBA THAT WE STILL HAVE HUMAN 
RIGHTS PROBLEM.

00:39:05.766 --> 00:39:07.766
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 

00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.899
PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU SEE
EVERY TIME THIS KIND OF THING 

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.194
HAPPENED, THEY DON'T HAVE 
FREEDOM, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:39:14.402 --> 00:39:17.901
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA 
NOW IS A HORRIBLE THING.

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.123
YOU SEE KIDS DYING AND PEOPLE 
DYING OF HUNGER.

00:39:23.095 --> 00:39:24.938
WHAT HAPPENED TO CUBA IS STILL 
HAPPENING IN CUBA IS A MAJOR 

00:39:28.104 --> 00:39:30.071
PROBLEM AND WE -- I HOPE BEFORE 
I LEAVE THIS COUNTRY, AND THIS 

00:39:30.072 --> 00:39:33.555
WORLD, I HOPE THAT I SEE A WORLD
WITH FREEDOM IN EVERY PLACE IN 

00:39:33.556 --> 00:39:37.669
THE WORLD BECAUSE OH AND PEACE 
BECAUSE WE GO TO THE MOON AND WE

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.174
DON'T REALIZE WE HAVE TO FIX 
WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.378
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:52.075
&gt;&gt; I REALLY WANT TO HEAR MORE 
ABOUT THAT --

00:39:52.122 --> 00:39:55.598
&gt;&gt; SHE CLOSED THE BOOK.
&gt;&gt; OH, NO, BECAUSE YOU ENDED UP 

00:39:55.599 --> 00:40:00.701
WITH GETTING FIRED, WHEN YOU'RE 
HERE WITH SO -- AND LOOKING INTO

00:40:00.702 --> 00:40:03.153
THE FUTURE.
IN TERMS OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS 

00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:05.230
AND JUST WHAT YOU THINK, WHAT DO
YOU SEE?

00:40:07.107 --> 00:40:09.107
YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE INTERNET AND --

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.196
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LOT OF THINGS 
HAPPENING.

00:40:12.197 --> 00:40:14.197
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO BE 
ORGANIZED.

00:40:16.395 --> 00:40:18.395
WHATEVER YOU DO NOW IS EXTREMELY
-- I THINK BEING 

00:40:18.455 --> 00:40:20.292
ORGANIZED HELP YOU A LOT.
MAKING PLANS, ANYTHING, I THINK 

00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:23.776
A LOT OF PEOPLE BECOME 
SUCCESSFUL AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 

00:40:23.777 --> 00:40:28.681
THEY DON'T BECOME SUCCESSFUL 
BECAUSE THEY DO THINGS IN A 

00:40:29.553 --> 00:40:31.710
HURRY.
EVEN GETTING MARRIED, DON'T GET 

00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:33.711
MARRIED IN A HURRY.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

00:40:35.209 --> 00:40:37.064
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GET MARRIED
BE SURE YOU TELL YOUR WIFE YES 

00:40:37.065 --> 00:40:40.169
TO EVERYTHING SHE TELLS YOU, 
THEN YOU'LL BE MARRIED FOR 41 

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.019
YEARS.
IT'S A LOT OF GREAT THINGS 

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.020
HAPPENING.
THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS GOING 

00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:47.285
THROUGH A REALLY ROUGH TIME 
BECAUSE OF THE DOWNLOADING 

00:40:47.566 --> 00:40:49.251
SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DON'T PAY 
AND I WAS TALKING TO SOME OF 

00:40:49.252 --> 00:40:51.252
YOUR PEOPLE, BY THE WAY 
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:40:52.322 --> 00:40:54.553
YOU HAVE ONE OF THE MORE 
BEAUTIFUL STAFF.

00:40:56.283 --> 00:40:58.283
HOW MUCH RESPECT THEY HAVE FOR 
YOU.

00:40:58.325 --> 00:41:00.091
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH 
THE RECORD BUSINESS AFFECTED NOT

00:41:00.092 --> 00:41:03.915
ONLY THE MUSICIANS, IT'S 
AFFECTED PEOPLE WHO CLEAN THE 

00:41:03.916 --> 00:41:08.311
STUDIO, THE PEOPLE, THE 
ENGINEERS, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

00:41:11.828 --> 00:41:13.050
DISTRIBUTION, THE PEOPLE WHO 
STOCK THINGS IN THE WAREHOUSE TO

00:41:13.051 --> 00:41:16.096
SELL THE RECORDS, IT'S REALLY 
AFFECTED A LOT OF PEOPLE SO I 

00:41:16.097 --> 00:41:18.097
HOPE THEY FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN

00:41:21.154 --> 00:41:22.622
KEEP MAKING LIFE MUSIC.
MUSIC IS SOMETHING THAT BRINGS A

00:41:22.623 --> 00:41:24.623
LOT OF JOY TO THE WORLD AND I 

00:41:27.566 --> 00:41:29.804
HOPE WE FIND A WAY GO ABLE TO --
WE JUST GOT IN BIG LITIGATION 

00:41:29.805 --> 00:41:33.558
THAT THINGS A LOT OF US THAT 
WORKED ON THAT IN THE PAST TO 

00:41:33.559 --> 00:41:36.808
BE ABLE TO WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD 
SOMETHING AT LEAST THEY GET PAID

00:41:36.809 --> 00:41:40.323
A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE A LIVING 
BUT I THINK SOMETHING, I ALWAYS 

00:41:40.324 --> 00:41:42.757
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.
I THINK THE COMPUTER IS GOING TO

00:41:42.758 --> 00:41:46.078
BE FANTASTIC.
THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO MUSIC.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.159
NOWADAYS WITH THE PHONE YOU CAN 
MAKE YOUR OWN VIDEO.

00:41:51.003 --> 00:41:53.003
YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE, LIKE, A 
MILLION DOLLAR VIDEO.

00:41:54.288 --> 00:41:56.318
YOU MAKE A VIDEO THAT IS 
SINCERE, CREATE YOUR OWN SOUND, 

00:41:56.319 --> 00:42:01.028
CREATE A SONG THAT'S VERY UNIQUE
THAT NOBODY'S DONE BEFORE.

00:42:02.678 --> 00:42:04.678
DON'T TRY TO COPY ANYBODY WHEN 
YOU DO NEWSIC.

00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:07.543
DO SOMETHING THAT IS YOU AND IT 
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:11.096
YOU'RE AFRICAN DO AFRICAN MUSIC,
IF YOU'RE FRENCH, DO FRENCH BUT 

00:42:11.097 --> 00:42:13.399
JUST BE REAL.
THAT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED MANY,

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.517
MANY YEARS AGO.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE YOURSELF.

00:42:17.716 --> 00:42:20.589
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE ARE GOING TO 

00:42:23.255 --> 00:42:25.255
ACTUALLY OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT
FOR QUESTION AND ANSWER.

00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:28.633
&gt;&gt; YOU TOLD ME TO SPEAK SPANISH.
[ SPEAKING SPANISH ]

00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:34.141
AND I SAID -- YES, BECAUSE THIS 

00:42:36.339 --> 00:42:38.339
IS BEING LIVESTREAMED WORLDWIDE.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:42:39.588 --> 00:42:41.837
SO PLEASE --
&gt;&gt; WHEN I SAW HER, I LOVE WHEN I

00:42:41.838 --> 00:42:44.908
DO THIS THING.
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS, THAT 

00:42:45.718 --> 00:42:47.718
SOMETIMES THEY WANT TO ASK ME.

00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:52.067
YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF QUESTION IF
YOU DON'T MIND I WOULD LIKE TO 

00:42:52.068 --> 00:42:54.314
SEE ANYBODY WHO HAS A QUESTION, 
I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER YOU.

00:42:55.546 --> 00:42:57.578
&gt;&gt; AND SO WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT
UP A LITTLE BIT.

00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:02.490

BEEN THROUGH A LOT THESE PAST 

00:52:56.565 --> 00:52:59.704

FIRST WE WERE CALLED RAPISTS, WE

THIS CONTROVERSY OVER THE WALL?

00:53:10.238 --> 00:53:14.341
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I'M 
SORRY, IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD

IMMIGRATION?

SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS MEETING --

00:53:21.086 --> 00:53:24.372

PRODUCE FIVE DIFFERENT

REPUBLICAN.

EVERY PRESIDENT HAS GOOD THINGS 
AND BAD THINGS.

00:53:30.504 --> 00:53:32.139
I THINK IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE 
LEGAL BECAUSE WE GO THROUGH A 

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:36.236
LOT OF ROUGH TIMES AND EVERY 
COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE LEGALIZED 

00:53:36.237 --> 00:53:38.973

LIKE HE SAID, SOMETIMES PEOPLE 

00:53:43.244 --> 00:53:47.059
DON'T REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES 
PEOPLE DON'T COME TO THIS

BETTER LIFE, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

TO SAVE THEM.

00:56:28.747 --> 00:56:30.564
WINNER, PRODUCER AND WRITER.
HE'S GOING TO BE IN OUR SHOW.

00:56:30.565 --> 00:56:33.640
THE REASON I WANT HIM TO BE IN 
OUR SHOW BECAUSE I THINK 

00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:38.341
SOMETIMES HAVING A STORY LIKE ME

00:56:39.414 --> 00:56:42.304
AND GLORIA, THE STORY ABOUT 
RICKY MARTIN AND SHAKIRA AND 

00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:46.002
YOUNG MARCO IS FROM PERU.
MAKES ME HAPPY THEY BECAME 

00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:49.132
SUCCESSFUL.
BE WHO YOU ARE.

00:56:52.021 --> 00:56:54.316
DON'T TRY TO MAKE SUSHI.
TRY TO MAKE PERUVIAN FOOD.

00:56:55.323 --> 00:56:57.323
WE HAVE RESTAURANTS THAT 
SOMETIMES I SAY WHY DO YOU 

00:56:58.446 --> 00:57:01.511
MAKE -- I SAY WE'RE CUBAN.
HAS TO BE RICE AND BEANS.

00:57:03.005 --> 00:57:05.005
THAT'S WHO WE ARE AND I THINK 
WE'RE LUCKY WITH THAT.

00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:08.281
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST A 
COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS.

00:57:08.928 --> 00:57:11.567
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?
I FEEL LIKE I DO THE WHOLE THING

00:57:11.568 --> 00:57:13.620
ON TV WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT.

00:57:14.247 --> 00:57:16.284
[ LAUGHTER ]
I NEVER WANT TO GET INTO 

00:57:16.708 --> 00:57:18.760
POLITICS.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE 

00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:21.549
OUR LAST QUESTION RIGHT OVER 
HERE.

00:57:21.748 --> 00:57:23.748
&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT IN HERE.

00:57:27.303 --> 00:57:30.190
&gt;&gt; EMILIO -- 
[ SPEAKING SPANISH ]

00:57:33.296 --> 00:57:36.179
I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE VERY 
BRIEF.

00:57:38.641 --> 00:57:40.641
[ SPEAKING SPANISH ]

00:58:02.655 --> 00:58:04.655
I'LL JUST SAY IT IN ENGLISH FOR 
EVERYONE.

00:58:06.786 --> 00:58:08.786
AS LATIN AND KNOWING HOW HARD 

00:58:10.595 --> 00:58:12.595
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND US HERE AND 
BEYOND, THEY WORK FOR THE 

00:58:13.197 --> 00:58:15.238
AMERICAN DREAM AND THEN LIVING 
IN MIAMI, KNOWING ABOUT CLIMATE 

00:58:15.239 --> 00:58:19.352
CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT, MY 
HARDEST PART AS AN ACTIVIST FOR 

00:58:19.353 --> 00:58:21.353
THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT IS 

00:58:25.048 --> 00:58:27.048
HOW TO TELL MY PEOPLE TO NOT -- 

00:58:28.314 --> 00:58:30.314
TO LOOK FOR A SMILE AND TRY TO 
LIVE GREEN WHEN THEY ALWAYS 

00:58:30.574 --> 00:58:32.574
THOUGHT THE AMERICAN DREAM WOULD
BE HERE AND MORE.

00:58:36.716 --> 00:58:38.716
SO RECONCILING THOSE HAS BEEN 
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE.

00:58:39.209 --> 00:58:40.844
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SPEAK 
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT OR PUT 

00:58:40.845 --> 00:58:44.976
IT IN YOUR HEART AND YOUR MIND 
TRYING TO CREATE SOME MUSIC TO 

00:58:44.977 --> 00:58:49.047
SPEAK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS
OF OUR ERA RIGHT NOW.

00:58:52.045 --> 00:58:54.045
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE ENVIRONMENT, YOU 

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.249
HAVE TO KNOW THAT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING, WE HAVE TO MOVE INTO 

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.906
THAT.
WE NEED TO MOVE AND PUT SOME 

00:59:00.907 --> 00:59:03.800
MONEY, WE NEED TO PAY MORE 
ATTENTION TO THAT.

00:59:05.429 --> 00:59:07.064
OTHERWISE THE NEXT GENERATION 
WILL PAY A BIG PRICE AND THE WAY

00:59:07.065 --> 00:59:10.112
TO DO IT IS CREATE 
CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SHOW PEOPLE 

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:13.548
HOW IF WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION, 
HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GOING TO BE.

00:59:13.736 --> 00:59:18.447
AS A LATINA LIVING IN MIAMI AND 
NO MONEY, FOR ME IT WAS SO HARD 

00:59:18.448 --> 00:59:20.448
BECAUSE I WISH I COULD HAVE 
STUDIED.

00:59:22.315 --> 00:59:24.580
I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.
OR LEARN MUSIC, OF BRINGING MY 

00:59:24.581 --> 00:59:28.242
MOM FROM CUBA THAT I SPENT 11 
YEARS WITHOUT SEEING HER AND 

00:59:28.243 --> 00:59:32.087
BRING MAY BROTHER SO YOU HAVE TO
HAVE A BALANCE.

00:59:34.348 --> 00:59:35.990
WE USED TO BE, MY 14 KIDS WITH 
MY GRANDMOTHER SLEEPING IN A 

00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:38.451
ROOM AND I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY 
THAT.

00:59:40.286 --> 00:59:42.286
I'M ASHAMED I PLAYED THE 

00:59:43.796 --> 00:59:45.268
ACCORDION FOR TIPS IN AN ITALIAN
RESTAURANT THAT DIDN'T FEED ME.

00:59:45.269 --> 00:59:49.262
I USED TO GET $5 AND BUY A 
SANDWICH.

00:59:50.679 --> 00:59:53.130
I THINK THAT TEACHES ME TO BE 
REAL AND TO APPRECIATE LIFE, AND

00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:57.108
TO GIVE HOPE TO SOMEBODY WHO 
APPRECIATE AND BOUGHT A RECORD 

00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:59.520
FROM ME 30 YEARS AGO, I NEVER 
WANT TO LOSE THAT.

01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:03.161
BUT LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO BE 
PERSISTENT.

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:06.475
PERSISTENT AND YOU HAVE TO PLAN 
THINGS.

01:00:07.576 --> 01:00:10.229
THE BEST WAY THAT I WILL SAY WE 
CAN SHOW THE WORLD LATINOS AND 

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.897
IMMIGRANTS AND NOT ONLY LATINOS 
IS GIVING BACK.

01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:16.958
GIVING BACK.
EVERY TIME WE RECEIVE AN AWARD 

01:00:20.636 --> 01:00:21.863
LIKE THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM OR THE
WEB GIN AWARD WHICH I WANT TO 

01:00:21.864 --> 01:00:25.552
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT'S NOT 
ABOUT GETTING THAT AWARD FOR ME 

01:00:25.553 --> 01:00:29.285
AND GLORIA, IT'S ABOUT GETTING 
THAT AWARD FOR MANY PEOPLE.

01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:33.348
MANY PEOPLE GET INSPIRED THAT WE
DID IT THEY CAN DO IT.

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.231
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO 
GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT EATING.

01:00:37.705 --> 01:00:40.575
HOW DIFFICULT THE IT WAS NOT 
BEING ABLE TO GO TO A MOVIE 

01:00:43.053 --> 01:00:45.053
THEATER, TO SAVE THE $3 TO BRING
MY MOM FROM CUBA.

01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:46.929
LIFE WAS GOOD TO US.
WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE GOOD TO 

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.394
LIFE.
AND WE ALWAYS I HOPE ME AND 

01:00:51.846 --> 01:00:53.297
GLORIA WILL BE A ROLE MODEL TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE 

01:00:53.298 --> 01:00:56.561
AND TO SAY I ALWAYS SAID THAT 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

01:00:58.433 --> 01:01:00.433
THAT WE LIVE IN THE BEST COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.960
I ALWAYS SOMETIMES WHEN I DO 
THESE THINGS AND EVERY NIGHT I 

01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:05.635
SAY GOD BLESS AMERICA.
WE LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:09.299
I'M NEVER GOING TO LOSE PEOPLE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT 

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.553
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, I CAN 
TELL YOU THAT.

01:01:12.785 --> 01:01:14.785
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.618
&gt;&gt; I MUST TELL YOU, WELL, IT'S 
NOT -- YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY 

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:30.936
SOMETIMES THE MOVIE IS AS GOOD 
AS THE BOOK, YOU ARE BETTER THAN

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.937
THE BOOK.

COMMERCIAL.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.696
