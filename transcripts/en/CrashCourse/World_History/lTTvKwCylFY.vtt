00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.799
Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.970
talk about The French Revolution. Admittedly,
this wasn’t the French flag until 1794,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.280
but we just felt like he looked good in stripes.
As does this guy. Huh?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.740
So, while the American Revolution is considered
a pretty good thing, the French Revolution

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.999
is often seen as a bloody, anarchic mess,
which...

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.929
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I bet, like always,
it’s way more complicated than that.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.619
Actually no. It was pretty terrible. Also,
like a lot of revolutions, in the end it exchanged

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.070
an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian
regime. But even if the revolution was a mess,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
its ideas changed human history - far more,
I will argue, than the American Revolution.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.540
[theme music]

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.800
Right, so France in the 18th century was a
rich and populous country, but it had a systemic

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.059
problem collecting taxes because of the way
its society was structured. They had a system

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.760
with kings and nobles we now call the Ancien
Régime. Thank you, three years of high school French.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.820
And for most French people, it sucked, because
the people with the money - the nobles and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.280
the clergy - never paid taxes. So by 1789,
France was deeply in debt thanks to their

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.259
funding the American Revolution - thank you,
France; we will get you back in World Wars

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.400
I and II. And King Louis XVI was spending
half of his national budget to service the federal debt.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.440
Louis tried to reform this system under various
finance ministers. He even called for democracy

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.689
on a local level, but all attempts to fix
it failed and soon France basically declared

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.740
bankruptcy. This nicely coincided with hailstorms
that ruined a year’s harvest, thereby raising food prices

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.200
and causing widespread hunger, which really made
the people of France angry, because they love to eat.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.660
Meanwhile, the King certainly did not look
broke, as evidenced by his well-fed physique

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.390
and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie
Antoinette also got to live in the very nice

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.189
Palace at Versailles thanks to God’s mandate,
but Enlightenment thinkers like Kant were

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.829
challenging the whole idea of religion, writing
things like: “The main point of enlightenment

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.289
is of man’s release from his self-caused
immaturity, primarily in matters of religion.”

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.800
So basically the peasants were hungry, the
intellectuals were beginning to wonder whether

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.320
God could or should save the King, and the
nobility were dithering about, eating foie

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.890
gras and songbirds, failing to make meaningful
financial reform.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.890
In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called
a meeting of the Estates General, the closest

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.010
thing that France had to a national parliament,
which hadn’t met since 1614. The Estates

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.340
General was like a super parliament made up
of representatives from the First Estate,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
the nobles, the Second Estate, the clergy,
and the Third Estate, everyone else.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.360
The Third Estate showed up with about 600
representatives, the First and Second Estates

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.760
both had about 300, and after several votes,
everything was deadlocked, and then the Third

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.599
Estate was like, “You know what? Forget
you guys. We’re gonna leave and we’re

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.400
gonna become our own National Assembly.”

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.150
This did not please King Louis XVI. So when
the new National Assembly left the room for

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.400
a break, he locked the doors, and he was like,
"Sorry, guys, you can't go in there. And if

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.650
you can't assemble, how you gonna be a National
Assembly?"

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.349
Shockingly, the Third Estate representatives
were able to find a different room in France,

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.409
this time an indoor tennis court where they
swore the famous Tennis Court Oath. And they

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.909
agreed not to give up until a French constitution
was established.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.060
So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops
to Paris primarily to quell uprisings over

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.040
food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw
this as a provocation, so they responded by

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.489
seizing the Bastille Prison on July 14th,
which, coincidentally, is also Bastille Day.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.780
The Bastille was stormed ostensibly to free
prisoners - although there were only seven

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.019
in jail at the time - but mostly to get guns.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.930
But the really radical move in the National
Assembly came on August 4, when they abolished

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.560
most of the Ancien Régime - feudal rights,
tithes, privileges for nobles, unequal taxation,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.799
they were all abolished - in the name of writing
a new constitution.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.799
And then, on August 26th, the National Assembly
proclaimed the Declaration of Rights of Man

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.470
and Citizen, which laid out a system of rights
that applied to every person, and made those

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.409
rights integral to the new constitution. That’s
quite different from the American bill of

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.799
rights, which was, like, begrudgingly tacked
on at the end and only applied to non-slaves.

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.500
The DoRoMaC, as I called it in high school,
declared that everyone had the right to liberty,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.220
property, and security - rights that the French
Revolution would do an exceptionally poor

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.209
job of protecting, but as noted last week,
the same can be argued for many other supposedly

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.250
more successful revolutions. Okay, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.079
Meanwhile, back at Versailles, Louis XVI was
still King of France, and it was looking like

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.640
France might be a constitutional monarchy.
Which might've meant that the royal family

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.989
could hang on to their awesome house, but
then, in October of 1789, a rumor started

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.290
that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere
inside the palace.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.470
And in what became known as the Women's March,
a bunch of armed peasant women stormed the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.550
palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Antoinette
move from Versailles to Paris. Which they

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.520
did, because everyone is afraid of armed peasant
women. And this is a nice reminder that to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.660
many people at the time, the French Revolution
was not primarily about fancy Enlightenment

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.710
ideas; it was mostly about lack of food and
a political system that made economic contractions

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.220
hardest on the poor.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.850
Now, a good argument can be made that this
first phase of the revolution wasn’t all

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.030
that revolutionary. The National Assembly
wanted to create a constitutional monarchy;

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.780
they believed that the king was necessary
for a functioning state and they were mainly

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.560
concerned that the voters and office holders
be men of property. Only the most radical

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.320
wing, the Jacobins, called for the creation
of a republic. But things were about to get

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.930
much more revolutionary - and also worse for
France.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.240
First, the Jacobins had a huge petition drive
that got a bit unruly, which led troops controlled

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.740
not by the King but by the National Assembly
to fire on the crowd, killing 50 people. And

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.030
that meant that the National Assembly, which
had been the revolutionary voice of the people,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.940
had killed people in an attempt to reign in
revolutionary fervor. You see this a lot throughout

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.120
history during revolutions. What looked like
radical hope and change suddenly becomes "The

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.040
Man" as increasingly radical ideas are embraced.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.210
Meanwhile, France’s monarchical neighbors
were getting a little nervous about all this

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.980
republic business, especially Leopold II,
who in addition to being the not holy, not

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.270
Roman, and not imperial Holy Roman Emperor,
was Marie Antoinette’s brother. I should

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.400
note, by the way, that at this point, the
Holy Roman Empire was basically just Austria.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.590
Also, like a lot of monarchs, Leopold II liked
the idea of monarchies, and he wanted to keep

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.450
his job as a person who gets to stand around
wearing a dress, pointing at nothing, owning

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.280
winged lion-monkeys made out of gold. And who
can blame him? So he and King William Frederick II

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.800
of Prussia together issued the Declaration of Pillnitz,
which promised to restore the French monarchy.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.320
At this point, Louis and the National Assembly
developed a plan: Let’s invade Austria.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.990
The idea was to plunder Austria’s wealth
and maybe steal some Austrian grain to shore

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.730
up French food supplies, and also, you know,
spread revolutionary zeal. But what actually

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.210
happened is that Prussia joined Austria in
fighting the French. And then Louis encouraged

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.490
the Prussians, which made him look like an
enemy of the revolution, which, of course,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.470
he was. And as a result, the Assembly voted
to suspend the monarchy, have new elections

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.410
in which everyone could vote (as long as they
were men), and create a new republican constitution.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.000
Soon, this Convention decided to have a trial
for Louis XVI, who was found guilty and, by

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.590
one vote, sentenced to die via guillotine.
Which made it difficult for Austria and Prussia

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.370
to restore him to the throne. Oh, it’s time
for the open letter?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.160
An Open Letter to the Guillotine. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment today.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.660
Oh, there’s nothing. Oh my gosh, Stan! Jeez.
That’s not funny!

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.920
Dear Guillotine, I can think of no better example of
Enlightenment thinking run amok. Dr. Joseph Guillotine,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.310
the inventor of the guillotine, envisioned
it as an egalitarian way of dying. They said

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.050
the guillotine was humane and it also made
no distinction between rich or poor, noble

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.340
or peasant. It killed equally.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.900
You were also celebrated for taking the torture
out of execution. But I will remind you, you

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.830
did not take the dying out of execution. Unfortunately
for you, France hasn’t executed anyone since

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.650
1977. But you’ll be happy to know that the
last legal execution in France was via guillotine.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.490
Plus, you’ve always got a future in horror
movies.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.940
Best wishes, John Green

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.200
The death of Louis XVI marks the beginning
of The Terror, the best known or at least

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.460
the most sensational phase of the revolution.
I mean, if you can kill the king, you can

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.000
kill pretty much anyone, which is what the
government did under the leadership of the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.920
Committee of Public Safety (Motto: We suck at
protecting public safety), led by Maximilien Robespierre.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.230
The terror saw the guillotining of 16,000
enemies of the revolution including Marie

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.670
“I never actually said Let them eat cake”
Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre himself,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.710
who was guillotined in the month of Thermidor
in the year Two.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.970
Alright, so while France was broke and fighting
in like nine wars, the Committee of Public

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.380
Safety changed the measurements of time because,
you know, the traditional measurements are

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.950
so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed
all the months and decided that every day

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.130
would have 10 hours and each hour 100 minutes.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.160
And then, after the Terror, the revolution
pulled back a bit and another new constitution

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.800
was put into place, this one giving a lot
more power to wealthy people. At this point,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.980
France was still at war with Austria and Britain,
wars that France ended up winning, largely

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.850
thanks to a little corporal named Napoleon
Bonaparte.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.610
The war was backdrop to a bunch of coups and
counter coups that I won’t get into right

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.860
now because they were very complicated, but
the last coup that we’ll talk about, in

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.950
1799, established Napoleon Bonaparte as the
First Consul of France. And it granted him

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.630
almost unlimited executive power under yet
another constitution. And when he was declared

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.950
First Consul of France, Napoleon proclaimed
"Citizens! The revolution is established on

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.250
the principals with which it began. It is
over." By which he presumably meant that France’s

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.580
government had gone all the way from here
to here to here.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.550
As with the American revolution, it’s easy
to conclude that France’s revolution wasn’t

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.280
all that revolutionary. I mean, Napoleon was
basically an emperor and, in some ways, he

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.090
was even more of an absolute monarch than
Louis XVI had been. Gradually the nobles came

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.510
back to France, although they had mostly lost
their special privileges. The Catholic Church

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.380
returned, too, although much weaker because
it had lost land and the ability to collect tithes.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.790
And when Napoleon himself fell, France restored
the monarchy, and except for a four-year period,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.850
between 1815 and 1870, France had a king who
was either a Bourbon or a Bonaparte.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.980
Now, these were no longer absolute monarchs who
claimed that their right to rule came from

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.180
God; they were constitutional monarchs of
the kind that the revolutionaries of 1789

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.230
had originally envisioned. But the fact remains
that France had a king again, and a nobility,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:43.070
and an established religion and it was definitely
not a democracy or a republic.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.150
And perhaps this is why the French Revolution
is so controversial and open to interpretation.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.550
Some argue the revolution succeeded in spreading
enlightenment ideals even if it didn’t bring

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.990
democracy to France. Others argue that the
real legacy of the Revolution wasn’t the

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.210
enhancement of liberty, but of state power.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.980
Regardless, I’d argue that the French Revolution
was ultimately far more revolutionary than

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.780
its American counterpart. I mean, in some
ways, America never had an aristocracy, but

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.730
in other ways it continued to have one - the
French enlightenment thinker, Diderot, felt

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.960
that Americans should “fear a too unequal
division of wealth resulting in a small number

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.340
of opulent citizens and a multitude of citizens
living in misery.” And the American Revolution

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.890
did nothing to change that polarization of
wealth.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.500
What made the French Revolution so radical
was its insistence on the universality of

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.380
its ideals. I mean, look at Article 6 of the
Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen:

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.300
“Law is the expression of the general will.
Every citizen has a right to participate personally,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.660
or through his representative, in its foundation. It must
be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.”

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.280
Those are radical ideas, that the laws come
from citizens, not from kings or gods, and

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.090
that those laws should apply to everyone equally.
That’s a long way from Hammurabi - and in

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.610
truth, it’s a long way from the slaveholding
Thomas Jefferson.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.130
In the 1970s, Chinese President Zhou Enlai
was asked what the affects of the French Revolution

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.340
had been. And he said, “It’s too soon
to say.” And in a way, it still is. The

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.680
French Revolution asked new questions about
the nature of people’s rights and the derivation

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.070
of those rights. And we’re still answering
those questions and sorting through how our

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.460
answers should shape society today - must
government be of the people to be for the

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.600
people? Do our rights derive from nature or
from God or from neither? And what are those rights?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.740
As William Faulkner said, “The past is never
dead. It’s not even past.” Thanks for

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.360
watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.320
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.030
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, our graphics

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.790
team is Thought Bubble, and we are ably interned
by Meredith Danko.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.140
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Giant
Tea Bag"; if you want to suggest future phrases

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.500
of the week, or guess at this week's you can
do so in comments, where you can also ask

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.480
questions about today’s video that will
be answered by our team of historians.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.480
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
