00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.782
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That, well that's interesting, I mean, like with games there's a minimum

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:09.412
requirements, you know, you must have this DirectX 11, or dadadadada. so, do

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:12.402
you have like minimum requirements or are there sort of tiers of support or how

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.000
does that work?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.820
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a, minimum set of requirements for your system and for graphics card,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.459
but we also have a very thorough certification process because. Even if a card

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:24.940
says that, you know, it runs DX11, it has all these effects, there can be

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.273
problems with a card of a driver. So we actually have to go through card driver

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:34.108
combinations, certifying each one, run through a whole list of effects, make

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:39.497
sure they can do each one well and efficiently. Because depending on the

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.273
customer, some customers may want the visual accuracy and don't care as much

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.500
about the performance. Some want the performance and don't care as much about

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.976
the visual accuracy. So depending on what it is we're striving for. If we have

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:54.356
an effect that looks really good but is slow, that will work for some customers

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:56.560
but not all customers.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.132
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [CROSSTALK]

00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:01.299
There are also the frame rate issues that you see, particularly in games. Where

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.772
a game has to run at 30 hertz or 60 hertz. And, again, they will cut some

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:08.427
corners in order to, to be able to do that. We don't have those strict

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:12.572
requirements, in CAD. Although there are times when someone has a model. They

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.190
need to orbit it, they need to pan around. So, we do need to get good frame

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.838
rate out of that. And we'll actually play some of those same tricks, where

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:23.510
we'll slightly degrade the visuals in order to be able to, to want, to see the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.315
model moving, and then when you stop, we, we cut off the degradation and bring

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.723
back the original model.
