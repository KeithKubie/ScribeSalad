00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:32.728
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:34.157
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.767
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:40.523
Our guest today is
Professor Deborah Tannen.

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:42.887
She is visiting the Berkeley campus

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:45.470
as the 2017 Hitchcock Lecturer.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:52.065
Since 1979, Tannen has been on the faculty

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:55.857
of Georgetown University's
Department of Linguistics.

00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:00.024
And, since 1991, has held the
rank of university professor.

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.865
A prolific scholar, Tannen has written

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.224
critically praised books for

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:10.606
both scholarly and general audiences.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:13.420
Her books include the number one,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.738
four year New York Times Bestseller

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:19.905
You Just Don't Understand:
Women and Men in Conversation.

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:25.341
Her most recent book is You're
the Only One I Can Tell:

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.093
Inside the Language of
Women's Friendships.

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:33.516
Professor Tannen, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:34.371
- So nice to be here.

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.204
Be here again.

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:37.304
- Yes, welcome back, I should say.

00:01:37.304 --> 00:01:38.565
Where were you born and raised?

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.763
- I was born in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:42.350
Raised in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.241
And I have my PhD from Berkeley.

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.397
- And, looking back, how did your parents

00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:50.246
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:54.034
- You know, the very first book
that I wrote in linguistics,

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.596
actually was edited,

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.900
was about spoken and written language.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.773
Orality and Literacy.

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:03.052
And I dedicated it to my parents.

00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:04.929
And I said who taught me about

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.101
orality and literacy respectively.

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.078
(laughter)

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:10.627
My mother being the orality.

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:12.214
My father being the literacy.

00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:14.536
Yeah, my parents were born in Europe.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.081
My father in Poland.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.162
My mother in Russia.

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:22.358
They came to this country,
my father in 1920.

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:23.867
And that's very significant.

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:25.710
That was the last year that

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.624
there were no limits on immigration

00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:29.739
from that part of the world.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.607
My mother had her father and
some siblings already here.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:35.440
Tried to come in 1921.

00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:39.520
And they had already instituted quotas.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.375
So, they had to hang out in Poland.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:44.981
They had escaped from
Russia over the border.

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:46.809
They had to hang out in
Poland for about two years

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.334
till they were able to come in 1923.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:52.144
And that was the last year
that anyone could come.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:56.830
By '24, the quotas were
so high no one could come.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.802
So, they had that background from Europe.

00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:03.878
They did not graduate from high
school, either one of them.

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:06.690
But my father did do high
school equivalency at night

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.725
while he was working in the factory.

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:12.224
Became a lawyer by attending
law school at night.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:16.301
Earned a master's degree
in law the same way.

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.606
- That background suggests that

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.606
you became conscious of conversation

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.669
comparing what was being discussed at home

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.678
and the way it was discussed
versus the public schools.

00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:31.511
Is that fair?

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.569
- You know, I trace my interest

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.445
in language to my father.

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:37.010
He was very gifted in language,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.177
both speaking languages,
picking them up, and writing.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.984
And he was the one, after people had left

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:46.652
and we would sit around in the evening,

00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:48.243
he was the one who would say,

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:49.827
"Did you notice when she said this

00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:51.170
and she said it this way?

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.432
And what did that mean?"

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.056
That was really from him.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.640
My mother was very verbal and storied.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.283
Talked about people, told stories.

00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:04.802
Also very interested in
people, their relationships.

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:07.939
I actually have a BA and
MA in English literature.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.506
So, my decision to get
the PhD in linguistics

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.747
was not an obvious one.

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:14.050
I was 30.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.353
I had lived in Greece.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:18.328
And this was also a large part in

00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:21.953
my interest in different, what
I call, conversation styles.

00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:22.890
Having lived in Greece where

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.678
the ways of speaking
were somewhat different.

00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:30.797
And so, I think I might
have gone into law,

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:32.752
as my father had done.

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:36.091
Although I didn't really
want to have to wear

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.562
what I thought of as lady's shoes

00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:39.823
and go on the subway every day.

00:04:39.823 --> 00:04:41.004
But, really, I was just bored

00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:44.344
and wanted something that would
be intellectually engaging.

00:04:44.344 --> 00:04:48.533
And the kind of linguistics
that I do, which...

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:53.138
Fortunately, I attended a
linguistic institute in 1973.

00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:55.218
The Linguistic Society
of America has these,

00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:57.126
at that time, every summer.

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:59.324
Now every other summer.

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:01.117
And I didn't really know
what linguistics was,

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:02.381
but I was curious.

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:03.643
- This was when you were an undergraduate?

00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:05.072
- [Deborah] I am now 30.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:05.968
- I see.

00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:07.680
- Had lived in Greece,
so I had that interest

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.594
in cross-cultural communication.

00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.672
Had a BA and MA in English literature.

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:13.748
I was teaching remedial writing at

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:17.003
the City University of New
York at Lehman College.

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:18.671
And I was just bored and I wanted to

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:22.090
be intellectually engaged again.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.778
I was really thinking more
of being a student again

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:27.831
than I was of a career goal.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:29.698
And I went to a Linguistic Institute

00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:32.098
and I was just so fortunate that,

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:36.047
that summer, the topic
was language in context.

00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:37.047
It was 1973.

00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:41.540
I think there was a zeitgeist at the time.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.860
Many fields were turning
to everyday interaction.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.980
And that was the case with linguistics.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.187
I took a course with Robin Lakoff

00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:53.687
who had just joined the
faculty at Berkeley.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:57.395
And was just fascinated by her schema

00:05:57.395 --> 00:06:01.751
for understanding a face
to face conversation.

00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:03.669
And other courses that I took, as well,

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.050
really inspired me that way.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.431
All those talks that were
being given that summer

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.481
where all the people who
became giants and were,

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.382
although I didn't realize they had giants,

00:06:14.382 --> 00:06:16.988
in the field of turning to the analysis

00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:19.104
of language in everyday interaction.

00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:21.627
So, it brought together my father's

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:24.437
love of language and his skill at language

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:27.286
with my mother's interest in people

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:30.380
and her facility with
everyday conversation.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.512
- Is the Linguistics
Institute here at Berkeley?

00:06:33.512 --> 00:06:35.305
- [Deborah] It was at the
University of Michigan.

00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:36.138
- I see.

00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:39.291
But then Robin Lakoff came to Berkeley

00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.472
or was she already here?

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.324
- I think it was the summer between

00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:45.486
her leaving Michigan
and coming to Berkeley.

00:06:45.486 --> 00:06:48.458
So, I then applied to and came to Berkeley

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:49.721
because she was here.

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:53.019
- Did your background as
an English undergraduate

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:55.668
help you in linguistic studies

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:58.563
or was that just a passing fad?

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.766
- You know, it's so
interesting you say that.

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:03.660
There are some of us in linguistics,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.611
again, the kind that I do,

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.404
with this English literature background.

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:08.953
So, it was not just my BA,

00:07:08.953 --> 00:07:12.168
but also my Master's
in English literature.

00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:14.775
And I had actually published
a couple of papers.

00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:17.218
One on Yeats and one on Joyce.

00:07:17.218 --> 00:07:19.752
And I'm sure that helped my application.

00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:22.967
But, yeah, I believe that my love of

00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:27.134
and sensitivity to literary
language has been key.

00:07:28.352 --> 00:07:30.835
One of my books that is published

00:07:30.835 --> 00:07:32.796
that I wrote for scholarly audiences

00:07:32.796 --> 00:07:35.614
was published by Cambridge
University Press.

00:07:35.614 --> 00:07:37.729
It's called Talking Voices:

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.903
Repetition, Dialogue, and Imagery

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:42.696
in Conversational Discourse.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:44.529
Actually, my title for it was

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:47.696
Conversational and Literary Discourse.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:51.825
And the theme of that book is that

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:55.249
the figures, the ways of using language

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:58.755
that we think of as being
quintessentially literary,

00:07:58.755 --> 00:08:02.707
patterns of repetition, patterns of sound,

00:08:02.707 --> 00:08:05.313
using dialogue that is taking the voices

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:10.034
of the people that are speaking,
and details and imagery,

00:08:10.034 --> 00:08:14.520
all these things are
thought of as literary,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.149
appreciated in literary language.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:19.041
But my point there is that they are

00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:22.870
the fundamental building blocks
of everyday conversation.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.436
So, you could say that
all my work in linguistics

00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:30.043
builds directly on my background
in literary criticism.

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:30.898
I'll just add quickly...

00:08:30.898 --> 00:08:31.731
- Yes?

00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.864
- I actually had written a
book of literary criticism.

00:08:33.864 --> 00:08:37.451
It's analysis of the work
of a modern Greek writer.

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.286
Her name is Lilika Nakos.

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.036
She's not translated.

00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:45.401
- What did you do your
dissertation on here at Berkeley?

00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:48.048
- My dissertation was called

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:52.443
Conversational Style:
Analyzing Talk among Friends.

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:56.610
But it was a comparison of what
I call conversational style,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.976
ways of speaking, ways of using language,

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.436
that were typical of

00:09:03.436 --> 00:09:05.997
New York Jewish speakers on the one hand

00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:09.781
and California non-Jewish
speakers on the other.

00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.833
I did not set out to look at

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:16.215
New York versus California
ways of speaking.

00:09:16.215 --> 00:09:20.458
My goal, my intention, had been simply to

00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:23.266
take a real conversation,

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:27.013
microanalysis of real
everyday conversation,

00:09:27.013 --> 00:09:30.476
and describe the conversational styles

00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:32.551
of each person in that conversation.

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.933
There were six.

00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:35.034
And the effects of those

00:09:35.034 --> 00:09:38.047
conversational ways of using language

00:09:38.047 --> 00:09:41.264
on each other and on the conversation.

00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:45.386
Three of the six people
were New York Jews.

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:48.894
I was one, my best
friend, and his brother.

00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:49.749
Three of us.

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:50.688
I'm from Brooklyn.

00:09:50.688 --> 00:09:51.993
They were from the Bronx.

00:09:51.993 --> 00:09:55.946
And then, two of his
friends and his former wife.

00:09:55.946 --> 00:09:58.264
She was British and the two friends

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.747
had grown up in California.

00:10:00.747 --> 00:10:04.088
I discovered, in analyzing
the conversation,

00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:07.181
that the New York speakers were able to

00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:09.424
express our ways of speaking in a way that

00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:11.500
the Californians could not.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.032
Because it was hard for
them to get the floor.

00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:14.865
(laughter)

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.693
So, I ended up doing a study, really,

00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:19.847
of New York conversational style

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.448
and the different effect that it had

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:25.051
in the interactions among the three of us,

00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:27.250
those who shared that
conversational style,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.817
and how different an effect it had

00:10:29.817 --> 00:10:31.487
in the interactions with

00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:34.051
the Californians and the British woman.

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.129
- I like to ask my guests

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:38.004
how they would advise students who

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:41.348
want to prepare for a career in

00:10:41.348 --> 00:10:42.977
the field that the guest is in.

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:47.414
Linguistics, what do you see
is the skills and temperament

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:50.081
involved in mastering that work?

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.013
- You need to be compulsive,

00:10:54.013 --> 00:10:56.707
but then, most of us
academics are compulsive.

00:10:56.707 --> 00:10:58.093
(laughter)

00:10:58.093 --> 00:11:00.760
Enormous patience to
look at the nitty gritty.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.177
You have to be kind of picky.

00:11:04.343 --> 00:11:06.420
I spent two and a half months

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.965
transcribing that two and
a half hour conversation.

00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:11.965
I timed the pauses.

00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:15.711
Now, a lot of that can
be done computationally.

00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:18.794
I transcribed it in a way that showed

00:11:19.705 --> 00:11:23.872
whether t-h-e meant the or
whether it represented the.

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:27.328
I used a capital E.

00:11:27.328 --> 00:11:31.077
So, that kind of patience
to look in great detail

00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:33.725
at the tiny, tiny bits of language,

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:38.167
I think, is something that
you need to be a linguist.

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:42.075
- Listening to you and
reading several of your works.

00:11:42.075 --> 00:11:44.317
Listening is very important.

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:47.493
So, a person who's gonna do linguistics

00:11:47.493 --> 00:11:49.410
has to be good at that.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.488
- I'm amused by your saying that

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:52.833
because so few people listen.

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:54.256
(laughter)

00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:56.208
Including linguists.

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:57.673
But I think, yes, that is very helpful.

00:11:57.673 --> 00:11:59.016
Being an observer.

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:00.724
We describe our field, linguistics,

00:12:00.724 --> 00:12:03.825
as descriptive, not prescriptive.

00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:04.884
And that's one of the things that

00:12:04.884 --> 00:12:07.529
distinguishes us from, for example,

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.218
people in the field of English literature.

00:12:10.218 --> 00:12:12.257
English teachers.

00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:14.412
We would never say,
"You're using that wrong."

00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:16.445
We would say, "Isn't that interesting?

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:17.833
You used it that way.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:19.585
Why are you using it that way?

00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:22.068
Who else uses it that way?"

00:12:22.068 --> 00:12:23.703
So, yeah...

00:12:23.703 --> 00:12:26.370
- In reading, again, your works,

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:30.482
you have to be a people person.

00:12:31.527 --> 00:12:33.890
That's my conclusion.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.372
But, in the sense that, in a way,

00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:40.609
you're being nosy about the way they talk,

00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:43.096
so you have to be able to deal with them.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.846
So, your analytical
skills do not upset them.

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:51.211
So, therefore you have
to be a people person

00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:52.226
to make them feel good.

00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:53.059
Is that...

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:55.449
- I'm fascinated by your saying that.

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:58.876
When I was deciding
which program to go to,

00:12:58.876 --> 00:13:01.888
one that I considered was the
University of Pennsylvania

00:13:01.888 --> 00:13:04.086
where a leading sociolinguist

00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:06.612
was of the time, William Labov.

00:13:06.612 --> 00:13:08.851
The kind of work he does is
rather different from mine,

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:11.256
but I did go to meet
with him and talk to him.

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:13.863
And he said, "You have to be comfortable

00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:16.308
going out and talking to strangers,

00:13:16.308 --> 00:13:18.795
because that's how we record their talk

00:13:18.795 --> 00:13:20.540
that we need in order to analyze.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.455
So, if you're not comfortable doing that,

00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:24.169
this is not for you."

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:26.248
In the end, I did something different.

00:13:26.248 --> 00:13:30.124
But I think it happens to be the case that

00:13:30.124 --> 00:13:32.041
many academics are shy.

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:34.030
They're introverts.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.315
They're happier alone in their study

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.499
with their computer screen than

00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:39.456
they are out talking to people.

00:13:39.456 --> 00:13:42.105
And there are many successful
discourse analysts...

00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:43.900
The kind of work that I do

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.244
would now be called discourse analysis.

00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:51.806
Discourse being the language
as it's used in interaction.

00:13:51.806 --> 00:13:56.535
There are many who are
quite introverted, quite shy

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:59.191
and are not comfortable
interacting with people.

00:13:59.191 --> 00:14:00.251
But that's okay.

00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:01.308
They get their recordings

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:03.995
or maybe they look at written language.

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:07.294
Maybe they look at something
they heard on television.

00:14:07.294 --> 00:14:09.084
Or maybe they just take time

00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:12.134
and are able to get close enough to people

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.969
to record their conversation.

00:14:13.969 --> 00:14:17.920
- Hey, help us understand
what conversational style is.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.388
- Yes, thank you for asking that.

00:14:19.388 --> 00:14:22.555
Conversational style is my main point,

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.718
you might say, of everything that I do.

00:14:26.718 --> 00:14:29.125
Let me explain it this way.

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:33.403
When I am asked by
people in the real world,

00:14:33.403 --> 00:14:35.844
journalists or interviewers on television,

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:38.904
they'll always say, "Wouldn't
this be a better world

00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:41.919
if everybody just said what they meant?"

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.659
And I often respond,
"We do say what we mean,

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:48.001
but we say it in our own
conversational style."

00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.668
We have in mind what we want to say,

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:52.595
what we want to accomplish
in this interaction,

00:14:52.595 --> 00:14:54.184
but we have to make decisions.

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:57.243
How loudly or softly to speak.

00:14:57.243 --> 00:14:59.560
What specific words to choose.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.515
How relatively direct or
indirect we're going to be.

00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:04.899
If I want you to close the window,

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.409
am I going to say "Close the window"

00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:10.442
or am I going to say "It's
kind of cold in here"

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:14.759
and hope you'll conclude that
you should close the window?

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:17.509
A whole range of features that...

00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:20.503
Decisions that have to be made

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.721
when you take your ideas and emotions

00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:25.473
and put them into words.

00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:29.185
There are people who, when they're angry,

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:30.816
will get very loud and yell.

00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:34.163
There are people who, when
they're angry, will get silent.

00:15:34.163 --> 00:15:36.887
All these differences
in conversational style.

00:15:36.887 --> 00:15:40.107
Are you gonna show interest in
somebody by asking questions?

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.227
Or is it rude to ask questions?

00:15:42.227 --> 00:15:43.060
Back off.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.690
They'll tell you what
they want you to know.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.857
And I have applied this in
a huge range of contexts.

00:15:51.073 --> 00:15:54.091
It comes up with my starting point,

00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:55.890
different regional backgrounds,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.110
different ethnic backgrounds,
different class backgrounds,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.715
individual personality, generation,

00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:05.630
sexual orientation, all
these influences on our style

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.138
and, of course, gender differences,

00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:10.237
which is the topic of the book
You Just Don't Understand,

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.358
which is the one that
got the most attention

00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:15.453
of my books written for general audiences.

00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:17.402
But I would say conversational style

00:16:17.402 --> 00:16:20.743
is all the linguistic elements that

00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:23.190
make up how you say what you mean.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.535
And they differ by all these influences.

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:29.020
If you talk to someone
whose conversational style

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.704
is relatively similar to yours,

00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:33.701
chances are your conclusions about

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.345
what they mean and what they intend

00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:40.990
and their inner abilities
will be relatively accurate.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.272
But, to the extent that the
person you're speaking with

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:46.286
has a different conversational style,

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:48.689
it's quite likely that your conclusions

00:16:48.689 --> 00:16:50.762
about their abilities and their intentions

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:55.002
and their conclusions about
yours may not be accurate.

00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:58.710
- Also, I want you to explain
the difference between

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.686
a communication and a metacommunication.

00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:05.886
'Cause I think that's
central to your analysis.

00:17:05.886 --> 00:17:06.719
- It is.

00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:10.811
These are terms that I borrowed from

00:17:10.811 --> 00:17:12.728
the anthropologist Gregory Bateson.

00:17:12.728 --> 00:17:15.619
And he pointed out that
anything anyone says

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.305
and any gestures they make, as well,

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:21.110
has a message and a metamessage.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.999
So, the message is the
meaning of the words.

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:27.540
The metamessage is how you
should interpret those words.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.683
What you think you're
doing by saying these words

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.473
in this way at this time.

00:17:32.473 --> 00:17:34.922
And, in so many of the books I've written

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:38.142
where I have examples from real
people in their real lives,

00:17:38.142 --> 00:17:39.607
they're arguing about the message,

00:17:39.607 --> 00:17:43.231
but it was really the
metamessage that got their goat.

00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:44.481
So, when you...

00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:47.765
Again, take a simple example.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.439
This was a real
conversation that I observed

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:55.735
walking along campus
with a female colleague.

00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:57.735
Male colleague appeared.

00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:00.536
It was a brisk fall day.

00:18:00.536 --> 00:18:02.122
Kind of chilly.

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:05.174
And we greeted each other
and she said to him,

00:18:05.174 --> 00:18:06.436
"Where's your coat?"

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:08.228
And he said, "Thanks, mom."

00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:09.534
(laughter)

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:13.731
So, what was the metamessage
of "Where's your coat?"

00:18:13.731 --> 00:18:17.234
To her, it was simply
friendly, a greeting.

00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:19.879
To him, it was "I'm speaking to you

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:22.203
as a parent would to a child."

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:23.875
And they're both there.

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:26.958
- So, the metamessage is really about

00:18:28.763 --> 00:18:31.204
the structure of the relationship,

00:18:31.204 --> 00:18:33.530
which is hidden in a way.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.383
- Well, I would say it's everything about

00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:38.300
how you mean what you say.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.603
So, it's what you think
of the relationship.

00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:43.192
It's also the implications.

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:46.855
So, I gave the example
of "It's cold in here"

00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:49.624
as a way to get someone
to close the window.

00:18:49.624 --> 00:18:51.825
You could say the metamessage is

00:18:51.825 --> 00:18:53.621
"Please, go close the window."

00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:55.578
Or you could just say the metamessage is

00:18:55.578 --> 00:18:57.164
"I don't want to impose on you.

00:18:57.164 --> 00:18:59.404
I don't want to force
you to close the window.

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.564
So, I'm being considerate of you."

00:19:01.564 --> 00:19:04.908
It's everything about
how you mean what you say

00:19:04.908 --> 00:19:07.724
and what it says about the relationship

00:19:07.724 --> 00:19:09.679
at the time that you say it.

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:13.552
It's interesting you say it's hidden.

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.710
All the books I've written I have examples

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.717
of message and metamessage.

00:19:17.717 --> 00:19:20.564
And it's so important, because, so often,

00:19:20.564 --> 00:19:23.949
people are frustrated
from their conversations.

00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:26.433
And they say, "Why did you say that?"

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.791
Take mothers and daughters

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:31.314
where daughters frequently felt

00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:33.026
that their mothers were critical.

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:35.388
Criticizing, especially, the big three,

00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:37.223
hair, clothes, and weight.

00:19:37.223 --> 00:19:40.323
And how they raise their
children, if they have children.

00:19:40.323 --> 00:19:41.747
And so, the mother would...

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.886
Give you my own example.

00:19:42.886 --> 00:19:44.606
My mother once said to me,

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:47.740
"Do you like your hair that long?"

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.510
Her metamessage, what was it?

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.217
I mean, for many people, it
would be "Your hair's too long."

00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:59.187
And, as a matter of fact,
later on, she laughed...

00:19:59.187 --> 00:20:01.470
At the time that she said it to me,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.060
I laughed and I said,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.688
"You know, so many women tell me that

00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.803
their mothers criticize their hair."

00:20:06.803 --> 00:20:08.347
She said, "I wasn't criticizing."

00:20:08.347 --> 00:20:10.139
But then, later, I said,

00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:11.237
"Mom, what do you think of my hair?"

00:20:11.237 --> 00:20:13.482
And she said, "I think
it's a little too long."

00:20:13.482 --> 00:20:15.683
So, I picked up that metamessage

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:19.470
that she's saying something
critical about my hair.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.418
Mothers typically felt their
daughters were so sensitive.

00:20:23.418 --> 00:20:24.251
I can't...

00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:26.477
"She takes everything as criticism.

00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:27.616
I'm concerned.

00:20:27.616 --> 00:20:29.527
I'm showing my caring.

00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:32.010
I want the world to appreciate her

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.473
to see how wonderful she is.

00:20:33.473 --> 00:20:37.421
I want things to go as
well as they can for her.

00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:39.453
So, if she had a better haircut,

00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:41.773
things would go better for her."

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:42.627
So, which is it?

00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:44.785
Which metamessage is accurate?

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:47.736
And I think it's so crucial to realize

00:20:47.736 --> 00:20:50.044
the metamessage somebody picks up

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:51.646
may not be the one you intend.

00:20:51.646 --> 00:20:54.049
So, each one, the mother, the daughter,

00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:56.692
feels the metamessage I perceive

00:20:56.692 --> 00:20:58.566
or I intend is the real one.

00:20:58.566 --> 00:21:00.114
"I'm not criticizing.

00:21:00.114 --> 00:21:01.785
I'm showing I care."

00:21:01.785 --> 00:21:03.046
"You're criticizing."

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:05.613
And so, it's very crucial point that

00:21:05.613 --> 00:21:09.780
I make in so many of these is
that they can both be true.

00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:16.236
- I also like to ask my
guests about creativity.

00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.144
And it strikes me that a
source of your creativity

00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:23.561
is your interest in everyday conversation

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.607
and your capacity to apply
the theory of linguistics

00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:37.707
that was already there
or that you developed.

00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:38.540
- Thank you.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.373
That's absolutely right.

00:21:39.373 --> 00:21:41.618
And, as I said, I think 1973,

00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:43.607
the year that I went to the institute

00:21:43.607 --> 00:21:48.533
and then '74 to '79, when I
was in grad school at Berkeley,

00:21:48.533 --> 00:21:51.173
there was a turn toward applying

00:21:51.173 --> 00:21:54.675
various theories to everyday interaction.

00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:56.346
So, we saw it in philosophy.

00:21:56.346 --> 00:21:58.544
There was someone named H.P. Grice

00:21:58.544 --> 00:22:01.434
who developed the schema
logic of conversation.

00:22:01.434 --> 00:22:06.284
He said you could take these
formal schemas of logic

00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:08.403
and apply it to everyday conversation.

00:22:08.403 --> 00:22:12.320
There was a field called
conversation analysis in sociology.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.990
Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.886
And it's interesting.

00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:17.615
My understanding is that
they took conversations

00:22:17.615 --> 00:22:18.713
simply because it was something

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.993
form everyday interaction you could

00:22:20.993 --> 00:22:23.148
pin down by transcribing it

00:22:23.148 --> 00:22:25.222
and showing that it was rule governed

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:26.771
and that it was orderly.

00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:28.887
And then there was the
work of Robin Lakoff,

00:22:28.887 --> 00:22:30.759
who I mentioned, of John Gumperz,

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:33.854
who was on the anthropology
faculty at the time,

00:22:33.854 --> 00:22:35.155
and of Wallace Chafe, who was in

00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:37.357
the linguistics department, as well.

00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.439
All of them turning their interest

00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:42.655
to the language of everyday interaction.

00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:45.104
And so, yes, that has
always been my passion.

00:22:45.104 --> 00:22:47.631
And I think that's my contribution.

00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:49.751
And I brought all their theories together.

00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:52.072
I don't know how much
detail you want to go into.

00:22:52.072 --> 00:22:53.622
How I did that.

00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:56.389
And then added, of
course, my own take on it.

00:22:56.389 --> 00:23:00.556
Maybe this sensibility of
literary criticism that I brought,

00:23:01.856 --> 00:23:04.793
as well as showing how all
these things came together.

00:23:04.793 --> 00:23:08.255
- My goal is to make the
audience interested enough in you

00:23:08.255 --> 00:23:09.923
to buy all those books.

00:23:09.923 --> 00:23:12.361
Which I'm sure you want.

00:23:12.361 --> 00:23:15.444
You write about a lot and, in fact...

00:23:16.537 --> 00:23:19.130
Were you surprised when your book

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.853
You Just Don't Understand:
Women and Men in Conversation

00:23:23.853 --> 00:23:27.603
became a four year New
York Times Bestseller?

00:23:28.703 --> 00:23:29.703
- Of course.

00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:32.125
A four year bestseller?

00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:32.982
That doesn't happen.

00:23:32.982 --> 00:23:34.660
Everybody would be shocked by that.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.324
But that it became a bestseller at all?

00:23:36.324 --> 00:23:39.507
Not only was I surprised,
my publisher was surprised.

00:23:39.507 --> 00:23:41.259
There was a period of several months

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:44.562
when they refused to print
enough books to fulfill demand.

00:23:44.562 --> 00:23:47.942
They just didn't believe it was happening.

00:23:47.942 --> 00:23:49.775
It seemed so unlikely.

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:52.912
I'll tell you something
that's kind of funny.

00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:55.745
I had ambitions for the first book

00:23:57.024 --> 00:23:59.962
that I wrote for general audiences.

00:23:59.962 --> 00:24:03.267
That book was called
That's Not What I Meant.

00:24:03.267 --> 00:24:05.630
And it took all the basic ideas

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.579
of conversational style and
conversational interaction.

00:24:09.579 --> 00:24:11.127
It was a slim book.

00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:12.594
Very understandable.

00:24:12.594 --> 00:24:15.445
Full of anecdotes and examples
from real interactions.

00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:19.197
Just like all my books for
general audiences have been.

00:24:19.197 --> 00:24:21.965
That was the one for
which I had ambitions.

00:24:21.965 --> 00:24:23.677
It's gonna change the world.

00:24:23.677 --> 00:24:25.756
People are gonna see that they think

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:29.923
everything is in terms of
psychological interpretation.

00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:33.826
I felt psychologists
had been so much better

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:36.226
at communicating to the general audience

00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:37.857
than linguists had been.

00:24:37.857 --> 00:24:40.997
That was the one for
which I was ambitious.

00:24:40.997 --> 00:24:42.262
The book did okay.

00:24:42.262 --> 00:24:44.094
Not that great.

00:24:44.094 --> 00:24:46.042
A friend of mine who is also an author,

00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:48.076
someone I had met that way,

00:24:48.076 --> 00:24:50.848
commented, he said, "You
just want your books

00:24:50.848 --> 00:24:53.982
to do well enough that they'll
let you write another one."

00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:55.816
I thought, you know, that makes sense.

00:24:55.816 --> 00:24:57.855
And I scaled back my ambitions.

00:24:57.855 --> 00:25:01.271
And so, when I wrote the book
You Just Don't Understand,

00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:04.573
it was with that scaled back anticipation

00:25:04.573 --> 00:25:05.799
of how well it might do.

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:07.467
And it was quite shocking.

00:25:07.467 --> 00:25:08.404
- Well, one of the things,

00:25:08.404 --> 00:25:10.934
when I read it for the first
time in preparation for this,

00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:14.684
is, "Oh, my," as you go
over the interactions

00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:18.844
between a husband and wife.

00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:23.863
You say that communication
between a man and a woman

00:25:24.915 --> 00:25:27.582
is cross-cultural communication.

00:25:28.747 --> 00:25:30.176
Why do you say that?

00:25:30.176 --> 00:25:31.009
- Yes.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:31.842
- [Harry] It's true.

00:25:31.842 --> 00:25:32.675
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:34.696
Of course, it's a metaphor.

00:25:34.696 --> 00:25:36.655
And, I have to say, I still...

00:25:36.655 --> 00:25:37.796
It just happened last night

00:25:37.796 --> 00:25:40.158
when I was giving a talk here at Berkeley.

00:25:40.158 --> 00:25:41.703
People will come up to me and say,

00:25:41.703 --> 00:25:44.005
"That book changed my life.

00:25:44.005 --> 00:25:45.147
That book saved my marriage.

00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:46.532
That book gave me a way to

00:25:46.532 --> 00:25:48.811
understand what was happening in my life

00:25:48.811 --> 00:25:51.703
that I couldn't understand before."

00:25:51.703 --> 00:25:54.036
So, that's been a real gift.

00:25:55.948 --> 00:25:59.126
But, yeah, I say it's
cross-cultural communication

00:25:59.126 --> 00:26:03.620
because I'm using the
model that I developed

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.614
based on New York versus
California ways of speaking.

00:26:07.614 --> 00:26:08.876
Girls play with girls.

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:09.935
Boys play with boys.

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:12.139
They are treated differently growing up.

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:13.601
They learn ways of using language

00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:15.723
among their same sex peers.

00:26:15.723 --> 00:26:17.512
They bring those ways of using language

00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:21.679
to conversations with men
and women they're close to.

00:26:22.845 --> 00:26:25.944
And I use this metaphor, too, sometimes,

00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:28.432
that women expect their
husbands, their boyfriends,

00:26:28.432 --> 00:26:31.693
their male partners, if
they're heterosexual,

00:26:31.693 --> 00:26:34.954
to be a new and improved
version of a best friend.

00:26:34.954 --> 00:26:38.087
And they're frustrated when
it doesn't work out that way

00:26:38.087 --> 00:26:39.104
and it can come down to

00:26:39.104 --> 00:26:41.916
these different conversational styles.

00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:43.384
I can give you two key examples

00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:44.767
that turned out to be kind of like

00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:48.934
what I think of as the
greatest hits from that book.

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:52.593
One is a conversation, takes place when

00:26:52.593 --> 00:26:54.549
you're riding in the car.

00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:57.726
And the woman says to the
man, "Are you thirsty, dear?

00:26:57.726 --> 00:27:00.168
Would you like to stop for a drink?"

00:27:00.168 --> 00:27:02.822
And he isn't, so he says no.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:06.086
And then, later, it turns out
that she had wanted to stop.

00:27:06.086 --> 00:27:08.485
And this was told to me by the man

00:27:08.485 --> 00:27:10.899
and he said, "Why does
she play games with me?

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:12.813
Why did she want me to be a mind reader?

00:27:12.813 --> 00:27:15.709
Why didn't she just tell
me she wanted to stop?"

00:27:15.709 --> 00:27:18.479
And my comment was probably

00:27:18.479 --> 00:27:21.250
she didn't expect a yes/no answer.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.316
She probably expected something like,

00:27:24.316 --> 00:27:25.213
"I don't know.

00:27:25.213 --> 00:27:26.517
How do you feel about it?"

00:27:26.517 --> 00:27:28.513
And then she could say "I don't know.

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:29.857
How do you feel about it?"

00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:30.917
And then they could talk about

00:27:30.917 --> 00:27:32.587
how they both feel about it

00:27:32.587 --> 00:27:34.670
and come to a decision taking

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.031
everybody's preferences into account.

00:27:37.031 --> 00:27:39.230
So, again, we have
message and metamessage.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.390
When she asked, "Are you thirsty?

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.141
Would you like to stop for a drink?"

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:44.971
She's sending a metamessage.

00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:46.520
"I want to know what you want.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.555
I'm not gonna impose what I want on you."

00:27:48.555 --> 00:27:52.388
And, when he says no,
she hears a metamessage.

00:27:53.898 --> 00:27:55.039
"I don't care what you want.

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.749
We're gonna do what I want."

00:27:56.749 --> 00:27:59.153
This may come up later when he says

00:27:59.153 --> 00:28:00.008
"Why didn't you tell me?"

00:28:00.008 --> 00:28:02.756
And she says, "We always
do what you want, anyway."

00:28:02.756 --> 00:28:03.899
(laughter)

00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:07.399
So, it becomes a metamessage about caring.

00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:12.863
And that is so much the
case in close relationships.

00:28:12.863 --> 00:28:15.280
And I wanna be so clear here.

00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:17.915
Most people are inclined to think

00:28:17.915 --> 00:28:19.995
one way is good and the other is bad.

00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:22.113
So, there are those who think,

00:28:22.113 --> 00:28:23.861
"Of course she should say what she means.

00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:25.080
I hate this indirectness.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.752
It's passive aggressive."

00:28:26.752 --> 00:28:28.265
And there are those who think,

00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:31.444
"Of course it would be rude
to say, 'I want to stop.'

00:28:31.444 --> 00:28:32.420
That's terrible.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.925
You have to start vague and
find out where everybody is

00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:37.107
and make a decision taking

00:28:37.107 --> 00:28:39.263
everybody's preferences into account."

00:28:39.263 --> 00:28:41.135
Either one works well.

00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:42.477
- What was the second example?

00:28:42.477 --> 00:28:44.513
- Okay, this is a conversation where

00:28:44.513 --> 00:28:47.775
the end of the day, say,
and the woman is telling

00:28:47.775 --> 00:28:51.981
a man about a problem and
he tells her how to fix it.

00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:53.448
And she's frustrated.

00:28:53.448 --> 00:28:54.792
The comment I made at the time

00:28:54.792 --> 00:28:56.827
was she didn't want a solution.

00:28:56.827 --> 00:28:58.332
She wanted to talk about it.

00:28:58.332 --> 00:28:59.920
And he's frustrated because

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.751
why would you want to talk about it

00:29:01.751 --> 00:29:04.113
if you don't do anything about it.

00:29:04.113 --> 00:29:07.378
And I do trace this to ways of speaking

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.700
that are quite typical for women and men.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.083
And it's so important for me to say...

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.754
I can't say this enough.

00:29:12.754 --> 00:29:16.829
We're talking about tendencies,
typical, many, most.

00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:18.540
We're not saying all.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.048
Because there are so many
other influences, like culture.

00:29:22.048 --> 00:29:24.131
But the tendency is that,

00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:28.649
when women might say to
a friend about a problem,

00:29:28.649 --> 00:29:32.273
the friend might say, "Oh,
I don't think he said that."

00:29:32.273 --> 00:29:34.434
And then "What did you say?"

00:29:34.434 --> 00:29:37.329
And then "What do you
think you could have done?"

00:29:37.329 --> 00:29:40.590
And "What do you think
he'll do if you do that?"

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.382
You ask all these questions

00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:45.357
and you do work your way
around to giving advice.

00:29:45.357 --> 00:29:46.907
But you need all that information

00:29:46.907 --> 00:29:48.664
to know what advice to give.

00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:51.356
But, again, message and metamessage.

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:54.698
Being willing to engage in
an extended conversation

00:29:54.698 --> 00:29:57.913
about the problem that
someone you care about

00:29:57.913 --> 00:29:59.901
is experiencing that in itself

00:29:59.901 --> 00:30:02.319
sends a metamessage of caring.

00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:03.827
And so, the frustration, I think,

00:30:03.827 --> 00:30:06.067
is less she didn't want a solution

00:30:06.067 --> 00:30:08.425
than she didn't want it right off the bat.

00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:12.704
And the solution cuts
short the conversation.

00:30:12.704 --> 00:30:16.863
So, starting the conversation
was probably her motive.

00:30:16.863 --> 00:30:18.893
- Everybody has to go
out and read this book.

00:30:18.893 --> 00:30:20.477
'Cause it's mind opening.

00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:23.162
Especially a husband and wife.

00:30:23.162 --> 00:30:24.995
But maybe also others.

00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:28.461
In a nutshell, 'cause we had...

00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:31.311
I want to go on to political
stuff that you've written.

00:30:31.311 --> 00:30:34.144
That you talk about the difference

00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:39.193
in wanting solidarity versus
somebody wanting power.

00:30:41.955 --> 00:30:46.122
And you have a set of adjectives
and descriptive statements.

00:30:47.215 --> 00:30:48.632
Women versus men.

00:30:50.844 --> 00:30:53.694
And man, through socialization

00:30:53.694 --> 00:30:56.861
and their childhood and other factors,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.436
essentially are interested in hierarchy.

00:31:01.436 --> 00:31:03.105
They're interested in power.

00:31:03.105 --> 00:31:06.895
They're more focused on
"I'm up and you're down."

00:31:06.895 --> 00:31:11.538
Whereas women, as we said
earlier, are into solidarity.

00:31:11.538 --> 00:31:13.455
Caring about the other,

00:31:15.258 --> 00:31:18.425
bringing everyone along in the circle.

00:31:20.186 --> 00:31:22.103
- Yeah, so glad I'm you brought that up.

00:31:22.103 --> 00:31:24.888
But I wanna say, right off the bat,

00:31:24.888 --> 00:31:27.981
it isn't as absolute as that.

00:31:27.981 --> 00:31:31.484
Every interaction is a matter of balancing

00:31:31.484 --> 00:31:35.027
a hierarchical dynamic, that
is, who's up, who's down,

00:31:35.027 --> 00:31:38.207
and a closeness distance dynamic.

00:31:38.207 --> 00:31:40.165
Is this way of talking bring us closer

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.756
or pushing us farther apart?

00:31:41.756 --> 00:31:44.812
And we're both, women and
men, and all individuals.

00:31:44.812 --> 00:31:47.582
Always interested in all these levels.

00:31:47.582 --> 00:31:50.428
But it's very common for a woman and a man

00:31:50.428 --> 00:31:53.359
to walk away from the same conversation.

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:55.438
One having focused on the question

00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:58.330
"Does this put me in a one
up, one down position?"

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.487
And the other having
focused on the question

00:32:00.487 --> 00:32:03.422
"Does it bring us closer
or push us farther apart?"

00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:06.111
And, again, it's important to say

00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:10.104
tends to, common, often, not
everybody, and not always.

00:32:10.104 --> 00:32:13.239
But the example I gave earlier
is a perfect example of that.

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:15.032
The question "Where's your coat?"

00:32:15.032 --> 00:32:17.967
If you focus on the closeness-distance,

00:32:17.967 --> 00:32:22.168
I'm being friendly, showing
you that I care about you.

00:32:22.168 --> 00:32:26.286
The hierarchical
dimension is "Thanks mom."

00:32:26.286 --> 00:32:28.768
You're the mother talking to the child.

00:32:28.768 --> 00:32:32.027
Just a very few quick examples.

00:32:32.027 --> 00:32:33.088
Women, a man...

00:32:33.088 --> 00:32:35.164
These are all real
examples that I encountered

00:32:35.164 --> 00:32:37.401
and that I give in the book.

00:32:37.401 --> 00:32:39.805
Man tells his wife, "Hey, I got a call

00:32:39.805 --> 00:32:40.948
from my high school friend.

00:32:40.948 --> 00:32:42.212
He's gonna be in town Friday.

00:32:42.212 --> 00:32:44.368
I'm gonna have dinner with him."

00:32:44.368 --> 00:32:46.155
And she feels hurt.

00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:48.353
"You shouldn't present
this as a fete complete,

00:32:48.353 --> 00:32:50.433
we should discuss it.

00:32:50.433 --> 00:32:51.980
Maybe I had plans for Friday night.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.307
You know, we're in this together."

00:32:54.307 --> 00:32:56.993
And he said, "I can't tell my friend

00:32:56.993 --> 00:32:59.521
I need to ask my wife for permission."

00:32:59.521 --> 00:33:03.022
So, is checking with her
asking for permission?

00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:04.893
That's the who's up, who's down.

00:33:04.893 --> 00:33:06.531
Is it showing caring?

00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:07.364
"We're involved.

00:33:07.364 --> 00:33:09.876
Our lives are wrapped up together.

00:33:09.876 --> 00:33:11.991
There's somebody who's
going to be impacted

00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:14.732
if I make a decision to
have dinner with you."

00:33:14.732 --> 00:33:17.374
So, it's just which one you focus on.

00:33:17.374 --> 00:33:19.164
And I have many other examples like that.

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:22.786
- Maybe I should develop
an app as a wedding planner

00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:24.941
and make your book available

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:27.786
as a part of the gift package.

00:33:27.786 --> 00:33:31.570
Now, I want to actually
move to a different area,

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.487
which is about civic
discourse, politics today,

00:33:36.996 --> 00:33:40.333
and how some of your analysis might apply.

00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:44.500
And let me ask, in researching
for this interview,

00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:48.628
I found a book that you had written

00:33:50.881 --> 00:33:54.548
on a critique of America's
argument culture.

00:33:55.524 --> 00:33:59.108
And the book was published in 1999.

00:33:59.108 --> 00:34:00.617
Very prescient.

00:34:00.617 --> 00:34:02.737
Tell us about your idea there.

00:34:02.737 --> 00:34:03.594
- Yes, the book is called

00:34:03.594 --> 00:34:07.872
The Argument Culture: Stopping
America's War of Words.

00:34:07.872 --> 00:34:12.641
The hardback subtitle was
moving from debate to dialogue.

00:34:12.641 --> 00:34:15.489
The idea was that we are approaching...

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:17.814
I say we, our American culture,

00:34:17.814 --> 00:34:20.010
but, maybe more broadly, world culture,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.519
certainly European culture.

00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:24.574
We are approaching more and more things

00:34:24.574 --> 00:34:26.974
in an adversarial spirit.

00:34:26.974 --> 00:34:29.865
It's an overapplication
of the assumption that

00:34:29.865 --> 00:34:33.244
the best way to come to truth is debate.

00:34:33.244 --> 00:34:37.849
That means find two people
as opposed as possible,

00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:41.514
the most extreme ends of
the continuum as possible,

00:34:41.514 --> 00:34:43.797
and let them fight about it.

00:34:43.797 --> 00:34:46.236
And this brings us to all the aspects

00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:47.948
of the press that I write about.

00:34:47.948 --> 00:34:50.679
One is the tendency to approach everything

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.311
as two sides in a debate.

00:34:52.311 --> 00:34:54.022
Whereas most things don't have two sides.

00:34:54.022 --> 00:34:55.733
They have many sides.

00:34:55.733 --> 00:34:58.950
The other is the valuation of attack.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.111
And we have seen this more and more.

00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:05.278
That journalists see as their
responsibility to attack,

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:09.593
to find what's wrong, to
write negative stories.

00:35:09.593 --> 00:35:13.098
If you were to write a positive
story, that's a puff piece.

00:35:13.098 --> 00:35:14.684
And they're embarrassed to do that.

00:35:14.684 --> 00:35:17.902
It wouldn't be respected
by their colleagues.

00:35:17.902 --> 00:35:19.085
So, that's the press.

00:35:19.085 --> 00:35:21.165
And I also wrote about politics.

00:35:21.165 --> 00:35:23.697
There was so much evidence
at the time that I wrote it

00:35:23.697 --> 00:35:25.734
and there's more now that,

00:35:25.734 --> 00:35:28.828
whereas in the past, the two
parties could work together,

00:35:28.828 --> 00:35:30.455
at least to some degree.

00:35:30.455 --> 00:35:33.262
That it had become so polarized that

00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:36.358
there was no meeting ground at all.

00:35:36.358 --> 00:35:38.517
And, of course, it's the Republicans,

00:35:38.517 --> 00:35:40.998
we might as well just say it
out there, because it's true,

00:35:40.998 --> 00:35:44.054
that the Republicans have decided that

00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:47.805
the path forward is to oppose
anything the Democrats want.

00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.517
And it may be what they wanted before,

00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:50.774
but now the Democrats want it,

00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:53.094
so they're just gonna stop it.

00:35:53.094 --> 00:35:56.594
And so, the press, politics, and academia.

00:35:57.574 --> 00:36:00.180
And that's kind of where
I started with all this.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.885
That many people feel the
way to start an article

00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:05.968
in an academic article...

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:10.818
Say what's been done before
and what's wrong with it.

00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:13.218
So that you can be right
and they can be wrong.

00:36:13.218 --> 00:36:15.617
But that isn't the way we're
gonna come to understanding.

00:36:15.617 --> 00:36:17.821
Yeah, sometimes it's great to say,

00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.043
"Read this article.

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.715
Tell me what's wrong with it."

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:22.593
But there are other
things you can do, too.

00:36:22.593 --> 00:36:25.441
"Read this article and see
what you can use in it."

00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:28.330
Things you don't agree with,
where did it come from?

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:31.226
Maybe it comes out of a
different intellectual tradition.

00:36:31.226 --> 00:36:33.384
How was it related to things we've read

00:36:33.384 --> 00:36:35.092
in the intellectual tradition we prefer?

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.618
- So, synthesis and integration

00:36:37.618 --> 00:36:41.785
and respectful reading of
those you oppose, in a way.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.012
- Yes, you're right to
use the word respectful,

00:36:46.012 --> 00:36:48.089
but I think some people would see

00:36:48.089 --> 00:36:50.534
the oppositional discourse as respectful.

00:36:50.534 --> 00:36:52.529
And, in fact, they might think that,

00:36:52.529 --> 00:36:55.992
if you don't attack and
ask critical questions,

00:36:55.992 --> 00:36:58.437
that's a lack of respect.

00:36:58.437 --> 00:37:02.224
So, what I'm trying to
call attention to there

00:37:02.224 --> 00:37:03.777
is something a little bit different.

00:37:03.777 --> 00:37:07.122
That we should realize this
is not the only way to truth

00:37:07.122 --> 00:37:10.011
and that it has many
negative consequences.

00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:13.434
And what I had in mind
there, among others,

00:37:13.434 --> 00:37:16.369
was ways that it obscures truth.

00:37:16.369 --> 00:37:18.363
And, goodness, we are seeing this

00:37:18.363 --> 00:37:20.613
in the current environment.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.981
If journalists are gonna
put everything into...

00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:28.227
One example of this is the idea that

00:37:28.227 --> 00:37:30.142
everything is opposing camps.

00:37:30.142 --> 00:37:32.229
You end up with this false equivalence.

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:35.811
I have to have two sides to every debate.

00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:37.969
So, if I'm gonna write
about climate change,

00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:41.150
I need to say something
about the people who oppose,

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.302
who say there's no such
thing as climate change.

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:46.517
But the fact is there's only
a few people who say that

00:37:46.517 --> 00:37:48.108
and they're all the same ones.

00:37:48.108 --> 00:37:51.038
And they were funded by
the fossil fuel industry.

00:37:51.038 --> 00:37:52.625
And yet, there they were, over and over,

00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:55.231
again, back in the late '90s,

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:59.347
being cited as if this were
really two sides of a debate.

00:37:59.347 --> 00:38:02.204
I use the example of the Holocaust.

00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:04.894
The United States, in the United States,

00:38:04.894 --> 00:38:06.689
Holocaust deniers have had

00:38:06.689 --> 00:38:09.784
more success than any other country.

00:38:09.784 --> 00:38:12.810
And I was able to show
that the reason was that

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.659
here they could masquerade as

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:17.654
the other side in a debate.

00:38:17.654 --> 00:38:20.716
And there's no better example that

00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:23.532
there are some situations
where there is no other side.

00:38:23.532 --> 00:38:25.203
There's truth.

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:28.203
- You wrote this in the '90s, 1990s.

00:38:29.527 --> 00:38:31.113
It's gotten much worse.

00:38:31.113 --> 00:38:34.030
And you talk about the factors that

00:38:34.899 --> 00:38:37.816
influence the conversational style.

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:43.614
And we're seeing stark inequality.

00:38:43.614 --> 00:38:45.848
City-rural divide.

00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:49.515
Cosmopolitanism versus provincialism.

00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:52.682
So, I guess, what we're witnessing now

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.390
is two tribes, basically, where there's

00:38:59.385 --> 00:39:03.292
an enormous amount of miscommunication,

00:39:03.292 --> 00:39:07.038
as you talked about with
regard to men and women.

00:39:07.038 --> 00:39:11.205
But it's social, in a rather
stark and terrifying way.

00:39:13.478 --> 00:39:14.332
- You're absolutely right.

00:39:14.332 --> 00:39:16.002
And I'm gonna give a shout out now

00:39:16.002 --> 00:39:18.608
to another book that was
just recently published.

00:39:18.608 --> 00:39:21.789
It's called One Nation After Trump.

00:39:21.789 --> 00:39:26.555
And it's by three very
gifted political scientists,

00:39:26.555 --> 00:39:30.468
E.J. Dionne, Norm
Ornstein, and Thomas Mann,

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.415
who's right here in Berkeley.

00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:36.582
And they are so convincing
and significant, I think,

00:39:37.707 --> 00:39:40.560
in what they point out
how did we get here.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.176
And they point out that Trump being...

00:39:44.176 --> 00:39:45.602
I won't say being elected.

00:39:45.602 --> 00:39:49.839
But becoming president is the culmination

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:53.256
of forces that can be traced very clearly

00:39:54.242 --> 00:39:57.316
to Newt Gingrich in the Republican Party

00:39:57.316 --> 00:39:59.963
and his decision that the way for

00:39:59.963 --> 00:40:02.164
Republicans to gain power was to

00:40:02.164 --> 00:40:06.118
oppose everything that the Democrats do

00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:09.046
and to demonize government.

00:40:09.046 --> 00:40:11.658
Make government into the enemy.

00:40:11.658 --> 00:40:14.426
And to demonize journalists.

00:40:14.426 --> 00:40:15.933
Make them the enemy.

00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:20.660
And they show in this book
how this has been incremental,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.025
but it didn't just come out of nowhere.

00:40:23.025 --> 00:40:24.084
And so, you could say that

00:40:24.084 --> 00:40:25.634
some of what they're describing there

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:28.738
is what I described in the
book The Argument Culture.

00:40:28.738 --> 00:40:32.655
The valorization of attack
as a mean to an end.

00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:37.725
- Let's look at the two candidates

00:40:38.801 --> 00:40:41.882
in our last presidential election.

00:40:41.882 --> 00:40:46.049
We were left with Trump for
various kinds of reasons

00:40:48.565 --> 00:40:51.898
that defy conventional political wisdom.

00:40:54.402 --> 00:40:57.652
But it's as if Trump now, as president,

00:40:59.978 --> 00:41:03.978
is an extreme version of
a style of conversation

00:41:06.902 --> 00:41:11.069
that emphasizes power,
hierarchy, and a dismissiveness

00:41:14.923 --> 00:41:18.384
that's really quite extraordinary.

00:41:18.384 --> 00:41:20.093
- Yes, well, for one thing,

00:41:20.093 --> 00:41:23.967
it breaks all the norms
of political discourse.

00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:27.792
Something, again, that
Ornstein, Dionne, and Mann

00:41:27.792 --> 00:41:29.626
write about in their book.

00:41:29.626 --> 00:41:33.126
It's normalizing a kind of discourse that,

00:41:35.814 --> 00:41:38.377
in the past, you would have
seen only in the street.

00:41:38.377 --> 00:41:41.593
It was not in the public domain.

00:41:41.593 --> 00:41:44.855
So, sending out these
tweets, insulting people,

00:41:44.855 --> 00:41:47.871
saying things that are completely untrue,

00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:49.703
and, because you say them
and you say them again,

00:41:49.703 --> 00:41:52.229
some people will believe you.

00:41:52.229 --> 00:41:53.576
I think all of this is breaking

00:41:53.576 --> 00:41:55.574
all the norms of political discourse

00:41:55.574 --> 00:41:58.137
and that's partly what's
happening with Trump.

00:41:58.137 --> 00:41:59.683
And this is, in a way, again,

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.598
it's the culmination of something that

00:42:01.598 --> 00:42:04.609
we've been building toward for a while.

00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:07.301
And that is what would have been

00:42:07.301 --> 00:42:10.193
just in the conversational everyday domain

00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:12.190
moving into the public domain.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.370
So, whereas before...

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.347
And I've sometimes traced
this back to Ronald Reagan.

00:42:16.347 --> 00:42:17.896
He was called a great communicator.

00:42:17.896 --> 00:42:19.771
He was not a great orator.

00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:21.074
But he was able to make

00:42:21.074 --> 00:42:24.491
his public speeches sound conversational.

00:42:25.354 --> 00:42:27.559
And that isn't a malign, in itself.

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:29.345
I mean, Clinton was great at that.

00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:31.751
And I think he used it to good effect.

00:42:31.751 --> 00:42:36.244
But I wanna say something I
think is so important here.

00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:40.888
A lot of people are asking how
did Trump become president?

00:42:40.888 --> 00:42:43.009
How did so many people vote for Trump

00:42:43.009 --> 00:42:45.411
knowing what we knew about him?

00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:47.691
I think it's equally important to ask

00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:51.314
how did so many people not
vote for Hillary Clinton

00:42:51.314 --> 00:42:54.619
given all the excellent
things we knew about her?

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:57.702
Given her vastly superior experience?

00:42:59.103 --> 00:43:02.353
Her vastly superior fitness for office?

00:43:03.507 --> 00:43:05.420
And I think there are two explanations.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.271
And one is the argument culture.

00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:12.271
From the time that she
entered the public stage,

00:43:13.247 --> 00:43:16.164
way back, 1992, she was the wife of

00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:20.408
a candidate in the Democratic primary.

00:43:21.529 --> 00:43:25.358
I wrote an op-ed called
The Hillary Factor.

00:43:25.358 --> 00:43:28.108
Whatever she did she was slammed.

00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:31.662
Her hair in the beginning was very simple.

00:43:31.662 --> 00:43:34.107
She kept it back with a headband.

00:43:34.107 --> 00:43:35.571
She was ridiculed for that.

00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.502
She had it styled and colored.

00:43:38.502 --> 00:43:39.724
She was ridiculed for that.

00:43:39.724 --> 00:43:40.779
She's having a makeover.

00:43:40.779 --> 00:43:42.651
She's manipulative.

00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:44.689
She was thought to be childless,

00:43:44.689 --> 00:43:48.145
which is quite stigmatized for women.

00:43:48.145 --> 00:43:50.140
That was because they kept
their daughter, Chelsea,

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.607
out of the public eye.

00:43:51.607 --> 00:43:53.931
So, they made it known
that they had a daughter.

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.927
She was accused, in Time Magazine,

00:43:55.927 --> 00:43:59.022
for yuppie overdoting on her daughter.

00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:01.175
I mean, these are kind of simple examples,

00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:05.773
but whatever she did she was
slammed for and accused for.

00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:08.631
And I think much of it was

00:44:08.631 --> 00:44:11.486
a very knee jerk response
on the part of journalists

00:44:11.486 --> 00:44:14.379
that they really felt it's their job

00:44:14.379 --> 00:44:16.705
to always write negative things.

00:44:16.705 --> 00:44:18.173
And this had...

00:44:18.173 --> 00:44:19.354
So, there's a number of ways that

00:44:19.354 --> 00:44:22.041
this played out in this last election.

00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:24.613
One is we had been hearing

00:44:24.613 --> 00:44:27.946
terrible accusations of her for decades.

00:44:29.774 --> 00:44:33.161
And so, there's a smoke,
there's fire feeling to it.

00:44:33.161 --> 00:44:36.092
She must have done something in Benghazi.

00:44:36.092 --> 00:44:38.132
She must have done
something in Whitewater.

00:44:38.132 --> 00:44:39.479
It turned out she didn't.

00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:41.963
All those years of
Whitewater investigations

00:44:41.963 --> 00:44:43.023
showed there was nothing.

00:44:43.023 --> 00:44:44.366
No wrongdoing.

00:44:44.366 --> 00:44:46.199
But the smoke is left.

00:44:47.499 --> 00:44:49.047
And so, there's a feeling that

00:44:49.047 --> 00:44:51.326
she's been criticized so much.

00:44:51.326 --> 00:44:55.493
And, again, Ornstein and
the others make this point.

00:44:56.539 --> 00:44:58.859
Trump had done so many things wrong that

00:44:58.859 --> 00:45:02.073
every day there was a new scandal.

00:45:02.073 --> 00:45:04.720
There was so little to
say against Hillary.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.204
There was just emails,
which, by the way, again,

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.854
I believe was mostly fabricated.

00:45:09.854 --> 00:45:12.756
A fabrication of how
serious this error was.

00:45:12.756 --> 00:45:14.749
But you read about emails every day,

00:45:14.749 --> 00:45:16.703
because they had to attack her, too.

00:45:16.703 --> 00:45:20.200
And so, people ended up thinking
this email stuff was huge

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.272
and forgetting about all these things

00:45:22.272 --> 00:45:23.495
that they read about him.

00:45:23.495 --> 00:45:26.307
So, that's one thing I think
the argument culture...

00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:28.474
All those years of attack.

00:45:29.608 --> 00:45:31.482
And the other is what I write about as

00:45:31.482 --> 00:45:35.356
a double bind that faces women
in positions of authority.

00:45:35.356 --> 00:45:36.986
- And you wrote this in the 1990s.

00:45:36.986 --> 00:45:38.958
- That's right, 1992.

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:42.958
- In a collection of
writers talk about Hillary.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.208
- Yes, yes, yes, I have an
article called The Double Bind.

00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:50.789
And it's in a book 13 Ways
of Looking at Hillary.

00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:53.122
Yeah, so, just very briefly.

00:45:55.146 --> 00:45:57.470
A double bind is a situation where

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:01.222
you have two requirements
you must fulfill.

00:46:01.222 --> 00:46:04.037
But anything you do to fulfill one

00:46:04.037 --> 00:46:06.487
actually violates the other.

00:46:06.487 --> 00:46:08.687
When women are in positions of authority,

00:46:08.687 --> 00:46:10.475
they have requirement be a good woman

00:46:10.475 --> 00:46:14.021
and requirement be a good leader.

00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.656
Our expectations of a good woman

00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:17.769
and a good leader are at odds.

00:46:17.769 --> 00:46:21.070
So, to be a good woman, you
should be self-deprecating.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.109
You shouldn't seem too sure of yourself.

00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:24.833
You shouldn't put yourself forward.

00:46:24.833 --> 00:46:27.154
You shouldn't talk about
what you're good at.

00:46:27.154 --> 00:46:29.678
If you're a good leader, you
should put yourself forward.

00:46:29.678 --> 00:46:31.753
You should seem confident.

00:46:31.753 --> 00:46:34.275
You should downplay anything you did wrong

00:46:34.275 --> 00:46:36.925
and play up everything you've contributed.

00:46:36.925 --> 00:46:39.696
And so, women are in a double bind.

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:44.376
If they fulfill our expectations
of a person in authority,

00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:46.741
then they're respected,
but they're not liked.

00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:49.998
If they fulfill our
expectations of a woman,

00:46:49.998 --> 00:46:52.687
they're liked, but they're underestimated.

00:46:52.687 --> 00:46:55.354
And I came upon this observation

00:46:56.638 --> 00:46:58.223
and this way of looking at things

00:46:58.223 --> 00:47:01.445
in research I did on
women in the workplace.

00:47:01.445 --> 00:47:04.504
And that was a book called
Talking From Nine to Five.

00:47:04.504 --> 00:47:06.906
That's where I first wrote about that.

00:47:06.906 --> 00:47:10.042
Where women in positions of
authority in the workplace

00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:12.897
faced this double bind and still do.

00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:15.174
But it clearly was going on with Hillary.

00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:17.908
And I believe that that played a huge role

00:47:17.908 --> 00:47:20.102
in all the people who
would say things like

00:47:20.102 --> 00:47:21.204
"I don't know.

00:47:21.204 --> 00:47:23.520
I just don't like her.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.650
Why is she shouting?"

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.416
She didn't talk any more
loudly than Bernie Sanders did,

00:47:28.416 --> 00:47:29.718
but, when a man shouts,

00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:32.406
he's addressing thousands of
people, you have to shout.

00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:33.627
That felt okay.

00:47:33.627 --> 00:47:37.088
But you hear a woman shouting,
it rubs you the wrong way.

00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:38.639
- There's another element in this

00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:39.740
that I wanna ask you about.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.240
'Cause you have an interest in

00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:47.283
communication on different platforms.

00:47:47.283 --> 00:47:51.843
Trump was the first to
effectively use Twitter

00:47:51.843 --> 00:47:54.364
in a political campaign.

00:47:54.364 --> 00:47:58.531
What do you have to say,
as a linguist, about that.

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:02.526
Because it's really become

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.287
an important element of communicating.

00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:11.644
He is in your face.

00:48:11.644 --> 00:48:13.274
I'm the man.

00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:14.357
I'm the boss.

00:48:15.783 --> 00:48:18.533
Hierarchical way of thinking that

00:48:19.632 --> 00:48:22.382
is so dismissive of anything that

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:27.206
tries to achieve solidarity,

00:48:27.206 --> 00:48:29.632
asking people what they think, and so on.

00:48:29.632 --> 00:48:30.782
- Well, there's a number of things

00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:33.331
we could say about using
Twitter in this way.

00:48:33.331 --> 00:48:36.138
First of all, it goes directly to people.

00:48:36.138 --> 00:48:39.678
It cuts out all the middlemen in the past

00:48:39.678 --> 00:48:42.178
that would have been a filter.

00:48:43.066 --> 00:48:44.819
And sometimes that's good.

00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:45.919
I mean, it's a little bit...

00:48:45.919 --> 00:48:46.909
You could say an extension of

00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:49.598
what Roosevelt did with fireside chats.

00:48:49.598 --> 00:48:51.308
Go right to people.

00:48:51.308 --> 00:48:54.975
Because of its brevity,
it becomes epithets.

00:48:58.272 --> 00:49:00.633
You don't have to explain
what you're saying.

00:49:00.633 --> 00:49:02.709
Just throw something out.

00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:06.013
And he uses language that is completely...

00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:08.090
Again, about breaking norms.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.779
Completely inappropriate
to public discourse

00:49:10.779 --> 00:49:13.877
and to diplomacy and to any sense of

00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:16.156
the dignity of his office.

00:49:16.156 --> 00:49:17.745
It's kind of like what you
would say in the street

00:49:17.745 --> 00:49:19.088
when you're were mad at somebody

00:49:19.088 --> 00:49:21.794
and you wanna cast aspersions on them.

00:49:21.794 --> 00:49:25.009
But that is perfectly suited to Twitter.

00:49:25.009 --> 00:49:27.676
And so, people that are his fans

00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:31.455
pick this up and it's great.

00:49:31.455 --> 00:49:32.516
They got their whole story.

00:49:32.516 --> 00:49:34.348
They don't want the backstory.

00:49:34.348 --> 00:49:38.259
They just get this little bit
and it resonates with them.

00:49:38.259 --> 00:49:39.400
"He's insulting somebody.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.233
I like that.

00:49:40.233 --> 00:49:41.066
I insult people.

00:49:41.066 --> 00:49:43.310
I think those people
are pretty crummy, too."

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:45.018
And so, it's satisfying, I think,

00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:48.556
in a way that can be very
politically effective

00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:52.057
in a very dangerous, of course, way.

00:49:52.057 --> 00:49:55.110
- Does a linguist have anything to offer

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.943
about how we transcend
these tribal divisions?

00:50:01.567 --> 00:50:04.734
It's cross-cultural communication now.

00:50:05.578 --> 00:50:06.802
The world we're in.

00:50:06.802 --> 00:50:08.969
What can we do about that?

00:50:11.894 --> 00:50:13.439
- I'm asked this all the time.

00:50:13.439 --> 00:50:16.617
And I so wish I had an answer.

00:50:16.617 --> 00:50:19.063
I do believe that what we're dealing with

00:50:19.063 --> 00:50:21.550
is way deeper than just
ways of using language.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.967
Language is always a huge part of things.

00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:28.513
I wish I could say if we talk this way,

00:50:28.513 --> 00:50:31.199
we're gonna bridge those divides.

00:50:31.199 --> 00:50:32.992
The problem is that there are

00:50:32.992 --> 00:50:34.909
people who want these divides.

00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:37.881
They're finding it useful.

00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:40.516
And they are gonna continue to try to

00:50:40.516 --> 00:50:42.938
stoke the flames of division.

00:50:42.938 --> 00:50:45.627
And so, given that, what can we,

00:50:45.627 --> 00:50:49.377
as the people who want
the divisions bridged,

00:50:50.675 --> 00:50:51.925
what can we do?

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.192
I mean, if it's helpful to understand

00:50:55.192 --> 00:50:58.166
what your enemies think,
yeah, you could listen.

00:50:58.166 --> 00:50:59.265
You could try to get to the bottom

00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:01.463
of what's motivating them.

00:51:01.463 --> 00:51:04.570
I think that's always a good thing to do.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.527
I think talking, personally,

00:51:06.527 --> 00:51:07.828
to people who disagree with you

00:51:07.828 --> 00:51:10.806
is always a hugely useful thing to do.

00:51:10.806 --> 00:51:13.414
Both to understand what motivates them.

00:51:13.414 --> 00:51:16.757
And, maybe, eventually, to try
changing their minds a bit.

00:51:16.757 --> 00:51:20.545
And there, certainly, the
first thing to do is to listen.

00:51:20.545 --> 00:51:22.256
Don't start right out trying to tell them

00:51:22.256 --> 00:51:24.212
why they're wrong and you're right.

00:51:24.212 --> 00:51:26.209
And maybe find some common ground

00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:29.714
that you could build on to
offer another perspective

00:51:29.714 --> 00:51:32.116
that they might consider.

00:51:32.116 --> 00:51:35.866
But the broad forces
that we're up against...

00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:39.690
The position that the
Republican Party has taken.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.865
And they're one of the two
parties running our country.

00:51:42.865 --> 00:51:44.372
That's very challenging.

00:51:44.372 --> 00:51:46.409
And I'm not sure that I have

00:51:46.409 --> 00:51:48.568
anything that I can recommend
in terms of language

00:51:48.568 --> 00:51:51.789
that could work against that.

00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:54.761
But I think trying to change
it in our personal lives

00:51:54.761 --> 00:51:56.593
is certainly something worth doing.

00:51:56.593 --> 00:52:00.858
When we feel ourselves
responding to others

00:52:00.858 --> 00:52:03.191
in a really corrosive way...

00:52:04.448 --> 00:52:05.590
"You're evil.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.854
I'm good."

00:52:06.854 --> 00:52:11.021
To maybe try to temper that
and reframe it in some way.

00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:15.815
- After reading your
books and your papers,

00:52:15.815 --> 00:52:19.971
I'm struck by, also,
it's possible relevance

00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:21.679
to this free speech debate.

00:52:21.679 --> 00:52:23.394
And I have a question for you,

00:52:23.394 --> 00:52:25.672
which is, especially at Berkeley,

00:52:25.672 --> 00:52:28.771
free speech meant something.

00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:31.604
And we now have new actors who are

00:52:32.929 --> 00:52:37.249
changing the conversation
about free speech,

00:52:37.249 --> 00:52:41.166
because, really, their
metacommunication is not

00:52:42.336 --> 00:52:44.452
"What I have to say is important."

00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:47.702
But, rather, how can what I say disrupt

00:52:48.847 --> 00:52:52.960
the context in which the
conversation is happening?

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.134
- This is becoming extremely complicated.

00:52:56.134 --> 00:52:57.521
I think, at one time, that

00:52:57.521 --> 00:53:01.837
Berkeley Free Speech Movement,
back in the '60s, was clear.

00:53:01.837 --> 00:53:04.279
"The bad guys wanna suppress our speech.

00:53:04.279 --> 00:53:05.255
We're the good guys.

00:53:05.255 --> 00:53:06.681
We have a right to speak."

00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:08.594
Now, that was pretty easy.

00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:12.090
Maybe not easy to achieve,
but easy to feel clear on.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.001
We now have people pointing out that,

00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:15.706
if you allow people to speak

00:53:15.706 --> 00:53:18.797
and what they're speaking is hate speech

00:53:18.797 --> 00:53:21.630
and encouraging others to demonize

00:53:24.638 --> 00:53:26.062
people who are different...

00:53:26.062 --> 00:53:27.242
And it's true.

00:53:27.242 --> 00:53:31.767
A lot of this is reminiscent
of times in the past

00:53:31.767 --> 00:53:34.783
when speech that demonizes
people you disagree with

00:53:34.783 --> 00:53:36.335
has led to violence.

00:53:36.335 --> 00:53:38.904
And there's plenty of
evidence that it does.

00:53:38.904 --> 00:53:41.062
You know, you're out there
saying you hate immigrants

00:53:41.062 --> 00:53:43.383
and then someone goes and
beats up an immigrant.

00:53:43.383 --> 00:53:44.851
Or shoots them.

00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:47.018
So, it's very complicated.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.020
Especially, I think, for people who

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.179
see themselves as liberal.

00:53:52.179 --> 00:53:56.872
Who are inclined to be,
perhaps, free speech extremists.

00:53:56.872 --> 00:54:00.217
Everybody should be allowed to speak.

00:54:00.217 --> 00:54:04.371
I think there are people
who would see us liberals...

00:54:04.371 --> 00:54:06.288
And I say us, because,
perhaps, at one time,

00:54:06.288 --> 00:54:08.854
I would have been in that camp.

00:54:08.854 --> 00:54:10.812
As part of the problem.

00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:14.107
Because we are trying to make it easier

00:54:14.107 --> 00:54:15.570
for people to speak in a way

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.443
that is going to incite violence

00:54:17.443 --> 00:54:21.610
and lead to real, minimally,
discrimination and worse.

00:54:23.563 --> 00:54:25.032
So, I think it's pretty...

00:54:25.032 --> 00:54:27.394
It's become much more complicated an issue

00:54:27.394 --> 00:54:30.324
than it seemed to be in the '60s.

00:54:30.324 --> 00:54:32.080
- Professor Tannen, I want
to thank you very much

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.748
for joining us today.

00:54:33.748 --> 00:54:36.888
It was a very informative conversation.

00:54:36.888 --> 00:54:40.633
And I recommend that the audience go about

00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:44.546
and buy, if not one,
several of your books.

00:54:44.546 --> 00:54:45.808
Thank you very much.

00:54:45.808 --> 00:54:46.641
- Thank you.

00:54:46.641 --> 00:54:47.474
It's been a pleasure.

00:54:47.474 --> 00:54:50.334
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:54:50.334 --> 00:54:53.251
for this Conversation with History.
