00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.732
Returning to our narrative structures, we've now seen a few examples of

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:08.000
author-driven, viewer-driven, and martini glass visual narratives.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.760
Think about these narrative structures and how they can be utilized in

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.360
your own work when creating or improving data visualizations.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.830
There's no one size fits all approach to storytelling, and what structure you

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.140
choose will depend on the narrative and ultimately the data itself.
