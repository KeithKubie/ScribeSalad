00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.047
- [Voiceover] Hello, friends,

00:00:02.047 --> 00:00:04.446
and welcome to the distant past,

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:07.046
because today we're talking
about the past tense,

00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:10.792
which refers to stuff
that has already happened.

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:12.660
There are many ways to
form the past tense,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.242
but for now I just wanna
focus on the basic version,

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.763
which is just adding "-ed".

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:21.513
So if you take a word like "walk"

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.020
as in, "I walk to the store,"

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.893
no, not the store, to the moon.

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:33.135
I'm going to the moon on foot,

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:34.551
try and stop me.

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:37.078
That's in the present tense,

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.499
but if I wanted to put that in the past,

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.583
I would say, "I walked to the moon."

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.234
I've got very strong legs and good shoes.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:54.691
So this sentence is happening now.

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:56.191
It's the present.

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:01.719
This sentence happened earlier.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:05.515
It's the past.

00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:08.133
SO, the simplest way to figure out

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.408
whether or not something
is in the past tense

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:13.989
or if you want to put
something in the past tense,

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:17.238
is this thing, this "ed" ending.

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:20.155
So you go from "walk" to "walked",

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.722
"talk" to "talked", "sneeze" to "sneezed",

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:33.968
"jump" to "jumped" and "open" to "opened"

00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:41.692
So, if it doesn't end with
with an "e", you add an "ed".

00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:43.195
If it does end with an "e",

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:45.715
you just add the "d".

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:47.099
That's how to form the past tense.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.643
That's what the past tense does.

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:50.351
It's stuff that's already happened,

00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:52.549
and most of the time when you wanna form

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.508
the past tense out of a word,

00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:56.091
you just add "ed".

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:58.025
You can learn anything.

00:01:58.025 --> 00:01:58.859
David, out.
