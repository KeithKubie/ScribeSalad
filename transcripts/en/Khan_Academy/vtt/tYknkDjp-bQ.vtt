00:00:00.518 --> 00:00:02.084
- [Voiceover] The
rectangle below has an area

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:05.218
of 12x to the fourth plus 6x to the third

00:00:05.218 --> 00:00:08.951
plus 15x squared square meters.

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:10.319
And we can see the area right over here

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.084
and they broke it up; this
green area is 12x to the fourth,

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.185
this purple area is 6x to the third,

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:16.818
this blue area is 15x squared.

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:19.651
You add 'em all together,
you get this entire rectangle

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.818
which would be the combined
area is 12x to the fourth

00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:24.718
plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared.

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:26.851
The length of the rectangle in meters,

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.384
so this is the length right over here

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:29.617
that we're talking about, so we're talking

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:31.950
about this distance.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.984
The length of the rectangle
in meters is equal to

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:39.818
the greatest common monomial
factor of 12x to the fourth,

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:41.784
6x to the third,

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:45.218
and 15x squared.

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:48.351
What is the length and
width of the rectangle?

00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:50.398
I encourage you to pause the video and try

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.184
to work through it on your own.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.444
Well the key realization
here is that the length

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:57.551
times the width, the
length times the width

00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:00.652
is going to be equal to this area.

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:03.884
And if the length is the
greatest common monomial factor

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.151
of these terms, of 12x to the fourth,

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.418
6x third, and 15x squared,

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:10.684
well then we can factor that
out and then what we have

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:14.251
left over is going to be the width.

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.118
So let's figure out what
is the greatest common

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.194
monomial factor

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:21.504
of these three terms.

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:23.218
And the first thing we
could look at is let's look

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:24.584
at the coefficients.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.384
Let's figure out what's
the greatest common factor

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.585
of 12, six, and 15.

00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:32.218
And there is a couple
of ways you could do it.

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:35.218
You could do it by looking
at a prime factorization,

00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:36.984
you could say alright,

00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:41.017
well 12 is two times six

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.818
which is two times three,

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:45.785
that's the prime factorization of 12.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:49.451
Prime factorization of six
is just two times three.

00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:51.941
Prime factorization of 15

00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:56.451
is three times five.

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.751
And so the greatest common factor,

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:03.118
the largest factor that's
divisible into all of them,

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:07.684
so let's see, we can
throw a three in there.

00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:11.018
Three is divisible into all of them.

00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:13.684
And that's it 'cause we
can't say a three and a two.

00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:16.751
A three and a two would be
divisible into 12 and six,

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:18.952
but there's no two
that's divisible into 15.

00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:21.151
We can't say a three and a five
'cause five isn't divisible

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.884
into 12 or six; so the
greatest common factor

00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:26.218
is going to be three.

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:27.818
Another way we could have done
this is we could have said

00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:31.751
where are the non-prime factors
of each of these numbers.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.084
12 you could have said, OK I can get 12

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:37.551
by saying one times 12

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.018
or two times six

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:43.985
or three times four.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.985
Six you could have said,

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:49.884
let's see, that could be one
times six or two times three.

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:51.651
So those are the factors of six.

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.518
And then 15 you could have
said well one times 15

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.517
or three times five.

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:01.218
And so you say the greatest common factor?

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.985
Well three is the largest
number that I've listed here

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.784
that is common to all
three of these factors.

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:10.284
So once again, the greatest common factor

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:12.851
of 12, six, and 15 is three.

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.051
So when we're looking at the
greatest common monomial factor

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:18.184
the coefficient is going to be three.

00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:20.218
And then we look at these powers of X.

00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:22.571
We have X to the fourth.

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.318
I'm using a different color.

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:27.858
We have X to the fourth,

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:30.478
X to the third, and X squared.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:31.850
Well what's the largest power of X

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.484
that's divisible into all of those?

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.585
Well it's going to be X squared.

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.117
X squared is divisible
into X to the fourth

00:03:36.117 --> 00:03:38.950
and X to the third and of
course X squared itself.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.351
So the greatest common
monomial factor is 3x squared.

00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:44.251
This length right over here,

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.551
this is 3x squared.

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.851
So if this is 3x squared,
we can then figure out

00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:52.368
what the width is.

00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:57.218
If we were to divide 12x to
the fourth by 3x squared,

00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:58.018
what do we get?

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:01.452
Well 12 divided by three is four

00:04:01.452 --> 00:04:03.619
and X to the fourth divided by X squared

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.485
is X squared.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.051
Notice 3x squared times 4x squared

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.218
is 12x to the fourth.

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:12.217
And then we move over
to this purple section.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:15.385
If we take 6x to the third
divided by 3x squared,

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.884
six divided by three is two.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.151
And then X to the third
divided by X squared

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:23.617
is just going to be X.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:27.718
And then last but not least, we have

00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:30.985
15 divided by three is going to be five.

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:32.652
X squared divided by
X squared is just one,

00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:33.950
so it's just gonna be five.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.418
So the width is going to be 4x squared,

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:39.251
plus 2x, plus five.

00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.218
So once again, the length,
we figure that out,

00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:45.217
is the greatest common
monomial factor of these terms.

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:47.684
It's 3x squared.

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:50.750
And the width is 4x squared

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.584
plus 2x, plus five.

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:56.512
And one way to think about
it is we just factored

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:57.785
this expression over here.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:01.195
We could write that.

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:03.485
Actually I wanna see the original thing.

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:06.951
We could write that 3x squared

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:09.445
times 4x squared,

00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:12.555
plus 2x, plus five

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.818
which is the entire width,
well that's going to be

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:16.284
equal to the area.

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:18.385
That's going to be equal
to our original expression:

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.484
12x to the fourth power

00:05:20.484 --> 00:05:22.751
plus 6x to the third

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.132
plus 15x squared.
