00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.030
Hotels.ng is an online
hotel booking portal,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.380
and right now we're the
biggest online hotel booking

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.510
portal in Nigeria.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.865
Our technology is a little
bit different from that that

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:19.580
is used by the major traveling
sites like Booking.com

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.440
and so on, in that we
often have to back up

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.140
or bookings using phone
or SMS or WhatsApp.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.960
So when a booking
arrives on our platform

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.060
we do not always have a
direct software connection

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.880
to the hotel.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.800
So maybe it will
fall back, and then

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.260
now become a phone booking that
will take maybe 10, 15 minutes

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.380
to fulfill.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.660
So initially, many of those
things we did not see them.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.020
We did not know we'd need
to do it a certain way.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.500
We basically started the
platform and then somebody

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.540
would book.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.140
We'd meet a particular
problem, then

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.510
we'd rush, develop it,
get it done, release it,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.950
and then it would start working.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.170
So our current
platform is basically

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.960
the evolution of everything
that we have learned.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
So it was influenced and
guided by the problems

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.720
that we had to solve
all along the way.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.580
I think we are a
little bit lucky

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.490
in that the industry
that we are in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.510
is something that people very
readily and easily understand.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.620
From the very first
day we went online,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.510
people already started
booking the hotels.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.590
We did not have to really
go out and teach them how

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.420
to book hotels.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.250
A lot of people knew this
already from other countries.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.520
And the hotel managers also
have been running such a system

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.350
locally.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.880
So taxi drivers
who pick up people,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.220
bring people to their
hotels, and they'd

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.790
pay them some kind
of commission.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.960
So they already knew
about commission systems

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.080
and all that.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.060
So all we basically had
to go and explain to them

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210
we are going to deliver
you more customers,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.380
and in exchange for that
you pay us a commission.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.520
And they say fine,
well, no problem.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.170
If you can do that, go ahead.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.000
And we would actually do it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.840
And the same thing
with the customers.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.045
We just said, OK, you can
now book your hotels online,

00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:59.420
and they said, that's a very
nice service, let me try it,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.520
and it works.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.600
So I think the early
days for us were not

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.640
as difficult as the early
days from some other business,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.720
because we are actually in a
market where there is demand.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.630
But nobody wanted
to spend that money

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630
and go through that effort
of actually going out

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.810
to get all those hotels.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.230
I would say a lot
of people do not--

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410
the things that are
holding people back,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100
I think at the moment,
are that they do not

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.820
have an effective way of
distributing their ideas.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.780
So if they actually
develop something

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.190
and it's a working
software project,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.610
the sales process is extremely
expensive in Nigeria,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.420
because of how disconnected all
the towns are from each other

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.420
and how you would go
about making sales.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.820
So effective software
projects that require sales

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.940
are a bit too difficult
to do, actually.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.010
And when it comes to being
able to distribute it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.250
on a global scale, and
reaching other people,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.590
it's difficult for an average
Nigerian developer compete

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.120
with a developer in
Romania or in the US,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.395
because there are some
disadvantages that they

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:12.220
have got here.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.570
They don't how steady lights.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.210
They don't have good internet.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.170
So just projects that
are only software based,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.530
they already start
off at a disadvantage.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.280
So it becomes only the very best
that can actually break out.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.080
Those that are
better than average

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.560
have got competition that are
also-- a lot of competition

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.696
that are also
better than average,

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:34.820
but have got other advantages
that they don't have,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.690
like just having
constant electricity

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.220
or having working internet.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.530
I think there are
options available,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.940
but they are definitely much
worse than the options that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.940
are available in other
continents, I'd say.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.740
The availability of finance
for African startups

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.730
is quite limited.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.420
Every now and then
there are companies

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.310
that come in and throw
a lot of money around

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.240
and then they leave, and then
in those spells in between,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.870
there's just not a lot
of capital available.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.750
And that's why I think-- that's
what ties into my earlier

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.960
question, which is basically
that companies that do not

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.899
operate at losses have the
ability to kind of wait out

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.250
the long periods between when
companies are available that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.850
are actually putting
money in Africa.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.320
Because that's
how it looks like.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.300
There are companies that
would, for a long time there

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.620
will be no finance available,
and then a few companies will

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.800
come in, have a lot
of finance available,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.540
and then they'll
go again after they

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.930
have done their
investments in Africa.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.640
So there is money,
but it's seasonal.
