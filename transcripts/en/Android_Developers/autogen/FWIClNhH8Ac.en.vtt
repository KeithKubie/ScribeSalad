00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.980
 
so let's look at a few other refinements

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
so let's look at a few other refinements
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.879
so let's look at a few other refinements
we can make for starters I think it's

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
we can make for starters I think it's
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.919
we can make for starters I think it's
pretty lame that we've gone through all

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
pretty lame that we've gone through all
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.350
pretty lame that we've gone through all
this work to sign the user in and all we

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
this work to sign the user in and all we
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.840
this work to sign the user in and all we
say is welcome player you know or we

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
say is welcome player you know or we
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670
say is welcome player you know or we
know our user signed in we should talk

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
know our user signed in we should talk
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.330
know our user signed in we should talk
to him or her by name so let's do that

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340
to him or her by name so let's do that
 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.500
to him or her by name so let's do that
now what we're going to do here is go

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
now what we're going to do here is go
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.650
now what we're going to do here is go
into my intro view controller and where

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
into my intro view controller and where
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.290
into my intro view controller and where
we say refresh interface based on sign

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
we say refresh interface based on sign
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.790
we say refresh interface based on sign
in instead of saying welcome player

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800
in instead of saying welcome player
 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.200
in instead of saying welcome player
we're going to get that information from

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
we're going to get that information from
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.510
we're going to get that information from
the Google Play game service so what

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
the Google Play game service so what
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.440
the Google Play game service so what
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
we're going to do here is we're going to
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200
we're going to do here is we're going to
say self dot sign in label that text

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
say self dot sign in label that text
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.540
say self dot sign in label that text
equals and a string string with format

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550
equals and a string string with format
 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.939

gpg manager shared instance we can get

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
gpg manager shared instance we can get
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390

this thing called the application model

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
this thing called the application model
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700
this thing called the application model
and this starts to contain some

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
and this starts to contain some
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530
and this starts to contain some
interesting information about the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
interesting information about the
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.960
interesting information about the
application one thing it contains is

another property I think the only thing
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.590
another property I think the only thing
associated with it right now called

associated with it right now called
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.550
associated with it right now called
local player that has a name so let's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
local player that has a name so let's
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.620
local player that has a name so let's
see what happens when we run this oh we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
see what happens when we run this oh we
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.770

get welcome no that's not right so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
get welcome no that's not right so
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.749
get welcome no that's not right so
what's going on here well what happens

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
what's going on here well what happens

what's going on here well what happens
is when you sign into google play games

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
is when you sign into google play games
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.020
is when you sign into google play games
the Google Play game service and start

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
the Google Play game service and start
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700
the Google Play game service and start
fetching information that it thinks

fetching information that it thinks
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410
fetching information that it thinks
you're going to need like information

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
you're going to need like information
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840
you're going to need like information
about the player definitions for all

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
about the player definitions for all
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179
about the player definitions for all
your achievements the players progress

towards completing those achievements
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.069
towards completing those achievements
and so on however since we're trying to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
and so on however since we're trying to
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.719
and so on however since we're trying to
say hello to the player immediately

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
say hello to the player immediately
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.760
say hello to the player immediately
after sign it is complete the service

hasn't had enough time yet to go out and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
hasn't had enough time yet to go out and
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810
hasn't had enough time yet to go out and
get all that information or at least

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
get all that information or at least
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730
get all that information or at least
confirm that the cache information it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
confirm that the cache information it
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130
confirm that the cache information it
has is still up to date so how do we fix

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
has is still up to date so how do we fix
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199
has is still up to date so how do we fix
this well one way might be to add a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
this well one way might be to add a
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.800
this well one way might be to add a
timer so that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
timer so that
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.330
timer so that
seconds later we say hello to the player

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
seconds later we say hello to the player
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.339
seconds later we say hello to the player
but there's a more elegant way of doing

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
but there's a more elegant way of doing
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.420
but there's a more elegant way of doing
it that the service provides for us so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
it that the service provides for us so
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.600
it that the service provides for us so
instead of setting the text right away

key with a completion handler now the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
key with a completion handler now the
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500
key with a completion handler now the
key here is and this is just a constant

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
key here is and this is just a constant
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.809
key here is and this is just a constant
that we define gpg model and you can see

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819
that we define gpg model and you can see
 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.880
that we define gpg model and you can see
it down here local player key and for

our completion handler let's indent that
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.250
our completion handler let's indent that
a bit now we can look and say well if

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
a bit now we can look and say well if
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.630
a bit now we can look and say well if
there was no error set self dot sign and

player named who now this time when we

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
player named who now this time when we
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.699
player named who now this time when we
run the application we get back a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709
run the application we get back a
 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770
run the application we get back a
personalized message that says welcome

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780

another method called reload data for

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
another method called reload data for
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.039
another method called reload data for
key now this method works almost the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
key now this method works almost the
 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.440
key now this method works almost the
same as low data for key I believe the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450
same as low data for key I believe the
 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.300
same as low data for key I believe the
difference is that reload a tofurkey

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
difference is that reload a tofurkey
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.879
difference is that reload a tofurkey
tells the service I want you to ignore

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889
tells the service I want you to ignore

any cached data you have go out on the
 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.009
any cached data you have go out on the
net and actually grab any new

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019
net and actually grab any new
 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.960
net and actually grab any new
information whereas load data for Key

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
information whereas load data for Key
 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.150
information whereas load data for Key
says if you have cash information it's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160
says if you have cash information it's
 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.050
says if you have cash information it's
okay to use it so I think if we run this

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060
okay to use it so I think if we run this
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.990
okay to use it so I think if we run this
you might see a slightly longer delay in

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
you might see a slightly longer delay in
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.449
you might see a slightly longer delay in
between when you sign the sign up button

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459
between when you sign the sign up button
 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.580
between when you sign the sign up button
appears and the welcome Todd Kerpelman

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
appears and the welcome Todd Kerpelman
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.320
appears and the welcome Todd Kerpelman
message appears and I believe that's

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330
message appears and I believe that's
 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.290
message appears and I believe that's
because I'm making an extra force

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
because I'm making an extra force
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.760

to make
so we're going to switch this back to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990
so we're going to switch this back to
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.060
so we're going to switch this back to
load data for key finally I'm going to

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070
load data for key finally I'm going to
 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.490
load data for key finally I'm going to
show you one other problem that we might

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
show you one other problem that we might
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.950
show you one other problem that we might
want to fix now I've got a pretty good

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960
want to fix now I've got a pretty good
 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.510

watch what happens when we run this

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780
watch what happens when we run this
 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.810
watch what happens when we run this
you're going to see for a brief moment

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
you're going to see for a brief moment
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.610
you're going to see for a brief moment
that the g plus sign in button is still

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
that the g plus sign in button is still
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.800
that the g plus sign in button is still
there it takes a moment for the service

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810
there it takes a moment for the service
 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.409
there it takes a moment for the service
to sign me in and make the Sign In

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419
to sign me in and make the Sign In
 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.420
to sign me in and make the Sign In
button go away and certainly when I'm

something that delay could be much
 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.240
something that delay could be much
longer and you don't want your user

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250
longer and you don't want your user
 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.070

repeatedly clicking that sign-in button

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080
repeatedly clicking that sign-in button
 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.870

they're just not getting signed in so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280
they're just not getting signed in so
 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.890
they're just not getting signed in so
what we want to do is when we get to

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900
what we want to do is when we get to
 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.930
what we want to do is when we get to
that moment where we're trying silent

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940
that moment where we're trying silent

know hey we're trying to sign you as in

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810
know hey we're trying to sign you as in
 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.480
know hey we're trying to sign you as in
the background please be patient for a

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490
the background please be patient for a
 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.030
the background please be patient for a
minute and we can do that by looking at

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040
minute and we can do that by looking at
 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.610
minute and we can do that by looking at
the value that gets returned by try

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620
the value that gets returned by try
 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.340
the value that gets returned by try
silent on the authentication now this

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350
silent on the authentication now this
 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200
silent on the authentication now this
actually returns a boolean and this

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210
actually returns a boolean and this
 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.090
actually returns a boolean and this
boolean is yes if the system has

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100
boolean is yes if the system has
 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.100

determined that it is going to try and

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110
determined that it is going to try and
 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.469
determined that it is going to try and
silently authenticate the user it says

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479
silently authenticate the user it says
 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.210
silently authenticate the user it says
looks like there's an old o auth token

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220
looks like there's an old o auth token

looks like there's an old o auth token
here I'm going to try and sign the user

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510
here I'm going to try and sign the user
 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.240
here I'm going to try and sign the user
in so we can take advantage of that

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250
in so we can take advantage of that
 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.040
in so we can take advantage of that
first thing we're going to do is create

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050
first thing we're going to do is create
 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.940
first thing we're going to do is create
a low property here not atomic school

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950
a low property here not atomic school
 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.900
a low property here not atomic school
that is trying the silent sign in and

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910
that is trying the silent sign in and
 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.020
that is trying the silent sign in and
then down here i'm going to say self

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030
then down here i'm going to say self
 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.730
then down here i'm going to say self
trying silent sign in is equal to the

trying silent sign in is equal to the
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.230
trying silent sign in is equal to the
value that gets returned and remember

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240
value that gets returned and remember
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.090

this gets returned immediately by the

this gets returned immediately by the
 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.020
this gets returned immediately by the

then we can go back up to our refresh

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
then we can go back up to our refresh
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.420
then we can go back up to our refresh
interface based on sign in method and

we're going to go up here and say self

dot sign in button dot enabled equals
not self trying silent sign in so if we

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
not self trying silent sign in so if we
 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.020
not self trying silent sign in so if we
get to this point the user is not signed

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030
get to this point the user is not signed
 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.300
get to this point the user is not signed
in yet but the system is attempting to

in yet but the system is attempting to
 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.760
in yet but the system is attempting to
sign them in you will see the sign in

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770
sign them in you will see the sign in
 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.710
sign them in you will see the sign in
button visible but it will not be

just wasn't able to silently sign the
user in the Sign In button will be

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600
user in the Sign In button will be
 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.650
user in the Sign In button will be

one other thing I forgot to do which is

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610
one other thing I forgot to do which is
 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.750
one other thing I forgot to do which is
here under finish with off we get to

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760
here under finish with off we get to
 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.750
here under finish with off we get to
this point once the attempt to silently

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760
this point once the attempt to silently
 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.090
this point once the attempt to silently
sign the user in is finished so we can

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100
sign the user in is finished so we can
 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.980
sign the user in is finished so we can
say self dot trying silent sign in is

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990
say self dot trying silent sign in is
 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.130
say self dot trying silent sign in is
equal to no alright so now let's run

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140
equal to no alright so now let's run
 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.780
equal to no alright so now let's run
this and you should see that that

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790
this and you should see that that
 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.020
this and you should see that that
sign-in button was visible but disabled

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030
sign-in button was visible but disabled
 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.230
sign-in button was visible but disabled
for that brief moment in between signing

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240
for that brief moment in between signing
 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.730
for that brief moment in between signing
in and when the sign up button appeared

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
in and when the sign up button appeared
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.680
in and when the sign up button appeared
now I'm going to sign out and it looks

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690
now I'm going to sign out and it looks
 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.390
now I'm going to sign out and it looks
like the Sign In button is there and is

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400
like the Sign In button is there and is
 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.920
like the Sign In button is there and is
once again enabled I'm going to click it

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930
once again enabled I'm going to click it
 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.160
once again enabled I'm going to click it
i'm going to say except go back into the

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170
i'm going to say except go back into the
 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:41.400
i'm going to say except go back into the
game and there we go we're signed in we

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410
game and there we go we're signed in we
 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.560
game and there we go we're signed in we
have a nice sign up button that again we

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570
have a nice sign up button that again we
 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.940
have a nice sign up button that again we
could probably hide the menu somewhere

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950
could probably hide the menu somewhere
 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.210
could probably hide the menu somewhere
and the game is addressing me by name I

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220
and the game is addressing me by name I
 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.400
and the game is addressing me by name I
feel like we're friends already so at

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.410
feel like we're friends already so at
 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.900
feel like we're friends already so at
this point we're pretty much done with

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:51.910
this point we're pretty much done with
 

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.730
this point we're pretty much done with
the section on getting the user signed

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740
the section on getting the user signed
 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.520
the section on getting the user signed
in from here it's it's the fun stuff we

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.530
in from here it's it's the fun stuff we
 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.140
in from here it's it's the fun stuff we
get to now add achievements we get to

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.150
get to now add achievements we get to
 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.420
get to now add achievements we get to
add leaderboards we can share our game

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.430
add leaderboards we can share our game
 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.220
add leaderboards we can share our game
play with a friend that kind of stuff

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.230
play with a friend that kind of stuff
 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.930
play with a friend that kind of stuff
now that we've gone through all the hard

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:03.940
now that we've gone through all the hard
 

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.300
now that we've gone through all the hard
work of getting the user signed in let's

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310
work of getting the user signed in let's
 

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.100
work of getting the user signed in let's
start having some fun and we're going to

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.110
start having some fun and we're going to
 

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.590
start having some fun and we're going to
do that in the next chapter so I'll see

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:10.600
do that in the next chapter so I'll see
 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:20.750
