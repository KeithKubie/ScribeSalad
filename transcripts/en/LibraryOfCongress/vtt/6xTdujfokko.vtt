&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.840
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Betsy
Peterson, the Director

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.140
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.330
And on behalf of the staff, and
indeed everyone at the library,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.450
I want to welcome
everyone here today

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.600
for the latest presentation

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.590
in our Benjamin Botkin
lecture series.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.970
For those of you the
Botkin series allows us

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.100
to highlight the leading --
the work of leading scholars

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.080
in the disciplines of folklore,
ethnomusicology, world history,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.180
and cultural heritage, while
enhancing our collections

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.900
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.000
For the center and the library,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.280
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.050
of our acquisition activity.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.780
Each lecture is videotaped,
and becomes part

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
of the permanent
collections of the center.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.180
And eventually are webcast
on the library's website

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.480
where they're available

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520
for viewing internet
patrons throughout the world,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.000
and for generations to come.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760
So, today's lecture.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.640
Today's lecture is a two-for
great pleasure for me.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.620
I have the honor of introducing
our speaker, Peggy Bulger,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.150
who is a distinguished
folklorist, a very dear friend

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.410
and colleague, and my
predecessor here as Director

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.890
of the American Folklore Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.620
She in turn, will be speaking

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.140
about a remarkable man
named Stetson Kennedy

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.480
who for many years was also
closely alive with the center --

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.810
or, actually, yeah, the center,
the archive, the library,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.760
and the field of folklore.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.370
But, first a little
bit about Peggy.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.430
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger:
Don't tell it all.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.220
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: I
won't, don't worry.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.290
Dr. Bulger received
her MA in Folk Studies

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.520
from Western Kentucky
University,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.210
and her PhD in Folklore and
Folklife from the University

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.310
of Pennsylvania in 1992.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.140
She began her professional
career in Florida serving

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
as Florida's State Folk
Arts Coordinator in 1975,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.970
and later as the administrator

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.650
of the Florida Folklife
Program from 1976 to 1989.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.680
As Florida's first
State Folklorist,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.300
she was the driving
force behind the creation

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.990
of the Folklife program there,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.330
and the Florida Folklife
collection.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.710
Which today is housed
in Tallahassee

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.220
at the state archives
of Florida,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.850
and features documentation
on Florida folk artists,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.180
performers, and folklorists.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.180
After helping to establish
the Florida Folklife program,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.020
Peggy moved on to
Atlanta leaving Florida,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.210
and became the Folk
Arts Director

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.280
and Senior Program Officer for
the Southern Arts Federation.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.720
After an innovative tenure
in that position in 1991,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.140
she was named Director
of the Library

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.320
of Congress's American
Folklife Center where she served

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.140
with distinction as AFC Director
until her retirement in 2011.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.810
In addition to this
varied career

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.050
and her administration work,
Peggy has also authored

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.290
or coauthored numerous articles
and publications including,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.180
South Florida Folklife and
Musical Roots of the South.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.040
She's produced several
documentary films including

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.630
Music Masters and Rhythm Kings.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.310
And she coproduced the double
album Drop on Down in Florida,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.400
which was reissued on
Dust to Digital in 2012.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.040
She also served as President of
the American Folklore Society,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.970
and received an honorary
doctorate

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.130
from Goucher College in 2012.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.580
After retiring, Peggy
returned to Florida

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.730
where she's remained
extremely active,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.220
which wouldn't be a surprise
for anyone who knows her.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.600
And in fact, she
joins us today to talk

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.620
about her most recent project,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.150
a biography of the
folklorist Stetson Kennedy.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.370
As you are going to hear,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.940
Stetson Kennedy has also
lead a remarkable life

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.130
as a political activist,
writer, and folklorist.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.600
He was a longtime friend
and supporter of the AFC,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.270
and he maintained an
influential circle

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.210
of friends throughout his
life including, Pete Seeger,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.140
Woody Guthrie, Alan
Lomax, Richard Wright,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.170
Jean-Paul Sartre, Zora Neal
Hurston, and also used folklore

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.250
and oral history as a vehicle
towards progressive change.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.910
Copies of Dr. Bulger's
book, right here,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.330
are on sale in the
foyer after the lecture.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.690
And Peggy will be available

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.090
to autograph copies
immediately after her talk.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.080
So, now, please join me in
welcoming Dr. Peggy Bulge

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.330
for her talk on Stetson
Kennedy; Applied Folklore

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.510
and Cultural Advocacy.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.500
[ Applause ]

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.210
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Thank you.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.480
Well, it's really wonderful to
be back here at the library.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.820
And I want to especially
the American Folklife Center

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.700
and staff, you know, Betsy,
thank you very much for that.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.760
Nancy Gross, Thea Austin,
Jennifer Cudding, all of you,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.550
Steve Winnick, all of you
have put a lot of work.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.060
I know how much work goes into
these things, because we used

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.950
to put them on when I was here.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.120
So, I'm happy to be on the
other side of the lectern,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.730
and I telling somebody when
I was getting ready for this,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.710
I said, you know, I
really need a staff.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.690
I had to learn how to do
a Power Point on my own

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.410
for the first time, that's the
downside of retirement, but,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.230
now I'm up and running.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.750
Let me just take this,
and page up and page down.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.680
See, I'm getting really
good at this here,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.570
page up and page down.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.850
This lecture though, is really
meant to introduce you all

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.050
to a most amazing
activist as Betsy had said,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.390
and an extraordinary,
ordinary man

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.210
who many people have never
heard of outside of Florida.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.020
I imagine, maybe all of you did,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.730
does anybody not have
heard about Stetson?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.030
Oh, good. Oh, good.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.630
Well, you are going
to be amazed.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.220
All of you are going to be
amazed actually, because even

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.790
if you know Stetson, or
think you know about Stetson,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.590
if you delve into his life
it's much more amazing

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.070
than even you know.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.760
But, so to begin, I really have
to talk about how I met Stetson,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.820
and that was back in 1976.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.360
As Betsy said, I was hired --

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.270
my very first job as a
folklorist was to come down

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.450
and be the State Folk Arts
Coordinator for a year on one

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.290
of those NEA one-year
grants, you know,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.860
to do a folk arts survey
of the state in 12 months.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.850
And I was young and often naive
enough to think it was possible.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.570
Yes, I'm going to
-- I'd never been

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.580
to Florida before in my life.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.400
So, the good thing is, I
decided I'd better find

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.660
out who had done any work
in Florida before me.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.010
And so, I went to the University
of Florida Library collection,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.190
and met up with Dr.
Alton Morris,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.020
who at the time was the
Editor of Southern Folklore.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.950
And he was also the Senior
Folklorist really working

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.250
in the state of Florida.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.590
And I was going through a
lot of the WPA materials,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.930
the Federal Writers
Project materials that were

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.100
at the P.K. Yonge Collection.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.420
And, you know, reading Zora
Neal Hurston, Alan Lomax,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.480
Herbert Halpert,
all kinds of people

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.710
who had been doing wonderful
work all over the state.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.130
But, I kept running across
the names Stetson Kennedy,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.280
I'd never heard of
Stetson Kennedy.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.060
And so, I was talking to
Dr. Morris and I said, gosh,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.080
you know, this guy Stetson
Kennedy did so much work,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.320
it's really too bad he's dead.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.160
And Morris goes, "Stetson?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.200
He's not dead, he's
alive and well,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.040
and lives outside
of Jacksonville."

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.190
And of course, I was 25 years
old, and I figured anybody

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.930
who had been doing
that work in the 1930s,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.050
this was 1976 had to
be dead, you know?

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.010
So -- and I'm embarrassed
to say,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.180
he was only 62 years
old in 1976.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.810
Whoo! You know, older
than I am now [inaudible].

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.450
Anyway, so, that started,
I made an appointment to go

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.660
over to see Stetson on his land.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:04.050
He had an estate I would
say, south of Jacksonville

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.540
in St. Johns County called
Beluthahatchee, which is word

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.580
that he got from
Zora Neal Hurston,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.360
which kind of means
a paradise on earth,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.890
at least that's what
he tells me.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.930
So, I went over to
interview him about his work

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.660
with the Federals
Writer Project,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.060
because that's all
I knew about him.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.890
And that actually began
a friendship that lasted

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.810
over 35 years until he died.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.620
But his work with the Florida
Writers Project was just the tip

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:40.120
of the iceberg in an amazing
life that really used his skills

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.290
as a documentarian
to affect political,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.620
environmental, and
cultural change.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.550
Stetson Kennedy was actually,
he was born on October 5,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:57.070
1916 to George Kennedy and
Willie Stetson in Riverside,

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.460
which is a wealthy
neighborhood in Jacksonville,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.620
Florida, it still is today.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.950
He is descendent
from southern Georgia

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.040
and Florida aristocracies,
so the surnames

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.140
in his family are
Woodward, Sanford, Lanier,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.240
Wallace, Stetson, and Kennedy.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.010
His most celebrated relative was
his great uncle John B. Stetson,

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.670
as many of you might
have heard of him.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.510
He was a northern hat
manufacturer who moved actually

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.360
to Deland, Florida in the 1880s

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.590
And founded the first law school

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.510
in the state, Stetson
University.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.480
So, Stetson was the eldest
of five children who grew

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.740
up with all of the rights,
privileges and prejudices

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.420
of their station in life.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.290
And so, from right to left
that's Stetson, the oldest,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.750
Martha, George Junior,
Nancy, and Margaret.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.720
And Stetson said to me that
the, "He grew up steeped

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.900
in southern culture
of the 1920s.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.210
Salt and pepper were
the only condiments,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.050
and garlic was frowned
upon as not only alien,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.560
but positively subversive."

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.570
Stetson as a teenager would help

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.280
in his father's retail furniture
business in Jacksonville,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.720
which catered to poor

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.160
and working-class customers
both Black and White.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.030
And they would pay a dollar
down and a dollar a week

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.500
for all of their purchases.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.090
And it was Stetson's job to
go collect that dollar a week.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.280
So, it was at that early
age, you know, at about 15,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.750
that he first began to document
the speech, idioms, jokes,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.110
and stories of those families.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.210
It was also the beginning
of his interest in folklore

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:48.780
and in activism to help
combat poverty and hunger.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.680
Stetson was always considered

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.310
to be the black sheep
of his family.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.250
His interest in Black culture,
traditions of the working class,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.030
and in the inequality of
southern life was not welcomed

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.670
within his family
as you can imagine,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.620
and also within his
"social peers."

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.490
He began college at the
University of Florida in 1935,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.630
which was the height
of The Depression.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.780
He was studying literature and
writing, he was also active

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.900
in social causes though
right from the beginning.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.070
He joined the North
American Committee

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.030
to aid Spanish democracy.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.990
And he had the University

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.590
of Florida ROTC members
send their used boots

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.340
to the Spanish Republican
troops.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:39.930
And he mobilized the cigar
rollers of Tampa in Key West

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.110
by appealing to their
Spanish heritage.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.970
He also -- this is
really interesting,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.610
he founded the Florida
International Peace Council,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.830
which was the very first
integrated student group

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.030
in the segregated South.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.260
Their slogan was, and this
was before World War II,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.600
"Keep America out of the war by
keeping war out of the world."

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.400
But, as Stetson says, he
invented independent studies

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.790
by dropping out of college
in 1937, and hitchhiking

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.330
to Key West where he intended
to collect narratives,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.980
and become a working
writer for a year or two.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.460
So, remember, this is at the
height of The Depression.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.920
Key West was actually
under federal jurisdiction,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.560
and it was an experiment
to use WPA labor

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.180
to create a tourist mecca

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:36.090
and save the bankrupt
town in this effort.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.500
It was also the beginning
of what would evolve

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.660
into the Civilian Conservation
Corp. The WPA workers were

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:49.830
taking houses like this, and
restoring them into this.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.150
The WPA was creating jobs
to develop roads, bridges,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.790
and critical infrastructure.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.390
As well as jobs that would
encourage economic development

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.030
through tourism.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.280
So, when Stetson first arrived,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.210
he got a WPA job raking
seaweed off the beaches

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.160
to attract these elusive
tourists, one of the many jobs

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.700
that got people to work.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.580
And he immediately
started collecting folklore

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.950
from his fellow workers
who were also destitute

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.180
and grateful for the job.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.380
So, one story he told me --

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.630
and he said it was
great to have this job,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.820
because the sea was
very obliging

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.610
by depositing another crop
of seaweed every day, and so,

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.650
there was never an
end to the job.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:40.010
But he said, "These fellas
on the beach, one fellow took

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.900
out a loaf of Cuban
bread, slices it,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.610
holds it up to the breeze,
and then he takes it down.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.260
He cuts a lime, he squeezes
the lime juice on the bread,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.210
puts it together and eats it.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.900
So, all the other
workers are asking,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.760
"What the hell he's
-- was he doing?"

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.990
And he said, Well, I just
made a sea breeze sandwich.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.880
So, I guess he was getting
a little fishy flavor

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.520
and imagining that he
had a fish sandwich.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.190
But there was that kind
of good humor in the face

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.760
of the awful economic
situation."

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.180
Stetson began to document the
traditional occupational lure

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.740
of Key Westers.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.950
He went down on the wharfs,
he went on the sponge boats

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.070
and the docks, and he collected

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:27.260
from the Bohemian conch
fisherman of the day.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.700
Because of this, he
came to the attention --

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.340
I love this picture, she --

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.340
doesn't even look like--
I know, what a babe.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.880
And she was the head
of the Florida --

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.180
Florida Writers Project.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.310
Anyway, he came to the
attention of Dr. Carita Corse,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.580
who was a family friend from
Jacksonville, and the new head

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.790
of the Florida Writers Project.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.060
She hired Stetson
at the age of 21

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.120
to be a Junior Interviewer
covering Key West.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.910
And that was because of
his family connections.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.900
The project was gathering
material, as most of you know,

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.670
to publish a state guide book.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.450
And most of the states,
of course, were engaged

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.220
in similar field work for a
series that would be published

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.710
and encourage visitation
across the country.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.210
It was kind of an
economic development thing

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.280
through writing.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.270
Stetson submitted manuscripts
were full of folklore

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.600
and cultural narratives.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.020
And he then came to the
attention of who else?

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.600
Dr. Benjamin Botkin, who this
lecture series is named for.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.220
Botkin was the head of the
Federal Writers Project Folklore

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.540
and Oral History Unit

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.450
in Washington D.C.
overseeing all of the states.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.600
And Botkin encouraged Corse to
hire Stetson to be in charge

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.420
of the "Folklore Oral History

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.900
and Social Ethnic Unit"
of the Florida team.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.340
And so, at the age of 22,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.450
Stetson became a
Federal Folklorist.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.090
Stetson was able to borrow the
acetate disk recording machine

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.000
of the Library of Congress's
Archive of Folk Song,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.930
and I believe we still
have that machine here.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.120
Yeah, we do.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.730
And along with photographer
Robert Cook,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.630
they documented the folk
arts and culture of Key West.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.010
And here, he is documenting
Edith Ogden,

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.520
who became his first wife.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.690
Stetson had seven wives,
but that's another story.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.610
And she's singing a Cuban
folk song for the project.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.480
And after the talk, you should
go see some of the materials

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.730
that Todd Harvey and
staff have pulled.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.240
Stetson's materials that are
here, right here in our archive.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.740
These are all coming from
interviews that I did

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.600
with him over, I don't know,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.640
200 hours of interviews
over maybe 15 years.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.620
He said, "I lived in
the Cuban Quarter,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.400
and it was my first exposure to
any culture other than the Black

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.150
and Cracker southern cultures.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.630
So, to find myself in a Cuban,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.270
Spanish speaking community
was quite an eye-opener.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.660
In spite of all the hardships,
they were having a ball.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.180
They were really enjoying life

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.410
in a way I'd never seen
anybody enjoying life.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.760
It had something to do with
the Creole outlook on life,

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.060
making the most of it.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.760
Wine, women, and song,
and making music.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.530
You can't beat it,
it was all new to me,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.580
and I've never gotten over it.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.760
I probably never
should have left.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.770
So, Stetson really was,
you know, you imagine,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.590
22 years old, he's excited.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.500
He did so much documentation
down there,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.330
this is documentation
Cuban Comparsas dancers.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.510
He documented second line
funeral parades in Key West.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.020
And of course, Bohemian
Goombay and Junkanoo Festivals.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.060
He also was sent on field trips

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.000
by Carita Corse to
other communities.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.280
And this is from a trip he made
to Tarpon Springs where many

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.620
of you might know that
60% of the population

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.940
of Tarpon Springs
were immigrants

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.640
from the Dodecanese Islands.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.020
They were brought over to
get the natural sponges

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.720
out of the bay, and they
were really very good

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.020
at that occupation.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.160
But, to this day,
the Greek culture

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.920
of Tarpon is a tourist
draw, and so, it, you know,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.190
could be a dream come true,
I guess for at the time.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.790
Stetson also documented the
cigar rollers in both Key West

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.670
and Tampa for occupational lure,

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.570
as well as political
activism pertaining

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.900
to the Batista Regime in Cuba.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.180
And I should say that, the Cigar
rollers were really interesting

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.890
in that, they started --

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.910
you know, the Cuban cigar
rollers first came to Key West,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.590
and when they wanted
to unionize,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.930
the owners of the cigar
companies moved lock, stock,

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.940
and barrel up to Tampa to
Ybor City to avoid unionizing.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.740
And one of the jobs
though in these factories,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.670
which you can see they're
all just working away mind --

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.540
it's pretty mindless
work after a while,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.650
was to be electore[Phonetic].

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.210
If you were a electore, you were
a man who sat up on a high -

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.310
high stool, and you
read to the workers.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.510
So, it's like books on
tape before books on tape.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.660
And you could read anything
that the workers wanted.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.340
And what they increasingly
wanted read were the political

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.540
newspapers of the day,
and activist materials.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.130
And so, it was a sad
day, but eventually,

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.630
the cigar rolling companies
got rid of that job,

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.680
and tore down electores
high seats.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.530
And that was -- the was cause
for a great consternation

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.300
within the industry there.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.070
But, Stetson also documented
cigar rollers' houses vernacular

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:06.890
architecture in Key West,
shot gun houses like this.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.670
And typical street scenes
in his Cuban neighborhood.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.900
This give me -- you can see
that they had Turtle burgers,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.250
turtle burger sandwich
at the time, you know,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.780
which sea turtles
are endangered now,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.860
so you wouldn't get a
turtle burger sandwich.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.470
But, I wonder what that
tasted like, well --

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.720
he also documented
cock fighting,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.000
which at the time was not
illegal down in Key West.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.670
And he became great friends

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.980
with an emerging young
Cuban-American folk artist,

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.970
Mario Sanchez.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.240
Sanchez's work is not
internationally collected,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.490
but back in the 1930s, he
was a young, unknown artist.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.230
And the Florida Writers
Project documentation would help

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.910
to start his career.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.940
He would do bas-relief paintings
on cibar -- cigar box covers,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.870
and other found wood pieces.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.690
And they celebrated
the traditional,

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.000
everyday life of Key West.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.870
This one is called Gossip, this
one is called Street Vendors.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.950
But, I want you to see he --
during the middle of his career,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.940
he got really into the clouds.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.620
And the clouds are telling
all kinds of stories,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.870
there's bull fighting, and
there's you know, fishing.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.160
And so, the clouds are
just as interesting

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.780
as what's going on
in the street.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.240
This one is called Pets.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.230
And this is simply called a
street scene, because it's got

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.770
so much detail, and it
gives you a good inkling

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.600
of what Key West must have
been like in the 1930s.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.170
Of course, Stetson was now in
charge of the folklore unit

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.510
and the folklore connection
all over the state.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.910
So, Cartia Corse called
him back to Jacksonville

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.060
to supervise the field
workers from the main office.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.760
He was soon to become
the supervisor

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.080
of Zora Neal Hurston,
if that's possible.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.670
He -- she was moving back down
to Florida from New York City

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.580
where she had been with the
brilliant anthropologist

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.300
Franz Boaz.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.180
She was also a Pulitzer Prize
winning author at the time.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.970
And Stetson remembers the
day that she was hired.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.350
He says, "When it was
announced that Zora was coming

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.190
into the Jacksonville
headquarters,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.830
Dr. Corse called a meeting
of the Editorial staff.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.370
She said that we would have
to make allowances for Zora,

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.720
because she had been lionized
by New York literary circles,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.960
and was consequently
given to putting on airs.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.570
She would, for instance,
smoke cigarettes

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.300
in front of White people."

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.780
So, I asked Stetson,
what happened?

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:02.370
"So, Zora came, Zora smoked,
and we made allowances.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.240
Although she was an
award-winning published author,

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:11.680
Zora was hired at the minim wage
for the WPA, $26.50 a month,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.050
as a junior interviewer

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.580
to collect Negro Folklore
with the Negro Unit.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.940
Of course, as you know,
in the South the WPA,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.880
the Federal Writers
Project units were separated

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.410
by race at the time.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.890
She did amazing work, and sent
in important documentation

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.060
of everything from the
juke joints of Eatonville,

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.510
to the railroad workers
from the state prison yards,

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.590
to Blues musicians in Pahokee,

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.340
and to turpentine
workers at Chipley.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.310
And I'm very happy to say that
if you want to hear and see,

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.740
and get into some of these
materials, it's all digitized.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.830
It's up online, and it's here
at the American Folklife Center.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.700
So, get into the website, and
get into collections online,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.980
and it's the Florida collection.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.320
But, it was also during
this time that Stetson met

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.250
and became friends with
Pete Seeger, as well as many

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.550
of the other Folk Song
Revival members from the North.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.120
And remember, this was the era

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.690
where Pete Seeger
was the first archive

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.590
of folksong's first intern.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.850
And he was working
with Alan Lomax.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.160
Alan Lomax, of course, was
the head of the archive

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.800
of folk songs at the
Library of Congress.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.100
And he would come down to
Florida to do field work

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.360
with Stetson, Zora Neal
Hurston, Herbert Halpert,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.040
and other prominent folklorists.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.610
And he and Stetson maintained
a friendship throughout

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.430
their lives.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.130
So, at the end of the 1930s,
and the beginning of the 1940s,

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.220
Stetson became involved
-- before the WPA had --

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.350
you know, wound up,
he became involved

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.300
in the early civil
rights struggles

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.770
and labor struggles
of the South.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.940
He joined the Southern
Conference for Human Welfare.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.930
He met and worked with
other Progressive reformers,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.020
Josephine Wilkins,
Claude Pepper, W.T. Couch.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.290
Ellis Arnall, George
Stoney, Clark Foreman,

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.310
Don West, and Virginia Durr.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.110
He would also meet and work
with Miles and Ziphia Horton

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.530
of the Highlander
Center in Tennessee.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.890
And this is Ziphia, and
she is actually credited

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.520
with being the first person

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.890
to use a traditional
African-American hymn as a tool

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.570
for activism at this
time, and of course,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.310
it's We Shall Overcome.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.490
Many of you know it, because a
young folk singer Guy Carawan

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.090
was working with Highlander
-- at the center at the time.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.760
And he actually, was doing
a lot of the song leading

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.840
at song rallies and gatherings.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.960
Stetson would note that this was
one of the most effective ways

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.800
to use folklore for
positive change.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.940
Traditional tunes would be
joined by progressive lyrics

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.110
to bring people to their
feet and move them in ways

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.860
that speeches alone could not.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.340
And I was privileged to
interview Miles Horton

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:20.270
on December 5, 1989 three
weeks before he died.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.950
And he explained to me why he
used Stetson as a consultant.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.780
So, Miles Horton said, "At
Highlander, we used a lot

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.320
of consultants, Stetson was
working on books, and so,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.570
he came to meet people,
and to talk the students.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.110
We were always happy
to have him around.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.300
It was good for the students
to know people like that.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.170
He had a broader base
than most folklorists.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.030
Most of the folklorists
don't get political,

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.050
they're afraid they'd
be called Communists,

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.320
and have their book
sales go down.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.680
But, he, Stetson, was
very open about it.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.120
Stetson, he was a philosopher,
he was totally interested

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.670
in the significance of folklore.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.620
When he put folklore
in his books,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.550
it was for its significance,
not just as a fact.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.750
It's only the folklorists
like Stetson

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.570
that I like to work with.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.470
I don't have any patience
for the fact collectors.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.650
I find them exceedingly boring."

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.790
There you go.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:35.230
By this time -- no, in 1942
the WPA programs as many

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.340
of you know, were shut down
very abruptly due to the entry

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.460
of the U.S. into World War II.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.050
But, by this time,
Stetson had taken much

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.540
of the state guide book
material that he had collected,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.830
that was not going to be used
in the official tourism tool,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.640
and he wrote his
first successful book,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.550
Palmetto Country,
and there's a copy

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.730
of it back there on the table.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.190
Which depicted Florida
not just in all

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.050
of its good characteristics,
but also all

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.100
of its bad qualities too.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.600
And then, he tried
to join the Army.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.850
He was rejected from joining the
Army because of a back injury,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.170
so he determined to
fight Fascism at home.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:21.320
For the next five years,
Stetson lived a double life.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.960
He moved to Atlanta,
under the name

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.710
of John Perkins he infiltrated
the Stone Mountain klavern

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.690
of the Klu Klux Klan.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.020
He was determined to document
secretly the Klan's own

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.840
folklore, and use this to expose
their unlawful activities,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.820
and also their tools
for communication

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.290
that would be less
affective without secrecy.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.270
So, this following section
I'm going to be talking about,

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.000
which is his work, and
how he used folklore

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.020
to get the charter revoked
in the Georgia Klan.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.440
It was written back in 1992
when the dissertation came out,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.770
and it held true then.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.860
Unfortunately, recent events
may put this commentary

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.520
into question again, because
without overwhelming public

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.730
outrage and sanction against
blatant racism and abuse

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.850
of human rights, the tactics

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:21.190
that Stetson Kennedy used would
have been minimally affective.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:26.450
Fortunately, they were
very affective at the time.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:31.150
Kennedy knew that naming is
power, exposing the secret names

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.660
and signs of the Klan would
steal the symbolic heart

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.360
from the organization,
and make them vulnerable.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.040
He determined to
sap their strenght

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.990
by turning their own
rituals against them,

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.470
by revealing their
cherished passwords,

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.860
and destroying their
exclusive brotherhood.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.070
By exposing this elaborately
constructed folk society,

00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.820
and its destructive ideology,
the cultural glue melts,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.790
and by holding those in power
accountable without the cloak

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:09.660
of secrecy and mysticism,
the society breaks apart.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:15.970
This then was the methodology
adopted by Stetson Kennedy

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.090
and his role as an
implied folklorist.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.090
And I just have to say,
I love this picture,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.380
it's Klansmen with Kewpie dolls.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:29.260
It's I think at a country fair,
and I'm just like going --

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.770
oh, it was so ubiquitous
that you know, this was --

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.390
this would not like, stop
people in their tracks,

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.100
I guess, I can't imagine.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.300
In all, Stetson as John Perkins
joined over 20 hate groups

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.790
in Georgia where he
-- and this is him

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.130
in his Columbian Brown shirt.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:52.620
The Columbians were a rival hate
group competing with the Klan.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.310
But, all of them were
dependent upon secrecy,

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.670
and bogus traditions.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:04.430
This is a map of the Klavern,
and he did give information

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.770
that showed all of the positions
of power, and their place

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.740
in the clubhouse, and
what they were used for,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.900
and what the crazy naming meant.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.490
This is a secret salute.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.720
He did a bunch of documentation

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.300
of hand gestures,
and what they meant.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.080
So, if you met -- for instance,

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.000
if a Klansman met another
Klansman on the street,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.660
they could make these
hand signals,

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.550
and the other person would know
what they're talking about.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.650
If they weren't a Klansman,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.840
I guess they'd just think
you're crazy, I don't know.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.470
And Stetson also would collect
handouts and wires as much

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.300
as he could while
he was undercover.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.820
During 1946 and 1947, Stetson
fed nationally famous journalist

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.570
Drew Pearson the secret minutes

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.060
of the Stone Mountain
Klan meetings.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.880
Pearson would announce
these secrets

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.910
on his Sunday night radio
show, the Merry-Go-Round.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.230
Stetson also gave this
information to Robert Maxwell,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.210
the producer of the
Superman radio show.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.440
And he was working
undercover for Daniel Duke,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.100
the Attorney General
for Georgia,

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.130
and the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.500
But, he knew it was time to
come out from under cover

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.620
and bring his information to
Capitol Hill in January of 1947.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.440
In his full regalia, he entered
the office, believe it or not

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.160
of Martin Dies, and the House on
American Activities Committee.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.320
Dies refused to see Stetson,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.820
and maintained the Klan
was not un-American,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.870
it was as American as apple pie.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.040
Of course, showing up
announced to the Capitol

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.410
in a Klan robe had
some consequences,

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:57.060
and Stetson though
was able to testify

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.000
to several Congress members,
and many members of the press.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.180
Of course, this blew his cover,
and his life would be in danger.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.480
Meanwhile, Georgia Attorney
General Dan Duke would use

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.460
evidence from Stetson's work
to confront the former governor

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.350
of Georgia, Eugene Talmadge,
who was a Klan member himself

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.710
with the whips that were
used in several hate crimes

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.190
against Blacks in Atlanta.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.700
And really, it -- the
Klan was a huge --

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.700
huge factor in American
life back at this time.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.290
This is Stetson with
Ellis Arnall

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.650
who was the progressive governor
who succeeded Eugene Talmadge.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.320
And with Stetson's
evidence, Arnall was able

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.560
to get the Georgia Klan's
charter revoked, and --

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.020
because they were
chartered as an educational,

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.650
charitable organization.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:58.090
And they had enough
evidence to show

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.540
that the Klan was
actually conspiring

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.070
to deny people their
civil rights.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:10.540
But, this of course, made things
very difficult for Stetson.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.040
His land in Florida
was set on fire,

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.390
and his house was
ransacked by local Klansman.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.920
He was getting death
threats every day,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.490
so he was weighing
his options let's say.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.610
He decided to go visit
his friend Alan Lomax

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.960
in New York city who was working
with the Henry Wallace campaign.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.630
And it was at a party at Lomax's
apartment finally met somebody

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:40.310
he'd been corresponding with for
over three years, Woody Guthrie.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.500
They had amazing
correspondence going on,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.080
but this is how it started.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.560
Kennedy's first contacts
with Woody were by mail.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.860
In April of 1945, Wood wrote to
Stetson concerning an article

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.900
that Stetson had written
for Southern Patriot,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.810
about the racist group
called Christian Americans.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.590
Woody had been so
impressed with the article

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.600
that he sent Stetson
a book of 10 songs.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.990
And Stetson had answered him
detailing how he himself was a

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.030
collector of folk songs.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.620
So, Wood replied with a
two-page, single spaced letter

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.510
that would begin
a long friendship

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.220
between the two activists.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.620
And the end of that
letter it says,

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.340
"Your Southern Patriot
is doing a fine job

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.540
of making it clear how the
Fascists will try every known

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.640
trick in their booby-trap
to plant their seeds

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.950
in the soils of our Southland.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.840
It is the ignorance
caused by poverty

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.800
that keeps Fascism alive.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.490
And you're in the big middle
of the land where the light

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.950
of prosperity has never
shined for a whole day.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.210
Your friend, Woody Guthrie."

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.810
So, Woody had also
written to Stetson

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.130
after he had read
Palmetto Country.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.200
And that of course, was
a book that got Stetson

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.380
on the map in many ways.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:10.310
So, he wrote to him --

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.500
About Palmetto Country.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.750
"Dear Stets, I don't know of
a book on my whole shelf Stet,

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.990
that hits me harder than
your Palmetto Country.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.230
I've read it, and I'm still
reading it, and I can now say

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:31.100
that if only, and if only all
our library books could say what

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.630
you did, the jokes, the songs,
the old ballads about the Voodoo

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.380
and the Hoodoo and
the Bigley winds

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.690
down in your neck
of the wood vine.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.070
If every book on the
shelf hit, and kicked,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.570
and jumped in just the right
direction just 2/3 as much

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:49.020
as your Palmetto Country does,
I'd feel much more like a man.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.210
Most damn books make me
feel like an asshole.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:56.600
But -- but if -- and
that's spelled A-S-S,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.740
new word, W-H-O-L-E.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.260
But a few like yours
have kept me standing

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.100
up like a Saw Leaf palm.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.660
I'm going to go down
some day and try a piece

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.670
of that sweet Palmetto Country.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.520
Keep on traveling where your
own free conscious takes you --

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.410
as you always do anyway.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.020
And there's no earthly
ends to the goods

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.070
and benefits you can perform.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.070
Your Stud Buddie,
Woody Guthrie."

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.440
See, he was amazing.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.710
Woody and Stetson began -- of
course, became fast friends.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.260
And In 1951, Woody
would come to stay

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.650
with Stetson at Beluthahatchee.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.100
He had -- by this
time, he had devised --

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.620
divorced his wife Marjorie,
and he was showing signs

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.090
of what we now know
was Huntington's Korea,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:51.700
but he was just as prolific
and creative as ever.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:57.020
While staying at Beluthahatchee,
he would write several songs

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.980
for Stetson's campaign, and
this picture is actually Woody

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.540
at Beluthahatchee.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.300
So, he was writing songs
for Stetson's campaigns.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.160
Stetson was running for
Florida State Senate

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.140
as a Color-Blind
Write-in candidate.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.600
He didn't win.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.360
He was running against George
Smathers, who was a proud member

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.600
of what was known as the
Porkchop Gang, and if you're

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.300
from Florida, or know Florida,

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:29.770
the Porkchop Gang is
incredibly infamous.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.430
And Smathers was a demagogue
who used language and innuendo

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:38.060
to exploit the intolerances
of his audiences,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.450
what we might call his base.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.840
One of Smather's speeches
against Stetson's good friend,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.500
the progressive candidate
Claude Pepper,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.910
is a master piece of
cultural sabotage.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:56.480
And this is an actual quote
that was used by Smathers.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.340
And I've seen it
in other places,

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.210
but Stetson had told
me about it.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.320
He said about Claude Pepper,

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.080
and this is to a
rally that he was at.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.090
"Are you aware that
Claude Pepper is known all

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.650
over Washington as a
shameless extrovert?

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.970
Not only that, but this
man is reliably reported

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.260
to practice nepotism
with his sister-in-law.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.670
And he has a sister who was once
a Thespian in wicked New York.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.440
Worst of all, it is
an established fact

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.010
that Mr. Pepper, before his
marriage practiced celibacy."

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.000
[ Laughter ]

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:45.660
Yeah. You know, some things
never change, I just -- anyway.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.230
That was George Smathers.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:53.290
You know, if you don't
know Florida politics,

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:58.520
you really should read up on it,
because it's quite interesting.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.220
So, interestingly, one
of Woody's campaign songs

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.960
that he wrote titled Stetson
Kennedy, would be recorded

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.080
in 2000 by Billy
Bragg and Wilco.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.280
And it's on, I think,
Mermaid Avenue number II.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.160
So, if you have that
CD or anything, go back

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.740
and listen to Stetson Kennedy.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.280
Another one of the songs
is Kennedy, he's that man,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.780
I'll just read a
little chorus of it.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.620
As I say, these songs
were great,

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.960
they didn't swing the
election, but they were great.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.670
This -- Kennedy, He's That Man.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:42.190
"Stetson Kennedy, he's that man,
walks and talks across our land.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.890
Talking out against the Ku Klux
Klan, for every fiery cross

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.840
and note, I'll get
Kennedy 100 votes.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.060
And I'll walk him to his
office on that morning, yes,

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:56.060
I'll walk him -- meet him
in his office on that day.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.570
I'll write Kennedy
in that square box

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.400
on the sweet election morn,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.930
and I'll writer old Smathers
Dupont down the drain.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:08.240
I'll melt all your guns and
tanks into homes for every Yank.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.860
Stetson Kennedy knows my
troubles, he's that man.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.730
Stetson Kennedy, he's that
man, he knows my hopes

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.460
and prayers and plans.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.820
Knows I need a job of work for
life from cradle to my grave.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.600
From Key West, north
to Jacksonville.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.270
Stetson Kennedy fills my bill,
and I'll walk him to his office

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:33.830
on the morning, yes, I'll take
him to his office on that day."

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.420
Woody Guthrie actually
would come back to stay

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.480
at Beluthahatchee in 1952,

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.520
where he would write
a total of 88 songs.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.580
And he -- and at the same time,
he finished his manuscript

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.410
for Seeds of Man
while he was there.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.970
So, Beluthahatchee was
designated a Florida landmark

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.670
in 2003 by The Friends
of Libraries USA due

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:01.480
to Woody's creativity
while he was in Florida.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.750
Woody had an a -- now, you have
to understand, Stetson was not

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.320
on his land at that time, I'll
tell you about where he was.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.960
So, Woody and his girlfriend
at the time, his companion

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.140
at the time, Andike[Phonetic]
had come to Beluthahatchee,

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.490
they were living in the woods.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:22.550
It was very scandalous, because
apparently, they were taken

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.400
to going naked a
lot of the times.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.060
But, he had an accident with
lighter fluid when he was there,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.720
and his -- there was
-- this was great.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.990
I found -- this is the
file on record when he went

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:38.290
to the emergency room.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.990
They had a little fire,
you know, when you go in

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.050
and they have to take
information from you,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.350
and they never show
you what's on file.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:51.140
This was it, "Patent says he
plays stringed instruments.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.380
The patient is a peculiar, he
wears shaggy hair and beard,

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.650
which he says is to
keep the mosquitos away.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:02.700
This couple are drifters, came
down here several months ago.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.590
Patient is supposed to be
a musician, folk music.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.010
He has quite a history."

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.000
[ Laughter ]

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:18.040
So, anyway, Woody was
down there, and as I said,

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:22.210
Stetson was not there,
he was in Europe.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.980
In 1952, the UNESCO Conference

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.760
of the U.S. National Commission
was meeting in Paris and Geneva.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.480
And there was an
ad hoc committee

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.770
that would hear evidence
on forced labor

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.160
and slavery across the world.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.540
Stetson had heard that they had
concluded there was no forced

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.800
labor in the United States.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.300
He contacted the
committee to insist

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:51.110
that he had irrefutable evidence
of forced labor in Florida.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.360
He was referring to the
recordings that he had done

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.660
as a folklorist

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.360
in the Turpentine camps
of the Pan Handle.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.010
With testimony by poor
Black workers who were kept

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.170
in virtual slavery by being
quartered out in the pinewoods

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.010
under the eye of
a White overseer.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.620
And they were paid in script,

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.800
which meant they could
only spend their money

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.700
at the company store, which was
also in the middle of the woods.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.150
And they were forever in
debt, and those who tried

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.790
to run away were
murdered if caught.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.380
And Stetson, actually, this
is an aside, he would tell me

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.150
about when they were
doing this recording,

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.940
he had gotten permission to
bring the big recording machine

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.500
into the woods by saying he
was collecting folk songs.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.690
And so, as long as the
overseer was around,

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.830
they would be collecting
folk songs.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.120
And when the overseer went away,

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.640
he started collecting
stories about the life.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.720
And he had a lookout there,
and -- who would say, "Quick!

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.320
The man coming, sing a song!"

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.050
And so, they'd go
back to singing songs.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:01.710
But, he collect -- collected
quite an amazing amount

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.670
of material.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.160
Similar conditions were found
in the migrant labor camps

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.810
of South Florida's
vegetable farms.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:15.150
And so, on November 5, 1952,
Stetson Kennedy boarded a plane

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.420
for Geneva to present
this evidence

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.230
to the UNESCO Committee.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:23.800
He had a one-way ticket and
seven dollars to his name,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.090
and he wouldn't return
for eight years.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.530
After the UNESCO conference
where he did give testimony,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.690
Stetson went behind the
Iron Curtain illegally,

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.820
and this is a funny story.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.590
He -- back at that time,
he was in West Berlin,

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.030
and he got on the subway.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:45.500
And when you hit the end of
West Berlin and you're going

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.620
into East Berlin, at the time,
they would just tell you,

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.890
if you don't have papers
to go into East Berlin,

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.730
you've got to get off
the subway now, well,

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.540
he just didn't get off.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.520
And so, he comes
up in East Berlin,

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.260
and that's another whole
story for another whole day,

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.150
but it's in the book,
and what happened

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.580
to him behind the Iron Curtain.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.840
But, he was hoping to find
that Communism was a system

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.430
of equality and fairness.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.050
At this time, of course,
everybody was really looking

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.050
for answers any way they could.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.250
And he was crushed to
find that the Roma people,

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:24.060
the Gypsies of the Soviet
Union were just as oppressed

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.980
as the Blacks of
the American South.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.120
So, Communism was not
the answer either.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.620
So, Stetson escaped the Soviet
Union, believe it or not.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.310
He was in Hungary and Budapest
during the Hungarian Revolution

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:40.750
of 1956.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:44.660
And he escaped back to Paris
where he was basically put

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.850
under house arrest by
the Paris Jean d'armes,

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.590
because he was a person
without a valid passport.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:55.160
So, he would be let go during
the day to have a 24-hour pass,

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.570
but he had to check himself
back into jail at night.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.510
It worked out well for
him, actually, he was --

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:04.930
he got three squares
a day, yeah.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:08.090
It was at this time that
Stetson met and became friends

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:11.040
with a large community
of American ex-patriots,

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.660
including Richard
Wright, who was trying

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.830
to get him a new passport.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.200
But, as you can imagine,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.250
the House on American Activities
Committee did not look favorably

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.710
on a man who had been
writing for the Soviet TASS.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.440
Finally, it was Jean Paul
Sartre who pulled strings

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.820
and got Stetson a passport to
return home in February of 1960.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.430
Now, when he was overseas,
he was not just lying around.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.230
While in Europe, Stetson
had been published

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:43.400
in 20 different languages.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.820
And so, these are just
some of the book covers --

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:50.610
books that he was
writing when he was there.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:54.430
And when he came back, he
again stared his civil rights

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.730
and labor advocacy immediately.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.200
And this is a letter he
received from Martin Luther King

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.930
in 1965 thanking
him for his work.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.520
So, my original dissertation
was written in 1992,

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.470
and my research really
revolved on Stetson's life

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.700
up until this time, the 1960s.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.020
But, Stetson's life
continued to revolve

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.380
around cultural advocacy.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.110
And you know, he lived
another 50 years,

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:27.200
so it's a very full life.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.870
During the 1970s and 80s,
this was when I knew Stetson,

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:33.360
he was working with
the Seminole Tribe

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.140
on traditional cultural issues.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.350
This is him with Jim
Billy who's still the,

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.020
again, the tribal head.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.630
He also worked with Alan
Lomax on several projects,

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.320
and reacquainted with
him in his later years.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.250
This is from 1999, I think
that's when Alan actually came

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:56.980
up to be a living legend.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:02.750
In his later years, they,
you know, connected again,

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:08.590
and up until Lomax's death
they were fast friends.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.440
He also caught up with Ramblin'
Jack Elliot, and here they are

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.090
at Pete Seeger's
90th birthday party

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:19.030
in Madison Square
Garden backstage.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:24.350
And they became, of
course, great friends again.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.130
And he worked with Arlo Guthrie

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:30.520
to get Woody's unpublished
songs published.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.220
Now, before I retired and moved
back to Florida, this picture's

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.740
from 2009, I began
working with Stetson

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.900
and the Stetson Kennedy
Foundation on several issues.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.700
And this is one of my favorite
photos, it's of course,

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.120
Ramblin' Jack Elliot,
Arlo Guthrie,

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.320
and Stetson at a festival
that we held to raise money

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.660
to open a Writers
Residency at Beluthahatchee.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.520
Stetson was also great
friends with MaVynee Betsch.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.230
Has anybody heard of MaVynee
Betsch, the Beach Lady?

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.830
Yeah, she was a force
of nature, and she

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.910
and Stetson were
fast, fast friends.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.160
MaVynee Betsch is the
great-granddaughter

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.850
of Abraham Lincoln Lewis,

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:19.570
who was the very first Black
millionaire from Jacksonville.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:24.290
He had the African-American
life insurance company.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:29.560
And back then, even the
ocean was segregated, and so,

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.690
Abraham Lincoln Lewis
bought 200 acres

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:37.270
on Amelia Island,
which is my home now.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.250
And he started American Beach
which was advertised as the,

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:47.120
really the first
African-American resort

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.500
and vacation community
in Florida.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:56.680
And MaVynee was an opera singer
at one time, she left that

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.050
and came down back
to American Beach.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.130
When I met her -- I met
her a couple of times.

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.050
She had dreadlocks that
were like, seven feet long,

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.960
literally, a dreadlock that
went down to her ankles,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.760
and she's got it piled here.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.540
She was doing advocacy
work for --

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.730
she got a dune system on the
National Historic Register,

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:20.540
the largest dune system
in Florida called Nana.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.290
And she was just
an amazing woman,

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.800
and go any of you
know Jeanetta Cole?

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.400
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Okay.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.700
Well, when I was
getting ready --

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.810
so, I knew MaVynee and I knew
Jeanetta, because I'd worked

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:39.380
with Jeanetta when she was the
president of Spellman College.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.040
And then, she became
the director

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.430
of the Smithsonian's
Museum of African Art.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.550
And so, we were having
lunch, and I said, well,

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.400
I'm going to be retiring,
you know, soon.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.110
And she says, "Oh, are you
going to stay up here?"

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.850
And I said, well, no,
I'm moving to Florida.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.260
And she says, "Oh, Florida,
where are you moving to?"

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.560
And I said, well,
it's a little island,

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.690
you probably never heard of it.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.990
And she says, "What island?"

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.290
And I said, Amelia Island.

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.950
She put down her
fork, and she says,

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:10.550
"My great-grandfather Abraham
Lincoln Lewis founded American

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:12.840
Beach, and MaVynee is my sister.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.140
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.550
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: And I could
see the family resemblance,

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.920
there's like the
yen and the yang.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.450
I mean, Jeanetta always
perfectly coiffed, yeah,

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.320
but anyway, it was just great.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:31.890
So, these two women
forceful in their own areas,

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:35.300
and still have a connection
with American Beach.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.600
So, Stetson of course,
worked with MaVynee

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.840
on several environmental issues.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:48.400
And in his last decade, Stetson
was featured in several exhibits

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.240
on the Klan, and on
Florida's, I guess,

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.300
Civil Rights history
and labor history.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.000
And he worked with the NAACP,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.630
the Center for Democratic
Renewal,

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:05.310
the Southern Regional
Counsel, Klan Watch,

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.270
and the Southern
Poverty Law Center.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.550
He was a consultant, and
also donated many objects

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.010
to museums and archives.

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.620
And I believe that this
Klan robe he donated

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:20.970
to the new African American
Museum here on the mall.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:27.150
Beluthahatchee was
dedicated a literary landmark

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:33.110
for the second time in 2014, and
this time for Stetson's writing.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:38.030
And these are just photos
of Stetson at Beluthahatchee

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:42.660
in his last years, and he
continued to be active.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.690
This is Beluthahatchee Lake,

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:47.950
and he has a statue
of blue heron there.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:53.130
He had a pet blue heron
he loved for many years.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:58.700
At the age of 90, Stetson
married for the seventh time.

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.610
On November 24, 2006
to Sandra Parks,

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.830
who is an activist
from St. Augustine.

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.380
And then, they continued
to fight for civil rights,

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.020
labor struggles, and
environmental conservation.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.750
And these are just the last
photos I have of Stetson.

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:20.220
This is in D.C. of
course, at a demonstration,

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.390
at an anti-Klan demonstration.

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:28.620
Also, back in Florida, he was
protesting public supermarkets,

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.460
because they wouldn't support a
once cent increase in the price

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.210
of tomatoes, so tomato pickers
could get health insurance.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.680
So, he was very active
in helping them.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.070
I love this, out with his
walker, and has a sign, yes!

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:49.420
And this is with NAACP workers.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.060
This tree Stetson saved from
developers, they were going

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:57.260
to tear it down for development,
and it's now a Heritage tree.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.830
And then, in 2005,
Stetson was inducted

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.290
to the Florida Artists
Hall of Fame.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.030
And here he is with the --

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.540
our governor at the
time was Jeb Bush.

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.650
And this is him with
Lawton Childs,

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:15.450
the Progressive politician
from Florida,

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.630
had that same dedication.

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.840
And of course, he
was a speech --

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.020
featured speaker here at the
Library of Congress in 2005,

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.330
and that's all videotaped.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:33.820
And as I was talking to somebody
before, most of his papers are

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.730
at the PK Yonge collection
at the University of Florida.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.280
And they're also at the
Schaumburg Collection

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.180
in New York, and the Georgia
State University Labor archives.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.860
and of course, Florida Archives

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.500
from the WPA collections
is up online here.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:54.780
And if you haven't gotten
in to it, I recommend it.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:59.990
August 27,2011, Stetson
Kennedy died.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.150
It was just before
his 95th birthday,

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:07.170
and there was a huge celebration
in honor of his life.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.440
And this is of course,
Beluthahatchee Lake,

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.040
and his daughter is spreading
his ashes on the lake.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.450
And, although it was sad,

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.030
I'm kind of glad Stetson
has not been alive

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:22.450
for the past several
years in terms

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:26.230
of what's happening
with our country.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.500
And I just have to --
I have to put that in,

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.250
but I won't get political.

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:34.510
And that's it.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:43.500
[ Applause ]

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.100
I could probably
take a few questions,

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.890
if anybody's got any questions?

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:50.190
Yes?

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:51.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Peggy.

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.540
What an incredible life, and
can't wait to read your book.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.280
My question is, what
started this young man

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.330
from a privileged background?

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:06.450
What got him thinking against
the grain, and in particular,

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:08.860
perhaps going into folk lore.

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.860
I mean, not only is there the
world view, but I'm astonished

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.190
at this young kid going out
and doing serious field work.

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:18.500
So, that's actually a
couple different questions

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.210
that come up [inaudible].

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.510
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bugler" Yeah.

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:25.610
Well, there were two things
that he mentions to me over

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.630
and over again in the
interviews I did with him.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:31.310
One was that they had a Black
maid when he was growing up.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:35.480
And he had -- when he
was a very young boy,

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.230
he had seen her being
beat up by a,

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:44.030
I think it was a
trolley car operator,

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.750
because she didn't
have the fare,

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.880
and he was just horrified
as a young boy.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.730
But, I think what really started
him was that he had to go

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:54.960
into these neighborhoods
to get the dollar a week.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.150
And he would hear
stories, first of all,

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.760
about why they don't
have the dollar.

00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.070
But, also stories that would
just evolve from there,

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:07.170
both Black and White,
and realize that --

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:12.390
you know, that got him totally
out of his bailiwick into,

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:16.130
you know, the kind of poverty
that was just all around,

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:18.660
but nobody was recognizing it.

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:24.910
And then, just because
he started realizing

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.570
that he was hearing words
he'd never heard of before.

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.060
And he would make notes of them,

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.150
and that just started
then jokes.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.730
He would, you know,
do jokes, and so,

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:40.230
that was really the
start of his education.

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.040
He would be like 15 years old

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.450
when he really kind
of, got into it.

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:46.330
And then, of course, when
he went away to college,

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.760
then the rest was history.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.630
Yeah. Yeah?

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:55.420
&gt;&gt; What was the callous theme
to actually go undercover?

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.100
Was there an incident, or
was it just [inaudible]?

00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.400
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: What's that?

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.180
&gt;&gt; Was it one incident
that caused him to do --

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.690
it was a very profound act
to go undercover like that?

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:09.670
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Well, his
uncle was named John Perkins,

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:14.510
he was dead at the time, and
his uncle was a Klan member

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.810
when he was alive.

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.870
And so, Stetson, you know,

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:22.750
throughout his life
was really dedicated

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.050
to civil rights issues.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:28.910
And he couldn't go in the army,
and I think he felt very bad

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:37.390
about not being able to -- well,
this -- wait, let me go back.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.810
Like I said, he was
really trying to figure

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.280
out what is the answer?

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.380
It wasn't like democracy
was, you know,

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.820
totally had a lock on it.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.280
He was looking at Communism,
he was looking -- some --

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.600
how can we alleviate
the poverty?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.790
Because in Florida at the time,

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:57.330
and living through
The Depression.

01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:00.780
And then when he went down
to Key West, you know,

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.970
and he saw that, you know,
people are resilient.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:08.790
He decided that the hate
groups were Fascists.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.610
And Fascism was the thing
that we really have to fight.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:16.170
And so, you can fight
the Nazis in Germany,

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.830
or you can fight them here.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:21.260
And that's what he decided,
especially since, you know,

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.540
the governor of Georgia
was a member.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.290
Most of the policemen
were members, and so,

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:32.100
the people in power were
hiding under the hoods,

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.500
but they were Fascists.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.910
And so, that's what
made him do it.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:41.810
&gt;&gt; I was curious about
how his family reconciled

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.110
his difference?

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.350
Did he maintain a good
relationship with parents

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:49.470
and siblings, or were they just
like, "You are too out there?"

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:50.770
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: No.

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:54.500
Over the years -- at the
very end of his life,

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:59.070
he had a fairly okay
relationship

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:00.370
with his younger sister.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:06.020
But, his parents they -- he
could never keep his mouth shut.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.570
You know, if -- you know how
-- I don't know about you,

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.420
but when I go to a family,
you know, Thanksgiving,

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.460
I just kind of don't talk
about religion and politics.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.570
Just don't talk about it, you
know, because it is, you know,

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.710
you're in a family where --
he was just so out there.

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.660
And they were so
embarrassed by him,

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.370
because they were,
you know, society.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.510
They were southern
society, yeah.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:34.970
&gt;&gt; Not to take anything at
all away from this great man,

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:38.570
but it -- there have been
suggestions in recent years

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:44.020
that to some extent, he may have
embellished the degree to --

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.320
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: You're talking

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.750
about Steven Dubner
Freakanomics, yeah.

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.050
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:53.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That was the
saddest -- that was a sad day.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.350
Here's Stetson who's in his
90s, who's been working all

01:02:56.350 --> 01:03:02.080
of his life for -- okay, in my
dissertation, Steven Dubner,

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.770
who's one of the
coauthors of Freakanomics.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.040
They -- in their original book
they did one of the chapters

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.810
on why is the Klu Klux Klan
like an insurance company

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:13.110
or something like that?

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.290
Anyway, they had come down
and interviewed Stetson,

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:19.220
and Stetson never
asked them for a dime.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.170
They used his story
to make, you know,

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.740
a kazillion dollars
on Freakanomics.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:32.670
Anyway, after the book came out,
there is an author if Florida,

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.810
Ben Green, and who's
a historian,

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:39.820
who has a long-standing
-- I wouldn't say feud.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:44.700
But, a long-standing
animosity with Stetson.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.170
And he contacted
them and said, "Oh,

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.610
you know Stetson
didn't do all that.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:56.840
He -- " well, and in
fact, he was very --

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.520
almost to the point
of libeling Stetson.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.700
So, I get a call from Dubner,
and he wanted my dissertations,

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.480
so he could read
what I had written.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.050
So, I gave it -- you know, I
told him where he could get it.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.880
And I -- and he asked me
about it, and I said, no,

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.370
in my dissertation even --
and you know, and Stetson,

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:23.660
when he was talking to
me, he said, "You know,

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.680
I was undercover with
another man who never wanted

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.410
to be -- he was smart.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.470
He never wanted to
be identified, so,

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.620
be didn't want anything,
no mention of him at all."

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.520
But, I said, he -- we're
calling him, you know, John Doe.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.280
But, there was another
man who was also working

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.610
with Stetson and
doing this work.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:48.190
But, somehow that got blown
complete -- and here's my own --

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:53.670
my own theory is that, the
authors of Freakanomics wanted

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.570
to sell more books, so
they wrote this article

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.150
in the New York Times
Magazine called Hoodwinked.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.630
In which they, you
know, took everything

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:07.250
that Ben Green had said,
and you know, said, "Oh",

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.840
you know, "He's made this up."

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.530
Well, they used my
dissertation as a citation.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.310
And I was furious, so I wrote
to the New York Times Magazine,

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.290
and do did Studs Terkel.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:24.340
And so, I'm very
happy that my letter,

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.740
and Studs Terkel's letter
are right there together.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.380
But, I said, where
is the smoking gun?

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.150
You know, Dubner --
he admitted to me,

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:33.910
never read my dissertation,

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:37.030
all he did was look
at the one citation.

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:40.070
And he's writing like he
knows what he's talking about,

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.370
he doesn't.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.400
And first of all, if he had
gone down and done all this work

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.280
with Stetson, shouldn't he
had found that out right away?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.290
I mean, it was no big secret.

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:54.670
And the way that Stetson writes,
if you can get a copy of I Rode

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:58.720
with the Klu Klux Klan, which is
his book, you know, the expose.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.100
It reads like a Mickey
Spillane novel, it's --

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.630
you know, and it was like
Stetson wanted his audience

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.990
to be the people who were under
the hoods who were thinking

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.400
about getting under the hoods.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.820
He wasn't writing for
an academic audience.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.000
He wasn't writing for
the history books,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.920
he was writing something that
would capture their imagination,

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.390
and make them realize,
this is not the way to go.

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:27.420
You know, this is -- and
how crazy this is, you know?

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.810
This is -- so, it was
like a big brouhaha.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.870
And unfortunately, it about
killed Stetson, I mean,

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:41.050
he was so upset, because,
you know, he just didn't want

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:43.390
to have to go to court
and everything like that.

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.040
But, it kind of --
that's what it was.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.740
And I do -- in the book,
I get into that, yeah.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, one more question,

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:56.530
we're going to do one
question, we're [inaudible].

01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.040
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Okay.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.340
No? Oh.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.350
&gt;&gt; I've heard Stetson
tell the story of going

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.510
down in Key West
a number of times,

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.980
and he always made it very
clear, the he shipped a crate

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.320
of books ahead of him, so that
it got there before he did,

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.310
so he continued his studies.

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.370
So, the question I have is ,
do you know why he did drop

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:17.530
of school, and do that?

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:20.350
&gt;&gt; Peggy Bulger: Yeah, he
ran out of money, mm-hmm.

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.910
It was the Depression,
and his family wasn't --

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:25.870
you know, because he
was so radicalized,

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:27.170
they weren't going
to support him.

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:31.260
He had one aunt who would send
him five-dollars a month back

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.560
in Key West.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.920
And back in that time that
was enough to survive on --

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.940
with his WPA job, or, you
know, racking seaweed.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.710
Yeah. That -- good point.

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:42.010
Yeah.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.310
&gt;&gt; I want to thank Peggy Bulger

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:46.010
for a wonderful talk,
and for coming.

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:51.330

01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:52.630
Thank you.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.010
&gt;&gt; She'll be signing
books in the foyer,

01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:58.790
and there's also a small
exhibit over on the side on some

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:01.120
of the material on
Stetson Kennedy

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.880
from the American
Folklife Center.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.620
And thank you so
much for coming.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.960
And please come back tomorrow,

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.000

called the American Folklife

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.180
Centers Archive Challenge.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.010
Where we have a group
of wonderful musicians

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:17.950
who have taken material
from our collection,

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:19.990
and are going to
be performing it.

01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:22.090
So, here tomorrow at noon.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:25.510
Please come back and
join us then, thank you.
