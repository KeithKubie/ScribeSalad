00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:03.401
- Tonight, we're celebrating
the timeless values

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:05.480
that President Kennedy lived by

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.900
and that have made America
the indispensable nation.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.067
Courage, patriotism,
justice, innovation, service,

00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:18.029
and the commitment to building
a more peaceful world.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.046
As his family, we're
proud of what he stood for

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:22.875
and its continuing power.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.872
Tonight, we're honored by the presence

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:26.669
of so many public servants who

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.002
live these values every day.

00:00:29.936 --> 00:00:32.784
This award celebrates
the indispensable quality

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:35.677
in public life that my
father most admired.

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:40.112
The courage to risk your
career to do what's right.

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:42.726
That may mean standing
for the national interest

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.710
when others are willing to trade it away

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.397
for personal or local benefit.

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.638
It may mean reaching
out to work with others

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.593
to benefit the common good

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.747
when you could score points
by criticizing them instead.

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.783
Over the years, we've
honored elected officials

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.956
at all levels of government
from both sides of the aisle.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.399
They have reaffirmed our faith

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.516
in principled public service

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:09.998
and set a standard by which
future leaders can be measured.

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.585
Our winners have shown us that we need

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:13.789
to reward courage in our leaders

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.274
and require it in ourselves.

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:17.659
Today, when many doubt the

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.535
integrity of our elected officials,

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.362
this award is more important than ever.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:24.866
Many of you, here in this room,

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.393
cast your first vote
for President Kennedy.

00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:30.159
You've told me how he changed your lives.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.604
And, together, you changed this country.

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:35.178
Tonight, we present the
Profile in Courage Award

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.610
to President Obama,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.471
who had the same impact
on another generation.

00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.608
Inspiring us, our
children, and grandchildren

00:01:42.608 --> 00:01:44.689
to change the world.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.527
On a personal note, I want to thank you

00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:48.889
for giving me the chance to serve.

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.966
In Japan, I saw, firsthand,

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.943
what American leadership
means to the world.

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.263
I saw the power of our commitment

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:58.708
to a rules-based international order

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:00.993
in lifting people out of poverty.

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.804
I saw the hope and
idealism of young people

00:02:03.804 --> 00:02:07.125
inspired by American
innovation and possibility.
