00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
the collective wisdom of all of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
humankind led to the medical

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
advancements that made us modern we're

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.750
attacking the things that harm us on a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.780
microscopic level we're finding new ways

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.990
of preventing disease everyday question

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.220
is how far can we go

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.680
what seems to be fantasy and sci-fi in

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.380
the world of health and human body is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
actually just right around the corner

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
imagine having your own personal catalog

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.010
of replacement tissue sitting on a shelf

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.070
we can tweak a skin cell and turn it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.879
into a brain so and rebuild your body

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
parts

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.320
that's the horizon and it's not far away

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.199
it's not 50 years away

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.870
it's going on right now this lab is to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.190
genetics what the printing press was to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.300
written work

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.949
here in this lab we synthesized DNA so a

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.920
lot of people have heard about the human

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.880
genome project where DNA was coded but

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.650
here what we're doing is actually

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.630
building pieces of DNA the DNA code in

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.670
every cell it's not only a source of

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.530
information for example your eye color

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.780
your hair color height but it's also

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.060
sort of control of different processes

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.039
in your body things like regenerating

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.820
cells at different speeds in different

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:31.149
parts of your body it's an incredible

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.570
incredible technology our overarching

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.460
goal is making DNA ubiquitous to make it

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.170
available to everyone the things that

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.259
we're working on right now we know can

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.259
be game-changing better more specific

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.159
drugs personalized drugs

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.130
we're enabling a lot of different types

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.360
of projects but i always like to think

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.970
about the people that are studying

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.929
cancer there's been a lot of cancer in

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.220
my family

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:06.879
cancer is a very dynamic disease but if

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.690
you can accelerate research then you can

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:13.120
actually create a designer therapy for a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.739
specific tumor and faster you can do

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.170
that the earlier you can intervene and

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.310
that's everything in cancer

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.810
in the world of synthetic biology it's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.220
either going to be the thing that saves

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.069
humanity or the thing that kills

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.890
humanity so were part of an organization

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.830
that self police's in the industry we

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.930
have different protocols to ensure that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.110
none of us will design and build

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.819
something harmful to humanity and I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.160
think as we think about medicine

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.010
this is the next revolution in Madison

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.050
this is the ability to really create

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.489
personalized medicine it's an

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.489
opportunity to help humankind
