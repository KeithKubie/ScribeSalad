What do you think David?

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; So in resolution theorem proving, we
start with whatever it is we assumed and

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.170
look for the negation of
that in an earlier sentence.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.950
Here we find not bird, and bird in S1.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.088
So we're going to resolve on not bird
and bird and leave both of those out.

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:16.731
&gt;&gt; That's good.
