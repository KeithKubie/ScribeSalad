bit different in this population as
 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.650
bit different in this population as
relates to heart disease compared to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660
relates to heart disease compared to
 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.080
relates to heart disease compared to
other populations and we also have a

higher prevalence of diabetes and this
 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.510
higher prevalence of diabetes and this
is in the absence of some risk factors

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
is in the absence of some risk factors
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520

with different BM eyes and told and
 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.350
with different BM eyes and told and
asked which one they thought was healthy

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360
asked which one they thought was healthy
 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.570
asked which one they thought was healthy
and they pointed to the one that was the

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580
and they pointed to the one that was the
 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.600
and they pointed to the one that was the
largest the had the highest BMI because

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610
largest the had the highest BMI because
 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.060

they thought while that woman can have

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070
they thought while that woman can have

children very easily and she looks to be
 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.680
children very easily and she looks to be
the healthiest so just different ideas

00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.690
the healthiest so just different ideas
 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.830
the healthiest so just different ideas
about what is a healthy figure what's a

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840
about what is a healthy figure what's a
 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.530

when it comes to children they also feel
 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.990
when it comes to children they also feel
that a child who is heavier is also a

that a child who is heavier is also a
 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.890
that a child who is heavier is also a
healthier child so so why wait so

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900
healthier child so so why wait so
 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.480
healthier child so so why wait so
there's different ideas about what

Asians and heart disease and their
biggest barriers to to a healthy

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240
biggest barriers to to a healthy
 

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.120
biggest barriers to to a healthy
lifestyle was eating unhealthy foods

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.130
lifestyle was eating unhealthy foods
 

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.980
lifestyle was eating unhealthy foods
during festivals and social gatherings

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:49.990
during festivals and social gatherings
 

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.169
during festivals and social gatherings
and a lack of time to prepare healthy

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:52.179
and a lack of time to prepare healthy
 

00:30:52.179 --> 00:30:54.090
and a lack of time to prepare healthy
foods which is probably coming to most

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:54.100
foods which is probably coming to most
 

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.310
foods which is probably coming to most
of us and a big benefit was eating

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320
of us and a big benefit was eating
 

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.990
of us and a big benefit was eating
healthy to prevent heart disease and

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000
healthy to prevent heart disease and
 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.240
healthy to prevent heart disease and
eating and exercising for more energy

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.250
eating and exercising for more energy
 

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.649
eating and exercising for more energy
which was also in line with a lot of

00:31:01.649 --> 00:31:01.659
which was also in line with a lot of
 

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:10.820
which was also in line with a lot of
information we got from focus groups and

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:10.830
 

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.379
as I mentioned before most of them were

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:13.389
as I mentioned before most of them were
 

00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:15.600
as I mentioned before most of them were
in the action maintenance stages of all

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:15.610
in the action maintenance stages of all
 

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.870
in the action maintenance stages of all
this five key behaviors and the most

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880
this five key behaviors and the most
 

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.930
this five key behaviors and the most
significant change was talking to

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:21.940
significant change was talking to
 

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.930
significant change was talking to
provider about their part disease

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:24.940
provider about their part disease
 

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:35.760
provider about their part disease
malcontent rather than just a moment

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:35.770
 

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.620
so for women who were active in all the

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:38.630
so for women who were active in all the
 

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.310
so for women who were active in all the
the five stages before they were more

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320
the five stages before they were more
 

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.260
the five stages before they were more
likely to be actively engaged in express

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.270
likely to be actively engaged in express
 

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.180
likely to be actively engaged in express
confidence and the other key behavior so

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.190
confidence and the other key behavior so
 

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.130
confidence and the other key behavior so
people who are felt confident gauging

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.140
people who are felt confident gauging
 

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.810
people who are felt confident gauging
physical activity are more likely to

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:49.820
physical activity are more likely to
 

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.640
physical activity are more likely to
engage and also feel confident and

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:51.650
engage and also feel confident and
 

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.410
engage and also feel confident and
talking to their health provider great

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:53.420
talking to their health provider great
 

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.120
talking to their health provider great
healthy meals and choosing healthy

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.130
healthy meals and choosing healthy
 

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.690
healthy meals and choosing healthy
options with the groceries and they also

00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:58.700
options with the groceries and they also
 

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.980
options with the groceries and they also
had a higher rating of health status and

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:01.990
had a higher rating of health status and
 

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.530
had a higher rating of health status and
those who were talking to the provider

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:04.540
those who were talking to the provider
 

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.360
those who were talking to the provider
were also older and had more risk

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:07.370
were also older and had more risk
 

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.160
were also older and had more risk
factors for heart disease which actually

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:09.170
factors for heart disease which actually
 

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.130
factors for heart disease which actually
is important they're older which means

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:12.140
is important they're older which means
 

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.470
is important they're older which means
the more than likely their provider was

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480
the more than likely their provider was
 

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.540
the more than likely their provider was
talking to them about heart disease just

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:16.550
talking to them about heart disease just
 

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:20.470
talking to them about heart disease just
as they would anybody else or they also

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480
as they would anybody else or they also
 

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.940
as they would anybody else or they also
talk to them because they had a lot of

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:21.950
talk to them because they had a lot of
 

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.010
talk to them because they had a lot of
risk factors for heart disease but at

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.020
risk factors for heart disease but at
 

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.390
risk factors for heart disease but at
least it was good to see that people who

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:25.400
least it was good to see that people who
 

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.400
least it was good to see that people who
had a lot of especially pharmacies were

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:27.410
had a lot of especially pharmacies were
 

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.130
had a lot of especially pharmacies were
talking to the provider about heart

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.140
talking to the provider about heart
 

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:39.010
talking to the provider about heart
disease so I looked at people who were

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:39.020
disease so I looked at people who were
 

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.750
disease so I looked at people who were
born in the US vs people who weren't

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760
born in the US vs people who weren't
 

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.620
born in the US vs people who weren't
born in the US I looked at people who

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:44.630
born in the US I looked at people who
 

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.630
born in the US I looked at people who
identified as acculturated versus not

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640
identified as acculturated versus not
 

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.600
identified as acculturated versus not
acculturated and looked at the

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:49.610
acculturated and looked at the
 

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.690
acculturated and looked at the
acculturation scale overall as a

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:51.700
acculturation scale overall as a
 

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.250
acculturation scale overall as a
continuous variable and found that non

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:54.260
continuous variable and found that non
 

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.250
continuous variable and found that non
acculturated women and women not more in

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:57.260
acculturated women and women not more in
 

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.630
acculturated women and women not more in
the US um were older and more likely to

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:01.640
the US um were older and more likely to
 

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.720
the US um were older and more likely to
have a partner in children and were also

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:04.730
have a partner in children and were also
 

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.130
have a partner in children and were also
more likely traditional South Asian

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.140
more likely traditional South Asian
 

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.080
more likely traditional South Asian
foods not surprisingly and they had also

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.090
foods not surprisingly and they had also
 

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.570
foods not surprisingly and they had also
had more risk factors if women who are

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:10.580
had more risk factors if women who are
 

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.190
had more risk factors if women who are
not acculturated women who are not born

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200
not acculturated women who are not born
 

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.770
not acculturated women who are not born
in the US had a lot more risk factors so

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:14.780
in the US had a lot more risk factors so
 

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.400
in the US had a lot more risk factors so
that just has important implications for

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.410
that just has important implications for
 

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:23.490
that just has important implications for
intervention on down the line so I also

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:23.500
intervention on down the line so I also
 

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.560
intervention on down the line so I also
looked at the best predictor of overall

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:25.570
looked at the best predictor of overall
 

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:30.270
looked at the best predictor of overall
change in behavior and the the two the

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:30.280
change in behavior and the the two the
 

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.640
change in behavior and the the two the
two variables that that turnout were a

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:32.650
two variables that that turnout were a
 

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.740
two variables that that turnout were a
perceived barriers to healthy lifestyle

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:34.750
perceived barriers to healthy lifestyle
 

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.120
perceived barriers to healthy lifestyle
for example the fewer perceived barriers

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.130
for example the fewer perceived barriers
 

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.340
for example the fewer perceived barriers
to healthy lifestyle that they had the

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.350
to healthy lifestyle that they had the
 

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.050
to healthy lifestyle that they had the
higher the global chain score on the

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:40.060
higher the global chain score on the
 

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.300
higher the global chain score on the
higher overall behavior change that

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:42.310
higher overall behavior change that
 

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:46.580
higher overall behavior change that
happened and a high positive evaluation

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:46.590
happened and a high positive evaluation
 

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.950
happened and a high positive evaluation
was also a high positive evaluation of

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960
was also a high positive evaluation of
 

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.020
was also a high positive evaluation of
the website and was also related to a

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:52.030
the website and was also related to a
 

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:57.900
the website and was also related to a
high will change score and the best

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:57.910
high will change score and the best
 

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.760
high will change score and the best
predictor of a positive rating of the

00:33:59.760 --> 00:33:59.770
predictor of a positive rating of the
 

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.850
predictor of a positive rating of the
South Asian web pages was that most

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:02.860
South Asian web pages was that most
 

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:08.280
South Asian web pages was that most
people gave it an eight-point 05 and the

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:08.290
people gave it an eight-point 05 and the
 

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.540
people gave it an eight-point 05 and the
most significant variable associated

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:09.550
most significant variable associated
 

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.040
most significant variable associated
that was confidence preparing healthy

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.050
that was confidence preparing healthy
 

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.480
that was confidence preparing healthy
meals which is not surprising because

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:14.490
meals which is not surprising because
 

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:17.159
meals which is not surprising because
most of the information as you saw on

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:17.169
most of the information as you saw on
 

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:18.840
most of the information as you saw on
the website was related to preparing

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:18.850
the website was related to preparing
 

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.210
the website was related to preparing
healthy meals and recipes and things

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:21.220
healthy meals and recipes and things
 

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.669
healthy meals and recipes and things
like that so in increased confidence

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679
like that so in increased confidence
 

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.409
like that so in increased confidence
repairing healthy meals and makes sense

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:25.419
repairing healthy meals and makes sense
 

00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:27.600
repairing healthy meals and makes sense
that they would if someone had increased

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:27.610
that they would if someone had increased
 

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.919
that they would if someone had increased
confidence for helping us make sense

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:28.929
confidence for helping us make sense
 

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.480
confidence for helping us make sense
they would also rate the website

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:30.490
they would also rate the website
 

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:34.350
they would also rate the website
marriage um so there are several

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:34.360
marriage um so there are several
 

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.930
marriage um so there are several
limitations to this study on the sample

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:36.940
limitations to this study on the sample
 

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.659
limitations to this study on the sample
was not representative it was a very

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:39.669
was not representative it was a very
 

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:42.870
was not representative it was a very
small sample and there's just inherent

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:42.880
small sample and there's just inherent
 

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.190
small sample and there's just inherent
challenges of a web-based servant

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200
challenges of a web-based servant
 

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.530
challenges of a web-based servant
intervention and I should say that the

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:46.540
intervention and I should say that the
 

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.450
intervention and I should say that the
intervention I develop myself I mean I

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:48.460
intervention I develop myself I mean I
 

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.540
intervention I develop myself I mean I
coded it interesting I'm not a coder so

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:51.550
coded it interesting I'm not a coder so
 

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.200
coded it interesting I'm not a coder so
it's clearly i mean we try to get

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.210
it's clearly i mean we try to get
 

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.370
it's clearly i mean we try to get
funding to make it something a little

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:56.380
funding to make it something a little
 

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.620
funding to make it something a little
bit jazzier but we weren't able to get

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:58.630
bit jazzier but we weren't able to get
 

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.120
bit jazzier but we weren't able to get
that so I mean there are limitations

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:21.180
health literacy what we did is when we
develop the website we didn't have an

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:21.190
develop the website we didn't have an
 

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.470
develop the website we didn't have an
explicit way of making sure that it was

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480
explicit way of making sure that it was
 

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.019
explicit way of making sure that it was
at a certain level I know usually count

00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:26.029
at a certain level I know usually count
 

00:39:26.029 --> 00:39:27.400
at a certain level I know usually count
syllables and they said we didn't do

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:27.410
syllables and they said we didn't do
 

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.799
syllables and they said we didn't do
that but what we did do is we sent out

00:39:29.799 --> 00:39:29.809
that but what we did do is we sent out
 

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:33.759
that but what we did do is we sent out
the website pages to people who were of

00:39:33.759 --> 00:39:33.769
the website pages to people who were of
 

00:39:33.769 --> 00:39:35.589
the website pages to people who were of
different backgrounds people had

00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599
different backgrounds people had
 

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:37.120
different backgrounds people had
different educational backgrounds and

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.130
different educational backgrounds and
 

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.390
different educational backgrounds and
had them reated and ask questions and we

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400
had them reated and ask questions and we
 

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.160
had them reated and ask questions and we
did that we send it to them and we also

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.170
did that we send it to them and we also
 

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.109
did that we send it to them and we also
physically sat down with people and

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119
physically sat down with people and
 

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:46.240
physically sat down with people and
while they were there we actually went

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:46.250
while they were there we actually went
 

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.650
while they were there we actually went
to a religious institution and gave it

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:47.660
to a religious institution and gave it
 

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.690
to a religious institution and gave it
to and had them out and had people just

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:49.700
to and had them out and had people just
 

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.769
to and had them out and had people just
kind of look at it and see if they had

00:39:50.769 --> 00:39:50.779
kind of look at it and see if they had
 

00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:55.539
kind of look at it and see if they had
any questions um but so that that's how

00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:55.549
any questions um but so that that's how
 

00:39:55.549 --> 00:40:00.640
any questions um but so that that's how
we did that but to be honest I mean and

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:00.650
we did that but to be honest I mean and
 

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.140
we did that but to be honest I mean and
I and I would definitely like more

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.150
I and I would definitely like more
 

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.700
I and I would definitely like more
inside each I would like to do more

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:03.710
inside each I would like to do more
 

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.470
inside each I would like to do more
research at some point about it because

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480
research at some point about it because
 

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.970
research at some point about it because
a lot of that health literacy is also

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:06.980
a lot of that health literacy is also
 

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.710
a lot of that health literacy is also
just about disease transmission I mean

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720
just about disease transmission I mean
 

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.089
just about disease transmission I mean
how do I mean there's just different

00:40:10.089 --> 00:40:10.099
how do I mean there's just different
 

00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:12.720
how do I mean there's just different
ideas about how people get diseases

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:12.730
ideas about how people get diseases
 

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.910
ideas about how people get diseases
anyway so beyond just understanding the

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920
anyway so beyond just understanding the
 

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.069
anyway so beyond just understanding the
words it's just sort of like

00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079
words it's just sort of like
 

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:20.680
words it's just sort of like
understanding how diseases happen kind

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:20.690
understanding how diseases happen kind
 

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.539
understanding how diseases happen kind
of thing that's that's also one part of

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:22.549
of thing that's that's also one part of
 

00:40:22.549 --> 00:40:23.829
of thing that's that's also one part of
health literacy and then the third

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839
health literacy and then the third
 

00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:33.320
health literacy and then the third
question I'm sorry for that I actually

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:33.330
 

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.620
that is the third one yes is it I don't

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:37.630
that is the third one yes is it I don't
 

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.750
that is the third one yes is it I don't
know is it very popular within this

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760
know is it very popular within this
 

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.609
know is it very popular within this
particular community of people that

00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:41.619
particular community of people that
 

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:46.100
particular community of people that
people have access to

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.110
 

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.660
color between income to help answer that

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:48.670
color between income to help answer that
 

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.000
color between income to help answer that
question yeah the meeting can was 100 to

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.010
question yeah the meeting can was 100 to
 

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.730
question yeah the meeting can was 100 to
150 k and they do and actually I do I

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:53.740
150 k and they do and actually I do I
 

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.590
150 k and they do and actually I do I
have that exact number my dissertation

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:55.600
have that exact number my dissertation
 

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.270
have that exact number my dissertation
summer but I don't I don't have it here

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280
summer but I don't I don't have it here
 

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.180
summer but I don't I don't have it here
but there is I got the number from sun

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:00.190
but there is I got the number from sun
 

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.220
but there is I got the number from sun
media outlet that said that South Asians

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.230
media outlet that said that South Asians
 

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.740
media outlet that said that South Asians
in America a South Asian Americans in

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:04.750
in America a South Asian Americans in
 

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.290

general I think there's like something

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:07.300
general I think there's like something
 

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.510
general I think there's like something
like seventy-three percent of them have

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520
like seventy-three percent of them have
 

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.510
like seventy-three percent of them have
home computers and certainly the the

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520
home computers and certainly the the
 

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.370
home computers and certainly the the
fact that the associate demographics

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:14.380
fact that the associate demographics
 

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.140
fact that the associate demographics
were so high it's not a representative

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.150
were so high it's not a representative
 

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.120
were so high it's not a representative
sample I think a lark lark a large part

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.130
sample I think a lark lark a large part
 

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.620
sample I think a lark lark a large part
of it has to do with the fact that the

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:19.630
of it has to do with the fact that the
 

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.680
of it has to do with the fact that the
westin computer based intervention it

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:22.690
westin computer based intervention it
 

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.540
westin computer based intervention it
was all English it required a certain

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:24.550
was all English it required a certain
 

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.800
was all English it required a certain
amount of health literacy so that

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:25.810
amount of health literacy so that
 

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.320
amount of health literacy so that
certainly had something to do with the

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:28.330
certainly had something to do with the
 

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.390
certainly had something to do with the
fact that the associate demographics

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400
fact that the associate demographics
 

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:46.599
fact that the associate demographics
were were so high

00:41:46.599 --> 00:41:46.609
 

00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:48.430
I'm sorry is the first part your

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440
I'm sorry is the first part your
 

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.470
I'm sorry is the first part your
presentation and maybe covered this but

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480
presentation and maybe covered this but
 

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.509
presentation and maybe covered this but
um I don't understand what the mechanism

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:52.519
um I don't understand what the mechanism
 

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:57.130
um I don't understand what the mechanism
is or why South Asians should have lower

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:57.140
is or why South Asians should have lower
 

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.579
is or why South Asians should have lower
BMI and lower cholesterol is there is

00:42:00.579 --> 00:42:00.589
BMI and lower cholesterol is there is
 

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:03.880
BMI and lower cholesterol is there is
there something you know what's going on

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:03.890
there something you know what's going on
 

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.749
there something you know what's going on
right right it's something called emit

00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:06.759
right right it's something called emit
 

00:42:06.759 --> 00:42:10.089
right right it's something called emit
metabolic syndrome there is an increased

00:42:10.089 --> 00:42:10.099
metabolic syndrome there is an increased
 

00:42:10.099 --> 00:42:12.849
metabolic syndrome there is an increased
amount of abdominal fat and there is

00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:12.859
amount of abdominal fat and there is
 

00:42:12.859 --> 00:42:15.640
amount of abdominal fat and there is
also an increased amount of I think of

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:15.650
also an increased amount of I think of
 

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.059
also an increased amount of I think of
LP 1 and it's a certain indicator that

00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:19.069
LP 1 and it's a certain indicator that
 

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:21.640
LP 1 and it's a certain indicator that
increases cholesterol the other thing is

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:21.650
increases cholesterol the other thing is
 

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.339
increases cholesterol the other thing is
our arteries are smaller significantly

00:42:24.339 --> 00:42:24.349
our arteries are smaller significantly
 

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:28.539
our arteries are smaller significantly
smaller and there's a third factor and

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:28.549
smaller and there's a third factor and
 

00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:30.549
smaller and there's a third factor and
we don't have a lot of the protective

00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559
we don't have a lot of the protective
 

00:42:30.559 --> 00:42:33.370
we don't have a lot of the protective
HDL that a lot of other populations have

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:33.380
HDL that a lot of other populations have
 

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.549
HDL that a lot of other populations have
so those that that constellation of

00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559
so those that that constellation of
 

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.440
so those that that constellation of
factors is called the metabolic syndrome

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:38.450
factors is called the metabolic syndrome
 

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.890
factors is called the metabolic syndrome
and asian indians and other south asians
