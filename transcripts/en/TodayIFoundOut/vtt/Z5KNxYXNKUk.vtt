00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.129
For four months from September 19, 1870 to
January 28, 1871, the Prussian Army laid siege

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.650
to the city of Paris, as part of the Franco-Prussian
War.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.539
Prior to having all supply lines cut off,
the French Ministry of Agriculture furiously

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.749
worked to gather as much food and fuel as
it could, and at the beginning, “livestock

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.359
blanket[ed] the Bois de Boulogne park on the
edge of Paris.”

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.980
Apparently insufficient, within less than
a month, the Parisians began butchering the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.770
horses, with the meat used as you would expect
and even the blood collected “for the purposes

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.110
of making puddings.”

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.110
By the end of the siege, approximately 65,000
horses were killed and eaten.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.450
Within another month, by November 12, 1870,
butchered dogs and cats began to appear for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
sale at the market alongside trays full of
dead rats and pigeons.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.530
The former pets sold for between 20 and 40
cents per pound, while a nice, fat rat could

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.550
go for 50.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.470
As Christmas approached, most of Paris’
restaurants and cafés were forced to close,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.580
although a few of its top eateries continued
serving, albeit with a markedly different

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.580
menu.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.710
And as traditional meats were becoming increasingly
scarce, the formerly impossible became the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.509
actual – when M. Deboos of the Boucherie
Anglaise (English Butcher) purchased a pair

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.060
of zoo elephants, named Castor and Pollux,
for 27,000 francs.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.729
The enormous animals were killed with explosive,
steel tipped bullets fired at close range,

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.740
chopped up and sold, with the trunks being
the most desirable and selling for 40-45 francs

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.979
per pound, and other parts between 10 and
14.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.350
Prized by the fine dining establishments,
for its Christmas feat, the Voisin served

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.090
elephant soup, and for New Year’s Day, Peter’s
Restaurant offered filet d’éléphant, sauce

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.090
Madère.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.979
The elephants weren’t the only zoo animals
featured on these menus, as the Voison also

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.439
served kangaroo and antelope, while Peter’s
also served peacock.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.740
In addition, rats, mules, donkeys, dogs and
cats were also transformed by their chefs

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.529
into roasts, chops, cutlets and ragouts.

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.630
Ultimately most of the animals in the zoo
were eaten, with the voracious Parisians sparing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.390
only the monkeys, lions, tigers and hippos.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.120
It is thought that the monkeys were left because
of their close resemblance to humans, but

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.290
it isn’t clear why the lions, tigers, and
hippos escaped the menu.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.780
In any event, the siege was ended by a 23-night
bombardment campaign in January, in which

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.879
the Prussians lobbed 12,000 shells into the
city, killing and wounding around 400 people.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:03:12.020
The Franco-Prussian War officially ended with
the Treaty of Frankfurt on May 10, 1871.
