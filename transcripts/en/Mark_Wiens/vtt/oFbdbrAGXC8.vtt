00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning everyone. It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com in Taipei, Taiwan.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This morning we are heading over to the Miniatures Museum of Taiwan.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.500
That's our first stop, and then from there we are hopefully going to have a hotpot lunch

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
and then go to a few other places.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So stay tuned for today's vlog from Taipei.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We have arrived, it looks like there's not a huge sign for it, but it's this banner, and it's housed in this big skyrise building, and it said to go to the basement floor 1.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
We got our tickets for 180 TWD

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and now we are just walking around the Taiwan Miniatures Museum

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So far I have seen mostly European and Victorian style houses and cottages and businesses

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
all models of them scaled down

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.000
but what's really impressive is the detail you can look inside of the houses and inside the living room

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and see even the furniture and the wallpaper

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.500
and people are very very well detailed

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
We didn't spend too long at the museum because I am ready for lunch

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
but the museum was alright, kind of small

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
but many good realistic, very realistic and very detailed models

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500
mostly European architecture and some famous buildings as well

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
That is the restaurant we are going right there across the street

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
and I believe in English it's called Old Sichuan

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.000
and so it's going to be a Sichuan-styled hotpot which I am looking forward to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Thank you

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
This is a really classy restaurant. I love the atmosphere here

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
We just ordered a couple of different plates

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.500
You order by the plates of meat, we also ordered some mixed vegetables

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
and then they bring you a pot of soup

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
they gave us this appetiser which they said is included

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
and it said green bean noodles, I think mung bean maybe, green mung beans

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.500
and then topped with peanuts and sichuan chillies and oil

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
This looks amazing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.500
Oh they're slippery

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.980
Those noodles are like slippery, very slippery

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but that is extremely good, that is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
it's very sour

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and then it has a beautiful dried chilli flavor to it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.000
we actually don't taste that oil really

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but it does has a nutty kind of sesame flavor as well

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we got our soup, we have divided between two different soups

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500
this one is the sichuan spicy soup

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.000
and then over here, I am not sure but kinda milky creamy looking soup

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
maybe a bone broth

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and they have brought over our plates of beef and pork which they set on a side table

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.500
the beef is a little bit fatty, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
but it's a little too fatty for me probably

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.000
but the pork over here looks very good, that one is pork shoulder

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500
but I am sure it's all going to taste amazing once dipped in that soup

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
okay, this is, this looks like bacon

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
but this is beef

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500
I gotta go into that spicy broth first

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
to test that out

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500
roll that around

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500
and I did not want to cook it too much

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500
going straight into my mouth from the pot

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.500
oh man...oh that's delicious

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.500
oh that's insane

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.500
I can feel those numbing sichuan peppercorns immediately

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
upon eating that piece of beef

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500
It just kinda make my tongue tingle a little bit

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.500
and that broth, it tasted very earthy

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500
and very just ???

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500
and that flavor

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500
Oh, I can ya, I can feel the peppercorn

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500
that is absolutely beautiful

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
oh man that's good. the meat is so good quality,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
and so thin

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500
that I did not even taste the fat

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
it just kind of melted

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500
so that was awesome

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500
okay, gotta taste this broth now

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.500
that meat is so good

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.500
okay, that broth is definitely more mild

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.000
and almost taste kind of milky

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500
okay, i am going to try the pork now

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.500
In go into this broth

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.500
Alright, I think that's cooked

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.500
The beef meat is a little more tender, because of all that fat

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.500
but that broth is just

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500
that blew in my mind that how flavorful it is

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
woah, that is so hot

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.500
and that is quite a beautiful presentation

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.500
and I will dip it in here, I am not sure how long

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500
and this sauce, there were a couple of different ingredients in there

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.500
and then the lady here told me to add

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.500
some of the spicy broth into the sauce

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500
to make the sauce

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.000
I think it's like a,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.500
oh my piece of fish fell apart

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
My entire mouth is just buzzing

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500
and my tongue is just tingling, I can barely feel it

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.500
and it is just sensational.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.500
I am loving every single bite of this

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Ying and I were eating in there for two hours

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.000
and that was by all means the best hotpot experience meal that I've ever had in my life

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
That was just mind-blowingly good

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.500
My mouth is still numb, and that was just insanely flavorful

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.500
and after, when we were done with our meal

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.000
Our waiter was really nice and he was cleaning up everything

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and he asked us, and he only spoke Chinese

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so I had no idea what he was saying, but

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.500
I just smiled and I just smiled in agreement

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.000
and in happiness of that meal and that food

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.500
and I don't know exactly what I said

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.500
but the next thing he came back

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
with a big bag of that soup

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500
broth from our hotpot

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500
so he packaged it to go, and so

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500
and so we have, Ying and I were laughing pretty hard

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.500
because we didn't, we have no idea what we did

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.500
we're just, we're just gleefully smiling

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500
with happiness from how delicious that meal was

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.000
but I guess we got our soup to go

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500
and so I have a big bag full of our

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
both of the soup broths

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.500
I have no idea what we're going to do with these soup broths

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500
but, maybe I will put it in my bath

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.500
and bathe in that, that pepper oil soup

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.500
Couple of days ago we tried to go to the Confucius Temple

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.000
actually that was last week

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
on Monday but it was closed, so I think we're

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.500
going to head there now since we're not too far

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.500
We arrived to Yuanshan station

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.000
which is little walk from the Confucius Temple

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500
and we're walking there now

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.000
This temple is very peaceful today

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.000
there are only a couple of people here that I can see

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and I'm going to check out the inside now

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.500
That was good to see, and definitely

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.000
when you come here you should combine

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the Confucius Temple with visiting the Baoan Temple

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.500
which is just across the street

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.000
as long as you don't come on a Monday

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
when this temple is closed

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and now we're going to head to the Fine Arts Museum

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
which is a little bit of a walk from here

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I've arrived to the Taipei Fine Arts Museum

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and the outside structure is pretty cool

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.500
made of glass and really boxy shape

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.500
but I know that it's a contemporary fine arts museum

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.500
and especially focusing on artists from Taiwan, local artists

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.500
The museum was pretty good, especially if you're interested

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500
in contemporary modern Taiwan art

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.500
and some very interesting exhibits on display as well

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.500
I'm still feeling the delicious effects of that lunch

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.500
and all I wanna do is go back to our hotel and relax

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.000
but we are actually going to go back to our hotel now

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500
because I need some work that I need to get done

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500
so I am going to end the vlog here in the mid afternoon

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.500
but I want to say thank you for watching this vlog

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
please remember to give it a thumbs up

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500
and leave a comment below

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.500
and I will see you on the next vlog from Taiwan
