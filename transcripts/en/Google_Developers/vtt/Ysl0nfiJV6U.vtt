00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.617
AVNI SHAH: Thanks to all of
you for being here today.

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:10.700
Especially, I know taking
time out of your weekend

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.310
is a big deal.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.701
And I also want to say
thanks for sharing snippets

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.075
of your personal story, for
those of you that just got up

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.030
a few minutes ago.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.070
I was just sitting
in the back, and it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.395
was pretty inspiring to hear.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.770
So I'm really
excited to be here.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.720
I'm really honored to
be helping kick off

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.954
the day with all of you.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:28.620
I thought I would
just talk a little bit

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.410
about my own personal
story, how I ended up

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.210
where I am, and
some of the things

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.860
that I've learned along the way.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.650
And I guess I'll start off
by making a confession.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.650
I was not one of
those kids that wanted

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.190
to study computer science from
the day I came out of the womb.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.620
I actually didn't even
touch a computer probably

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.610
until I was 10.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490
And even then, it
was to play games.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.672
I was playing "Oregon
Trail" or "Lemmings"

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:52.630
or something like that.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.526
I didn't teach myself to
code in my spare time.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:57.650
I was probably running
around with the neighborhood

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.080
kids or something like that.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.550
So I wasn't one
of those kids that

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.349
had computer science in their
blood from the early days.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.110
But there was
something that I liked

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.140
to do from when I was
young, and that was

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020
to build things with my hands.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.890
It started with
Legos, and then I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
graduated to building shelves
or furniture with my dad,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.510
to wiring our media cabinet, to
fixing things around the house.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.610
So I guess I knew
from an early age

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.530
that I wanted to be
able to create things.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.620
And, in fact, we took
this test in third grade

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.400
that was supposed to
tell us what we were

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.280
going to be when we grew up.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.450
And it was one of those tests
that was totally see through,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.400
so you could tell exactly how
the questions and the answers

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.060
were going to correlate
to what occupation you

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.440
were going to end up with.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.230
And so like any seven-year-old,
I decided to game the system.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.380
And so I picked
the exact answers

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.150
that I thought correlated
with building or engineering,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.490
though I might not have
called it that at the time.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.320
And I think my test
results came back,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.800
and it said I should be a
carpenter or a watchmaker.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.560
I might have over-corrected
a little bit.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.910
But I was happy about that,
because the essence was there.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.320
The career that said I should
use my hands to build things.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.100
And I have to
admit this was much

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.650
to my parents', in particular
my father's, dismay.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.916
He was, like most
parents of his generation

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.290
who had immigrated
from elsewhere

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.510
in the world-- India in
his case-- job stability

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.440
was really top of mind.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.685
And I mean, I think
it's understandable

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.560
from their viewpoint.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.851
My dad is actually an engineer.

00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.610
My mom's an accountant.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.600
And the economy hadn't
always been nice to them.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.010
So when they looked at me
and what they wanted for me,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.180
they really wanted me to have
an occupation or a career that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.080
was really recession-proof.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.730
And for them, that was medicine.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.030
So my dad really wanted
me to be a doctor.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.890
And honestly, I can't even
use the past tense there

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.340
because he will still
call me up and ask me

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.080
if I want to take the MCAT
just in case, over the weekend,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.390
because I can just do that.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.540
So if my dad had
had his way, my path

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.570
wouldn't have consisted of MIT.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.115
It wouldn't have consisted
studying computer science

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:14.240
and electrical engineering.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.880
It wouldn't have
consisted of Google.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.960
But to be fair, my
third grade rebellion

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.216
was not the only reason my
path ended up the way it was.

00:03:23.216 --> 00:03:24.840
As I was looking back
and just thinking

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.310
through all of the major
moments and, I guess, decisions

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.500
that led to where I am
today, I realized that there

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.360
was another common thread.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.210
And that was this.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.400
When faced with a decision
where one of the choices

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.605
is really uncomfortable
or scary, do that thing.

00:03:44.605 --> 00:03:46.230
Because those are
the moments and those

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.377
are the times where you actually
learn and grow the most.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.210
And to be fair, I've
done the opposite, too.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.990
So I can compare and contrast.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.550
And, of course, that fear
is not the only reason

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.590
to do something.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.820
But it should go in the pros
column and not the cons column.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.360
And that's what I thought I'd
talk a little bit about today.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.860
So the first really difficult
decision I remember making

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.810
was where to go to college.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.445
I think at the time
my dad was still

00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:14.320
partially convinced I
would come to my senses

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.230
and go to med school, at least
stay home close to Alabama.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.380
But I was fortunate enough
to get into MIT, although I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.070
wasn't sure if I wanted to go.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.300
It was really far away.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.500
It was supposed
to be really hard.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.900
And I didn't know if I
could cut it, to be honest.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.180
I was used to being
the top of my class

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.490
or near the top of
my class in Alabama,

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.200
and I knew that wasn't going to
be the case if I went to MIT.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.580
So I was scared
to make that leap.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.760
And then the more
I thought about it,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.550
the more I realized that I
was going to college to learn.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.790
And if I was going
there to learn,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.540
I might as well surround
myself with people

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.680
that I can learn from.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.380
I might as well be a small
fish in a big pond learning

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.560
from everyone around me.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.140
And so I went to MIT.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.750
And over the four years,
I learned a whole bunch

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.470
of interesting CS-y things.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.320
But I also learned
that I could do it,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.100
that I could cut it there.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.050
And that actually gave
me a lot of confidence

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.300
for the next steps in my life.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.430
And the next step in
my life was deciding

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.260
what to do after college.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.470
So this was back
in 2003, and it was

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.340
after a little
mini economic turn

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.000
down, like a little
mini bubble burst.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.416
I remember a lot
of my friends who

00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:33.120
had graduated the year
before were given job

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.240
offers that were then
rescinded before they even

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.900
started their jobs.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.900
So a lot of people
actually across the country

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.000
were staying in school because
that was advisable, I guess,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.300
at the time.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.110
And MIT in particular
is pretty research

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.900
and academic focused, so
most of the people I knew,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.550
especially CS students, were
staying on to do research,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.100
get their PhDs,
Masters, whatever.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.580
So first of all, the
decision to go into industry

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.710
was leaving everything
I knew behind.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.880
Leaving all my friends, leaving
research, leaving academia,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.234
leaving school for the
first time, behind.

00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:12.150
And then that was
compounded when I was trying

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.100
to decide where to go to work.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.922
So back then, Google was
not the household name

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:18.630
that it is today.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.424
In fact, when I told
my parents about it,

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:21.340
they called it Goofle.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.811
So I was deciding between
that and Microsoft, which

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.060
of course was very well known.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.930
And so for them, thinking
again about job stability,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.020
they were like,
absolutely, hands down you

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.050
should go to Microsoft.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.550
Absolutely.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.570
And many of the people I talked
to gave me that same advice.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.290
And I guess from that
perspective, it makes sense.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.810
Like, how stable could a
company called Goofle be, right?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.630
Doesn't seem wise.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.260
But I wasn't so convinced.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.130
I wasn't so sure, and I debated
back and forth for three weeks.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.490
I lost so much sleep
just trying to think

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.410
about where I should go work.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.930
One day I would be like,
yes, Microsoft, clearly

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.650
the right choice.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.714
And then the next day,
I would be like, no.

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:04.630
Maybe I should try it.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.671
Maybe I should do Google.

00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:08.640
And I was just really torn.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.770
And in the end,
there was one thing

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.320
that I just couldn't let go of.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.320
I remember after my
interviews at Microsoft--

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.460
it was a full day of interviews.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.530
I was exhausted like
you would expect.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.490
Interviews are really draining.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.180
So I got back to
the hotel, and I

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.460
think I just slept for like 12
hours after those interviews.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.860
But after my interviews at
Google, I was energized.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.290
12 years later, I
can still remember

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.630
how I felt after a full day
of interviews at Google.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.220
It was, I don't know.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.320
It was tingly.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.110
I could feel it in my body,
and I couldn't let that go.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.370
I just couldn't let
that feeling go.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.200
And so ultimately, I
decided to come to Google.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.797
And it has been an amazing
11 and 1/2 years since.

00:07:52.797 --> 00:07:54.380
I joined when Google
was pretty young,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.980
so I got to see it grow,
go through immense periods

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.480
of growth.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.480
I think we have 50 times
the number of employees

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.450
now than we did when I joined.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.890
I got to work on a ton
of interesting projects

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:10.220
from Search to Google Toolbar to
Maps to Chrome, where I am now.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.290
I got to work with a
lot of amazing people.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.230
Again, I'm a small
fish in a big pond,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.030
and it's really great
to be able to learn

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.860
from everyone around me.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.340
It's also where I met my
husband, so it all worked out,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.100
I guess, in the end.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.910
As a quick side note, actually,
in making that decision

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.910
I learned this tactic for how
to make hard decisions that I

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.870
thought I would share because
I found it extremely useful.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.159
So what I do is I
try on the decision

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.187
before I actually commit.

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:41.520
Kind of like you would try
on a dress or a pair of pants

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.645
before you buy them, right?

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:46.372
So what I do is I tell myself
I've made the decision,

00:08:46.372 --> 00:08:47.580
but I don't tell anyone else.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.470
I don't actually send any
emails or formally accept,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.080
but I tell myself I've made it.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.955
I sleep as though I made
it, and then I wake up

00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.720
and I see how I feel.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.730
And if I don't regret it, I know
I've made the right decision.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.550
And I have used that for
many of the tough decisions

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.889
I've made since then and
told other people about it,

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.430
and it tends to get
positive reviews.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.971
So I thought I would
pass that along.

00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:14.736
In fact, I used it
to name my first kid.

00:09:14.736 --> 00:09:17.830
I would call my belly
different names every day

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.640
until one just stuck
and felt right.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.160
Having a little
less luck this time.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.250
But I am trying
on multiple names,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.310
so I'm still trying
on to see what works.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.340
The next really
difficult decision

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.690
came about six years later.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.290
So the summer of 2009,
where I had the opportunity

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.500
to go to Zurich, lead a new
project for Google Maps,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.752
and manage a team for
the very first time.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.710
In addition to that, I
had just gotten married,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.520
so I would be
living with somebody

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.050
for the first time in my life
in a new country with no friends

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.530
or family working at
a job that I was 100%

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.930
convinced I was totally
unqualified for.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.470
I was going to be expected to
lead a team I had never met,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.656
work on a product I
had never worked on,

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:10.155
and manage a team of people,
many of whom were older than me

00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:14.070
and considerably more
experienced than me.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.000
And I remember being
on our honeymoon,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.090
the last week of our honeymoon
in Bora Bora, of all places.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.300
Just thinking to myself,
like, I can't do it.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.170
This is crazy.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.710
I'm under-qualified.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.250
I have been somehow fooling
people for six years,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.241
and they're going to
finally find me out.

00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:29.740
It's over.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.730
The gig is up.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.200
I'm done.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.700
And I thought
about it some more.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.075
And I have to
admit with the help

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:40.650
of a very supportive husband,
I came to realize three things.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.800
First, if I had indeed been
fooling people for six years,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.570
I had done a pretty
damn convincing job.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.830
So maybe I could keep it
up for a couple more years.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.660
But more importantly,
that the feeling

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.130
I was having, this
impostor syndrome,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.770
is something that is shared
with people at all levels, men

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.240
and women alike.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.000
So I wasn't alone.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.980
It was completely natural
to have that feeling.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.840
Second, that I had a bunch of
people that believed in me.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.410
My husband believed in me.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.725
My manager at the time
and mentor, Marissa Mayer,

00:11:11.725 --> 00:11:12.350
believed in me.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.410
My new manager believed in me.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.900
And honestly, if they
all believed in me, maybe

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.630
I should believe in
me just a little bit.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.670
And then third, this was
the path I had chosen.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.780
I had chosen product management.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.260
I knew one day I was going
to be in a position where

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.980
I was going to end up
managing people if I did well.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.670
So I might as well
try it, right?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.210
And if I fail, I fail.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.360
At least I will have learned
something in the process.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.970
And so I went.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.510
And it turned out to be one
of the best experiences.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.950
I have learned things I couldn't
have even predicted if I tried

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.130
to write them down on paper.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.370
I learned that I really
like managing people,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.430
and I'm actually OK at it.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.500
I learned how to come on to a
new team and gain credibility.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.000
I learned about myself, that
when I do come on to a new team

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.990
I feel miserable and incompetent
for about six months.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.670
And then magically, it seems
to get better after that point.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.220
I learned about
building products

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.640
for users with completely
different perspectives

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.837
than the one that I was used to.

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:20.670
And I learned about
being a better coworker.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.840
Being nine time zones away from
Mountain View for two years,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.494
I brought back with
me a lot of empathy

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.410
about working with people
in different offices

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.470
that has been really
useful ever since.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.550
On a personal level, my husband
and I traveled the world.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.880
We got introduced to new
countries and cultures

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.079
and cuisines.

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.620
We got to know each
other much better

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.203
during our first two
years of marriage

00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:43.500
because we were isolated
together with each other.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.550
So it was amazing, and
I almost didn't do it.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.130
I almost let fear
and uncertainty

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.040
and insecurity keep me
from what turned out

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.780
to be one of the biggest
learning experiences

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.060
I've had in the last decade.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.570
So I guess I will end
with another confession.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.712
Doing this talk wasn't
an easy decision for me.

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:11.420
I mean, obviously not
as hard as deciding

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.140
to move to another country
for a couple of years.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.500
But it still wasn't easy.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.370
While I've done a decent
amount of public speaking,

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.840
I guess I've never gotten up
in front of a bunch of people

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.660
and talked about myself or
my experiences or things

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.090
like that.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.630
So this was pretty
uncomfortable.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.700
And I remember when
Natalie asked me

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.520
if I would be willing to do it.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.350
I immediately
thought, I don't know.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.690
I don't know what I'm going
to say to hundreds of people.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.710
I don't know if I have
an interesting story

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.690
or something I can talk about.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.670
And to be honest, oh my
god, it was so much easier

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.200
just to say no.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.740
I mean, I have a
good excuse, right?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.280
I'm 6 and 1/2 months pregnant.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.820
I'm tired.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.710
I have migraines.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.210
I have a two-year-old at home.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.910
I have a full-time job.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.980
It was so much easier
to just say no and not

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.380
push myself to go that extra bit
and work on this and do this.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.600
And I realize,
though, that this,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.330
this engaging with other
professional women,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
getting together and
building a community where

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.280
we support and we celebrate each
other, this is important to me.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.180
This is worth--
this is something

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.380
that I want to take part in.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.030
And so before I went
to sleep at night,

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.007
I told myself I
was going to do it.

00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:31.090
I didn't tell Natalie yet.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.810
I told myself I
was going to do it.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.701
I slept on it.

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.200
I woke up.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.340
I felt good about it.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.250
I really did that to
make this decision.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.500
And it felt right.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.940
So I emailed her, and I told her
I would do it, and here I am.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.370
And in the process, at least
I've learned a few things.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.994
I've learned a little
bit about myself.

00:14:47.994 --> 00:14:52.620
I've gotten some time
to reflect on my path.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.170
I've learned a bit
about taking risks

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.300
in the face of fear
and uncertainty.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.120
In fact, especially in the
face of fear and uncertainty

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.870
because from my
experience what I've found

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.240
is it's those times where you
not only have a steep learning

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.780
curve, but you have the step
function learning curve.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.800
It's where you
grow and you thrive

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.660
and you flourish the most.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.010
And it makes it worthwhile.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.850
So I hope the next
time any of you

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.540
are faced with such a
decision, one of which

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.330
feels really
uncomfortable or scary

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.287
or pushes you out of
your comfort zone,

00:15:29.287 --> 00:15:31.120
I hope you take the
time and the opportunity

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.029
to try it on and
ultimately go for it.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:36.570
Thank you again for
being here today.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.120
[APPLAUSE]
