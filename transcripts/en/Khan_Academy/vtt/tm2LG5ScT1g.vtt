00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.936
- [Instructor] Let's
talk a little bit about

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:06.114
the element, phosphorous,
and its importance to life

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:08.707
and how it cycles through living systems.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.952
So we're gonna talk about
the phosphorous cycle.

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:14.800
First, it's important to
appreciate that phosphorous

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.031
is a very reactive element,
so it's seldom found

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.350
by itself.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.183
Normally, we find it in phosphate form.

00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:26.518
So this right over here, the
orange is a phosphorous atom,

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:30.044
and it's bound to four
oxygens right over here,

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:32.377
and at least the way that
it's set up right over here,

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:34.763
it would have a -3 charge.

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:38.372
This would often form ionic
bonds with other things,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:40.585
or one of the oxygens
can have a covalent bond,

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.937
or you can form phosphoric
acid where the oxygen's

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:45.142
bound to hydrogens, but
this is the general form

00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:46.879
that you typically find it.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.628
That's the phosphorous
that I'm pointing to,

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:52.935
but this whole thing, we
would call this a phosphate.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.065
We would call this a phosphate.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.144
You see this showing up in
very important macromolecules

00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:00.377
in biology.

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:04.544
This is DNA, and both DNA and
RNA have phosphate backbones.

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:10.221
You can see the sides of the
ladder, I guess you could

00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:13.556
view it as that word, the
backbone of our DNA molecules.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.108
You can see these phosphates
there and in the center

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:20.773
of the phosphate, you
have the phosphorous atom.

00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:23.065
Also over here, you have ATP.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:24.893
In biology, we study that.

00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:26.056
It's the powerhouse.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:28.783
It's the energy currency
of biological systems,

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:31.761
stands for adenosine triphosphate.

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.313
You have three phosphate
groups right over here,

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:37.100
and when you pluck one of
those phosphate groups off,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.262
it can power reactions.

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:41.107
It can change the confirmation of enzymes.

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:43.429
It can do all sorts of interesting things,

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.747
so hopefully you can
appreciate that phosphate

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:49.136
is essential for life,
'cause life as we know it

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:51.719
involves ATP, and involves DNA,

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:55.036
and many, many other
things that phosphates

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:56.595
are involved with.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.454
Phosphate, or phosphorous
I should say in particular,

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:02.544
is a little bit different
than carbon or nitrogen

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:05.167
in that it's not found in the atmosphere.

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:08.304
It's not typically found as a gas.

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:12.387
Instead, phosphate is
going to be found in rocks,

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:16.698
and it's going to be
phosphate-based rocks.

00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:18.754
There will be other elements in there.

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:20.429
It could be chlorine.

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.347
There's a bunch of different
types of phosphate rocks,

00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:26.140
but when they're in
their sedimentary form,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.557
let me create some soil here.

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:33.702
Let's say this soil has
some phosphates in it.

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:38.683
Then, it allows things like
plants to grow in that soil.

00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:41.037
This is a plant growing in that soil,

00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:44.810
and the plant, we've
talked about it before,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.036
it could be fixing carbon
from the atmosphere

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:53.745
using light energy, but its
phosphate is going to come

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.203
from the soil.

00:02:55.203 --> 00:02:57.640
That phosphate was already
there, and that helps

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.686
that plant grow because that
plant needs that phosphate

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:03.853
for its ATP, its DNA, its
RNA, and for other things.

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:08.927
Phosphate is often considered
a rate limiting factor

00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:11.005
for the growth of things like plants,

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:12.651
and that's why a lot of fertilizers

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:15.994
will have phosphorous
in them, or phosphates,

00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:18.218
or nitrogen's another one.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.507
Next time you think about
fertilizer, you're fertilizing

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:22.218
things in your garden,
look at the ingredients.

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:25.206
You will see phosphate
there because that might be

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:28.083
the scarce resource or
the thing that is limiting

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.103
the actual growth of the plant.

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:30.936
Then you might say,

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:33.280
"I have ATP and DNA in my body.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.895
"How do I get phosphates?"

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:38.346
Well, you get it by eating plants.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:40.596
This is you eating a plant.

00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:44.268
The plant goes back there.

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:46.768
How does this form a cycle?

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.877
When any of this living matter dies,

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:51.014
and I've said it in previous video,

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:52.955
I'll show the dead plant
'cause a dead animal,

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:54.940
it's just a little darker.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.009
So whenever you see the
plant now, it's dead.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.988
Let's say it got buried
somehow, some soil,

00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:02.824
so it's all just a dead
plant right over there.

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:06.991
The phosphates in that plant
can then go back into the soil.

00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:12.010
You could view this as a very tight cycle

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.125
and the same thing would
be once you die or I die,

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.038
the phosphates, if we're
buried, would go into the soil,

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:21.918
but there could be other
ways that the phosphate

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:25.020
and the corresponding
phosphorous gets recycled.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.178
You could think on a bigger
scale where you could have,

00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:31.345
let's say there's a river.

00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:34.176
There's a river right over here.

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:35.579
This is either a very small river

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.236
or a very big plant that I drew.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.260
That river can take
phosphates from that soil,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.153
and it could put it into the ocean,

00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:46.809
and then those phosphates
could be used by sea life.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.399
Then when that sea life
dies, it goes to the base

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:51.953
of the ocean floor, and at
some point in the future,

00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:53.999
that base of the ocean
floor could be pushed up,

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.062
and a plant grows on it.

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:58.732
So you can imagine all
sorts of these cycles.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.729
We're actually seeing
more and more of this

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.304
as human beings have said,

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:05.809
"If phosphate is the rate
limiting factor for the growth

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.718
"of plants, and we need
to grow a lot of plants

00:05:07.718 --> 00:05:11.728
"in order to feed ourselves,
we've started mining it."

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.103
We've started adding a
lot more to the soil,

00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:18.446
but it also allows a lot
of that to be washed away

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:21.329
into our rivers and streams,
and eventually end up

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.275
in the ocean.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:25.667
As we'll see, this can
actually have very negative

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:28.250
consequences for our biosphere.
