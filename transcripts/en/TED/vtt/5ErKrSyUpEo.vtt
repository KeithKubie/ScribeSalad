00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.096
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.920
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
There is a moment on the birthing table

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.000
that feels like dying.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.576
The body in labor stretches
to form an impossible circle.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.880
The contractions
are less than a minute apart.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.560
Wave after wave,
there is barely time to breathe.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.896
The medical term:

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.120
"transition,"

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.856
because "feels like dying"
is not scientific enough.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.896
(Laughter)

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.120
I checked.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.376
During my transition,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.353
my husband was pressing down on my sacrum

00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:53.816
to keep my body from breaking.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.040
My father was waiting
behind the hospital curtain ...

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.280
more like hiding.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.040
But my mother was at my side.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.056
The midwife said
she could see the baby's head,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.456
but all I could feel was a ring of fire.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.536
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't,"

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.536
but she was already pouring
my grandfather's prayer in my ear.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.960
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi,
Par Brahm Sarnai."

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.720
"The hot winds cannot touch you."

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.640
"You are brave," she said.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.880
"You are brave."

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.000
And suddenly I saw my grandmother
standing behind my mother.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.840
And her mother behind her.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480
And her mother behind her.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.536
A long line of women who had
pushed through the fire before me.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.816
I took a breath;

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.056
I pushed;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.320
my son was born.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.856
As I held him in my arms,
shaking and sobbing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.296
from the rush of oxytocin
that flooded my body,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.896
my mother was already
preparing to feed me.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.976
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.096
My mother had never stopped
laboring for me,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.456
from my birth to my son's birth.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480
She already knew
what I was just beginning to name.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.376
That love is more than a rush of feeling

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.320
that happens to us if we're lucky.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.480
Love is sweet labor.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.656
Fierce.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.216
Bloody.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.440
Imperfect.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.360
Life-giving.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.960
A choice we make over and over again.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.936
I am an American civil rights activist

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.856
who has labored with communities
of color since September 11,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.736
fighting unjust policies by the state
and acts of hate in the street.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.016
And in our most painful moments,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.896
in the face of the fires of injustice,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.840
I have seen labors of love deliver us.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.856
My life on the frontlines of fighting
hate in America has been a study

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.520
in what I've come to call
revolutionary love.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.200
Revolutionary love
is the choice to enter into labor

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.056
for others who do not look like us,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.240
for our opponents who hurt us

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.920
and for ourselves.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.776
In this era of enormous rage,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.400
when the fires are burning all around us,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.800
I believe that revolutionary love
is the call of our times.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.960
Now, if you cringe when people say,
"Love is the answer ..."

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.656
I do, too.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.696
(Laughter)

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.976
I am a lawyer.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.296
(Laughter)

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.576
So let me show you how I came to see love
as a force for social justice

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.280
through three lessons.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.696
My first encounter with hate
was in the schoolyard.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.296
I was a little girl
growing up in California,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.216
where my family has lived
and farmed for a century.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.856
When I was told that I would go to hell
because I was not Christian,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.616
called a "black dog"
because I was not white,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.576
I ran to my grandfather's arms.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.616
Papa Ji dried my tears --

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.376
gave me the words of Guru Nanak,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.376
the founder of the Sikh faith.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.696
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.959
"I see no enemy."

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.296
My grandfather taught me

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.040
that I could choose
to see all the faces I meet

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.480
and wonder about them.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.296
And if I wonder about them,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.976
then I will listen to their stories
even when it's hard.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.416
I will refuse to hate them
even when they hate me.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.856
I will even vow to protect them
when they are in harm's way.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.776
That's what it means to be a Sikh:

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.176
S-i-k-h.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.816
To walk the path of a warrior saint.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.936
He told me the story
of the first Sikh woman warrior,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.176
Mai Bhago.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.376
The story goes there were 40 soldiers
who abandoned their post

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.696
during a great battle against an empire.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.016
They returned to a village,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.480
and this village woman
turned to them and said,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.480
"You will not abandon the fight.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160
You will return to the fire,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.560
and I will lead you."

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.656
She mounted a horse.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.336
She donned a turban.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.176
And with sword in her hand
and fire in her eyes,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.016
she led them where no one else would.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.720
She became the one she was waiting for.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.576
"Don't abandon your posts, my dear."

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.656
My grandfather saw me as a warrior.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.920
I was a little girl in two long braids,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.080
but I promised.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.160
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.520
watching the Twin Towers fall,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.176
the horror stuck in my throat,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.056
and then a face flashes on the screen:

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.456
a brown man with a turban and beard,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.200
and I realize that our nation's new enemy
looks like my grandfather.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.216
And these turbans meant to represent
our commitment to serve

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.296
cast us as terrorists.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.256
And Sikhs became targets of hate,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.856
alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.656
The first person killed in a hate crime
after September 11 was a Sikh man,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.120
standing in front
of his gas station in Arizona.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.560
Balbir Singh Sodhi
was a family friend I called "uncle,"

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.040
murdered by a man
who called himself "patriot."

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.600
He is the first of many
to have been killed,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.496
but his story --

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.960
our stories barely made the evening news.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.336
I didn't know what to do,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.216
but I had a camera,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.016
I faced the fire.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.496
I went to his widow,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.760
Joginder Kaur.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.000
I wept with her, and I asked her,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.640
"What would you like to tell
the people of America?"

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.800
I was expecting blame.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.160
But she looked at me and said,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.520
"Tell them, 'Thank you.'

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.536
3,000 Americans came
to my husband's memorial.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.136
They did not know me,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.480
but they wept with me.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.640
Tell them, 'Thank you.'"

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.536
Thousands of people showed up,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.976
because unlike national news,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.080
the local media told Balbir Uncle's story.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.656
Stories can create the wonder

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.520
that turns strangers
into sisters and brothers.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.880
This was my first lesson
in revolutionary love --

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.000
that stories can help us see no stranger.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.320
And so ...

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.000
my camera became my sword.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.120
My law degree became my shield.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.256
My film partner became my husband.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.416
(Laughter)

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.640
I didn't expect that.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.976
And we became part
of a generation of advocates

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.960
working with communities
facing their own fires.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.160
I worked inside of supermax prisons,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.256
on the shores of Guantanamo,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.736
at the sites of mass shootings

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.880
when the blood
was still fresh on the ground.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.976
And every time,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.496
for 15 years,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.535
with every film, with every lawsuit,

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.856
with every campaign,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.216
I thought we were making the nation safer

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.640
for the next generation.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.840
And then my son was born.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.000
In a time ...

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.856
when hate crimes against our communities

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.520
are at the highest
they have been since 9/11.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.936
When right-wing nationalist movements
are on the rise around the globe

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.800
and have captured
the presidency of the United States.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.416
When white supremacists
march in our streets,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.560
torches high, hoods off.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.240
And I have to reckon with the fact

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.936
that my son is growing up
in a country more dangerous for him

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.320
than the one I was given.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.280
And there will be moments

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.160
when I cannot protect him

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.480
when he is seen as a terrorist ...

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.056
just as black people in America

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.200
are still seen as criminal.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.680
Brown people, illegal.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.280
Queer and trans people, immoral.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.296
Indigenous people, savage.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.376
Women and girls as property.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.896
And when they fail to see our bodies
as some mother's child,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.496
it becomes easier to ban us,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.736
detain us,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.976
deport us,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.776
imprison us,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.480
sacrifice us for the illusion of security.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.360
(Applause)

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.440
I wanted to abandon my post.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.160
But I made a promise,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.256
so I returned to the gas station

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.800
where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed
15 years to the day.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.840
I set down a candle
in the spot where he bled to death.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.960
His brother, Rana, turned to me

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.120
and said, "Nothing has changed."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.200
And I asked,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.240
"Who have we not yet tried to love?"

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.880
We decided to call the murderer in prison.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.000
The phone rings.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.680
My heart is beating in my ears.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.056
I hear the voice of Frank Roque,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.800
a man who once said ...

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.960
"I'm going to go out
and shoot some towel heads.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.800
We should kill their children, too."

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.960
And every emotional impulse
in me says, "I can't."

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.200
It becomes an act of will to wonder.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.400
"Why?" I ask.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.680
"Why did you agree to speak with us?"

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.256
Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.456
but I'm also sorry
for all the people killed on 9/11."

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.616
He fails to take responsibility.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.920
I become angry to protect Rana,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.920
but Rana is still wondering about Frank --

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.280
listening --

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.280
responds.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.616
"Frank, this is the first time
I'm hearing you say

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.920
that you feel sorry."

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.560
And Frank --

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.800
Frank says, "Yes.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.880
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.120
One day when I go to heaven
to be judged by God,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.280
I will ask to see your brother.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.240
And I will hug him.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.200
And I will ask him for forgiveness."

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.840
And Rana says ...

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.640
"We already forgave you."

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.960
Forgiveness is not forgetting.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.840
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.176
Because when we are free from hate,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.416
we see the ones who hurt us
not as monsters,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.096
but as people who themselves are wounded,

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.176
who themselves feel threatened,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.656
who don't know what else
to do with their insecurity

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.816
but to hurt us, to pull the trigger,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.096
or cast the vote,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.176
or pass the policy aimed at us.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.920
But if some of us
begin to wonder about them,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.320
listen even to their stories,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.040
we learn that participation
in oppression comes at a cost.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.120
It cuts them off
from their own capacity to love.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.840
This was my second lesson
in revolutionary love.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.480
We love our opponents
when we tend the wound in them.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.616
Tending to the wound
is not healing them --

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.840
only they can do that.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.416
Just tending to it allows us

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.880
to see our opponents:

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.560
the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.760
They've been radicalized by cultures
and policies that we together can change.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.480
I looked back on all of our campaigns,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.736
and I realized that any time
we fought bad actors,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.240
we didn't change very much.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.656
But when we chose
to wield our swords and shields

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.720
to battle bad systems,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.400
that's when we saw change.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.616
I have worked on campaigns

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.176
that released hundreds of people
out of solitary confinement,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.936
reformed a corrupt police department,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.280
changed federal hate crimes policy.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.776
The choice to love our opponents
is moral and pragmatic,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.336
and it opens up the previously
unimaginable possibility

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.760
of reconciliation.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.000
But remember ...

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.160
it took 15 years to make that phone call.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.840
I had to tend to my own rage
and grief first.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.800
Loving our opponents
requires us to love ourselves.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.976
Gandhi, King, Mandela --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.920
they taught a lot about
how to love others and opponents.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.960
They didn't talk a lot
about loving ourselves.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.200
This is a feminist intervention.

00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:35.096
(Applause)

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.016
Yes.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.256
Yes.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.576
(Applause)

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.536
Because for too long have women
and women of color been told

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.056
to suppress their rage,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.656
suppress their grief
in the name of love and forgiveness.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.696
But when we suppress our rage,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.216
that's when it hardens
into hate directed outward,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.680
but usually directed inward.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.320
But mothering has taught me
that all of our emotions are necessary.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.600
Joy is the gift of love.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.680
Grief is the price of love.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.119
Anger is the force that protects it.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.520
This was my third lesson
in revolutionary love.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.776
We love ourselves

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.935
when we breathe through the fire of pain

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.200
and refuse to let it harden into hate.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.920
That's why I believe

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:40.856
that love must be practiced
in all three directions

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.160
to be revolutionary.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.976
Loving just ourselves feels good,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.536
but it's narcissism.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.200
(Laughter)

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.240
Loving only our opponents
is self-loathing.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.520
Loving only others is ineffective.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.400
This is where a lot
of our movements live right now.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.760
We need to practice
all three forms of love.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.200
And so, how do we practice it?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.000
Ready?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.920
Number one ...

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.616
in order to love others,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.656
see no stranger.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.136
We can train our eyes
to look upon strangers on the street,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.896
on the subway, on the screen,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.696
and say in our minds,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.136
"Brother,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.496
sister,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.936
aunt,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.160
uncle."

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.936
And when we say this,
what we are saying is,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.640
"You are a part of me I do not yet know.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.960
I choose to wonder about you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.960
I will listen for your stories

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.480
and pick up a sword
when you are in harm's way."

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.360
And so, number two:

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.696
in order to love our opponents,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.120
tend the wound.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.240
Can you see the wound
in the ones who hurt you?

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.280
Can you wonder even about them?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.616
And if this question
sends panic through your body,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.016
then your most revolutionary act

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.760
is to wonder, listen and respond
to your own needs.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.880
Number three:

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.216
in order to love ourselves,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.920
breathe and push.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.816
When we are pushing
into the fires in our bodies

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.520
or the fires in the world,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.320
we need to be breathing together

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.840
in order to be pushing together.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.120
How are you breathing each day?

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.280
Who are you breathing with?

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.800
Because ...

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.656
when executive orders
and news of violence hits our bodies hard,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.136
sometimes less than a minute apart,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.240
it feels like dying.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.280
In those moments,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.336
my son places his hand
on my cheek and says,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.000
"Dance time, mommy?"

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.440
And we dance.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.496
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.696
Our family becomes
a pocket of revolutionary love.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.576
Our joy is an act of moral resistance.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.696
How are you protecting your joy each day?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.320
Because in joy we see
even darkness with new eyes.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.480
And so the mother in me asks,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.880
what if this darkness
is not the darkness of the tomb,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.200
but the darkness of the womb?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.240
What if our future is not dead,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.320
but still waiting to be born?

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.120
What if this is our great transition?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.960
Remember the wisdom of the midwife.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.096
"Breathe," she says.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.656
And then --

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.016
"push."

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.376
Because if we don't push, we will die.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.456
If we don't breathe, we will die.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.216
Revolutionary love requires us
to breathe and push through the fire

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.616
with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.840
so that one day ...

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.520
one day you will see my son as your own

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.280
and protect him when I am not there.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.360
You will tend to the wound
in the ones who want to hurt him.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.480
You will teach him how to love himself

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.000
because you love yourself.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.280
You will whisper in his ear,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.360
as I whisper in yours,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.880
"You are brave."

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.440
You are brave.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.416
Thank you.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.456
(Applause)

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.376
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.896
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.376
(Applause)

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.016
(Cheering)

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.120
(Applause)
