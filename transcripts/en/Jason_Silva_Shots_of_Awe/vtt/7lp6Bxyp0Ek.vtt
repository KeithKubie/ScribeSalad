00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.020
So there was a very interesting
article in "Fast Company"

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.615
recently that talked
about the fact

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:23.060
that people who were raised
bilingual, multicultural,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.660
tended to have a more fluid
kind of creativity going.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.540
And the reason is
because they were

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.230
familiar with
multiple mindwares,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.540
multiple cultural
reality tunnels.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:48.220
[SPEAKS SPANISH]

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.830
But on the other side, I
learned English very young.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.430
I lived in the United States.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.240
My mother has an
American family.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.260
I grew up a secular Jew.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.330
There is that world view.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.260
There is that mindware.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.820
And having to move
between worlds

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.510
allowed me to see just how
ambiguous everything is,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.420
and just how fluid
everything is.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.467
And so that makes
you, I think, more

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.577
open to connect the
dots in a new way,

00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:14.740
more open to different world
views, more open to the reality

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.000
is tightly coupled
to perception,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.290
and perception is tightly
coupled to our cultural reality

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.030
tunnel.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.765
Perception is
essentially linguistic.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:24.890
The world is made of language.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.170
Reality is kind of
written into being

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.830
inside of these cultural
mindware environments

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.710
in which we live.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.816
And so in order to deal
with violence, in order

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:36.080
to practice tolerance,
in order to fix

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.900
the maladies of
the world, we first

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.040
need to realize just
the fact that all of us

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.180
are living in
different universes,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.540
different cultural world views.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.415
And I think understanding
that and leveraging

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:48.090
that insight might allow
us to find a way to connect

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.490
more deeply with one another.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.990
Yeah.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.140
