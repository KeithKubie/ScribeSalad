00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.208
- Beautiful St. Louis.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.178 align:start size:97% position:3%
The great Mississippi River,
the heartland of America,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.248 align:start size:97% position:3%
the artery that pumps through
our country, who knew?

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.250
It's fuckin' super gross,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.652 align:start size:94% position:6%
like it is overwhelmingly
disgusting.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.122 align:start size:84% position:16%
I thought this was
the artery of America!

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.557
America, what happened to us?

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:30.497
(intense hard rock music)

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.112
We have launched!

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.483
Let's see, for the past two
days, the river has been

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.819
and industrial horror story.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start size:97% position:3%
But, about 80 miles south
of St. Louis the Mississippi

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:04.164 align:start size:97% position:3%
goes from like industrial
cesspool to absolute beauty.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.300
This is the majestic river
you've heard about, you know,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.234
and we're just Huck Finnin'

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.403
the shit out of it, we love it!

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.672 line:0%
- Woah dude, what the fuck!

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.742
- Feels great, you can't
help but have some fun

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.011
on a boat-ercycle.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.313
St. Louis, what a town!

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.314
- Yeah!

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.148
- Yeah!

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.285
- My thighs are chapped.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.555
Do I get a merit badge for this,

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.156 line:0%
or do I get any mon\ey, or?

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.927 line:0%
I think I got a rash, all in
all I'm glad to just pop in

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.662
for a day and just do
my thing and take off,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:40.166
but he's gotta actually pound
these miles out, you know,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.968
it's fun to just
do a little bit ...

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.236
- I love you, John Melley!

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.504
- Kurt's out there,
so we can say it:

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:45.638
He's a piece of shit.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.140
- Roustabout!

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.475 align:start position:0%
- And he shouldn't be doing
this, it's a big waste of time.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.543
I don't envy them,
but I hope those

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.811
African kids get the goats.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.214
They're gonna get their goat.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.383
(mellow guitar music)

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.019
- What a day.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.589
Can you believe that it's
this calm and beautiful?

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.925
I almost feel like,
does everybody know?

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.363
Does everybody know how
amazing this river is,

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.099
and yeah, yeah they totally do.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.769
It is the most amazing
thing I've ever done!

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.241 align:start position:0%
Now I'm having this like,
beautiful moment with the river,

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
like, I'm having moments where
I might cry on a Jet Ski,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:27.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
like the only time I can say
I would cry on a Jet Ski.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.149
Just from pure beauty.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
Then I have to deal
with the fact that like,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.318
am I a Jet Ski guy?

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.255
Am I gonna like buy a house
boat and start listening

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.658
to Air Supply and get
divorced and just,

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.260
start saying weird things like,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I don't wanna sound
racist, but ..."

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.063
Like, is that me now?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.636
(mellow guitar music)

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:04.417
This is an image of
a man completely at
peace with his life.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.654
(mellow guitar music)

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.629
We got some jumpin' fish!

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.309
God, I'm so happy.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.478
(mellow guitar music)

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.225
And then we approach the
place where we were docking

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.094
for that evening, and it's like
this biker bar on the river,

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.597
and it is heaven on the water.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.332
Yeah.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.166
- You got two.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.000
Yep.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.834
- Two for you?

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.668
- Mmm.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.502
- Oh, look at you go!

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.104 line:0%
- Look at me.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.639 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And it's amazing because
as we're pulling in,

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.709 align:start size:97% position:3%
all the waitresses have like
five beers in their hand,

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.677 align:start position:0%
and they give them out and it's
like this beautiful moment.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.646
Toast to myself!

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:07.747
Where are we?

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.785
Evansville, Illinois I love you!

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.255 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it was like all this
shit we went through,

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.056
after 80 miles on
the river, this,

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.293
this moment made
it all worthwhile.

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.695 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is the most magical
place I've ever been.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.498
Apparently it's called
Evanston, Illinois, so,

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.634
mark it on your map
and visit Evanston.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.468
Cheers.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.637
