00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.110
We've got two right
triangles here.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.670
And let's say we also
know that they both have

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.810
an angle whose measure
is equal to theta.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.440
So angle A is congruent
to angle D. What

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.840
do we now know about
these two triangles?

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.080
Well for any triangle, if
you know two of the angles,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.980
you're going to know
the third angle,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.290
because the sum of the
angles of a triangle

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.440
add up to 180 degrees.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.940
So if you have two
angles in common,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.320
that means you're going to
have three angles in common.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.170
And if you have three
angles in common,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.010
you are dealing with
similar triangles.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130
Let me make that a
little bit clearer.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.680
So if this angle is
theta, this is 90.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.570
They all have to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.570
That means that this
angle plus this angle

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.790
up here have to add up to 90.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.930
We've already used up
90 right over here,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.710
so angle A and angle B
need to be complements.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.490
So this angle right over here
needs to be 90 minus theta.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.620
Well we could use the
same logic over here.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.970
We already use of 90
degrees over here.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.120
So we have a
remaining 90 degrees

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.860
between theta and that angle.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.785
So this angle is going to
be 90 degrees minus theta.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.400
You have three corresponding
angles being congruent.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.970
You are dealing with
similar triangles.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090
Now why is that interesting?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.590
Well we know from
geometry that the ratio

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.010
of corresponding sides
of similar triangles

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.870
are always going to be the same.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.660
So let's explore the
corresponding sides here.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.897
Well, the side that
jumps out-- when

00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:32.980
you're dealing with the
right triangles-- the most

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.270
is always the hypotenuse.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.810
So this right over
here is the hypotenuse.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.550
This hypotenuse is
going to correspond

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.210
to this hypotenuse
right over here.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.160
And then we could
write that down.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.410
This is the hypotenuse
of this triangle.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.730
This is the hypotenuse
of that triangle.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.410
Now this side right
over here, side BC,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.504
what side does
that correspond to?

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:55.920
Well if you look
at this triangle,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.430
you can view it as the side that
is opposite this angle theta.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.145
So it's opposite.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.020
If you go across the
triangle, you get there.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.540
So let's go opposite angle D.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.610
If you go opposite
angle A, you get to BC.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.110
Opposite angle D, you get to EF.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.150
So it corresponds to this
side right over here.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.510
And then finally, side AC
is the one remaining one.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.340
We could view it
as, well, there's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.280
two sides that make up
this angle A. One of them

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.210
is the hypotenuse.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900
We could call this, maybe,
the adjacent side to it.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.990
And so D corresponds
to A, and so this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.500
would be the side
that corresponds.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650
Now the whole reason I
did that is to leverage

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.500
that, corresponding
sides, the ratio

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.550
between corresponding
sides of similar triangles,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.140
is always going to be the same.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.820
So for example, the ratio
between BC and the hypotenuse,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.830
BA-- so let me write
that down-- BC/BA

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:04.660
is going to be equal to EF/ED,
the length of segment EF

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.020
over the length of segment ED.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.890
Or we could also
write that the length

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.940
of segment AC over
the hypotenuse,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.760
over this triangle's
hypotenuse, over AB,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.010
is equal to DF/DE-- once
again, this green side

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.885
over the orange side.

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:33.051
These are similar triangles.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.790
They're corresponding
to each other.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.317
So this is equal to DF/DE.

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.950
And we could keep going, but
I'll just do another one.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.440
Or we could say that the
ratio of this side right

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.180
over here-- this blue
side to the green side

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.240
of this triangle--
the length of BC/CA

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.000
is going to be the same as
the ratio between these two

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.297
corresponding sides, the
blue over the green, EF/DF.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.630
And we got all of
this from the fact

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.640
that these are
similar triangles.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.091
So this is true for
any right triangle

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:26.090
that has an angle theta.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.220
Then those two triangles
are going to be similar,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.720
and all of these ratios
are going to be the same.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.390
Well, maybe we can give
names to these ratios

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.750
relative to the angle theta.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.150
So from angle theta's
point of view--

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.840
I'll write theta
right over here,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.700
or we can just
remember that-- what

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.220
is the ratio of these two sides?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.720
Well from theta's point
of view, that blue side

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.310
is the opposite side.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.790
It's opposite-- so the opposite
side of the right triangle.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.940
And then the orange side we've
already labeled the hypotenuse.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.140
So from theta's
point of view, this

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.380
is the opposite side
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.340
And I keep stating from
theta's point of view

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.430
because that wouldn't be the
case for this other angle,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.990
for angle B. From angle
B's point of view,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.220
this is the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.500
And we'll think about that
relationship later on.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.541
But let's just all think
of it from theta's point

00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:23.720
of view right over here.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.170
So from theta's point
of view, what is this?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.060
Well theta's right over here.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.260
Clearly AB and DE are still
the hypotenuses-- hypoteni.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.370
I don't know how to say
that in plural again.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.570
And what is AC, and what are DF?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.170
Well, these are adjacent to it.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.990
They're one of
the two sides that

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.210
make up this angle that
is not the hypotenuse.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.230
So this we can view as
the ratio, in either

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.110
of these triangles,
between the adjacent side--

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.060
so this is relative.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.792
Once again, this is
opposite angle B,

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.250
but we're only
thinking about angle

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.770
A right here, or the
angle that measures theta,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.520
or angle D right over
here-- relative to angle A,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.750
AC is adjacent.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.060
Relative to angle
D, DF is adjacent.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.490
So this ratio right over
here is the adjacent

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.350
over the hypotenuse.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.470
And it's going to be the same
for any right triangle that

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.040
has an angle theta in it.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.260
And then finally,
this over here, this

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.850
is going to be
the opposite side.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.060
Once again, this was the
opposite side over here.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.970
This ratio for
either right triangle

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.410
is going to be the opposite
side over the adjacent side.

00:06:35.157 --> 00:06:36.990
And I really want to
stress the importance--

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.240
and we're going to do many,
many more examples of this

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.040
to make this very concrete--
but for any right triangle

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.620
that has an angle theta, the
ratio between its opposite side

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.130
and its hypotenuse is
going to be the same.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.790
That comes out of
similar triangles.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.960
We've just explored that.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.000
The ratio between
the adjacent side

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.280
to that angle that is
theta and the hypotenuse

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.630
is going to be the same,
for any of these triangles,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.640
as long as it has that
angle theta in it.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.940
And the ratio,
relative to the angle

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.560
theta, between the opposite
side and the adjacent side,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.390
between the blue side
and the green side,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.340
is always going to be the same.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.370
These are similar triangles.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.980
So given that,
mathematicians decided

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.990
to give these things names.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.060
Relative to the angle
theta, this ratio

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.330
is always going to be
the same, so the opposite

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.755
over hypotenuse, they call this
the sine of the angle theta.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.065
Let me do this in a new
color-- by definition--

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.440
and we're going to extend this
definition in the future--

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.160
this is sine of theta.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.840
This right over
here, by definition,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.720
is the cosine of theta.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.060
And this right over
here, by definition,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.720
is the tangent of theta.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.260
And a mnemonic that will help
you remember this-- and these

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.810
really are just definitions.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.810
People realized, wow, by similar
triangles, for any angle theta,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.637
this ratio is always
going to be the same.

00:08:03.637 --> 00:08:05.720
Because of similar triangles,
for any angle theta,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.470
this ratio is always
going to be the same.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.170
This ratio is always
going to the same.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.670
So let's make these definitions.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.480
And to help us
remember it, there's

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.760
the mnemonic soh-cah-toa.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.060
So I'll write it like this.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.340
soh is sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.845
cah-- cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.710
And then finally,
tangent is opposite

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:47.520
over adjacent-- soh-cah-toa.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.020
And in future videos,
we'll actually

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.276
apply these definitions for
these trigonometric functions.
