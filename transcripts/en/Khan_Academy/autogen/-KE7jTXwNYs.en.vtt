00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.150
 We have said many times that the ATF 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.120
 is the exchange coin for energy in cells, 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.450
 but in this video we talk about this topic in more detail. 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.450
 As we will see when we move from ATF to ADP, 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 or ADP + phosphate group, we have free energy release. 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.220
 If we look at the system, 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.450
 the ATF's free energy is here, but once it's gone 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.650
 hydrolysis and obtain ADP + phosphate group, 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.650
 the free energy dropped by nearly 30.5 kJ / mol, 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.450
 delta G is -30.5 kJ / mol. 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.550
 If you look at Gibbs's free energy videos, 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.310
 you will know that this value tells us that this is a spontaneous reaction. 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.020
 Delta G is less than zero, 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750
 which means that this reaction will be spontaneous. 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.120
 When I realized this was the first time I said to myself, 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.700
 "Once the reaction is spontaneous, why 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.540
 then all the ATP and all the water 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.800
 do not turn spontaneously into ADP and do not release energy 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920
 in the form of heat or something else? " 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.560
 The key is that the reaction must climb that hill. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.790
 We have this activating energy, 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.650
 the reaction has to go up, 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 if there is no enzyme to catalyze it. 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.320
 Now we will explain why we have this uprising in the path of reaction. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 When ATP breaks down, we have 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520
 a molecule of water that carries out the hydrolysis. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 This is the way people usually imagine hydrolysis. 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.240
 Although sometimes another molecule may be involved. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.590
 But if we take a molecule of water, 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.990
 we have to have 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.420
 this free electron pair at oxygen, 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.690
 to cause a so-called nucleophilic reaction 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.550
 with this phosphorus from the phosphate group. 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 If this happens, this link is created. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 Then these electrons can go to that oxygen, 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.750
 which gives him a negative charge. 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 Now you can say, "Okay, that seems logical." 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.450
 But do not forget that the electrons are negative 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.120
 and are surrounded by these negative charges. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.920
 They have to overcome their approach. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550
 Attacking these negative charges 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.910
 want to repel, they must overcome this repulsion. 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.590
 This is overcome by 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 a class of enzymes called ATPase. 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.850
 Remember these enzymes 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.820
 are large protein complexes and the ATP molecule can be 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.820
 connect to the exact place in the enzyme. 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.690
 They try to surround the ATP molecule 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.550
 with positive ions. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.750
 Let's say there is a positive ion here, 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.550
 he can "distract" these electrons as long as the water 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.620
 performs the nucleophilic response. 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.920
 Water will not have to worry about these electrons here. 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.850
 There may be a positive ion here as well. 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.020
 And remember, if we imagine the situation in three dimensions, 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.190
 this thing has embraced the ATP molecule 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.190
 from different countries, this is the ATFase. 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.920
 So if we have an enzyme here, 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.650
 we will lower the activating energy 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.399
 and it will look like this. 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.790
 Consequently, the reaction will be possible. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.290
 The reaction does not take place, 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.820
 when we do not have an enzyme, 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.050
 because we have this hill. 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.590
 But if we have enzymes, they will 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.890
 allow the reaction to take place. 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.720
 Then this attacks this, this relationship is formed and you are saying, 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.450
 "We have another hydrogen here." 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.850
 "We have another hydrogen." 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.720
 But it can be picked up by another water molecule 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.450
 and to become a hydroxone ion. Exactly 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.350
 is actually happening. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.420
 Then this oxygen takes this electron pair 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 and gets a negative charge. Finally, we have, 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.780
 a truncated phosphate group, 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.950
 ADP and energy release. 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150
 Generally, we would not want this reaction to release energy 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.419
 no reason. 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.050
 Most ATFas will use 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.950
 the energy released in this reaction to phosphorylate the molecule. 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.720
 In this case we can assume that this one 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.390
 hydroxide is phosphorylated, 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.620
 but many different molecules can be phosphorylated. 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.910
 Or the conformation of this ATPase may change, 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.590
 to start doing another kind of job. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 For example, to carry molecules against their concentration 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.160
 or electrochemical gradient. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.820
 We do not just want to release energy. 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.250
 Sometimes it can happen if we want to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920
 to generate heat but in most cases 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.820
 we want to do some work useful for cells. 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.050
 I hope this video helped you 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.190
 to better understand the ATP and the reaction 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.640
 of hydrolysis. 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.650
 It is called hydrolysis because, as in this example, 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.820
 water is used to decompose ATP 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.300
 or for the cleavage of one of its phosphate groups.
