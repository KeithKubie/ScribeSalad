00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.710
In addition to what
we have seen already,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.600
Moneyball also discusses
several other things,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.140
for example, how it
is easier to predict

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.680
professional success
of college players

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.800
than high school players,
that stealing bases,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.920
sacrifice bunting, and
sacrifice flyers are overrated,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.060
and pitching statistics
do not accurately

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.840
measure pitcher ability.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.090
Pitchers only
control strikeouts,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.430
home runs, and walks.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190
Where was baseball in 2002?

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.660
The graph on the
left is what we have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750
seen in the beginning
of this lecture.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.030
So before Moneyball techniques,
analytic techniques,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.270
became more well-known, the
A's were clearly an outlier.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.160
Recall that the A's
are here, compared

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.970
to the Red Sox and the Yankees.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:16.030
Just observe that the A's
had 20 more wins than teams

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.440
with equivalent payrolls.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.690
And they had as many wins
as teams like the Red Sox

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.320
that have more than
double the payroll.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.370
Where is baseball now?

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.780
The A's, in the green dot
here-- and for reference, this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.960
is the Red Sox and the Yankees--
are still an efficient team.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:52.170
But they only have
about 10 more wins

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.900
than teams with
equivalent payrolls.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.060
So specifically, there
are fewer inefficiencies,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.010
because many of
them were discovered

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.720
after the book
Moneyball was published.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.050
In fact, the use of analytics
in general in baseball

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.780
has now a name
called sabermetrics.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.370
Of course, there has been a
lot of work done in the field.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.280
Baseball Prospectus
is a website devoted

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520
to the analytics of baseball.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.570
New concepts were introduced--
value of a replacement

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.550
player, VORP, and defense
independent between statistics,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.140
DIPS.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.940
There's another book
that has been written.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.220
The title of the
book is The Extra 2%:

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.110
How Wall Street Strategies
Took a Major League Baseball

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.990
Team from Worst to
First, dictating

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.300
the story of the Tampa Bay Rays.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.590
And finally, analytics
have been used

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.740
in many game-time
decisions in baseball,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.120
for example, the batting order,
changing pitchers, et cetera.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.640
So what is happening
with other baseball

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.430
teams and other sports?

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.080
So nowadays, every major
league baseball team

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.080
has a statistics/analytics
group.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.440
In fact, the Red Sox
implemented quantitative ideas

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.940
and won the World Series
for the first time

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.570
in 2004, after 86 years.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.260
They in fact tried to
hire Billy Bean in 2003,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.840
who accepted for one day,
but then he changed his mind

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.390
and went back to
the Oakland A's.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.610
Analytics are also
used in other sports,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.530
although it is believed
that more teams use

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.180
statistical analysis
than is publicly known.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.520
And finally, what is the
edge of using analytics?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.740
Models allow managers
to more accurately value

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.579
players and minimize risk.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.390
This is a direct
quote from Moneyball.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.329
"In human behavior, there was
always uncertainty and risk.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.200
The goal of the
Oakland front office

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.250
was simply to minimize the risk.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.770
Their solution wasn't perfect.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.760
It was just better than
rendering decisions

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120
by gut feeling."

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.540
And a final remark that,
as you have observed

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.390
throughout the lecture,
that the model we introduced

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.050
are reasonably simple.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.950
They involved regression
ideas, and they did not

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.350
involve many variables that
are not that sophisticated.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.070
Yet they led to significant
success of the Oakland A's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.650
and more generally,
for teams that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.870
use the power of
sports analytics.
