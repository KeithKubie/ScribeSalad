00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.930
Bigger populations and more genetic diversity,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.480
indicates populations with more alleles for

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.550
a given gene. This results in

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.080
more heterozygosity, and populations being better suited

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.880
to survive a selective pressure, like a disease or climate change. The

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
net effect is genetic diversity. Which is an awesome thing for species survival.
