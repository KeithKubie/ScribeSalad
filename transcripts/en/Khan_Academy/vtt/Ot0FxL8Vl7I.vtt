00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.213
- We have an interesting
problem or exercise here.

00:00:03.213 --> 00:00:07.235
Find a such that the
limit as x approaches zero

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:09.639
of the square route of four plus x

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.093
minus the square route of four

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.792
minus a times x,

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.605
all of that over x, is equal to 3/4.

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:19.731
And like always, I encourage you

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.610
to pause the video and give a go at it.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.470
So assuming you have had your go,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.358
now let's do this together.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.272
So when you just try to superficially

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:31.192
evaluate this limit here,
if x approaches zero,

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:33.102
so if you're just trying to evaluate

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:35.535
this one x equals zero,
you're going to get...

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.484
let me just try to evaluate the limit.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.848
As x approaches zero

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:42.817
of the square route of four plus x

00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:46.667
minus the square route of four minus ax,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.114
all of that over x.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:50.723
Well, this right over here is going to be

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.180
just the principal root of four,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.602
because four plus zero is four.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:54.707
This right over here is just going to be

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:56.213
the principal root of four,

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:57.784
because no matter what a is,

00:00:57.784 --> 00:00:59.292
a times zero is going to be zero,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.280
so you're going to be
left with four minus zero,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.048
so it's just the principal route of four.

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:04.313
So you're going to have two.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:05.698
This whole thing is going to be two.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.699
If you just were to substitute x there,

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:09.714
so this whole thing is two.

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:12.245
This whole thing right over here

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:13.574
is going to be two as well.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.025
You're going to have two minus two,

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:16.125
and then as x approaches zero,

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.563
this is going to be zero.

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.857
So this looks like we are going...

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.867
we are getting an indeterminate form.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.973
And when you get to something like this,

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:28.886
you start to say, "Well,
L'Hopital's rule might apply."

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:31.074
If I get zero over zero,
or infinity over infinity,

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:33.118
well, this limit is going
to be the same thing

00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:35.854
as the limit as x approaches zero.

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:38.234
This is going to be the same thing

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:41.283
as the limit as x approaches zero

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.126
of the derivative of the numerator

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:46.157
over the derivative of the denominator.

00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:49.160
So what is the derivative
of the numerator?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.907
Actually, let me just do the derivative

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:51.854
of the denominator first,

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:55.001
because the derivative
of x, with respect...

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:55.886
Oh, I may have to do that
in a different color.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.262
The derivative of x with respect to x

00:01:58.262 --> 00:01:59.903
is just going to be one.

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:00.982
But now let me take the derivative

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:03.712
of this business up here.

00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:05.692
The derivative...

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.456
The derivative of this with respect to x.

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:12.759
So this is four plus x to the 1/2 power.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.550
So this is, the derivative of this part

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.545
is going to be 1/2 times four

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:21.078
plus x to the negative 1/2 power.

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:24.202
And so the derivative of
this part right over here...

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.632
Let's see, here the...

00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:26.871
The chain rule applied
here with a derivative

00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:28.923
of four plus x is just one, so we just

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:30.843
multiply this thing by one.

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:32.453
But here the chain rule, the derivative of

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:36.087
four minus ax, with respect
to x, is negative a.

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:38.089
Now we multiply that,
and we're going to have

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.816
this negative out front,
so this is going to be

00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:41.639
plus a.

00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:44.893
Plus a times...

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.749
times 1/2

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:52.094
times four minus ax

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:54.371
to the negative 1/2 power.

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.143
I just used the power
rule and the chain rule

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.938
to take the derivative here.

00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:01.176
And so what is is this going to be?

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:04.026
Well, this is going to be equal to...

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:06.886
This is going to be equal
to something over one.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.242
So we have up here, as x approaches zero,

00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:11.959
this is going to be,
this part, four plus zero

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.660
is just four to the negative 1/2 power.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.308
Well, that's just going to be 1/2.

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:18.792
Four to the 1/2 is two,

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:20.808
four to the negative 1/2 is 1/2.

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:23.800
And then as x approaches zero here,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.713
this is going to be four
to the negative 1/2,

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:28.649
which is once again 1/2.

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.194
So what does this simplify to?

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:33.621
We have 1/2 times 1/2, which is 1/4.

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:35.127
That's that there.

00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:38.599
And then over here I have
a times 1/2 times 1/2,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.720
so that's going to be plus a over four,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.123
and so this is the same thing as just

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:47.579
a plus one over four.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.633
And we say that this
needs to be equal to 3/4.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.801
This needs to be equal to 3/4.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.800
That was our original problem.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.001
So that needs to be equal to 3/4,

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:58.253
and now it's pretty straightforward

00:03:58.253 --> 00:03:59.619
to figure out what a needs to be.

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.542
A plus one needs to be equal to three,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.492
or a is equal to 2.

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:07.666
And we are done.
