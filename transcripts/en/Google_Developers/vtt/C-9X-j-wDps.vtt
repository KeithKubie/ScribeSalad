00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:07.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to Coffee with a Googler.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.240
Today I'm going to be chatting
with Peter Lewis, who's

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.860
a product manager
here at Google,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.905
and he's working with
beacons and showing us

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:14.280
all the wonderful
things that can

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.890
be done with beacons and
the types of applications

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.710
that you can build.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.059
And if you've ever built any
applications with beacons,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.600
the one thing that I would love
to share with you and the one

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.350
thing that we're going
to be talking about

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.910
is just how much innovation
is going on in that space

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.730
and how much there
still is to learn.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.762
For me, I had been
building some applications

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.220
and I didn't realize
the power that

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.470
was available from
the Google SDKs

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.030
and the various APIs and
platforms that are out there.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.180
So we're going to
learn all about that,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.263
and hopefully there'll be
something useful for you

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:42.510
with some instructions on
how you can get started.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.350
So we're taking a little
break from Firebase

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.100
and shooting Firecasts and Ask
Firebase and all these shows

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.997
to have one of my
favorite people

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:51.330
at Google, who works on one
of my favorite technologies,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.272
beacons.

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:54.480
And Peter, welcome, and
thanks for coming all the way

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000
from the UK to chat with us.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.910
PETER LEWIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.903
You're one of my favorite
people at Google as well.

00:00:58.903 --> 00:00:59.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Aw.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.291
PETER LEWIS: So it's
great to be here

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.560
and talking about the
technology that I work on.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.220
I'm a product manager in
Google's location group.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.970
And one of the things
that we work on

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.640
is the Google Beacon Platform.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.514
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.180
PETER LEWIS: Which
includes Eddystone,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.840
which is a beacon format, and a
bunch of cloud and mobile APIs

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.332
for interacting with beacons.

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:19.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
just as a little bit

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.800
of a reset for people who
aren't familiar with them

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.466
or have used them or played with
them, what exactly are beacons?

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.830
PETER LEWIS: These things
are really simple devices.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.130
All that they do is repeatedly
broadcast an identifier.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.040
And that identifier
marks an important place

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.490
or an important object in a way
that users' devices understand.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.570
So they give phones a
good idea about what

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.096
matters in their environment.

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:42.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.020
Here in Google, we've got these
beacons all over the place

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.190
so we can have apps that say
we're in a particular place.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.240
We're in a conference
room or we're

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.650
in a microkitchen or
something along those lines.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.407
So what kind of
ways would beacons--

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.490
are they used outside of
Google in the real world?

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.823
PETER LEWIS: They're a location
technology, and location

00:01:56.823 --> 00:01:58.260
matters in many apps.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.330
Almost every app
that you download

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.850
cares about where the user is so
they can deliver a contextually

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.770
relevant experience.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.210
And the Beacon Platform is about
taking that to the next level,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.790
about providing more reliable
place detection and also

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.390
more precise place detection.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.970
So what that means
is that if you're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.710
building a feature in your app
that takes account of the fact

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.950
that a user is in
a particular place,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.540
that can become more precise,
and it can trigger more

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.860
reliably as well.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.370
So beacons are a great way
of providing the signal

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.330
that a user's device
needs in order

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.620
to be able to deliver
that kind of experience.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I've
done a little bit of beacon

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.641
development myself,
and in my case

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:39.390
it was kind of primitive,
where I was just

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.723
turning on the Bluetooth stack
and sniffing for beacons.

00:02:41.723 --> 00:02:43.850
And if I detected
a particular one,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.030
then I could respond to it.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.880
But I know you've got
a platform that makes

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.070
all of that so much easier.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.111
PETER LEWIS: We wanted to
take beacon development

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:53.100
from something that only experts
could do and then make it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.490
into a platform that's
really easy for developers

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.395
to get started with, and really
to see something happening

00:02:58.395 --> 00:02:59.770
pretty much
immediately when they

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.200
start developing with beacons.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.800
So the way that
we've done that is

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.660
to make it so that
you no longer have

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.860
to care about the
individual bytes

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.430
that the radio in this
thing is broadcasting,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.380
and VLE frequencies or
whatever, and really

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.560
to focus on what the
functionality that you

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.780
as an app developer
want to enable is.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.060
So the way that we've
done that is we've

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780
made it so that the
identifier in the beacon

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.870
just points to a cloud
resource that you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.200
can update via an API,
the Proximity Beacon API,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.520
or directly through
our web dashboard

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.590
that we have on our dev site.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.680
Always good to have a dashboard.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.138
PETER LEWIS: Yeah,
absolutely that.

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:40.106
And the idea is that once you've
deployed the infrastructure,

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:42.480
once you've marked all of the
places that you care about,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.520
you can associate lots
of different information

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.099
with those places.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.640
And then you can
get that information

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.070
back to your app using
the nearby API in Android

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.180
or the CocoaPods that
we have for iOS as well.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.850
And the experience
for a developer

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.324
shifts away from, I'm looking
for these particular bytes

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.740
that I have to keep track, or
with this particular beacon,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.180
all that kind of thing,
and more towards, in my app

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.400
I just create a
subscription that says,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.285
tell me when I'm on platform
9 at King's Cross Station.

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:12.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.800
And does it work when
you're on platform 9 and 3/4

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.749
as well, just--

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.749
PETER LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.400
But we don't talk about
that with muggles.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.649
LAURENCE MORONEY: Fair enough.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.560
So one of the
things that I found

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.420
when I was building
apps for beacons

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.640
was that it was very much like
a single beacon, single use.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.439
And I just didn't have the
imagination to go beyond that.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.230
So I was writing a game
that said, OK, when

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.120
you're in this location
and when it detects

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.345
that you're in this
location, then it

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:36.727
will unlock a part of the game.

00:04:36.727 --> 00:04:38.310
And then you do that
part of the game,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.970
and then it tells you to
go to another location.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.780
And then when you
run over there and it

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.431
sniffs the beacon
at that location,

00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:45.180
then it unlocks the
next part of the game.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.792
And it was really fun and
it was kind of interesting,

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.750
but it was like a single
beacon for single use.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.280
And I know you're really looking
into more interesting scenarios

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.780
than that.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.490
PETER LEWIS: In the
olden days, the way

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.420
you developed with
beacons was to decide

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.380
there was a particular
feature of your app

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.500
that you were going to point
at with a particular beacon.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.360
And that approach
really wasn't something

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.380
that scaled nicely, either for
developers or for the platform.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.790
And I think developers
found very quickly

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.990
that they had to start
building and managing

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.180
large databases of
their beacons that

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.240
were very difficult to share
with other developers or reuse

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.200
or all of these things.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.540
So it was a bit of a pain.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.155
We, with the Google
beacon platform,

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:27.040
have shifted away
from that model

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.890
of one beacon for one
feature in one app

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.210
and towards a model where you
deploy the infrastructure.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.290
You mark all of the
places that matter,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.449
and then you decide what you
want to do with them per app

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.740
that you're developing, really.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.720
So you can get lots of
different functionality

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.920
from the same set of beacons.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.190
And that's a power that
really comes from the fact

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.230
that we treat beacons as cloud
objects within Google's Beacon

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.310
Registry.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.630
So this is part of
Google Cloud Platform.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.270
You register beacons
with the Cloud Platform,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.140
and once you've done that,
you can associate blobs

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.710
of information with
beacons that are meaningful

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.360
not only to your app but
to other developers' apps,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.330
to different bits of
apps, and there are

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.090
many different permutations.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.640
So we were one of the APIs is
to use Cloud Platform's identity

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.260
and access management console.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.740
This is a tool that allows you
to share resources in Cloud

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.670
Platform with other developers.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.080
I have a platform
project and I might say,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.840
I want you to be able to
fire up App Engine instances.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.620
I can also say, I want you to
be able to use beacons that

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.810
are in my beacon
network, for example,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.389
and build experiences in your
app based on my infrastructure.

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.179
PETER LEWIS: And all
of these permutations

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:46.211
are possible with
the Beacon Platform.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:48.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: Is there a
concrete scenario or an example

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.562
scenario that we
can think of where

00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:52.520
if I've got an area with
lots of beacons in it,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.560
how I can use those
beacons in multiple ways?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560
PETER LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.240
So one of the things we're
most excited about recently

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.310
is that the city of Amsterdam
has been deploying beacons

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.350
throughout the city
and then making

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.330
them available to developers
throughout the world.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.560
So the way they do
that is they go and do

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.640
the hard work of
sticking these things up

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.180
to bus stops and buses and
trams and things like that.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.310
And they associate some
information with those beacons.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.040
So they might be this bus stop
ID or the routes of buses that

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.100
stop there, that kind of thing.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.240
And they use a new feature
in Proximity Beacon API that

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.780
allows them to make those blobs
of data publicly accessible

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.106
to any developer.

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:33.480
So what this means
is if you want

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.920
to build an app that uses
Amsterdam's beacon network,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.220
you just have to write
code in Android Studio

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.070
or for iOS using the CocoaPod.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.600
And this means that
you can take advantage

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.640
of their hard work
deploying beacons

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.020
and actually enable new
contextual functionality

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.640
in your app.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.294
Where would I get started?

00:07:55.294 --> 00:07:57.210
PETER LEWIS: So the
easiest way to get started

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.090
is with just a few
beacons on your desk,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.710
exactly like these beacons here.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.970
We've worked with many beacon
manufacturers to make sure that

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.080
beacons are correctly
broadcasting Eddystone and have

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.400
full support for the Eddystone
specification that you can

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.494
order from our developer
site, g.co/beacons.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.785
LAURENCE MORONEY: g.co.beacons.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.220
PETER LEWIS: We
have on GitHub, we

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.470
have a set of beacon
platform samples,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.770
so GitHub Google
beacon platform,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.020
and that has some
sample apps in it.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.850
In terms of SDKs, really
the most important thing

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.940
is to make sure you're using
the nearby API, which is

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.030
part of Google Play Services.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.970
So this is an API that lets
you as a developer focus

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.980
on, tell me about this
kind of information,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.580
and it takes care of the
beacon scanning for you,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.280
works out whether it has that
kind of information associated

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.310
with the beacon, and
then just returns it

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.950
to your app as a message.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.334
As a difference that--
just how valuable

00:08:58.334 --> 00:08:59.750
that is when I was
writing my app.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.870
It was like there were
hundreds of beacons around me,

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.786
and for a particular
one, I was getting the ID

00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:06.616
and I had to maintain a
database to query, oh,

00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:08.490
if you got this beacon,
then here's the data,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.990
or here's the things that you
want to do associated with it.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.490
So all that's taken
out of my hands.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.031
PETER LEWIS: That's
all taken away so

00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:16.480
that you can focus on the
feature that you want to build.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Super cool.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.685
PETER LEWIS: Making
your app contextual

00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:20.180
is difficult enough as it is.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes it is.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.860
PETER LEWIS: Making it so
you can focus on the feature

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.980
is really important to us.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.201
PETER LEWIS: We also
have a code lab.

00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:27.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ah, OK.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.100
PETER LEWIS: Yeah.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.510
So there's a Hello Beacons
code lab that you can do,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.890
codelabs developers google.com.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:39.260
And that will walk you through
creating a nearby subscription.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.470
So what this means is
that you can essentially

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.240
write a piece of functionality
in your app that says,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.230
tell me about
beacon messages that

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.980
have this namespace and type.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: And then
it will just go and find them

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.540
for you.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.220
PETER LEWIS: Exactly.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.178
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:52.856
Well, thank you so much, Peter.

00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:54.230
So if you've been
juggling in how

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.896
to get started with
beacons, well, we've

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.075
got a great website for you.

00:09:57.075 --> 00:09:58.500
Just go to g.co/beacons.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.240
You can download everything.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.990
There's samples.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.570
There's documentation--
everything

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.080
you need to get started
with building applications

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.580
in this wonderful technology.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.064
Thank you so much.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:07.980
PETER LEWIS: I did it.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.730
