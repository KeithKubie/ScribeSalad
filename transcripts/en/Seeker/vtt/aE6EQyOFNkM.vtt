00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.850
If you look at a map of the US power grid,
it looks like a spider web blanketing the

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.850
entire country.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.559
It’s a patchwork that formed after communities
that got their power locally were slowly stitched

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.160
together to create a massive network.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.110
So could we scale that up even bigger?

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.800
Could we connect the entire world with power
lines?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.550
What would that do for us, and what would
it look like?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.940
The most obvious technological hurdle is transmitting
power over extremely long distances, which

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.180
is something of a recurring theme.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.251
Back in the 1880s, when the first power plants
were coming online, Nikola Tesla’s alternating

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.550
current duked it out with Thomas Edison’s
direct current in the war of the currents,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.970
the original AC/DC.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.510
Alternating current means the electrons in
the wire reverse direction rapidly, while

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.550
direct current provides a steady stream of
elections.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.280
AC eventually won out because at the time
it was easier to convert AC power to higher

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.130
or lower voltages, and higher voltages are
needed to travel longer distances with less

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.150
energy loss due to resistance.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.240
Direct Current has another disadvantage.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.490
At higher voltages, DC could only be used
to send electricity from Point A to Point

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.600
B. It couldn’t form the sprawling integrated
grid networks we need for a stable electricity

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
system.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.709
So in this match, it’s Tesla - 1, Edison
- 0.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.590
But fast forward to the present day, and DC
is making a comeback.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.960
Not just because it’s everywhere, since
our phones, laptops, and anything with a battery

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.960
runs on it.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.590
It’s also because it’s become a more viable
method for long distance power transmission,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.229
thanks in large part to China’s geography.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.320
Most of China’s population is concentrated
in the eastern part of the country, more than

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.849
2,000 kilometers away from most of the country’s
sources of coal in the northwest and hydroelectric

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:44.549
power in the southwest.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.849
Typical AC power lines with a voltage as high
as 765,000 volts have a max transmission distance

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.549
under 500 kilometers.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.829
To generate power in one place and send it
across the country, the voltage would have

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:57.959
to go up.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.889
So the government-owned utility State Grid
of China collaborated with experts in high

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:08.009
voltage power transmission, like German company
Siemens and the Swedish power group ABB, not

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.890
to be confused with the other Swedish power
group, ABBA.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.930
Soon State Group surpassed the other companies
and started developing their own high voltage

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.570
transformers and power lines.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.300
In 2009, they built a million volt AC line,
and in 2010 they built the world’s first

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.959
800,000 volt DC power line.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.379
By the end of 2017 they had 21 ultra high
voltage lines crisscrossing the country, and

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.909
they’re thinking even bigger.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.379
Right now they’re constructing a 1.1 million
volt transmission line that can carry the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.260
output of 12 power plants 3,200 kilometers.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.459
Couple that with ABB’s development of high
voltage DC circuit breakers that can allow

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.370
for a grid structure and Siemens’ claim
that DC lines cost less than AC lines over

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.540
a certain distance, and you’ve got the foundations
for a global grid and a Thomas Edison comeback

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.780
for the ages.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.909
That would allow for some pretty nifty tricks,
like taking energy from solar panels that

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.870
are in a part of the world that’s sunny,
and zipping it to other parts of the world

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.870
where it’s dark.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.910
It could actually make renewable energy that’s
generated in remote areas more viable.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.159
It’s not that outlandish, in 2016 the US
actually had plans to send wind energy to

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.640
Tennessee that was generated in Oklahoma.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.209
Why Oklahoma?

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.709
Because that’s where the wind comes sweeping
down the plain.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.780
Showtunes aside, State Grid even claims a
global grid could harness wind power generated

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.329
at the north pole and solar energy generated
at the equator.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.680
And if it’s DC, we could ditch those AC/DC
converters your electronics need that get

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.409
all hot and waste about 1/5th of your household’s
energy.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.469
A global DC grid is a green dream!

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.049
Will it ever happen?

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.010
Almost definitely not.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.840
The cost would be astronomical, over 50 trillion
dollars, and the politics are way too messy.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.459
Control of a country’s power grid is a major
national security issue, and any entity that

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.359
built, owned, or operated another country’s
power supply would be extremely… um… powerful.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.470
So a global grid is a really cool idea…
that’ll probably never happen.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.540
Resistance is a big problem in energy grids,
but superconductors could solve that, Maren’ll

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.400
tell you all about them here.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.990
Though a global grid is unlikely, State Grid
has signed a deal with companies in Japan,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.180
Korea, and Russia with the goal of creating
an Northeast Asian “super grid.”

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.470
Think it’ll happen?
