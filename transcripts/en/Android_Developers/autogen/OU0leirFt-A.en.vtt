Technologies as an X R evangelist so I
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.720
Technologies as an X R evangelist so I
mostly focus on AR and VR but I've done

mostly focus on AR and VR but I've done
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.520
mostly focus on AR and VR but I've done
a lot of mobile game development in the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
a lot of mobile game development in the
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.860
a lot of mobile game development in the
past and built a lot of Android

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
past and built a lot of Android
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.440
past and built a lot of Android
applications and what I want to do today

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
applications and what I want to do today
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.050
applications and what I want to do today
is talk a little bit about some best

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
is talk a little bit about some best
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.230
is talk a little bit about some best
practices for unity development inside

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
practices for unity development inside
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.050
practices for unity development inside
the Android ecosystem so there's gonna

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
the Android ecosystem so there's gonna
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029
the Android ecosystem so there's gonna
be some fairly kind of basic or easy

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
be some fairly kind of basic or easy
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.790
be some fairly kind of basic or easy
wins as well as talking about things you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
wins as well as talking about things you
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679
wins as well as talking about things you
can do and how to kind of understand and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
can do and how to kind of understand and
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690
can do and how to kind of understand and
start some of the debugging process as

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
start some of the debugging process as
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.479
start some of the debugging process as
well as some newer features and things

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
well as some newer features and things
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490
well as some newer features and things
that are maybe still a little bit in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
that are maybe still a little bit in
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590
that are maybe still a little bit in
early access and if you are kind of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
early access and if you are kind of
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900
early access and if you are kind of
publishing your game in the near coming

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
publishing your game in the near coming
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.069
publishing your game in the near coming
months you'll see some of these things

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
months you'll see some of these things
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779
months you'll see some of these things
starting to come out and just some

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
starting to come out and just some
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190
starting to come out and just some
strategies that you can take advantage

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
strategies that you can take advantage
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100
strategies that you can take advantage
of as a developer so before I get

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
of as a developer so before I get
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779
of as a developer so before I get
started I want to ask how many people

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
started I want to ask how many people
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060
started I want to ask how many people
have heard of unity or are aware of the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
have heard of unity or are aware of the
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000
have heard of unity or are aware of the
unity editor or engine all right lots of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
unity editor or engine all right lots of
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490
unity editor or engine all right lots of
hands there so if you're not aware unity

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
hands there so if you're not aware unity
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040
hands there so if you're not aware unity
is a piece of software or a tool for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
is a piece of software or a tool for
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.880
is a piece of software or a tool for
writing interactive applications and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890
writing interactive applications and
 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.440
writing interactive applications and
we've done a lot of work to make it very

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
we've done a lot of work to make it very
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710
we've done a lot of work to make it very
easy to develop and create your games

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
easy to develop and create your games
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260
easy to develop and create your games
and publish them to stores like the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
and publish them to stores like the
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.060
and publish them to stores like the
Google Play Store there's actually

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
Google Play Store there's actually
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.770
Google Play Store there's actually
integrated settings in the publish

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
integrated settings in the publish
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.270
integrated settings in the publish
settings so you can set up a lot of your

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
settings so you can set up a lot of your
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940
settings so you can set up a lot of your
things build out your apk and push it up

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
things build out your apk and push it up
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520
things build out your apk and push it up
right away all right

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
right away all right
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350
right away all right
and so what I want to do first is just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
and so what I want to do first is just
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030
and so what I want to do first is just
go through what I call some easy wins

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
go through what I call some easy wins
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859
go through what I call some easy wins
some basic kind of techniques to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
some basic kind of techniques to
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350
some basic kind of techniques to
consider when publishing and developing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
consider when publishing and developing
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.560
consider when publishing and developing
your application within the unity editor

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570
your application within the unity editor
 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.149
your application within the unity editor
next I'm going to talk about ADB the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
next I'm going to talk about ADB the
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950
next I'm going to talk about ADB the
Android debug bridge how you can set

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
Android debug bridge how you can set
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200
Android debug bridge how you can set
that up and how you can utilize that to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
that up and how you can utilize that to
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880
that up and how you can utilize that to
get some information about what's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
get some information about what's
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069
get some information about what's
actually happening with your application

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
actually happening with your application
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.580
actually happening with your application
running on Android back to your PC and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
running on Android back to your PC and
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.230
running on Android back to your PC and
after that I'm just going to talk a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
after that I'm just going to talk a
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330
after that I'm just going to talk a
little bit about kind of reducing the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
little bit about kind of reducing the
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.300
little bit about kind of reducing the
apk size on your application so that you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
apk size on your application so that you
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850
apk size on your application so that you
can make it easier for users to get a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
can make it easier for users to get a
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709
can make it easier for users to get a
hold of your app try it right away and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
hold of your app try it right away and
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539
hold of your app try it right away and
not have to wait for a long download

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
not have to wait for a long download
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.370
not have to wait for a long download
time or downloading it over something

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
time or downloading it over something
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.910
time or downloading it over something
like Wi-Fi all right so let's start with

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
like Wi-Fi all right so let's start with
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.190
like Wi-Fi all right so let's start with
some easy wins the first thing I want to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
some easy wins the first thing I want to
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710
some easy wins the first thing I want to
talk about is just texture Atlas II and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
talk about is just texture Atlas II and
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050
talk about is just texture Atlas II and
what this is is it's really common in 2d

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
what this is is it's really common in 2d
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790
what this is is it's really common in 2d
development where you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
development where you
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
development where you
all of your sprites together in a single

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
all of your sprites together in a single
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.710
all of your sprites together in a single
texture what this allows you to do is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
texture what this allows you to do is
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.960
texture what this allows you to do is
reduce draw calls and you can then kind

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
reduce draw calls and you can then kind
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.270
reduce draw calls and you can then kind
of split it up to use different little

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
of split it up to use different little
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.760
of split it up to use different little
sprite sheets for each individual sprite

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
sprite sheets for each individual sprite
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.830
sprite sheets for each individual sprite
but have them all kind of packed here on

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
but have them all kind of packed here on
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.370
but have them all kind of packed here on
a certain texture and while this works

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
a certain texture and while this works
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.260
a certain texture and while this works
really well for 2d it's also pretty

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
really well for 2d it's also pretty
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.380
really well for 2d it's also pretty
common to do it for 3d as well you can

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
common to do it for 3d as well you can
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.760
common to do it for 3d as well you can
see there's two little bug creatures

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
see there's two little bug creatures
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.070
see there's two little bug creatures
here one's more of a dragonfly and one's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
here one's more of a dragonfly and one's
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.200
here one's more of a dragonfly and one's
a ladybug but they're actually using the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210
a ladybug but they're actually using the
 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.390
a ladybug but they're actually using the
same texture here and just referencing

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
same texture here and just referencing
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.100
same texture here and just referencing
different parts of it so when you're

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
different parts of it so when you're
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.930
different parts of it so when you're
creating things like 3d assets you can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
creating things like 3d assets you can
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.930
creating things like 3d assets you can
consider laying out the UVs on a shared

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
consider laying out the UVs on a shared
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420
consider laying out the UVs on a shared
UV sheet here and then reference the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
UV sheet here and then reference the
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610
UV sheet here and then reference the
same texture to again just reduce draw

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
same texture to again just reduce draw
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.200
same texture to again just reduce draw
calls and kind of optimize your

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210
calls and kind of optimize your
 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.460
calls and kind of optimize your
application now the other thing to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
application now the other thing to
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.540
application now the other thing to
consider is kind of how you're

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550
consider is kind of how you're
 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.950
consider is kind of how you're
compressing your textures and what sort

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960
compressing your textures and what sort
 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.350
compressing your textures and what sort
of shaders you're using to render your

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
of shaders you're using to render your
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.690
of shaders you're using to render your
3d models and again this is more on the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
3d models and again this is more on the
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.760
3d models and again this is more on the
3d side but does apply a little bit to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
3d side but does apply a little bit to
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.630
3d side but does apply a little bit to
2d so one thing to keep in mind is right

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
2d so one thing to keep in mind is right
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180
2d so one thing to keep in mind is right
now inside the unity editor the standard

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
now inside the unity editor the standard
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.880
now inside the unity editor the standard
shader is PBR or physically based

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890
shader is PBR or physically based
 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.270
shader is PBR or physically based
rendering and this is meant to kind of

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280
rendering and this is meant to kind of
 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.300
rendering and this is meant to kind of
reflect the lighting conditions and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310
reflect the lighting conditions and
 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.190
reflect the lighting conditions and
features in the real world we have

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
features in the real world we have
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.710
features in the real world we have
reflective surfaces that are able to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720
reflective surfaces that are able to
 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240
reflective surfaces that are able to

them similar to what we have that exists
 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.830
them similar to what we have that exists
in the real world things like different

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
in the real world things like different
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.270
in the real world things like different
lighting settings and stuff like that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
lighting settings and stuff like that
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640
lighting settings and stuff like that
now depending on what sort of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
now depending on what sort of
 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.410
now depending on what sort of
application you're making or what sort

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420
application you're making or what sort
 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.240
application you're making or what sort
of stylistic choice you're making with

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
of stylistic choice you're making with
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310
of stylistic choice you're making with
your models it's not always really

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320
your models it's not always really
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.000
your models it's not always really
appropriate to have these PBR materials

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
appropriate to have these PBR materials
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.010
appropriate to have these PBR materials
and have all these different options for

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020
and have all these different options for
 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.199
and have all these different options for
what you need you can see here that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209
what you need you can see here that
 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.699
what you need you can see here that
these two bugs are a little bit more

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709
these two bugs are a little bit more
 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.610
these two bugs are a little bit more
stylized or cartoon-like so it doesn't

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
stylized or cartoon-like so it doesn't
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.710
stylized or cartoon-like so it doesn't
necessarily make sense to have them

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
necessarily make sense to have them
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.810
necessarily make sense to have them
fully kind of going through the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820
fully kind of going through the
 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.880
fully kind of going through the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890
processes that's required to render them
 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.790
processes that's required to render them
based on physically-based properties so

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800
based on physically-based properties so
 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.229
based on physically-based properties so
what I've done here is I'm actually have

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
what I've done here is I'm actually have
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.170
what I've done here is I'm actually have
two different materials that are backed

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
two different materials that are backed
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.990
two different materials that are backed
one by the standard shader and one by a

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
one by the standard shader and one by a
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.150
one by the standard shader and one by a
much lighter shader here and you can see

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160
much lighter shader here and you can see
 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.090
much lighter shader here and you can see
the kind of settings here and even

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
the kind of settings here and even
 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.860
the kind of settings here and even
without fully understanding what's

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
without fully understanding what's
 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.050
without fully understanding what's
happening at the shader level you can

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060
happening at the shader level you can
 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.720
happening at the shader level you can
easily

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730
easily
 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.750
easily
the contrast between the differences of

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760
the contrast between the differences of
 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.390
the contrast between the differences of
the kind of instructions or the maps

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400
the kind of instructions or the maps
 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.580
the kind of instructions or the maps
that are associated with this and you'll

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590
that are associated with this and you'll
 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.320
that are associated with this and you'll
see here on one side we have just a

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330
see here on one side we have just a
 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.090
see here on one side we have just a
simple texture assignment and on the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100
simple texture assignment and on the
 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.620
simple texture assignment and on the
other while we have that texture

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630
other while we have that texture
 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.030
other while we have that texture
assignment we also have all these

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040
assignment we also have all these
 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.500
assignment we also have all these
different settings what I haven't

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510
different settings what I haven't
 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.230
different settings what I haven't
actually adjusted them all at all and if

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240
actually adjusted them all at all and if
 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.330
actually adjusted them all at all and if
I go back there you can kind of almost

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340
I go back there you can kind of almost
 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.250
I go back there you can kind of almost
barely see a difference between how the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260
barely see a difference between how the
 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.470
barely see a difference between how the
lighting and the rendering is set up

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480
lighting and the rendering is set up
 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.690
lighting and the rendering is set up
here so something to really keep in mind

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700
here so something to really keep in mind
 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.000
here so something to really keep in mind
depending if you're using 3d models and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010
depending if you're using 3d models and
 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.280
depending if you're using 3d models and
the actual stylistic approach that you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290
the actual stylistic approach that you
 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.400
the actual stylistic approach that you
want to your assets is just considering

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410
want to your assets is just considering
 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.610
want to your assets is just considering
using a more light lightweight shader or

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
using a more light lightweight shader or
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.280
using a more light lightweight shader or
a mobile-optimized shader so within

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290
a mobile-optimized shader so within
 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.410
a mobile-optimized shader so within
unity and the material settings you can

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420
unity and the material settings you can
 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.090
unity and the material settings you can
actually drop-down choose the shader

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100
actually drop-down choose the shader
 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.400
actually drop-down choose the shader
that's backed for that material and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410
that's backed for that material and
 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.800
that's backed for that material and
there is a specific mobile one as well

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810
there is a specific mobile one as well
 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.570
there is a specific mobile one as well
so really kind of consider this when

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580
so really kind of consider this when
 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.190
so really kind of consider this when
setting up your 3d models and the last

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200
setting up your 3d models and the last
 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.810
setting up your 3d models and the last
thing and this is something that's kind

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820
thing and this is something that's kind
 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.820
thing and this is something that's kind
of unique to the Android platform is

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
of unique to the Android platform is
 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.980
of unique to the Android platform is
within the unity editor in the

within the unity editor in the
 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.470
within the unity editor in the
application namespace and API we

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480
application namespace and API we
 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.960

actually have an is genuine check and

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
actually have an is genuine check and
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.150
actually have an is genuine check and
what you can do here is in your code you

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160
what you can do here is in your code you
 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.390
what you can do here is in your code you
can go and check if the apk is genuine

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400
can go and check if the apk is genuine
 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.540
can go and check if the apk is genuine
and what it means to be genuine is if it

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550
and what it means to be genuine is if it
 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.880
and what it means to be genuine is if it
is directly downloaded from the Google

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890

we all know that apks can be fairly

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
we all know that apks can be fairly
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.320
we all know that apks can be fairly
easily distributed and this is really

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
easily distributed and this is really
 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.420
easily distributed and this is really
helpful for testing or you know letting

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430
helpful for testing or you know letting
 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.490
helpful for testing or you know letting
your buddy try out your game before it's

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500
your buddy try out your game before it's
 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.070
your buddy try out your game before it's
released and what you can do in your app

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080
released and what you can do in your app
 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.070
released and what you can do in your app
is that you can use this is genuine

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080
is that you can use this is genuine
 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.350
is that you can use this is genuine
check to potentially restrict some

check to potentially restrict some
 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.540
check to potentially restrict some
features or things like that so you

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550
features or things like that so you
 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.910
features or things like that so you
could restrict access to the in-app

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920
could restrict access to the in-app
 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.040
could restrict access to the in-app

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050
store that's in your thing you could
 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260
store that's in your thing you could
also restrict access to maybe certain

something to keep in mind is that this

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470
something to keep in mind is that this
 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.700
something to keep in mind is that this
is a fairly expensive call so if you are

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710
is a fairly expensive call so if you are
 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.920
is a fairly expensive call so if you are
using it consider using it at a single

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930
using it consider using it at a single
 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.250
using it consider using it at a single
point before you kind of show different

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260
point before you kind of show different
 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.830
point before you kind of show different
features or applications and don't try

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
features or applications and don't try
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.510
features or applications and don't try
to call this every frame as that will

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520
to call this every frame as that will
 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.240
to call this every frame as that will
get pretty expensive

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250
 
 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.440
 
all right and now I just want to dive a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450
all right and now I just want to dive a
 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.960
all right and now I just want to dive a
little bit into debugging and this is

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970
little bit into debugging and this is
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.910
little bit into debugging and this is
kind of a process that I go through when

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920
kind of a process that I go through when
 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.220
kind of a process that I go through when
developing any apps on Android it is a

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230
developing any apps on Android it is a
 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.770
developing any apps on Android it is a
little bit more rudimentary

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780
little bit more rudimentary
 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.570
little bit more rudimentary
but kind of helps you get a base start

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580
but kind of helps you get a base start
 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.280
but kind of helps you get a base start
to start to understand what's going on

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290
to start to understand what's going on
 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.630
to start to understand what's going on
and how to integrate this and so for

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640
and how to integrate this and so for
 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.660
and how to integrate this and so for
this I use ADB so ADB is the Android

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670
this I use ADB so ADB is the Android
 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.820
this I use ADB so ADB is the Android
debug bridge and what it is is it's

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830
debug bridge and what it is is it's
 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.100
debug bridge and what it is is it's
basically a robust command-line tool

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110
basically a robust command-line tool
 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.250
basically a robust command-line tool
that allows you to link in directly to

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260
that allows you to link in directly to
 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.770
that allows you to link in directly to
your Android device you can do this

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780
your Android device you can do this
 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.930
your Android device you can do this
through USB by just plugging into your

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940
through USB by just plugging into your
 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.480
through USB by just plugging into your
device opening up the adb console and

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490
device opening up the adb console and
 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.220
device opening up the adb console and
then there's a lot of associated

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230
then there's a lot of associated
 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.380
then there's a lot of associated
commands as well as flags that you can

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.390
commands as well as flags that you can
 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.910
commands as well as flags that you can
use to get information back now one

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920
use to get information back now one
 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.370
use to get information back now one
thing to keep in mind is that ADB gives

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380
thing to keep in mind is that ADB gives
 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.130
thing to keep in mind is that ADB gives
you a lot of information back and if

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140
you a lot of information back and if
 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.140
you a lot of information back and if
you're not using any filtering it'll be

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150
you're not using any filtering it'll be
 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.330
you're not using any filtering it'll be
hard to even really read or understand

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340
hard to even really read or understand
 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.100
hard to even really read or understand
what's happening as information just

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110
what's happening as information just
 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.530
what's happening as information just
continually flies through in the console

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540
continually flies through in the console
 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.310
continually flies through in the console
itself so what can you do for this well

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320
itself so what can you do for this well
 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.250
itself so what can you do for this well
you can actually set a specific unity

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.260
you can actually set a specific unity
 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.320
you can actually set a specific unity
flag but again I just wanted to kind of

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.330
flag but again I just wanted to kind of
 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.930
flag but again I just wanted to kind of
highlight here that as a developer when

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.940
highlight here that as a developer when
 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.450
highlight here that as a developer when
you're connecting your device via ADB or

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460
you're connecting your device via ADB or
 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.330
you're connecting your device via ADB or
REO via your computer you can do it via

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.340
REO via your computer you can do it via
 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.000
REO via your computer you can do it via
USB and if you're using a more modern

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.010
USB and if you're using a more modern
 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.800
USB and if you're using a more modern
phone one thing to keep in mind is that

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.810
phone one thing to keep in mind is that
 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.750
phone one thing to keep in mind is that
you will need to unlock and look at your

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:58.760
you will need to unlock and look at your
 

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.850
you will need to unlock and look at your
phone and actually allow those USB

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:00.860
phone and actually allow those USB
 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.610
phone and actually allow those USB
debugging and that's an option in the

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:03.620
debugging and that's an option in the
 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.010
debugging and that's an option in the
developer settings so if you guys are

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.020
developer settings so if you guys are
 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.510
developer settings so if you guys are
developing for Android hopefully your

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520
developing for Android hopefully your
 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.060
developing for Android hopefully your
Android device is already in developer

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.070
Android device is already in developer
 

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.710
Android device is already in developer
mode and there's a little checkbox there

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720
mode and there's a little checkbox there
 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.890
mode and there's a little checkbox there
for allowing USB debugging and then from

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:14.900
for allowing USB debugging and then from
 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.840
for allowing USB debugging and then from
here you can connect it to your computer

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:16.850
here you can connect it to your computer
 

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.020
here you can connect it to your computer
and then start hooking up ADB and

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.030
and then start hooking up ADB and
 

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.110
and then start hooking up ADB and
getting some information back it is also

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120
getting some information back it is also
 

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.090
getting some information back it is also
available via Wi-Fi and you can do this

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.100
available via Wi-Fi and you can do this
 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.730
available via Wi-Fi and you can do this
via the connected editor within in the

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:27.740
via the connected editor within in the
 

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.520
via the connected editor within in the
console window within unity so as I

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:30.530
console window within unity so as I
 

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.080
console window within unity so as I
mentioned there's actually a flag or a

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.090
mentioned there's actually a flag or a
 

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.890
mentioned there's actually a flag or a
callback here

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:32.900
callback here
 

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.200
callback here
and you can do a dash S unity and

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.210
and you can do a dash S unity and
 

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.810
and you can do a dash S unity and
that'll give you specific callbacks from

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:37.820
that'll give you specific callbacks from
 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.480
that'll give you specific callbacks from
your app running in unity so here I just

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490
your app running in unity so here I just
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.719
your app running in unity so here I just
have a small little debug log then every

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:43.729
have a small little debug log then every
 

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:46.210
have a small little debug log then every
time I change the orientation from

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.220
time I change the orientation from
 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.760
time I change the orientation from
portrait to landscape landscape it just

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:48.770
portrait to landscape landscape it just
 

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.940
portrait to landscape landscape it just
outputs ad

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:49.950
outputs ad
 

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.670
outputs ad
message within my console in the app and

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680
message within my console in the app and
 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.000
message within my console in the app and
as I'm running this on my phone and as

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.010
as I'm running this on my phone and as
 

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.250
as I'm running this on my phone and as
it's connected you can actually see

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260
it's connected you can actually see
 

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.070
it's connected you can actually see
these callbacks through ADB now it'll

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080
these callbacks through ADB now it'll
 

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.200
these callbacks through ADB now it'll
also output things like air Zorn all

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.210
also output things like air Zorn all
 

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.020
also output things like air Zorn all
reference exceptions which if you

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.030
reference exceptions which if you
 

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.760
reference exceptions which if you
developed a lot of applications in unity

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:07.770
developed a lot of applications in unity
 

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.500
developed a lot of applications in unity
you know you always get those a lot

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:09.510
you know you always get those a lot
 

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.540
you know you always get those a lot
where certain things aren't hooked up or

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:11.550
where certain things aren't hooked up or
 

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.920
where certain things aren't hooked up or
certain things aren't initialized before

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:12.930
certain things aren't initialized before
 

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.750
certain things aren't initialized before
your trying to call them and you can get

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760
your trying to call them and you can get
 

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.720
your trying to call them and you can get
that information back via ADB so you can

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:17.730
that information back via ADB so you can
 

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.490
that information back via ADB so you can
start kind of tracing and understanding

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500
start kind of tracing and understanding
 

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.120
start kind of tracing and understanding
where those issues are coming from

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.130
where those issues are coming from
 

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.530
where those issues are coming from
alright and now what I want to do is

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540
alright and now what I want to do is
 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.930
alright and now what I want to do is
talk a little bit about reducing the

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940
talk a little bit about reducing the
 

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.590
talk a little bit about reducing the
size of your apk so within unity and

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600
size of your apk so within unity and
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.560
size of your apk so within unity and
just really when building any sort of

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:33.570
just really when building any sort of
 

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.660
just really when building any sort of
application especially in the mobile

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:35.670
application especially in the mobile
 

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.590
application especially in the mobile
ecosystem you know that how fast your

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600
ecosystem you know that how fast your
 

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.900
ecosystem you know that how fast your
user can actually play and experience

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:41.910
user can actually play and experience
 

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.610
user can actually play and experience
your game is crucial in getting them to

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:45.620
your game is crucial in getting them to
 

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.470
your game is crucial in getting them to
be retained and continue to play it and

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480
be retained and continue to play it and
 

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.260
be retained and continue to play it and
so part of this is kind of a strategy

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.270
so part of this is kind of a strategy
 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.680
so part of this is kind of a strategy
for delivering a small apk or a small

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:54.690
for delivering a small apk or a small
 

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.900
for delivering a small apk or a small
application that they can get started

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:56.910
application that they can get started
 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.090
application that they can get started
with right away they can download not

00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100
with right away they can download not
 

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100
with right away they can download not
over Wi-Fi and they can really just

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.110
over Wi-Fi and they can really just
 

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.250
over Wi-Fi and they can really just
start experiencing so for this there's a

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260
start experiencing so for this there's a
 

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.560
start experiencing so for this there's a
couple different strategies both built

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:06.570
couple different strategies both built
 

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.900
couple different strategies both built
into unity and the Google Play Store and

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:08.910
into unity and the Google Play Store and
 

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.880
into unity and the Google Play Store and
I want to talk about how you as a

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:10.890
I want to talk about how you as a
 

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.710
I want to talk about how you as a
developer can start taking advantage of

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720
developer can start taking advantage of
 

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.800
developer can start taking advantage of
those alright so the first one is

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:15.810
those alright so the first one is
 

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.010
those alright so the first one is
splitting the apk by target architecture

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:18.020
splitting the apk by target architecture
 

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.450
splitting the apk by target architecture
now this is a little bit of a newer

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:20.460
now this is a little bit of a newer
 

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.940
now this is a little bit of a newer
function so it's available in the latest

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:22.950
function so it's available in the latest
 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.820
function so it's available in the latest
version of unity in 2018 point two so

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:25.830
version of unity in 2018 point two so
 

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.720
version of unity in 2018 point two so
that's the latest stable release

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:26.730
that's the latest stable release
 

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.870
that's the latest stable release
available now and what it allows you to

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880
available now and what it allows you to
 

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.020
available now and what it allows you to
do is it allows you to check which apk

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.030
do is it allows you to check which apk
 

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.240
do is it allows you to check which apk
target architectures you specifically

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.250
target architectures you specifically
 

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.060
target architectures you specifically
want when you build out your app now the

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.070
want when you build out your app now the
 

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.030
want when you build out your app now the
Play Store actually allows you to upload

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040
Play Store actually allows you to upload
 

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.090
Play Store actually allows you to upload
different versions of the apk for all

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100
different versions of the apk for all
 

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.190
different versions of the apk for all
these target architectures and then

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200
these target architectures and then
 

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.370
these target architectures and then
depending on what device you're on in

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380
depending on what device you're on in
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.530
depending on what device you're on in
what target architecture it has it'll

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540
what target architecture it has it'll
 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.950
what target architecture it has it'll
actually download these separate apks

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:53.960
actually download these separate apks
 

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.480
actually download these separate apks
previously inside unity when you had

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.490
previously inside unity when you had
 

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.430
previously inside unity when you had

part of the store right now where you

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680
part of the store right now where you
 

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.250
part of the store right now where you
can give your users access to it now to

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260
can give your users access to it now to
 

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.319
can give your users access to it now to
integrate this and use this within unity

00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:27.329
integrate this and use this within unity
 

00:15:27.329 --> 00:15:30.019
integrate this and use this within unity
there's a lot of additional kind of

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:30.029
there's a lot of additional kind of

good job of providing a menu here and it

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240
good job of providing a menu here and it
 

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.910

actually walks you through the required

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920
actually walks you through the required
 

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.950
actually walks you through the required
steps you drop down the Google Play

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:41.960
steps you drop down the Google Play
 

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.350
steps you drop down the Google Play
instant you can actually build to the

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360
instant you can actually build to the
 

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.970
instant you can actually build to the
instant architecture and then run that

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:45.980
instant architecture and then run that
 

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.130
instant architecture and then run that
on your device and it gives you this

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.140
on your device and it gives you this
 

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.200
on your device and it gives you this
small little sample of your app and

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.210
small little sample of your app and
 

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.050
small little sample of your app and
packages it all up for you so this is

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.060
packages it all up for you so this is
 

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.300
packages it all up for you so this is
directly integrated into unity so you

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:55.310
directly integrated into unity so you
 

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.160
directly integrated into unity so you
can start taking advantage of it now and

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.170
can start taking advantage of it now and
 

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.460
can start taking advantage of it now and
build these instant Play apps and that's

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:00.470
build these instant Play apps and that's
