a day in the life of the bacteria in

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
a day in the life of the bacteria in
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.860
a day in the life of the bacteria in
your gut they are on a different

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870
your gut they are on a different
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.720
your gut they are on a different
schedule from you because you're eating

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
schedule from you because you're eating
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.460
schedule from you because you're eating
and it's taking a certain amount of time

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
and it's taking a certain amount of time
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320
and it's taking a certain amount of time
for you the bacteria to make their way

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
for you the bacteria to make their way
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.879
for you the bacteria to make their way
this is the bacteria are all in the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
this is the bacteria are all in the
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.730
this is the bacteria are all in the
large intestine which is the end of the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
large intestine which is the end of the
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.299
large intestine which is the end of the
line

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
line
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.680
line
well the rectum is the end of the line

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
well the rectum is the end of the line
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.400
well the rectum is the end of the line
but but this is this is a place where

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
but but this is this is a place where
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170
but but this is this is a place where
your your body's kind of done with

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
your your body's kind of done with
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790
your your body's kind of done with
everything you absorbed in the small

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
everything you absorbed in the small
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.490
everything you absorbed in the small
intestine even sorbed all the nutrients

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
intestine even sorbed all the nutrients
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.410
intestine even sorbed all the nutrients
that you can that that your body's going

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
that you can that that your body's going
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269
that you can that that your body's going
to use and the stuff that they don't

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
to use and the stuff that they don't
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710
to use and the stuff that they don't
want it's kind of stuff that you throw

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
want it's kind of stuff that you throw
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630
want it's kind of stuff that you throw
into the composter the large intestine

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
into the composter the large intestine
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639
into the composter the large intestine
that's the composter that's where the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
that's the composter that's where the
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.290
that's the composter that's where the
bacteria live and they can use them

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
bacteria live and they can use them
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090
bacteria live and they can use them
they're like oh I'll take that so the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
they're like oh I'll take that so the
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950
they're like oh I'll take that so the
back they call your bacteria down there

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
back they call your bacteria down there
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.330
back they call your bacteria down there
and in your colon and they're waiting

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
and in your colon and they're waiting
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.330
and in your colon and they're waiting
for you to be done done with what you're

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
for you to be done done with what you're
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830
for you to be done done with what you're
gonna do with it and then it's passed

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
gonna do with it and then it's passed
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.299
gonna do with it and then it's passed
along so it's a certain amount of you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
along so it's a certain amount of you
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190
along so it's a certain amount of you
know it's like five hours before you're

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
know it's like five hours before you're
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779
know it's like five hours before you're
sort of you know me it's making its way

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
sort of you know me it's making its way
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520
sort of you know me it's making its way
and coincidentally that's the peak in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
and coincidentally that's the peak in
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220
and coincidentally that's the peak in
flatulence is about five hours after a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
flatulence is about five hours after a
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650
flatulence is about five hours after a
meal and the other bacteria are kind of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
meal and the other bacteria are kind of
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.549
meal and the other bacteria are kind of
doing their thing because flatulence is

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559
doing their thing because flatulence is
 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.729
doing their thing because flatulence is
gas produced by bacteria breaking down

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739
gas produced by bacteria breaking down
 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.130
gas produced by bacteria breaking down
whether it's usually sugars of some kind

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
whether it's usually sugars of some kind
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.609
whether it's usually sugars of some kind
like lentils and beans being the most

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
like lentils and beans being the most
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219
like lentils and beans being the most
famous contributors anyway so they are

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
famous contributors anyway so they are
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200
famous contributors anyway so they are
they're happily doing their thing so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
they're happily doing their thing so
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210
they're happily doing their thing so
there are there on a lag from your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
there are there on a lag from your
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740
there are there on a lag from your
schedule so whenever you're eating then

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
schedule so whenever you're eating then
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.120
schedule so whenever you're eating then
you sort of wait a while and then

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
you sort of wait a while and then
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429
you sort of wait a while and then
they're eating and I don't know exactly

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
they're eating and I don't know exactly
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859
they're eating and I don't know exactly
what else they do with their lives in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
what else they do with their lives in
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499
what else they do with their lives in
there I don't know how they pass the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
there I don't know how they pass the
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899
there I don't know how they pass the
time in between and I thought how much

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
time in between and I thought how much
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999
time in between and I thought how much
fighting is going on I think that it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
fighting is going on I think that it
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460
fighting is going on I think that it
seems to me like a lot of gang tribe

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
seems to me like a lot of gang tribe
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.620
seems to me like a lot of gang tribe
warfare going on because you know when

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
warfare going on because you know when
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.359
warfare going on because you know when
you hear about a fecal bacteria this is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
you hear about a fecal bacteria this is
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.330
you hear about a fecal bacteria this is
if you were a you are a gut bacteria and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
if you were a you are a gut bacteria and
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670
if you were a you are a gut bacteria and
suddenly here comes this whole it's this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
suddenly here comes this whole it's this
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.940
suddenly here comes this whole it's this
you know population giant population of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
you know population giant population of
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100
you know population giant population of
foreigners you know so it's this other

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
foreigners you know so it's this other
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.929
foreigners you know so it's this other
crazy immigration situation where

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
crazy immigration situation where
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.550
crazy immigration situation where
there's they're duking it out and the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
there's they're duking it out and the
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010
there's they're duking it out and the
strongest ones win and so that's a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
strongest ones win and so that's a
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649
strongest ones win and so that's a
global whole global warfare scene going

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
global whole global warfare scene going
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.950
global whole global warfare scene going
