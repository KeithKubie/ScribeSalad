00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.970
JJ BEHRENS: Hi, I'm JJ.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.310
And here we have our
next episode of

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.410
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.910
We have Jarek Wilkiewicz
down at the end.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.440
And we have two guests today,
Kevin and Matt from Kamcord.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.280
And later on, we're going to
be talking with Jeffrey

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.660
Posnick and Vladimir Vuskovic,
who is PM for YouTube APIs.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.210
So we got a really
full show today.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.930
Jarek, I remember at Google I/O,
we had one talk on gaming

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.520
where we had Dude Perfect and
the guy who created Tony Hawk

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.570
3 and everyone else.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.790
And so I'm guessing that the
goal today is to see how many

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.380
people we could fit
on the stage?

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes,
JJ, precisely.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.260
We are trying to hit the limit
of how many people we can fit

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.220
in the studio.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.110
We actually have a live
audience today.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.840
So this is a shout out for
people in the room that are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.220
actually helping us keep
this energized.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.250
But the real purpose for today's
live episode of our

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.480
YouTube Developers Live is to
show you an exciting piece of

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.920
technology that is being
developed by a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.350
company called Kamcord.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.630
And it really goes in line with
one of the approaches

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.090
that we discussed at Google I/O
to solving the problems

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.790
related to mobile
video capture.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.780
So Kamcord uses one of the
approaches that involves local

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.260
video capture and coding.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.320
And they've been quite
successful at that.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.190
I'm personally very excited
about this approach and this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.670
technology.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.690
So I can't wait to ask a
bunch of questions and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.860
then see a live demo.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.620
Since, of course, this is a
show for developers so it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.220
wouldn't be valid
without a demo.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.225
So I hope the demo's going
to work, right?

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.120
KEVIN WANG: Of course.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
so let's get into it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.919
We have Kevin and Matt
here, so maybe I'll

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.320
start with you, Matt.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.980
So tell me a little
bit about Kamcord.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.250
What prompted you to
start the company?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.360
Why mobile?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.080
And how did you guys actually
arrive at the idea?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.740
How long have you been at it?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.330
Just give me a little
background

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.620
about you guys first.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.825
And then we'll drill into some
of the technical details.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:31.110
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah,
sounds great.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.010
So Kamcord is a mobile
recording

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.680
technology for games.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.970
And the reason we built
the technology is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.350
that we are all gamers.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.620
We have three co-founders.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.010
And basically, we were on our
mobile phones a lot and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.240
playing these games.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.620
And we had these really awesome
moments, but we

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.820
weren't able to share them with
our friends, our family,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.790
and others online.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.940
And we really felt that Kamcord
was a great way to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.330
capture a video of this content
on the phone or tablet

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.200
and then be able to share that
on YouTube and other social

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.700
medium channels.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.150
And then what happened is we
started reaching out to some

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.680
of our friends that build mobile
games and realized that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.020
game developers really have a
distribution problem today.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.700
They have to try to somehow
get on the charts.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.530
And the problem there is
that that can be very

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.830
expensive for them.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.370
And we wanted to really create
a way that allows a user to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.520
kind of promote that game on
behalf of the game developer.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.880
So I heard you used to
work for Google.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.700
Did you have time to play games
back when you were at

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.170
Google or is this--

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.420
you quit to play games?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.470
What's the story there?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.160
MATT ZITZMANN: I personally
have always played games.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.220
I had three siblings that went
to University of Michigan.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.200
And we lived about an hour
and a half away.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.730
And I was about eight
years old.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.740
And we had a little 9-inch inch
TV that we would put in

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.360
our minivan.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.170
And I would play Madden
Football and all these

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.080
different games while we were
driving to the university.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.960
And I just always
played games.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.900
My dad was a real estate
developer.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.480
And we would play Sim
City together.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.100
So gaming has been
a part of my life

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.760
from really the get-go.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.550
And mobile--

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.110
basically what happened is I
personally became busier and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.700
busier in life and just didn't
have time to spend three hours

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.080
playing a game.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.780
And when I was at Google, I
would jump on the shuttle.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.870
And I would have a few minutes
here or there before I was

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.750
going to do email.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.210
And mobile gaming lends itself
very well for that type of

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.200
experience where you only have
three or five minutes while

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.210
waiting in line for
lunch, et cetera.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So tell me--
say I'm a game developer and

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.120
I'm developing a game
using Nginx.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.540
What are my choices here?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.490
Is there a technology that will
allow me to address all

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.050
the platforms?

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.930
What's the state of the art
from your perspective?

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.340
How does your solution fit
into the overall puzzle?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.610
MATT ZITZMANN: Right.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.840
So when we started with this
idea, we started looking

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.200
around and trying to figure
out who else had addressed

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.940
this problem of unlocking the
content from the device.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.910
And we really didn't find
another company that was

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.820
creating a solution.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.210
And we found other solutions.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.950
But they were kind of a no-go
for the game developer to put

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.200
in their actual game, primarily
because it would

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.660
slow down the gameplay.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.250
And so from day one when Kevin
started building the

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.750
prototype, it was really a
matter of thinking about how

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.990
can we build this technology
in a way that does not slow

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.690
down the gameplay.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.570
Because the user still wants to
have a game that runs at 60

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.830
fps and really can enjoy
the game as they have

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.690
always played it.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.140
But Kamcord can now sit in the
background basically recording

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.670
and allowing and kind of
seamlessly, passively

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.810
recording the screens.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.370
The user doesn't really need
to think about starting and

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.370
stopping, recording.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.725
It's just working behind
the scenes for them.

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:15.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.630
So how about you give
us a little demo?

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.330
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah, sure.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.180
So we're going to have our third
co-founder, Adi, give us

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.430
a demo here.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.740
Give this one moment
to transition.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.790
All right.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.200
So we have a game here
called Lost Robot.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.310
This game is currently in the
app store approval process, so

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.470
it will be going live soon.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.700
[GAME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.410
MATT ZITZMANN: And basically
what you have to do is you

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.230
have to help this robot
get back home.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.700
And so what Adi's doing here is
moving these little gates

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.160
out of the way.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.050
And behind the scenes,
what's going on is

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.790
Kamcord is just recording.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.860
You as a user don't really need
to think about anything.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.110
And so this was just a
really basic level.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.370
We just figured we'd keep it
really simple for this demo.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.070
And in the top left
there is a button.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.190
And if you press that button,
you'll be taken

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.600
to the Kamcord screen.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.030
And then on this Kamcord screen,
we have a replay

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.850
button so you can see exactly
what you just did.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.440
I hope everyone's enjoying
the elevator music.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.430
I guess it's a little more
hip than elevator music.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.060
All right, so that's the
end of the level again.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.220
So that's a replay of
what you just did.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.890
And then we have these
different--

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.500
obviously--

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.850
sharing functionalities.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.300
So if you click the YouTube
button, that will take you to

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.440
the YouTube screen where
you can share.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.790
And then the user can
type in a message.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.570
And hit Share.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.110
That's really neat.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.840
So it looks like it's very
well integrated into the

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.230
overall experience.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.910
So Kevin, tell me a little bit
about what's involved on the

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.770
technical side.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.832
If I want to integrate this into
my game, do I have to use

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:36.450
a specific game engine?

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.190
How about the YouTube
uploading?

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.510
What APIs do you guys use?

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.530
How about the user
authentication?

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.570
Give us some background about
all the pieces of the stack,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.470
how they fit together.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.970
KEVIN WANG: Right.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.550
So we have basically one
SDK, one framework for

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.860
iOS per game engine.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.540
So if you use a particular game
engine, you'll download

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.680
that framework, include it
in your code, basically.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.780
And the API that we offer
is pretty simple.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.590
It's basically just start and
stop recording because we just

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.870
want to make the APIs as
simple as possible for

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.470
developers.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.920
And basically once you start
and after you stop, if you

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.730
want your own UI to show the
video, or you can use the one

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.404
that we showed that comes
with our software.

00:09:20.404 --> 00:09:24.920
So that's basically like if you
want to get more than half

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.550
the value, you could just
do that with just a

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.980
couple lines of code.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.590
You'll get pretty far.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.810
In terms of the authentication
with YouTube, we use GData.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.150
So we just use the standard
libraries.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.350
And you didn't see in that demo,
but we'd already logged

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.410
into our account before.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are you guys
using the GTM OAuth 2

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.500
controller?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.390
KEVIN WANG: Yes, we are.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:47.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.910
Cool.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.870
Good answers.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.457
Because when people say, I'm
using ClientLogin on this

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:55.660
show, we normally
kick them out.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:55.970
Great.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.380
And then are there
any limitations?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.720
Like you mentioned that you're
trying to implement the

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.280
solution such that there's very
little overhead and the

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.160
frame rate is not affected.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.990
And what's the catch?

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.750
Is there a limited buffer size
that you can actually capture

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.060
the gameplay video?

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.000
How do you guys--

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.910
what other things that
are limiting?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.300
KEVIN WANG: Right.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.460
So it's pretty neat.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.935
So for example, on your iOS
phone, like the native camera

00:10:20.935 --> 00:10:25.350
app, that will write all your
video as it's being recorded

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.530
live to the device disk.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.630
And that way uses just a
constant amount of RAM, so you

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.920
can record for as long
as you want.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.650
And we used that same
tech, basically.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.160
Cool.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.690
And right now, you mentioned
there's one

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.470
engine supported today?

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.370
KEVIN WANG: Yes, that
engine is cocos2d.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.534
We're planning to expand
to more in the future.

00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:50.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.160
Any plans to look into
Android as well?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.080
Since we're at Google?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.400
KEVIN WANG: Yeah, that's
definitely the plan.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.570
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Really cool.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.790
So how do people get
started with this?

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.440
Like if I'm building a cocos2d
game, where do I go?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.165
What do I need to sign?

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.170
What's the process?

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.930
KEVIN WANG: If you go to our
site on kamcord.com--

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.650
K-A-M-C-O-R-D dot com--

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.280
you can basically sign up
for the developer key.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.510
And after that, you can download
the SDK documentation

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.576
and get started right away.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.550
Great.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:23.970
Now, JJ here, he's a very
famous mobile gamer.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.280
So when will he be able to share
his achievements with

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.580
some of the apps that
are coming?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.040
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.890
We have 13 games live on the
app store today, and we'll

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.220
have about 25 live by
the end of August.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.600
And we hope to have 100 by
the end of the year.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.760
And just continue to grow the
company into more and more

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.335
games, more game engines,
Android, et cetera.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Couple
of other questions.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.660
Anything that surprised
you while you

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.690
were developing solution?

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.430
Like things that you were just
not expecting that totally

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.680
blew your mind?

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.700
Like this question,
for example.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.460
KEVIN WANG: I think one thing
that was sort of funny was as

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.510
you're building a product in the
early days, you have your

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.660
core competency, which is making
this recording very

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.910
fast and seamless.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.890
And we're trying to think of
adding more features, et

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.210
cetera, to the product.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.940
And those take time and it could
be a little bit buggy.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.970
And what was really surprising
for us was that as we were

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.680
talking to our developers who
were basically trying to use

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.570
our software, what they told
us was the core of what you

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.760
have is golden.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.460
And they were willing to work
with us to fix all the

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.190
problems that they
came across.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.110
When you're starting a company,
you always try to

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.030
write software very fast.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.100
Things always break.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.970
And we expected people
to get upset or

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.990
frustrated as things--

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.450
we roll out a new feature, it
works part of the time.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.080
The other time it breaks.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.480
Right?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.650
Everyone's just been--

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.650
they just come back and ask you,
oh, yeah, here's a bug,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.430
here's a log report
if you fix this.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.790
And when we do, they're
really happy.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds like
a great community to work

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.510
with-- people actually
supporting your effort--

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:07.620
MATT ZITZMANN: It really is.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --as opposed
to treating you as somebody

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.460
who's trying to sell
them something.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.110
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.260
Just to add to that, I think
probably the number one thing

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.180
that came to my mind when you
asked the question was our

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.360
interactions with the developers
has just been

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.700
unbelievable.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.590
We had one guy that was at the
hospital when his wife was

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.320
giving birth.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.960
We've had two brothers
that quit their jobs.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.840
And they're down in Guatemala
designing this awesome game

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.820
that's going to be coming
out very, very soon.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.920
We've interacted with hundreds
of developers now.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.800
And they all have a different
story, a different motivation

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.850
for building games, whether
it just be for fun

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.776
or financial gain.

00:13:49.776 --> 00:13:55.030
And just getting to know these
guys and their personalities

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.400
has just been pretty cool.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.300
KEVIN WANG: Yeah, there have
been a couple times where it's

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.210
late on a Friday night.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.100
And we're about to finish.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.530
And we get an email-- hey,
Kevin, this is broken--

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.740
these guys from down
in Guatemala.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.060
So we stayed up and worked till
7:00 AM just trying to

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.510
fix the bugs.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.610
They're trying to release, so
we got to support them.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anything that
surprised you with the

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.630
YouTube API?

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.790
Like any areas where you
felt like we fell flat,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.310
or we could do better?

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.350
Any tricky things, pieces of
advice for future generations

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.620
of YouTube API developers?

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.730
Things that you think are tricky
and need some better

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.480
explanation?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.250
KEVIN WANG: So the way we did
it, mostly I just went to the

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.650
sample code, copied and pasted
as much as I could.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.140
And that actually worked.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.990
It got me immediately 90% of
the way there, I would say.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool, cool.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.670
KEVIN WANG: It was a little
bit hard to find some

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.260
documentation, I found.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.050
So it was mostly just
trial and error.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.286
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You think
our search engine

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.353
is not doing good?

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:50.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.210
KEVIN WANG: It got me to the
right page, inside the page.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.190
JJ BEHRENS: Wait a second,
which search

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.480
engine were you using?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.540
KEVIN WANG: It starts
with a Y.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.620
JJ BEHRENS: That could
be the problem.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.510
MATT ZITZMANN: I would say one
thing more at the product

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.910
level is having--

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.110
gaming today, we can do either
recordings or live streaming.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.420
And I think live streaming could
be a really interesting

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.490
proposition in the future.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Directly
from the mobile game?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.850
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.330
And we have a lot of crazy ideas
about where we want to

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.550
take Kamcord in the future.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.710
But yeah, being able
to basically--

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.290
I imagine or envision a world
where a group of friends could

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.360
go back home after school.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.390
And one of the guys is playing
his game on his tablet, and

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.490
all his friends could be in that
room with him watching.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:42.450
And it's just like a place for
them to hang out after school.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.950
And I think that could be a
really powerful thing to have

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.710
a synchronous connection.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.710
Now, that said, mobile and
tablets lend themselves more

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.150
to the asynchronous
experience.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.890
But I think having the
opportunity to experiment with

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.710
those unique, new types of
entertainment experiences

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.076
would be really interesting
to us.

00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:02.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You think
you're going to have that

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.230
working by the next
Google I/O?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.830
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah, we'll
definitely have it working.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.720
That's a year away.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm going
to take you up on that.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.950
JJ BEHRENS: I know we have a
lot of developers watching.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.550
And I just wonder if you guys
had any words of wisdoms for

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.970
developers out there.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.380
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah, I think
for us, we try to be super

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.330
hands on when people
have issues.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.270
And so providing us as many
details as possible--

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.040
[? stack ?] traces and just
describing your problems,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.410
screenshots, even send
us a little bit

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.910
of your source code.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.030
Calling us, Skyping, all of
these different things.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.440
Just basically trying to provide
us as much information

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.920
so that we can help solve
the problems that

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.290
you're running into.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.960
KEVIN WANG: Yeah, I would say
we talk a lot to developers

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.360
through email and a little
bit through Skype.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.147
Skype is always the best and
we're really always happy to

00:16:57.147 --> 00:16:57.750
jump on a call.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.730
And for email, if you just tell
us what the problem is,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.750
and what you need, even.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.940
Don't be afraid to ask
us, tell us, this is

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.770
what we need to launch.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.390
That makes our jobs easier,
actually, if you tell us your

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.609
exact specs.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:13.884
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:17:13.884 --> 00:17:16.609
Yeah, the bug reports I normally
get, it just say, it

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.010
doesn't work.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.280
MATT ZITZMANN: Yeah, we get a
lot of that and then you go

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.710
back and we end up getting
to where we need to be.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.700
But if we can short-circuit
there to that end state, it

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.390
helps a ton.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.660
Well, thank you very much for
giving us an intro to the

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.750
technology and answering all
the tough questions.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.550
We have a lot of content to
cover in this hour, so I'm

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.195
going to hand it over to JJ.

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:47.040
JJ BEHRENS: Yep, and now we're
going to talk to Vladimir

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.340
Vuskovic, product manager
for YouTube APIs.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.420
And Vladimir, first of all,
where are you and

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.535
what time is it?

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.630
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah,
I'm in Zurich.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.080
It is 7:20 in the evening.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.640
Thanks for staying up and
chatting with us.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.180
So whatcha working--

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.335
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Actually,
it is the 1st of August, so

00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:10.860
it's Swiss national
holiday today.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.920
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, is it?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.100
Well, I mean, it's Europe.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.690
That's like--

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.060
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: So
everybody's partying.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.980
JJ BEHRENS: I mean, it's
Europe, though.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.400
There's a holiday every other
day, as far as I could tell.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.250
So Vladimir, what are
you working on?

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.655
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: So currently,
we are really,

00:18:29.655 --> 00:18:30.260
really busy.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.530
We are working on a
bunch of things.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.120
First thing on our mind is the
new version of the YouTube

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.140
API, the version 3.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.090
And so we are really busy trying
to launch it publicly

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.990
as soon as possible.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.860
In addition to that, we are
working on a bunch of

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.430
interesting things like exposing
more of the partner

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.630
features through the API.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.200
Exposing the analytics
data through the API.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.230
We are working on also exposing
some of the newest

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.850
YouTube features through
the API.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.060
So we are really, really
busy in this period.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.980
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.450
So a lot of people--

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.290
aside from the people
watching this show--

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.690
when they think of YouTube,
they don't

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.320
necessarily think of APIs.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.930
And yet Jarek and I see a lot
of crazy apps built with the

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.060
YouTube APIs.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.740
Can you tell me some of your
favorite apps that you've seen

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.720
built with YouTube APIs?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.770
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Oh, yeah,
that's a good question.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:32.490
So yeah, the applications using
the YouTube APIs are the

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.050
[? vastest ?]

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.450
possible span.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.240
So from websites to mobile
apps like a little

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.800
[? clipboard ?]

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.150
to games, game consoles
like PlayStation.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.710
So it's really hard to pick.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.450
Perhaps the ones that's most
interesting to me is like it's

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.470
the rowboats like
the air drones.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:03.070
They are using the API to upload
the videos they record

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.945
while flying and later upload
to YouTube, so they have a

00:20:06.945 --> 00:20:08.345
really cool channel, as well.

00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:12.130
So this is something really,
really cool.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.470
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.410
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: It's perhaps
my favorite one

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.160
of the strange ones.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.760
JJ BEHRENS: I like the
air drone, too.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.440
So if you look at YouTube,
there's a lot of features on

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.320
the site that aren't actually
present in the API.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.170
Why is that?

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.110
And how do you make the decision
as to what goes into

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.920
the API and what's only
for the website?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.100
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:45.740
So the lag between the features
being on YouTube and

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.620
being exposed to the API, it's
mostly because on YouTube, we

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.700
launch stuff really, really fast
and need to write on it.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.150
And so we need some time to
stabilize the interface until

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.800
we can decide to give it out
to the API is one thing.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.640
The other thing is resources.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.187
So the API team needs
to keep up with all

00:21:07.187 --> 00:21:10.500
the development space.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.540
And we are getting quite
better at that.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.740
So one of the reasons that we
are launching v3 is because

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.590
it's going to enable us to
shorten this period and to be

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.530
quicker to catch up
on the API side.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.700
So this is something that we are
working on hard to reduce

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.610
this lag as much as we can.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.440
Also, one of the things that you
can expect coming out soon

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.210
that are available on the site
and not in the API, for

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.840
instance, are topics.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.460
So we are working hard
to expose the

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.920
topics through the API.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.590
And I expect that to be
out relatively soon.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.590
I cannot comment on a date,
but it's a matter

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.100
of a month or two.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.550
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I know that
I've gone to, for instance,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.300
the Player team's meeting.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.330
And those guys move so
incredibly quickly you never

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.810
know what they're
going to add.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.770
And yet, on the API team, we
have this amazing deprecation

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.060
policy where we try really,
really hard not to break apps.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.920
So does that have an impact on
what you include in the API

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.950
and how hesitant you are?

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.780
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:24.180
So we tend to include in the
APIs things that we think

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.990
reach the certain level of
maturity so that they're going

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.270
to stay for a while.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.900
It's not mandatory because we
can always expose that through

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.280
the API and have an experimental
API until we

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.170
establish the interface.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.990
But in general, you are right.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.570
So this is one of the reasons
that the API lags a bit.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.820
But yeah, I said before this
is going to improve.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.370
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.930
So when I think of product
managers, I always have this

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.480
exalted vision of them where
there's this massive boat.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.760
And they're steering the boat,
and they're trying not to run

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.730
into things.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.710
And they have this vision of
where they're going to go in

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.200
the future.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.030
One question is mobile's
really big.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.090
How is mobile impacting
your vision of the

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.600
future right now?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.920
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah, mobile
is key, for sure.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.610
So the consumption of videos
on mobile, and everything

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.350
around mobile is just growing
incredibly [? vastly. ?]

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.850
So we absolutely put mobile in
the center of our strategy.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:33.826
So one example for that is the
recently launched [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:36.314
[? boundary ?] player API.

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:38.970
I don't know if you guys seen
that, but that's something

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.520
that we really pushed forward.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.970
And we think that this will
enable a whole new generation

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:51.620
of apps and really fuel
innovation in the ecosystem

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.580
around videos.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.700
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.990
So not everyone is a content
partner, but a few of the

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.240
people in our audience
are content partners.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.030
And sometimes they've talked
to me about the fact that

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.900
there are some things that you
could do via our content

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.870
management system that you can't
do via the YouTube API.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.340
Are we going to be able to give
them an API to do some of

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.370
those things in the future?

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.460
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: OK, so
until now, the only way

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.135
partners could interact
programmatically with YouTube

00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:28.800
was through what we
call ingestion.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.400
So through XML feeds that they
would need to submit

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.630
over SFTP to us.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.470
And then we would process those
feeds and interact with

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.460
the content management system.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.020
And so now we are trying to
make this a bit better.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:50.095
So we are working hard on
launching the partner API that

00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:55.150
are going to be very much
similar and bound to the v3

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.640
YouTube API.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.510
And that will enable exactly
that kind of interaction as

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.080
you mentioned before.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.580
So basically interacting with
the CMS and doing the same

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.070
kind of things that you
are able to do today

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.670
using the CMS UI--

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.230
the Content Management
System UI-- or these

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.800
ingestion XML feeds.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.460
So we are in the trusted
testers phase now.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.340
And we are testing the first
alpha version of

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.190
those partner APIs.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.040
And we are really excited that
this is going quite well.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.390
So this is also something
that we expect to

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.885
launch relatively soon.

00:25:32.885 --> 00:25:35.455
In addition to that, we are
also working on our other

00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:38.040
partner features like the
branding API we just launched

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.055
recently to allow partners to
brand the channels through the

00:25:41.055 --> 00:25:44.870
API or the analytics API to get
your analytics from the

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.200
API and analyze them yourself.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.510
So yes, so there is a lot of
effort around exposing more

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.170
information to partners
through the API.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.070
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.420
Now, I know, looking at the
roadmap every quarter, I'm

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.190
always amazed at how many things
the YouTube API team is

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.210
working on.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.410
I just can't imagine how you
could not get pulled in every

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.700
direction at the same time.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.930
What are the things that you
guys are working on that

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.720
you're most excited about?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.200
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah,
it's really hard one.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.760
So I'm really excited
about the v3.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.140
Really, really excited, so I'm
looking forward to that.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.850
Another thing that we recently
launched that I'm really

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.310
excited about is the YouTube
Upload Widget.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.610
So that's something that
I really like a lot.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.330
So it basically enables
developers to put [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.405
IFrame--

00:26:39.405 --> 00:26:40.740
a piece of YouTube--

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.130
on their site and then enable
their users to upload videos

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.060
either to webcam or by selecting
files to YouTube

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.150
directly from their website
without leaving it.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:57.620
And along with it, we offer a
set of JavaScript API to have

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.090
better control of [? recent ?]
events and things like this.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.810
So I was really excited
about that launch.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.260
That happened recently.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.300
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I'm going
to have to agree with you.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.840
The webcam widget's probably
my favorite new API.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.780
So I agree.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.660
That's really exciting.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I have
one question for Vlad.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:13.720
Hey, Vlad.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.830
So I am told that you have
PhD in robotics.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:18.730
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah,
that's true.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the
question is how does one with

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.440
PhD in robotics become a YouTube
product manager?

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.970
And do you have any pieces of
advice for people that would

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.600
like to become product managers

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.800
at YouTube, at Google?

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.770
What type of career trajectory
they should pursue to become

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.410
product manager?

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.310
JJ BEHRENS: Aside from getting
a PhD in robotics

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.230
and moving to Zurich?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well,
if that's the

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.540
advice, then so be it.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.160
But I'm just curious
to see how that

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.890
fits into your thinking.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.310
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah, I think
there are several paths

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.690
to become a project
manager at Google.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.710
So you can have entrepreneurial
experience,

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.540
for instance.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:06.310
Or you can just be fresh out of
university with good grades

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.680
and join the APM program
in Google.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.362
This is a very interesting
path for new

00:28:12.362 --> 00:28:15.790
graduates or new PhDs.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.730
So I followed a different
path.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.117
After the PhD, I was
working for a

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:25.350
startup doing Java compilers.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.218
So it just happened.

00:28:29.218 --> 00:28:35.290
But gather as much experience as
you can in several fields,

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.570
possibly, so that you
can prove that you

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.830
have an open mindset.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.810
I think it's really important.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.680
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.110
Do you have any more words of
wisdom before we wrap up?

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.610
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah, we can
perhaps just mention the

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.675
new v3 and some timelines around
when we plan to launch

00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:01.120
it, so I think we--

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.160
JJ BEHRENS: I was afraid
to ask you.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.850
But then, of course, everyone
wants to know that question.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.710
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Yeah,
I know, I know.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.370
Everybody's asking
that one, yeah.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.510
So we are really working hard
and we think that we're going

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.430
to be able to launch in the next
couple of months maximum.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.830
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.600
That'll be a nice day when--

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.980
there will be client libraries
that will--

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.600
one client library
to rule them all.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.794
Per language, of course.

00:29:25.794 --> 00:29:28.355
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I
call that nirvana.

00:29:28.355 --> 00:29:30.680
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Another thing
that I just wanted to

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.582
mention quickly is I just want
to apologize to those who

00:29:33.582 --> 00:29:39.610
applied to join the
testing phase and

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.510
haven't been selected.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.380
Because currently, the API's
changing on a daily basis, so

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.950
it's not stable enough to have
a broad base of testers.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.220
But yeah, I said before.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.780
So the good news is we are
launching soon the beta

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.890
version 2 to everybody.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.450
JJ BEHRENS: Wow.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.260
Thanks a lot, Vladimir.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.260
Thanks for coming in
on your holiday.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.790
We really appreciate it.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.880
Next up, we have Jeffrey
Posnick, developer programs

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.010
engineer for YouTube APIs.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.150
Everyone knows Jeffrey.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.370
Jeffrey, you have some special
words of wisdom for us today

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.360
or something like that.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.470
What are you going to talk
to us about today?

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.200
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, I think
something like that probably

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.010
is a good catch-all
for what I wanted

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.690
to share with everybody.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.110
I guess I wanted to give a
little bit of an update on

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.860
what's been happening in the
community in the past week.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.370
And one thing of note is a blog
post that Jarek made that

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.880
went up this past Friday.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.645
And this is a blog
post that is--

00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:41.850
I don't know-- two years
in the making, maybe.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:47.080
We had a very, very long beta
period for the IFrame YouTube

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.180
player and the associated
API--

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.830
well, I guess the associated
API, in particular.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.120
And we are now officially
out of beta.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.270
This is something that
people ask about--

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.970
not on a daily basis in the
Google Groups and whatnot.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.540
But we definitely get nervous
developers who have seen the

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.153
beta tag attached to the IFrame
player API in the past

00:31:09.153 --> 00:31:11.150
and said, hey, does this mean I
really shouldn't be using it

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.240
in my apps?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.745
I really don't want to publish
something that might change at

00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:17.990
any time, that sort of thing.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.110
So that's all understood.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.300
And we had a few internal things
we had to take care of

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.490
before we could remove
that beta label.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.170
One of the things is alluded
to in the blog post.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.970
And that was basically changing
the names of some of

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.150
the interfaces to the API.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:43.816
So if you pull up the post on
our apiblog.youtube.com, feel

00:31:43.816 --> 00:31:46.620
free to go and read it
after watching this.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.160
You'll just basically note that
we changed the name of

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.620
one of the callback functions.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.220
And we actually changed the URL
that you use to pull in

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.820
the JavaScript for
the player API.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.570
The reason we did that was to
actually unify that API with

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.350
the Upload Widget API
that Vlad was

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.570
talking about earlier.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.955
So there's now actually only one
JavaScript file that you

00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:12.900
need to pull in.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.860
And regardless of whether you're
using the IFrame Player

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.110
API and the Upload Widget or
you're just using one or the

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.425
other, or if you're using
both, you just have

00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:25.340
to pull in one file.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.550
And you have one callback
function when it's loaded.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.870
So now that we've made that
change, we feel pretty

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:36.220
confident that we're ready to
make the IFrame Player API a

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.850
fully supported API, subject
to our normal deprecation

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.135
policy, everything like that.

00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:44.520
And if you've been holding off
on using it in any of your

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.133
apps, please don't be nervous
about it anymore.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.430
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.890
That's really good news.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:52.630
I know a lot--

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.760
JEFFREY POSNICK:
And you know--

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.160
sorry, just one more thing.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.440
And because it's not beta, that
does not mean that we

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.730
have yet achieved 100% feature
parity with, let's say, the

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.760
JavaScript Player API.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.190
And it doesn't mean that there
will not occasionally be bugs

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.080
because supported production
products do have bugs every

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.750
once in a while.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.910
But we're going to continue to
take all the feedback that we

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.690
get from the developer
community about new

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.455
functionality and/or bugs
and address that as

00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:22.430
promptly as we can.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.190
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.490
I know that the IFrame
API's been stable for

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.470
a pretty long time.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.240
But I know that some people
were worried about it just

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.690
because of the beta status.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.260
So this is good news.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.170
And I really like that
API, so that's great.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.740
So I'm looking at Moderator and
it doesn't look like we

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.290
have any questions.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.490
That must mean that Jeffrey
actually answered

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.310
them before the talk.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.860
It actually is more
effective--

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: There is
actually an entry there.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.290
And I'm not sure if this is
a comment or a question--

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.820
someone from Laos.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.460
New for me.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:03.280
So the way I think about this is
they haven't actually seen

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.600
this show before.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.350
Where they can find more
information, how can they keep

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.719
up to date on what's happening
in the YouTube API?

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.739
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, well,
we have two guests.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.844
How did you guys learn about
the YouTube API?

00:34:16.844 --> 00:34:19.770
KEVIN WANG: We used your
search engine.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.530
JJ BEHRENS: You googled
for YouTube API?

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.420
Yeah, that's pretty effective,
actually.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.239
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But one
comment is this show is live

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.750
every Wednesday at 10:00
AM Pacific time.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.960
If you go to
developers.google.com/live,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.730
you will actually see
the schedule.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.570
There's many other interesting
broadcasts, as well.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.800
And you can catch the
past episodes of

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.030
our Hangout on YouTube.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.659
So if you go to the Google
Developers channel, search for

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:55.100
YouTube there, you will find all
the past events that you

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.310
have missed.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.140
So you can catch up
pretty quickly.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.730
It'll only take a few hours.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.530
We've been doing this
for about a quarter.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.000
JJ BEHRENS: Yep.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then
you're welcome to join us

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.744
every Wednesday from now on.

00:35:06.744 --> 00:35:07.510
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.000
OK, thank you guys
for coming in.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.830
Thank you, Vladimir--

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.130
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sorry.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.320
JJ BEHRENS: Go ahead.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.030
JEFFREY POSNICK: Just to
interrupt you for a second.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.050
To make our manager happy
because she definitely had

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.510
asked us to do this, and to make
me happy because we're

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.760
always looking for
more teammates.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.570
Basically, the YouTube developer
relations team is

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.390
looking to hire some
new folks.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:32.210
And we wanted to encourage
people who are watching to

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.960
visit developers.google.com/jobs
if

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.520
you're interested in doing the
same sort of thing that Jarek,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.730
JJ, and I do.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.320
JJ BEHRENS: And we also
have a special guest.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.175
He's not miked up.

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:46.700
But he's going to try to
sneak in behind us

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.180
and peek in the camera.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.430
This is Jeremy, our
new developer

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.610
advocate for YouTube APIs.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.850
And he's going to be helping out
Jarek and I. So the team

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.400
is growing.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.890
And we are answering
more questions.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:58.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Welcome.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.865
JJ BEHRENS: Jeremy, welcome
to the team.

00:35:59.865 --> 00:36:02.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Official
welcome to the team.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.720
JJ BEHRENS: Handsome guy.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.090
And I think that's it.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.320
Thank you guys for
joining, Vladimir

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.250
and Jeffrey and Kamcord.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.220
Thanks a lot.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Bye, guys.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.920
VLADIMIR VUSKOVIC: Bye.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:29.000
