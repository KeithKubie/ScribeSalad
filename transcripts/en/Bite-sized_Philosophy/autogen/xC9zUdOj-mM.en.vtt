Piaget was very interested in what

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
Piaget was very interested in what
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.519
Piaget was very interested in what
happens to value structures and their

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
happens to value structures and their
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.730
happens to value structures and their
hierarchical organization once they have

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
hierarchical organization once they have
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160
hierarchical organization once they have

to apply outside of the confines of a

to apply outside of the confines of a
body so here's a way of thinking about

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
body so here's a way of thinking about
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.560
body so here's a way of thinking about
it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

two-year-olds basically hypothalamic
that's why they're so much fun

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
that's why they're so much fun
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.509
that's why they're so much fun
first they're happy then they're sad

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
first they're happy then they're sad
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.740
first they're happy then they're sad
then they're hungry then they're tired

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
then they're hungry then they're tired
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.560
then they're hungry then they're tired
you know they just zip from one pretty

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
you know they just zip from one pretty
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.049
you know they just zip from one pretty
straightforward and rather awe-inspiring

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
straightforward and rather awe-inspiring
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959
straightforward and rather awe-inspiring
motivational state to another and but at

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
motivational state to another and but at
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.360
motivational state to another and but at
two they can't play they can play with

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
two they can't play they can play with
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090
two they can't play they can play with
by themselves but they can't play with

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
by themselves but they can't play with
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920
by themselves but they can't play with
other children they can't get that until

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
other children they can't get that until
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110
other children they can't get that until
they're three and they need to get it by

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
they're three and they need to get it by
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.250
they're three and they need to get it by
the time they're free because if they

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
the time they're free because if they
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810
the time they're free because if they
don't get it by the time they're four

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
don't get it by the time they're four
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029
don't get it by the time they're four
they will never get it and then you have

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
they will never get it and then you have
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.560
they will never get it and then you have
an antisocial kid who's going to be an

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
an antisocial kid who's going to be an
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600
an antisocial kid who's going to be an
outsider for his entire life and there

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
outsider for his entire life and there
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549
outsider for his entire life and there
isn't anything you can do about it so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
isn't anything you can do about it so
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560
isn't anything you can do about it so
that has to happen between two and four

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
that has to happen between two and four
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360
that has to happen between two and four
so what happens at about age three is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
so what happens at about age three is
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860
so what happens at about age three is
that the kid learns how to play a game

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
that the kid learns how to play a game
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.810
that the kid learns how to play a game
with another person and what that game

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
with another person and what that game
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.179
with another person and what that game
is is fundamentally the development of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
is is fundamentally the development of
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520
is is fundamentally the development of
the ability to share a frame of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
the ability to share a frame of
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170
the ability to share a frame of
reference which is what you're doing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
reference which is what you're doing
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179
reference which is what you're doing
when you play Monopoly it's like it's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
when you play Monopoly it's like it's
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789
when you play Monopoly it's like it's
stupid to play Monopoly obviously who

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
stupid to play Monopoly obviously who
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289
stupid to play Monopoly obviously who
cares if you have a whole pile of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
cares if you have a whole pile of
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.320
cares if you have a whole pile of
counterfeit paper right but doesn't

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
counterfeit paper right but doesn't
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940
counterfeit paper right but doesn't
matter it because the way you're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
matter it because the way you're
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520
matter it because the way you're
constituted is that your brain will

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
constituted is that your brain will
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.420
constituted is that your brain will
treat anything you act like constitutes

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
treat anything you act like constitutes
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580
treat anything you act like constitutes
a valuable goal as if it's a valid

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
a valuable goal as if it's a valid
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.990
a valuable goal as if it's a valid
framework of reference and if it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
framework of reference and if it
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969
framework of reference and if it
couldn't do that a you couldn't abstract

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
couldn't do that a you couldn't abstract
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.219
couldn't do that a you couldn't abstract
and be you could not get along with

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
and be you could not get along with
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230
and be you could not get along with
other people so you can sit around the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
other people so you can sit around the
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210
other people so you can sit around the
table and you could say let's pretend

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
table and you could say let's pretend
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.630
table and you could say let's pretend
that monopoly is a reasonable facsimile

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
that monopoly is a reasonable facsimile
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450
that monopoly is a reasonable facsimile
of reality which you wouldn't say but

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
of reality which you wouldn't say but
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.399
of reality which you wouldn't say but
it's what you mean and everybody says

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
it's what you mean and everybody says
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429
it's what you mean and everybody says
yes that would be amusing

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
yes that would be amusing
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.639
yes that would be amusing
and so then you set your goal which is

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
and so then you set your goal which is
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.530
and so then you set your goal which is
to get all the little hotels and all the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
to get all the little hotels and all the
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170
to get all the little hotels and all the
money and proof your emotions go along

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
money and proof your emotions go along
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120
money and proof your emotions go along
for the ride and what's so interesting

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
for the ride and what's so interesting
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039
for the ride and what's so interesting
about that is you can get everybody into

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
about that is you can get everybody into
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450
about that is you can get everybody into
the game and so one of the things that's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
the game and so one of the things that's
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310
the game and so one of the things that's
really interesting about people is that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
really interesting about people is that
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109
really interesting about people is that
we can establish a shared fictional

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
we can establish a shared fictional
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449
we can establish a shared fictional
frame of reference and it organizes all

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
frame of reference and it organizes all
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.059
frame of reference and it organizes all
our emotion

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069
our emotion
 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.250
our emotion
so they're predictable that's also why

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
so they're predictable that's also why
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.649
so they're predictable that's also why
we can watch movies you go to the movie

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659
we can watch movies you go to the movie
 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.509
we can watch movies you go to the movie
you identify the hero you figure out

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519
you identify the hero you figure out
 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.089
you identify the hero you figure out
what the hero wants who you're the hero

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099
what the hero wants who you're the hero
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.209
what the hero wants who you're the hero
and the way that works is you don't look

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219
and the way that works is you don't look
 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.920
and the way that works is you don't look
at the hero and think about what he's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
at the hero and think about what he's
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.140
at the hero and think about what he's
doing and evaluated emotionally and then

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
doing and evaluated emotionally and then
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.660
doing and evaluated emotionally and then
feel it what you do is you specify the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670
feel it what you do is you specify the
 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.210
feel it what you do is you specify the
hero's goal and then you map him on to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
hero's goal and then you map him on to
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.460
hero's goal and then you map him on to
your body and you read off the emotional

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
your body and you read off the emotional
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.750
your body and you read off the emotional
responses of your own body

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
responses of your own body
 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.960
responses of your own body
and that's how you understand the hero

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
and that's how you understand the hero
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.839
and that's how you understand the hero
so it's it's embodied you're using your

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849
so it's it's embodied you're using your
 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.500
so it's it's embodied you're using your
your embodiment as a computational

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
your embodiment as a computational
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.300
your embodiment as a computational
device that can run simulations of other

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
device that can run simulations of other
 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.550
device that can run simulations of other
consciousness and it does that with the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
consciousness and it does that with the
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.349
consciousness and it does that with the
body and we like doing that you can go

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359
body and we like doing that you can go
 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.229
body and we like doing that you can go
to a movie and you know you're Brad Pitt

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239
to a movie and you know you're Brad Pitt
 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.289
to a movie and you know you're Brad Pitt
for an hour and a half you know when

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299
for an hour and a half you know when
 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.059
for an hour and a half you know when
you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable things

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069
you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable things
 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.039
you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable things
and that's also how we understand other

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049
and that's also how we understand other
 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.170
and that's also how we understand other
people we're very good at that so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180
people we're very good at that so
 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.670
people we're very good at that so
anyways we have these shared frames of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
anyways we have these shared frames of
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.690
anyways we have these shared frames of
reference like when we're playing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
reference like when we're playing
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.360
reference like when we're playing
Monopoly ok so children at free learn

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370
Monopoly ok so children at free learn
 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.250
Monopoly ok so children at free learn
how to play games and that means they

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260
how to play games and that means they
 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.649
how to play games and that means they
learn how to organize their own internal

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659
learn how to organize their own internal
 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.530
learn how to organize their own internal
motivational States into a hierarchy

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
motivational States into a hierarchy
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.270
motivational States into a hierarchy
that includes the motivational states of

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
that includes the motivational states of
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.520
that includes the motivational states of
other people and that means they can

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530
other people and that means they can
 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.009
other people and that means they can
play and that's what you guys do when

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019
play and that's what you guys do when
 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.030
play and that's what you guys do when
you're out in the world like we're

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040
you're out in the world like we're
 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920
you're out in the world like we're
playing a game right now we all know the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
playing a game right now we all know the
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.869
playing a game right now we all know the
rules that's why we can all sit in this

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879
rules that's why we can all sit in this
 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.879
rules that's why we can all sit in this
room and play the game without fighting

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889
room and play the game without fighting
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.009
room and play the game without fighting
with each other you know when the room

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019
with each other you know when the room
 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.659
with each other you know when the room
is set up like a theater and we all know

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669
is set up like a theater and we all know
 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.119
is set up like a theater and we all know
the theater game and so and the chairs

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129
the theater game and so and the chairs
 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.039
the theater game and so and the chairs
are always facing this way at the moment

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049
are always facing this way at the moment
 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.539
are always facing this way at the moment
and so that's a hints that you should

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549
and so that's a hints that you should
 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.670
and so that's a hints that you should
look forward and this is raised so you

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
look forward and this is raised so you
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.500
look forward and this is raised so you
know the room is basically telling you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510
know the room is basically telling you
 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.050
know the room is basically telling you
what to do because it's a stage like all

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060
what to do because it's a stage like all
 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.969
what to do because it's a stage like all
rooms and because you're smart and

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979
rooms and because you're smart and
 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.129
rooms and because you're smart and
socially conscious you can walk into a

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139
socially conscious you can walk into a
 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.319
socially conscious you can walk into a
stage through and your body knows what

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329
stage through and your body knows what
 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.599
stage through and your body knows what
to do and if you're civilized and social

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609
to do and if you're civilized and social
 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.860
to do and if you're civilized and social
you just do it then all the other

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
you just do it then all the other
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.479

you don't have to know what they're up
 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.499
you don't have to know what they're up
to because you can predict what they're

to preserve the dominance hierarchies is
 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.060

someone who's thrown screaming and naked
into the jungle at night and that's the

into the jungle at night and that's the
 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.400

difference between order and chaos and
 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.160

we like order better than chaos and it's

now we'll invite a little chaos in for

now we'll invite a little chaos in for
 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.500
now we'll invite a little chaos in for
entertainment now and then it has to be

entertainment now and then it has to be

you're willing to fool around on the

you're willing to fool around on the

the going gets serious you're pretty

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130
the going gets serious you're pretty
 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.500
the going gets serious you're pretty
much likely to bail out and no wonder
