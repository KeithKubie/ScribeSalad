the design documents mm-hmm as you

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:24.689
the design documents mm-hmm as you
 

00:46:24.689 --> 00:46:28.929
the design documents mm-hmm as you
advised your hiney see just in there yep

00:46:28.929 --> 00:46:28.939
 
 

00:46:28.939 --> 00:46:31.879
 
yes I felt terrifies he means their code

00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:31.889
yes I felt terrifies he means their code
 

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:35.419
yes I felt terrifies he means their code
examples yes sir I think the desire is

00:46:35.419 --> 00:46:35.429
examples yes sir I think the desire is
 

00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:36.889
examples yes sir I think the desire is
to keep the design section down to the

00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:36.899
to keep the design section down to the
 

00:46:36.899 --> 00:46:39.019
to keep the design section down to the
design so it's not to scare off designer

00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:39.029
design so it's not to scare off designer
 

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:42.199
design so it's not to scare off designer
swift code and but yeah certainly

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:42.209
swift code and but yeah certainly
 

00:46:42.209 --> 00:46:43.849

linking through two tips for

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859
linking through two tips for

00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559
implementation is interesting coming out
 

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:51.649
implementation is interesting coming out
and turning I think it's it's nice to

00:46:51.649 --> 00:46:51.659
and turning I think it's it's nice to
 

00:46:51.659 --> 00:46:53.120
and turning I think it's it's nice to

of the designers is so important

00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:55.049
of the designers is so important
 

00:46:55.049 --> 00:46:56.959
of the designers is so important
compared to back in the day when we

00:46:56.959 --> 00:46:56.969
compared to back in the day when we
 

00:46:56.969 --> 00:46:58.819
compared to back in the day when we
didn't have such kind of strict standard

00:46:58.819 --> 00:46:58.829
didn't have such kind of strict standard
 

00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:01.399
didn't have such kind of strict standard
so I think keeping the two separate has

00:47:01.399 --> 00:47:01.409
so I think keeping the two separate has
 

00:47:01.409 --> 00:47:03.259
so I think keeping the two separate has
kind of made a lot of sense but yeah

00:47:03.259 --> 00:47:03.269
kind of made a lot of sense but yeah
 

00:47:03.269 --> 00:47:05.629
kind of made a lot of sense but yeah
maybe it's a case in easley a couple of

00:47:05.629 --> 00:47:05.639
maybe it's a case in easley a couple of
 

00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:08.089
maybe it's a case in easley a couple of

a very very long time about this he said

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.180
a very very long time about this he said
 

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.820
a very very long time about this he said
that even though the GPS icon is there

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:11.830
that even though the GPS icon is there
 

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.920
that even though the GPS icon is there
he said that it is actually designed to

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:13.930
he said that it is actually designed to
 

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.560
he said that it is actually designed to
be quite efficient in terms of not

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:16.570
be quite efficient in terms of not
 

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.570

needs to he told me to look in the

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:21.670
needs to he told me to look in the
 

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.370
needs to he told me to look in the
source code to see if I could then stop

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:23.380
source code to see if I could then stop
 

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.320
source code to see if I could then stop
it from doing that and then essentially

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:25.330
it from doing that and then essentially

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:34.539
 
yeah he will get course pretty quickly

00:51:34.539 --> 00:51:34.549
yeah he will get course pretty quickly
 

00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:36.729
yeah he will get course pretty quickly
afterwards so it depends I don't know

00:51:36.729 --> 00:51:36.739
afterwards so it depends I don't know
 

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:37.870
afterwards so it depends I don't know
how all the computations are going to

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880
how all the computations are going to
 

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.669
how all the computations are going to
take but if it's more than a second or

00:51:39.669 --> 00:51:39.679
take but if it's more than a second or
 

00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:40.779
take but if it's more than a second or
two then yeah definitely go for wait

00:51:40.779 --> 00:51:40.789
two then yeah definitely go for wait
 

00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:44.229
two then yeah definitely go for wait
look look it is it's a good choice to

00:51:44.229 --> 00:51:44.239
look look it is it's a good choice to
 

00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:48.880
look look it is it's a good choice to
learn to read okay yeah just take the

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:48.890
learn to read okay yeah just take the
 

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:49.809
learn to read okay yeah just take the
weight lock and then turn it back off

00:51:49.809 --> 00:51:49.819
weight lock and then turn it back off
 

00:51:49.819 --> 00:51:51.009

Android building system see what's

00:53:07.029 --> 00:53:07.039
Android building system see what's
 

00:53:07.039 --> 00:53:09.429
Android building system see what's
happening Gradle is one of the systems

00:53:09.429 --> 00:53:09.439
happening Gradle is one of the systems
 

00:53:09.439 --> 00:53:12.219
happening Gradle is one of the systems
that was in there as a potential for

00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:12.229
that was in there as a potential for
 

00:53:12.229 --> 00:53:15.549
that was in there as a potential for
support it seems to be less favored

00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559
support it seems to be less favored
 

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.529
support it seems to be less favored
because it's not a mainstream system by

00:53:17.529 --> 00:53:17.539
because it's not a mainstream system by
 

00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:18.640
because it's not a mainstream system by
mainstream I just mean it's got a

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:18.650
mainstream I just mean it's got a
 

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:20.109
mainstream I just mean it's got a
critical mass of users I'm sure there

00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119
critical mass of users I'm sure there
 

00:53:20.119 --> 00:53:22.029
critical mass of users I'm sure there
are not people who really like it I

the moment being supported in the first
 

00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:29.079
the moment being supported in the first
part of the new build system but there's

00:53:29.079 --> 00:53:29.089
part of the new build system but there's
 

00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:30.729
part of the new build system but there's
nothing to say that it wouldn't have

00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:30.739
nothing to say that it wouldn't have
 

00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:32.439
nothing to say that it wouldn't have
support for a built later because there

00:53:32.439 --> 00:53:32.449
support for a built later because there
 

00:53:32.449 --> 00:53:33.370
support for a built later because there
are quite a few people who are
