00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:09.702
(inspiring piano music)

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.455
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:14.788
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:21.752
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:25.169
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:29.326
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:31.409
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:34.138
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.590
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.673
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:43.662
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:44.662
of the past.

00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:50.254
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.421
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.854
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.437
of humans like you.

00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.188
(electronic music)

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:43.206
So I'm going to extend some of the points

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:44.667
that Rusty raised,

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.405
but particularly in the
context of this structure,

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:49.357
which is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:50.878
So I think most people will be familiar,

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:52.541
this large folded
structure here at the top

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:54.478
is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:56.693
It makes up about three
quarters of the volume

00:01:56.693 --> 00:01:59.453
of the human central nervous system.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.261
And I think most people in this room

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:03.786
know functionally how important it is,

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:07.519
it's as I say here the
executive and integrative center

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.157
of the central nervous system.

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:11.402
It's a heap load of real estate,

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:12.985
it does important things
so it's affected by

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:16.634
a variety of diseases
that have their etiology

00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:18.774
or their impact at
different stages in age,

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:20.823
starting from conditions
with a very early onset

00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:22.835
in childhood, like autism,

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.061
right through to diseases of later life

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.287
like dementia or stroke
and those kind of things.

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:29.527
So what I'm gonna talk about today

00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:33.385
is how do we start dealing with questions

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.943
about how do you control the development

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:35.792
of the cerebral cortex,

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:38.176
particularly in terms of size,

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:39.775
as a very simple concept.

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.733
And as I'm sure you've heard

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:45.691
in previous CARTA symposia,
and you'll hear this afternoon,

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:48.087
there's a lot of debate
about cognitive capacity,

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.307
cognitive ability, and its
anatomical underpinnings.

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:54.027
And is it bigger brains
make you smarter and so on?

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:56.490
But there's some degree of
agreement around the idea

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.657
that certainly more neurons
give you more processing power

00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.443
at its most basic rate.

00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:03.307
Complexity is probably
very important as well

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:06.189
in terms of elements that
one can build circuits from

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.347
and what you do with them.

00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:10.923
But raw real estate is
also quite important.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.724
And that becomes very obvious
when you start looking

00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:16.754
at these three
cherry-picked primates here.

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:20.431
We've obviously got humans,
chimp and rhesus macaque.

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.483
And what we're looking at
here is the number of neurons

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:24.080
in each cerebral cortex.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.841
Where you can see that human's has roughly

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:29.383
threefold as many compared to chimpanzee.

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:32.433
Even though in terms of
actual developmental time,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.920
so I could ask this audience
how long do humans take

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.433
to develop, easy one for us
all to answer, nine months.

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.802
The chimp is roughly the same,

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:40.966
but you still end up with a brain

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.450
which has a cortex with about a third

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.921
of the number of neurons.

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.425
And then macaque, which is
shorter in development again,

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.166
but has tenfold fewer neurons.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.300
So there's a very basic
developmental biology question,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.457
is how do different organisms generate

00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:57.521
different numbers of neurons
within their cerebral cortex?

00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.450
And at what level is it controlled?

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.672
And by understanding
that question of control,

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:04.433
can we start thinking about
how you might then evolve

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:05.953
these differences between
different species,

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.657
and it plugs into the kind of genetics

00:04:08.657 --> 00:04:11.133
and that kind of work that
you'll be hearing about

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.167
later in the afternoon.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:14.050
So to think about this,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.934
you've got to think about
developmental biology,

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:17.287
which is how do you actually make things

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.295
in the cortex in the first place.

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:23.026
And this is a picture from a mouse brain,

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:24.183
where this red thing,

00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:25.385
this is a slice through the mouse brain,

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:27.289
this would be the outside,
this would be the inside.

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.017
And what all these little red blobs are,

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.921
these are what we would
call progenitor cells,

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:33.335
but for the sake of simplicity

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:34.826
I'll call them cortical stem cells.

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:36.465
So these guys aren't neurons,

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.163
this is before you have
any neurons in your brain

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:39.775
or in this case the mouse brain.

00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:42.111
And this is a slice this
way through one half

00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:43.679
of your cerebral cortex.

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.367
So the skin would be
out here, for example,

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:47.859
there's a hole in the
center of the brain here.

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:50.209
And these guys are lined up in a row.

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.954
And what happens is, these
cortical stem cells go on,

00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:55.273
and this is them in black,

00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:58.423
to generate cortical
neurons that are arranged

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.187
in layers over time.

00:05:00.187 --> 00:05:02.007
So you do this inside-out development,

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:03.653
you make the deep layers before
you make the upper layers

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:04.486
and so on.

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:06.954
And this is a very stereotyped program

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:09.327
that plays out in every
single mouse in the same way.

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:11.237
And in a mouse it takes about six days

00:05:11.237 --> 00:05:14.253
to generate all of these cells.

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.559
So that's fine, you've got one
big population of stem cells,

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.076
there's some very interesting
biology about them,

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:19.554
how they diversify.

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:22.191
But at its heart, these
guys make all of this

00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:24.423
class of neurons.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:25.848
So when you're thinking
about how you build a brain

00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:27.511
you've got to think
about how they do this.

00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:30.862
But a key concept within
this is what is the output

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.642
of each one of those cortical stem cells.

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:36.230
And there's a principle
in development here

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.460
where we talk about a clone.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.199
No this isn't Dolly the sheep type clone,

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.326
this is a different clone,

00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:42.678
just to make your life
slightly more complicated.

00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:43.877
It's a very basic idea.

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.167
What it is is, in a mind experiment,

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.925
if you could label one of those red cells

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:51.431
in that previous slide,
with an indelible marker,

00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.967
so every time it divides,

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.967
its daughter cells inherit
the indelible marker,

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:56.761
and let development play out over time.

00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:58.118
What you'd end up doing is labeling

00:05:58.118 --> 00:05:59.878
every single cell it made,

00:05:59.878 --> 00:06:02.016
just passively by letting it roll.

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:03.983
So that's the idea, so you label a clone.

00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:05.356
So if we're doing this in the cortex,

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.811
we know what the start to
cortical development looks like,

00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:09.527
we've got these progenitor cells lined up.

00:06:09.527 --> 00:06:12.729
We call this an epithelium, basically.

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.944
And we know what it looks like
at the end of development,

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:16.647
where you've got these layers of neurons,

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:19.703
and we've got little labels
that let us tell them apart.

00:06:19.703 --> 00:06:21.047
The mind experiment,
and the real experiment,

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.611
is you then label one of these guys

00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:26.151
with an indelible marker,
and let time play out.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.613
And you do this, and you look at thousands

00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:28.941
and thousands of these.

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.391
What you find is something very simple.

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.461
If you do this before
you make any neurons,

00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:34.863
you end up with purple spots
that cross all the layers

00:06:34.863 --> 00:06:37.215
and make all of the cells.

00:06:37.215 --> 00:06:38.662
And what that tells you is you've got this

00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:41.761
fundamental principle where
each cortical stem cell

00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:43.711
will make a clone of cells that populates

00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.951
all of the different neuronal types.

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:49.135
And so what that tells you
then is that your clone

00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:51.294
is sort of an atomic unit of building

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:53.128
a structure within the nervous system.

00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:54.733
This is true in the cortex
example I've given here.

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:56.378
It's actually true in your spinal cord,

00:06:56.378 --> 00:06:57.961
your eye and so on.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.463
And what that does is it gives you an idea

00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:02.277
of thinking about this problem of,

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:05.533
at a kind of comparative
development level,

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:07.915
how do you make a bigger cortex in say

00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:10.638
a human compared to a macaque, or a chimp?

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.359
And it's actually very simple.

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:14.263
So if you think about it in clonal terms,

00:07:14.263 --> 00:07:16.488
either have more clones,

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:18.374
so increase the number of stem cells

00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:20.155
before you ever even make the structure,

00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:23.021
or actually change what
each stem cell does

00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:25.422
in terms of what the
output of its clone is.

00:07:25.422 --> 00:07:29.004
So make the production
from that clone larger.

00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:31.926
And it's a way of ending
up with more neurons.

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:32.989
An example I've got up here,

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:34.422
this is mouse.

00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:36.511
And mice are, for want of a better term,

00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:38.157
relatively simple in this respect,

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.590
which is they have phases.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.272
This is your starting stem
cell, it proliferates,

00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:45.238
and then it has this linear program.

00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:47.788
It expands itself, then
it starts making neurons,

00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:49.721
during which it depletes itself.

00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:51.494
Because you're eating up
stem cells to make neurons.

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:53.338
And then they switch to
make these supporting,

00:07:53.338 --> 00:07:55.644
or these second cell type
in the nervous system,

00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:56.739
the astrocyte, which is actually

00:07:56.739 --> 00:07:58.136
functionally very important.

00:07:58.136 --> 00:07:59.990
And it's a nice linear program.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.910
So one of the big
questions in the field is

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.106
when you start getting to primates,

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:05.677
how complicated does this get?

00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:07.390
Do you just take the simple template,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.279
and just make more of them,

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:11.388
and you just generate
more real estate that way,

00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:12.894
or do you diversify this and make it

00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:14.282
much more complicated?

00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:15.574
And how would this work?

00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:16.985
And if you can understand
that then you can start

00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:19.589
plugging in the molecular genetic stuff

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:22.955
and think well how does
this work within all this?

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:24.677
The question is how do you study this?

00:08:24.677 --> 00:08:26.938
And labeling single cortical
stem cells in a human

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:28.405
might you get you in trouble

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:29.818
in most jurisdictions at this point.

00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:31.310
(laughter)

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.831
So we did something similar
to what Rusty spoke about,

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:37.477
where in this case we were very much

00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:39.863
focused on the cerebral cortex.

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:41.168
So we started with human,

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.371
and we took human embryonic stem cells,

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.325
or these induced pluripotent stem cells

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.469
that Rusty mentioned.

00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:49.335
And what we essentially
worked out how to do,

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.293
using principles of developmental biology,

00:08:51.293 --> 00:08:53.636
is make the cortical, just the cortical,

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:55.112
neural stem cell.

00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:57.373
And they form these rather
pretty rosettes within this.

00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:59.095
And what we found is
that we could put them

00:08:59.095 --> 00:08:59.990
into the dish,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.942
and they would replay this
generating the layers of neurons

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:07.289
on exactly the timescale that
they do in normal development,

00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:10.710
but in utero, which was
a bit of a surprise.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.631
And they actually go on and they make

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:14.322
these beautifully connected networks.

00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:16.421
So these are neurons which
are firing away happily,

00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:18.789
these human neurons.

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:20.385
So this was a bit of a surprise to us,

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.306
that they observed rules even though

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:26.389
they were isolated from the whole embryo.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.966
So we then extended this
and said well what happens

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:31.590
if we look at these different species.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.953
So this was worked on by Tomoki Otani

00:09:33.953 --> 00:09:34.989
when he was in the lab.

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:37.206
And this was actually a
collaboration with Carol Marchetto

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:39.238
who you heard mentioned by Rusty,

00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:41.701
and actually Eliza Curnow,

00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:45.638
at the Primate Research
Institute up in Seattle.

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:46.929
And what essentially we did was work out

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:50.222
how to make pure cortex
from these cerebral cortexes

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.686
from these different species in the lab.

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.128
And this is John Gurdon down the bottom

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:55.966
for those of you who don't know.

00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:57.790
Though we don't actually
have John's IPS cells.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.882
We think there's a market
for them, (laughter),

00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:01.712
a rather dodgy market
for them, but anyway.

00:10:01.712 --> 00:10:03.900
So this is chimp, and there
are actually two different

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.063
species of macaque, because
we could get access to them.

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:09.562
So we could make the cortical stem cells,

00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:10.930
and we could replay development.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.885
And what we found was, each species,

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:14.885
just as it does in vivo,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.204
has a developmental timescale

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:20.697
which it observes in the lab.

00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:22.382
By which I mean, the green cells here,

00:10:22.382 --> 00:10:26.758
so the bottom of each one of
these graphs here, is time,

00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:28.948
and the green are those
deep layers of neurons,

00:10:28.948 --> 00:10:31.196
and the red is these later-born neurons.

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:34.005
So every species makes green before red.

00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:36.029
But what happens is the macaque makes red

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.212
much sooner than the
human does and the chimp.

00:10:38.212 --> 00:10:39.148
And actually, the human and the chimp

00:10:39.148 --> 00:10:41.349
look remarkably similar at the resolution

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.435
that we can look at with
these kind of assays.

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.852
So in fact, the rest of
what I'll talk about,

00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:47.468
we just look at human and macaque.

00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:49.636
Because actually human and
chimp look very similar.

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.238
Which is actually kind of reassuring,

00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:53.110
because you'd want them
to look very similar,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.478
given what you heard about in
terms of genome similarities.

00:10:56.478 --> 00:10:58.742
So every species has a schedule,

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.901
and I should say the schedule
is remarkably similar

00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.633
to what happens in utero.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:04.288
And we extended this to
all sorts of other analyses

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:06.553
which I won't go into detail with here.

00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:07.925
Including when do they make neurons,

00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:09.942
when do they make different
classes of neurons,

00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:11.737
and the kind of electrophysiology
you heard about,

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.126
when do they mature, when
do they form networks?

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:18.067
So what this provides us now is a platform

00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:19.912
to start asking the mechanistic questions

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:22.842
that I mentioned, which is,
well how does the stem cell

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:25.375
that actually generates these
neurons within each species

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:28.725
behave in terms of making a cortex?

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:30.146
And what that involved doing,

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:33.642
is in the lab version of
the experiment I described,

00:11:33.642 --> 00:11:35.814
where we label just one stem cell

00:11:35.814 --> 00:11:37.975
in a population of tens of thousands

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:39.737
and actually watch that over time

00:11:39.737 --> 00:11:41.857
and then look at lots of
individual stem cells.

00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:45.855
And to do that we use a
trick where we take a virus

00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:49.371
which is essentially we sort of damaged.

00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:51.019
So this virus can infect a cell,

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:53.099
but it can never get back out again.

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:54.712
So it brings the marker with it,

00:11:54.712 --> 00:11:55.602
the marker then stays.

00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:56.481
So these are what we call

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.282
replication-incompetent lentiviruses.

00:11:58.282 --> 00:11:59.555
This is a rosette made up of,

00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:01.316
each one of these blobs is a stem cell

00:12:01.316 --> 00:12:02.571
we label one stem cell.

00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:04.795
And then we follow this thing dividing

00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:06.740
over say 10 days in the lab

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.923
and we can reconstruct the clone.

00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:11.939
And one of the challenges
here is as we mentioned

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.470
primate development is
very long and very slow.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.336
So to give you some sort of benchmark,

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.996
mice will take over the world.

00:12:17.996 --> 00:12:20.188
And the reason mice will
take over the world is

00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:23.843
they do all their development
in less than 21 days.

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:25.907
And they generate litters
of, well you know,

00:12:25.907 --> 00:12:27.137
those of you who have
been unfortunate enough

00:12:27.137 --> 00:12:29.643
to have your garage overrun by mice.

00:12:29.643 --> 00:12:33.571
As opposed to humans, and we
know how long humans take.

00:12:33.571 --> 00:12:36.752
And I mentioned, the mice
will make the cortical neurons

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:39.353
at six days, humans will
do it over four or five,

00:12:39.353 --> 00:12:40.253
six months.

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:43.020
And so you get an idea,
these clones become enormous.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.779
So we have to look at
them in blocks of 10 days.

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.971
So the first 10 days,
second 10 days and so on.

00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:50.843
And the first thing we
can do is start measuring,

00:12:50.843 --> 00:12:52.769
what do they make and how do they make it?

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:56.154
And as biologists, we tend
to think biology's a mess.

00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:58.537
You know, there are kind of
rules, but they're a bit dodgy,

00:12:58.537 --> 00:13:00.255
and it's a bit tricky to make sense of it.

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:02.571
It's all about extracting
order from chaos.

00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:05.676
And physicists think that
we're a bunch of Luddites

00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:07.139
and that we can't think straight.

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:08.353
(laughter)

00:13:08.353 --> 00:13:09.434
There are clearly
physicists in the audience,

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:10.748
I heard some sniggering.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:14.041
And a colleague and friend
of mine at Cambridge,

00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.925
who is a physicist, called Ben Simons,

00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:18.965
says actually you biologists,

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.428
if you think of the complex datasets,

00:13:20.428 --> 00:13:22.171
there's usually some
very important principles

00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:23.004
underlying them.

00:13:23.004 --> 00:13:24.362
And I said prove, and so he did.

00:13:24.362 --> 00:13:25.659
And he took all this kind of data,

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:27.332
and he ripped them apart.

00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:29.067
And rather than me
boring you for 10 minutes

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:30.697
with all the details, I'll
give you the punchline,

00:13:30.697 --> 00:13:32.481
which is what I told him to tell me too.

00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:35.714
Which is that essentially,
when we start looking at,

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:36.851
so for example this is,

00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:40.371
how many stem cells are
within a clone, over time?

00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:43.364
And this is, in the first 10
days, for example, 20 days.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.947
Gray is the next 10 days and
black is the next 10 days.

00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:47.866
And you see, actually in
each window of 10 days,

00:13:47.866 --> 00:13:48.939
humans all look the same.

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:50.402
And what's happening over time is,

00:13:50.402 --> 00:13:51.565
within the clone,

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.471
they're actually expanding
the number of stem cells

00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.933
in the clone while making neurons.

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:58.027
So the the whole thing
is growing exponentially.

00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:00.242
Macaques start off
looking very like humans,

00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:02.074
and then they crash.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.058
And what that really means is that

00:14:04.058 --> 00:14:07.140
essentially the macaques
stop making neurons

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.731
much sooner than the humans do.

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:09.830
And it's a very simple thing.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.299
What it means is that the humans make

00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:14.142
these big long extended clones,

00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:15.864
which allow them to make far more neurons

00:14:15.864 --> 00:14:17.689
over a much longer period of time.

00:14:17.689 --> 00:14:20.001
So they'll make more
neurons per stem cell.

00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:21.574
And they do them in kind of clever ways,

00:14:21.574 --> 00:14:24.053
stuff that I won't get into today.

00:14:24.053 --> 00:14:28.421
Now, that's all fine, and
it's very descriptive.

00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:31.055
It raises the second
question, which is well fine,

00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:32.679
how does this work?

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:35.216
Now there's a very broad
distinction we like to make,

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:37.721
which is how much of this
biology is controlled

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.942
intrinsically, whatever that means

00:14:39.942 --> 00:14:41.317
in terms of the mechanism.

00:14:41.317 --> 00:14:43.406
And how much is controlled externally?

00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:45.018
Signaling, environment.

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:47.453
You can boil it down
to the nature/nurture,

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.621
who do you know, what do you know.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.294
But you get the basic principle.

00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:51.839
I once heard that one
referred to the European

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:53.355
versus the American model,

00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:54.766
but I couldn't work out
which one was meant to be

00:14:54.766 --> 00:14:56.456
slightly not complimentary.

00:14:56.456 --> 00:14:57.522
(laughter) But anyway.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.245
So in this case what we can do is

00:15:00.245 --> 00:15:01.697
we can essentially do transplantation.

00:15:01.697 --> 00:15:04.461
Now clearly, I'm not gonna get a license

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.979
to transplant macaque cells
into humans, certainly,

00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:10.393
and probably not the
other way round either.

00:15:10.393 --> 00:15:11.226
But what we can do is,

00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:13.061
we can do transplantation in the lab,

00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:15.409
where we can label up,
say, the human stem cell

00:15:15.409 --> 00:15:17.961
or the macaque stem
cell, and then move say

00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.781
one in a thousand of those
into the other environment.

00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:21.819
So essentially we're exposing them

00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:23.190
to the other species'
environment and asking

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.345
now what will they do, at its simplest.

00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:28.051
And we can then roll them out over time

00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:29.401
and do all our maths.

00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:30.788
And essentially, all I'm showing you here

00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:32.403
is that nothing changes.

00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:33.809
So I'll give you the punchline, which is,

00:15:33.809 --> 00:15:35.961
the number of neurons a stem cell makes

00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.683
is actually intrinsic to the species.

00:15:37.683 --> 00:15:39.107
It's got nothing to do
with the environment,

00:15:39.107 --> 00:15:40.957
at the resolution of this assay,

00:15:40.957 --> 00:15:42.146
with all sorts of caveats around it

00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:43.645
with what we're measuring.

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:45.929
By which we mean, if I
move macaque into human,

00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:47.525
macaque doesn't care, it'll still make

00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:49.194
what it wants to make
when it should make it.

00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:50.697
And similarly with the human,

00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:52.186
if I move human into macaque,

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:55.177
it'll still generate a
certain number of cells.

00:15:55.177 --> 00:15:57.883
So that's quite striking,
but it's about numbers.

00:15:57.883 --> 00:15:59.962
There's a second readout
which is very important,

00:15:59.962 --> 00:16:01.499
which I've rather glossed over,

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:03.353
which is this what neurons do you make

00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:04.442
and when do you make them?

00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:06.378
So this idea of switching
from the early-born neurons

00:16:06.378 --> 00:16:08.225
to the late-born neurons I mentioned.

00:16:08.225 --> 00:16:09.961
And this was the thing I mentioned.

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:12.512
So we make layers, we mentioned this,

00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:15.497
but also the humans here switch to making

00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:18.977
these red guys much later than
the macaque do, for example.

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:21.376
And we can look at this as
well within these systems,

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.051
and again what we find is that,

00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:24.359
if you look at these pie charts,

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:27.161
this pie chart looks
identical to this pie chart.

00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:29.362
And what we're dong here
is putting human into human

00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:31.634
or human into macaque, or vice versa,

00:16:31.634 --> 00:16:33.847
macaque into human or
macaque into macaque.

00:16:33.847 --> 00:16:36.479
And essentially, the species don't care.

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:37.730
They're going to do what
they're going to do.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.034
They're sort of like my 11-year-old son,

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.351
in the sense that it doesn't
matter what environment,

00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:44.679
there's a certain amount of pigheadedness.

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:46.959
So what this mean is,

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.095
and I don't know where they get it from,

00:16:48.095 --> 00:16:50.978
I blame his mother. (laughter)

00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:55.421
Anyway, so what we've learned
from these kind of studies

00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:59.155
is that the primates do
development slightly differently.

00:16:59.155 --> 00:17:00.871
And I should say something
which I haven't had time

00:17:00.871 --> 00:17:02.810
to go into today, they
also do it differently

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.137
to small mammals like mice.

00:17:05.137 --> 00:17:07.090
So this idea that early
on you're expanding

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:08.762
your stem cells while making neurons,

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:11.856
that's quite different
compared to small mammals.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.537
So there's a big mammal problem

00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:15.339
in addition to the primate problem.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.673
And this is something which as a field

00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:19.036
we haven't really grappled with yet.

00:17:19.036 --> 00:17:20.352
There are such huge differences

00:17:20.352 --> 00:17:22.548
between the kind of
tools we use in the lab

00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:24.303
and the model organisms
we study in the lab,

00:17:24.303 --> 00:17:27.335
like mice, in terms of
their biology, and primates.

00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:29.602
That some of them aren't
to do with being primates,

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:31.984
they're to do with being large,
slowly-developing mammals

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.152
more than anything else.

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.869
But even within this difference,

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:36.809
what we find is that humans are different

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.811
to the smaller-brained primates.

00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:41.020
And that essentially these
differences that I mentioned

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.086
are all cell-autonomous.

00:17:43.086 --> 00:17:44.853
And what that then leaves us at,

00:17:44.853 --> 00:17:46.385
and this is where we are now is,

00:17:46.385 --> 00:17:48.027
this provides us with a platform

00:17:48.027 --> 00:17:49.589
to ask what are these mechanisms?

00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:51.953
How do we control what a stem cell does

00:17:51.953 --> 00:17:53.180
and how it does it?

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.643
And our goal is, if we can identify

00:17:54.643 --> 00:17:56.210
what those differences are,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.531
what those cell-intrinsic controls are,

00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.706
and clearly yes we all
think about genetics,

00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:01.953
and there is an element of that,

00:18:01.953 --> 00:18:03.954
but we have to be quite broad-minded

00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:07.219
about what the cell-intrinsic clocks are.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:09.445
Then looking at those
differences will give us insight

00:18:09.445 --> 00:18:13.469
into evolutionary differences
by thinking backwards.

00:18:13.469 --> 00:18:15.306
I should say there's
another side to this too,

00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:17.486
which is the mechanisms that control

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:19.842
differences between species of brain size

00:18:19.842 --> 00:18:22.485
are also very important
in two clinical contexts.

00:18:22.485 --> 00:18:24.354
One is control of brain
size developmentally,

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:25.673
which has a very strong impact

00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:28.756
on various intellectual disabilities,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.235
and the other side is obviously

00:18:32.235 --> 00:18:33.386
different kinds of brain cancer,

00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:35.952
because it's the same
biology there as well.

00:18:35.952 --> 00:18:36.874
So I'll just finish there,

00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:38.852
and just to say I mentioned this was led

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:42.318
by Tomoki Otani, who was
in the lab up til recently

00:18:42.318 --> 00:18:44.316
and is now with McKinsey in Tokyo,

00:18:44.316 --> 00:18:47.102
and is carried on by two other people

00:18:47.102 --> 00:18:48.766
within the lab that I've mentioned here.

00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:50.581
And just to say that none of this work

00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:53.420
would have been possible
without Ben, Rusty and Carol.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.680
So thank you very much.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.930
(applause)

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.135
Okay, the question that
we have been interested in

00:19:01.135 --> 00:19:03.920
over the past 25 or so years,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.975
is how do brains in evolution get bigger.

00:19:06.975 --> 00:19:10.486
And to put the question into
a bit more specific terms,

00:19:10.486 --> 00:19:14.013
what underlies the evolutionary increase

00:19:14.013 --> 00:19:17.454
in the number of neurons
that are generated

00:19:17.454 --> 00:19:19.662
in cortical development.

00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:21.296
And as you heard from
the previous speakers,

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:24.269
this reflects the
activity of cortical stem

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:26.634
and progenitor cells,

00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:30.654
and the answer how you get
more neurons formed is simple.

00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:33.369
All you need is an increased and prolonged

00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:36.918
proliferation of these
cortical stem cells.

00:19:36.918 --> 00:19:38.294
The tricky question is,

00:19:38.294 --> 00:19:41.569
what underlies the
differences across species?

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.736
Why do we have more neurons
than the macaque, or the chimp?

00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.286
Let me give you a very brief introduction

00:19:49.286 --> 00:19:50.420
to these stem cells.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.774
What you see here is a
developing mouse brain.

00:19:54.774 --> 00:19:57.654
And the neocortex, formed from a structure

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.636
called the dorsolateral telencephalon,

00:19:59.636 --> 00:20:01.510
that is shown here in the box.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.068
And shown here at greater magnification.

00:20:05.068 --> 00:20:07.958
And what has fascinated
me as a cell biologist

00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.520
over the years is that this cortical wall,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.086
this developing cortical
wall, has polarity.

00:20:14.086 --> 00:20:16.488
It has an apical side, as you
heard from previous speakers,

00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:18.501
and a basal side.

00:20:18.501 --> 00:20:20.537
And the process of making neurons

00:20:20.537 --> 00:20:24.069
is a strict apical-to-basal process.

00:20:24.069 --> 00:20:27.621
In which progenitors that form the primary

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:29.910
germinal layer, the ventricular zone,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.323
progenitors that we collectively call

00:20:32.323 --> 00:20:35.259
apical progenitors, but notably the apical

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:38.303
or ventricular radial glia,

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:40.558
these progenitors do
not make many neurons,

00:20:40.558 --> 00:20:44.620
but rather generate a
secondary class of progenitors

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.441
that form the secondary layer

00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:50.926
of the germinal zone called
the subventricular zone.

00:20:50.926 --> 00:20:53.359
We call these collectively
basal progenitors

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:55.165
and there are two major types.

00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:58.044
The basal, or outer, radial glia,

00:20:58.044 --> 00:21:00.916
and basal intermediate progenitors.

00:21:00.916 --> 00:21:04.236
In an important paper from
Collette Dehay and colleagues,

00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:08.096
it was shown that in more
highly developed brains,

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:12.036
the outer subventricular
zone is very characteristic,

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:16.668
and it is very highly populated
by basal radial glial cells.

00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:20.749
So these are the ones implicated
in cortical expansion.

00:21:20.749 --> 00:21:24.577
There is actually a cell
biological reason why

00:21:24.577 --> 00:21:28.836
these progenitors have
advantages to expand the cortex.

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:31.311
The apical progenitors,
because of their cell

00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:35.405
biological nature, can
divide only at the ventricle.

00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:37.836
And that's a very limited space.

00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:40.078
In contrast, the basal
progenitors can divide

00:21:40.078 --> 00:21:42.100
anywhere in the subventricular zone.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.547
They can thicken the subventricular zone,

00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:47.732
and this is a huge advantage
if one wants to maximize

00:21:47.732 --> 00:21:50.082
the number of cell divisions.

00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:53.268
This is the reason why
cortical expansion is linked

00:21:53.268 --> 00:21:57.815
to basal progenitor
abundance and proliferation.

00:21:57.815 --> 00:22:01.632
So a few years ago, we decided
then to embark on a search

00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:04.969
for human-specific genes
that would do two things,

00:22:04.969 --> 00:22:07.924
increase basal progenitor generation

00:22:07.924 --> 00:22:12.091
and also induce or promote
basal progenitor proliferation.

00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:15.972
And when I say we, I
talk about an outstanding

00:22:15.972 --> 00:22:19.055
PhD student in the lab, Marta Florio.

00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:25.084
What Marta has developed is
a cell biological approach

00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:29.004
to isolate these two major
classes of stem cells.

00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:31.999
This is a cartoon of the
developing cortical wall,

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:34.572
and you can label the
apical side with an antibody

00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:36.864
against a protein called Prominin-1,

00:22:36.864 --> 00:22:39.880
and the basal side with a
membrane dye that diffuses

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.770
into plasma membrane called DiI,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.665
and with this approach,
you get a dual labeling

00:22:45.665 --> 00:22:48.681
of the apical radial glia
and a single labeling

00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:52.848
of the basal radial glia such
that the aRG's will be blue

00:22:53.884 --> 00:22:58.249
and red, and the bRG's in
the mouse would only be red.

00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:00.716
Now the neurons would also be red,

00:23:00.716 --> 00:23:04.356
but in the mouse, you have
a transgenic mouse line

00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:06.755
where the neurons are, in addition, green,

00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:08.508
and we can sort them away.

00:23:08.508 --> 00:23:11.649
So we get relatively pure populations.

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:13.949
In humans, this is more complicated,

00:23:13.949 --> 00:23:16.950
and so we focused our attention
to those cells that had

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.423
duplicated the DNA, which
turns them into progenitors.

00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:22.836
So the aRG's are blue plus red,

00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:26.411
the bRG's are red only,
but please note that

00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:30.116
the bRG's in the G one phase
end off the cell cycle,

00:23:30.116 --> 00:23:32.188
so before they duplicate the DNA,

00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:36.636
what we recovered in the
neuron fraction shown here,

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:40.484
and in fact, we know that
about 10% of the cells

00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:44.084
in the neuron fraction are these cells.

00:23:44.084 --> 00:23:47.615
This will become important
as you will see in a minute.

00:23:47.615 --> 00:23:50.849
What Marta then did was she
isolated the cell populations

00:23:50.849 --> 00:23:54.500
and determined the transcriptome and

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.282
went for those genes
that are highly expressed

00:23:57.282 --> 00:24:01.449
in the stem cells and found a
total of about 400 such genes

00:24:03.172 --> 00:24:05.868
that were highly expressed
in the basal and apical

00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:08.868
radial glia, but very low in the neurons.

00:24:08.868 --> 00:24:11.813
She then eliminated from
these roughly 400 genes

00:24:11.813 --> 00:24:15.540
those which were also expressed
in the mouse stem cells,

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.432
which brought the number down to 266,

00:24:19.432 --> 00:24:22.700
and then of these, she again
eliminated those that are

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.300
also expressed in the human
neurons or human cortical plate,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.383
which brought the number down to 263.

00:24:30.556 --> 00:24:33.556
These 263 genes come in two classes.

00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:38.139
207 have an ortholog in the mouse genome,

00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:42.852
but the gene is not expressed
in the mouse stem cells.

00:24:42.852 --> 00:24:46.100
And 56 have no ortholog
in the mouse genome,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.379
but exist, of course, in the human genome.

00:24:48.379 --> 00:24:50.988
These were, for us, the
more interesting ones.

00:24:50.988 --> 00:24:54.498
And now remember that we
noticed by the approach

00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:58.665
of our way of isolating these
cells that 10% of the cells

00:24:59.692 --> 00:25:03.355
in the neuron fraction would
actually be the stem cells,

00:25:03.355 --> 00:25:06.300
the basal radial glia,
so we introduced another

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.140
filter and asked which of these 56 genes

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.882
is at least tenfold more highly expressed

00:25:12.882 --> 00:25:15.892
in the stem cells than the neurons,

00:25:15.892 --> 00:25:19.604
and amazingly, that reduced
the number down to one.

00:25:19.604 --> 00:25:23.400
This one gene has this
pattern of expression.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.133
It is highly expressed in the
apical and basal radial glia,

00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:29.292
and this is the
contamination, if you wish,

00:25:29.292 --> 00:25:33.599
of the bRG's in G one
in the neuron fraction.

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:37.230
This gene is called
ARHGAP11B, and as I said,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.268
it is specifically expressed
in human, but not mouse,

00:25:40.268 --> 00:25:44.382
apical and basal radial
glia, but not neurons.

00:25:44.382 --> 00:25:48.015
This gene is interesting
for several reasons.

00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:49.682
One is how it arose.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.504
It arose as was first
shown by Evan Eichler,

00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:56.272
who is actually here in the audience,

00:25:56.272 --> 00:26:00.813
as a product of a partial
duplication of a ubiquitous gene

00:26:00.813 --> 00:26:04.996
called ARHGAP11A, which
encodes a specific enzyme-like

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:09.115
protein called a Rho
GTPase activating protein.

00:26:09.115 --> 00:26:12.687
But it has, in contrast
to the mother gene,

00:26:12.687 --> 00:26:15.767
it does not have the GAP domain in full,

00:26:15.767 --> 00:26:19.735
but it has a novel sequence
here at the C terminal end of

00:26:19.735 --> 00:26:23.902
47 amino acids, which are
actually also specific to humans.

00:26:25.118 --> 00:26:29.272
Now this sequence comes
about because 55 nucleotides,

00:26:29.272 --> 00:26:33.196
shown here in purple,
which are present in 11A,

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:35.963
are actually not present in 11B,

00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:37.967
and this leads to a reading frame shift

00:26:37.967 --> 00:26:41.615
and this new green protein
sequence shown here.

00:26:41.615 --> 00:26:44.887
And the other reason why
this gene is interesting is

00:26:44.887 --> 00:26:47.072
when it arose in evolution.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:49.597
As was shown by Evan Eichler,
but also by my friend

00:26:49.597 --> 00:26:51.165
and colleague Svante Paabo,

00:26:51.165 --> 00:26:53.224
who cannot be here today, unfortunately,

00:26:53.224 --> 00:26:56.456
it arose about five million years ago,

00:26:56.456 --> 00:26:59.081
after the lineage that
leads to the chimpanzee

00:26:59.081 --> 00:27:02.352
segregated from the
lineage that leads to us,

00:27:02.352 --> 00:27:06.647
but before the lineage that
leads to the neanderthals

00:27:06.647 --> 00:27:09.693
segregated from the
lineage that leads to us,

00:27:09.693 --> 00:27:11.256
and as you know, neanderthal brains

00:27:11.256 --> 00:27:13.508
were at least as big as ours.

00:27:13.508 --> 00:27:16.489
So we have here a gene that is expressed

00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:19.623
in the right stem cell at the
right time of development,

00:27:19.623 --> 00:27:22.322
and that is only found in those hominids

00:27:22.322 --> 00:27:26.182
with one point three liter to
one point four liter brains.

00:27:26.182 --> 00:27:28.613
So the obvious question
was, would that gene

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:31.290
increase brain size or
increase neuron number

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.341
in the model system, the mouse?

00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:37.335
And this is what Marta investigated

00:27:37.335 --> 00:27:40.323
by expressing the gene by a technique

00:27:40.323 --> 00:27:43.255
that we call in utero electroporation,

00:27:43.255 --> 00:27:46.547
and to make a long story
short, what she found was

00:27:46.547 --> 00:27:48.627
that when you express
this human-specific gene

00:27:48.627 --> 00:27:51.315
in the mouse developing
neocortex, it triples the

00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:55.795
number of mitotically
active basal progenitors.

00:27:55.795 --> 00:27:59.962
So the progenitor is implicated
in neocortex expansion.

00:28:00.947 --> 00:28:02.554
So it increases these progenitors,

00:28:02.554 --> 00:28:04.979
but there are two ways how it can do that.

00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:07.547
Either you make more of these progenitors

00:28:07.547 --> 00:28:11.475
from the apical radial
glia, or you increase

00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:15.445
the proliferation of these
basal progenitors once formed.

00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:19.234
And we solve this, or
we studied this issue

00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:22.591
and made use of a method
that Elena Taverna developed.

00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:25.822
Elena, like Marta, is also from Milan,

00:28:25.822 --> 00:28:28.179
and you can believe me, these
are such outstanding people

00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:30.460
that whenever I get an
application from Milan,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.206
I accept it. (laughter)

00:28:33.206 --> 00:28:35.507
So what Elena developed was a technique

00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:39.379
where she microinjects
in organotypic slices

00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:41.198
into the apical radial glia.

00:28:41.198 --> 00:28:42.411
So here you'll see the slice,

00:28:42.411 --> 00:28:43.906
and here you'll see the pipette,

00:28:43.906 --> 00:28:45.869
and basically she injects blind,

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:48.506
but the pipette is filled
with fluorescent dextran,

00:28:48.506 --> 00:28:51.531
and so you can identify the injected cell

00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:54.004
and very accurately trace what happens

00:28:54.004 --> 00:28:56.043
to the daughter cells
and granddaughter cells

00:28:56.043 --> 00:28:59.673
of the cell after one cell
cycle or two cell cycles,

00:28:59.673 --> 00:29:02.236
and what Elena could show,
and I'll just summarize

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:03.840
these data, is the following.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.859
She showed that when you stick
in this human-specific gene,

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:11.474
you will change the mode
of division of the aRG cell

00:29:11.474 --> 00:29:13.827
to a style where it immediately gives rise

00:29:13.827 --> 00:29:16.203
to two basal progenitors.

00:29:16.203 --> 00:29:18.858
That is good, but it's also bad

00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:22.023
unless these basal progenitors
would keep on dividing,

00:29:22.023 --> 00:29:25.423
and that is, in fact, the second
thing that ARHGAP11B does.

00:29:25.423 --> 00:29:27.991
Normally in the mouse, one
of these basal progenitors

00:29:27.991 --> 00:29:31.315
will make two neurons, but
in the presence of 11B,

00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:34.148
it will now keep on proliferating.

00:29:35.075 --> 00:29:37.379
So this is what we found in the mouse.

00:29:37.379 --> 00:29:41.404
Nereo Kalebic very recently
expressed this human-specific

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:43.935
gene not in the mouse but in the ferret,

00:29:43.935 --> 00:29:46.925
a carnivore with a folded brain.

00:29:46.925 --> 00:29:51.189
And when he does that, he
found that also in the ferret,

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:55.477
11B massively increases
the basal progenitors,

00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:58.807
but interestingly, it very
dramatically increases the

00:29:58.807 --> 00:30:02.172
basal radial glia, which is
not what happened in the mouse.

00:30:02.172 --> 00:30:04.895
But in the ferret, it
increases the relevant

00:30:04.895 --> 00:30:06.728
basal progenitor type.

00:30:08.495 --> 00:30:11.399
And importantly, these
basal radial glial cells

00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:15.507
have markers that are very
characteristic of the human state

00:30:15.507 --> 00:30:19.111
rather than the mouse
state or the ferret state.

00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:21.631
So the other question we
ask is whether 11B can

00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:24.175
induce folding of the mouse neocortex,

00:30:24.175 --> 00:30:26.949
which normally is an unfolded brain.

00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:29.981
So when we electroporate, we
have always a control side

00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:32.660
which is smooth as shown here,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.495
and then we can stick it in the gene,

00:30:34.495 --> 00:30:37.806
and we see where it is
expressed by the green color,

00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:39.838
and when we look five days after sticking

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.096
this human-specific gene into
a developing mouse brain,

00:30:43.096 --> 00:30:46.582
we actually see that folds
can arise in about half

00:30:46.582 --> 00:30:50.553
of the embryos that are
expressing this gene,

00:30:50.553 --> 00:30:53.466
and here is another
case where you have the

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:56.048
electroporated area,
and you see these folds

00:30:56.048 --> 00:30:58.428
in the mouse developing cortex,

00:30:58.428 --> 00:31:00.615
which are somewhat
reminiscent of the folds

00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:04.448
that happen in a fetal
human brain shown here.

00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:08.342
Question is, how does 11B
achieve these effects?

00:31:08.342 --> 00:31:10.880
Is it like the gene from which it arose,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.213
11A, a RhoGAP question mark?

00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:17.412
And so a post-doc fantastic
poster from Japan,

00:31:17.412 --> 00:31:20.177
Takashi Namba took on that question,

00:31:20.177 --> 00:31:23.736
made various constructs,
the mother gene, 11A,

00:31:23.736 --> 00:31:27.903
a full GAP domain of 11A, a
truncated GAP domain of 11B,

00:31:28.926 --> 00:31:32.843
and a modern 11B form,
and asked which of these

00:31:33.746 --> 00:31:37.148
exhibits RhoGAP activity,
and the answer is

00:31:37.148 --> 00:31:40.165
these upper two ones do,
and these bottom ones,

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.915
including 11B do not.

00:31:42.854 --> 00:31:46.521
And we actually know
that the ability of 11B

00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:51.920
to amplify basal progenitors
is tightly linked

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.087
to the existence of this new
green human-specific sequence.

00:31:57.531 --> 00:32:00.766
Question then was can
the evolutionary increase

00:32:00.766 --> 00:32:04.599
in brain size in us be
explained by ARHGAP11B?

00:32:06.038 --> 00:32:08.989
And then we have a
problem because as I said,

00:32:08.989 --> 00:32:11.534
even Eichler and Svante
showed that this gene

00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:13.790
arose about five million years ago,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:17.176
but at five million years
ago, our brains were small.

00:32:17.176 --> 00:32:20.578
The big increase in
brain size happens later,

00:32:20.578 --> 00:32:24.175
but we now have at least
an interesting possibility

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:26.342
of explaining this enigma.

00:32:27.834 --> 00:32:30.498
And this has to do with
the question how this loss

00:32:30.498 --> 00:32:34.141
of the 55 nucleotides that
gives rise to the reading

00:32:34.141 --> 00:32:38.842
frame shift and the new
sequence actually comes about.

00:32:38.842 --> 00:32:41.358
When we started this
work, we thought that as

00:32:41.358 --> 00:32:45.541
the gene duplicated, these
55 nucleotides got lost

00:32:45.541 --> 00:32:48.109
at the level of the genomic DNA,

00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:49.546
but when we looked more closely,

00:32:49.546 --> 00:32:53.210
we actually noticed that
the genomic DNA of 11B

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.977
contains these 55 nucleotides.

00:32:55.977 --> 00:32:58.978
What's happening is something
much more interesting.

00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:03.009
What you see here is on the
top, the sequence of 11A,

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:04.759
and this is the splice donor site,

00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:07.722
the site where one
coding sequence is moved

00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:10.835
and spliced onto the next one.

00:33:10.835 --> 00:33:15.002
Now in 11B, there is a
point mutation, a C to a G,

00:33:16.317 --> 00:33:19.456
which creates a new splice donor site,

00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:22.312
and when this is taken,
the 55 nucleotides here

00:33:22.312 --> 00:33:26.287
are removed, and that induces
the shift in the reading frame

00:33:26.287 --> 00:33:29.853
because it truncates the
coding region of axon five,

00:33:29.853 --> 00:33:33.851
and when that's spliced
together to a messenger RNA,

00:33:33.851 --> 00:33:36.083
then you get a new protein sequence,

00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:38.938
so this human-specific
sequence is caused by

00:33:38.938 --> 00:33:42.171
a single nucleotide splice mutation.

00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:45.308
This raised a very
interesting explanation,

00:33:45.308 --> 00:33:47.983
or at least a possibility,
and that is that

00:33:47.983 --> 00:33:51.348
ARHGAP11B arose with a full GAP domain

00:33:51.348 --> 00:33:55.099
and having this activity
five million years ago,

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:57.637
and then later, but
before the neanderthals

00:33:57.637 --> 00:33:59.616
branched off from our lineage,

00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:02.452
later this point mutation takes place

00:34:02.452 --> 00:34:04.790
which gives this protein a new function,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.090
or this gene a new function.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.052
So Marta investigated this possibility

00:34:10.052 --> 00:34:14.583
by creating what we call
an ancestral ARHGAP11B.

00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:17.932
So it is a gene that is
essentially the C DNA

00:34:17.932 --> 00:34:21.571
that is essentially
identical to modern 11B,

00:34:21.571 --> 00:34:24.667
except that it doesn't
have the G but the C.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:26.882
So it cannot make the green sequence,

00:34:26.882 --> 00:34:29.699
but makes this kind of a protein.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.725
And we then ask the question
will this ancestral 11B

00:34:33.725 --> 00:34:36.222
exhibit RhoGAP activity?

00:34:36.222 --> 00:34:39.171
And so Takashi again
made various constructs

00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:42.867
and tested the possible
activity in an assay

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:46.236
in which a decrease in phosphorylation is

00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:48.736
indicative of RhoGAP activity.

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:53.956
And as you can see,
the modern 11B does not

00:34:53.956 --> 00:34:58.115
exhibit RhoGAP activity,
but the ancestral 11B,

00:34:58.115 --> 00:35:01.365
like the 11A, exhibits RhoGAP activity.

00:35:02.771 --> 00:35:07.650
Next question then was would
this ARHGAP11B increase

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:12.048
basal progenitors and again
by in utero electroporation

00:35:12.048 --> 00:35:15.794
into mice, in contrast to the modern 11B,

00:35:15.794 --> 00:35:18.616
which increases basal progenitors,

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:21.699
the ancestral 11B is unable to do so.

00:35:22.835 --> 00:35:26.874
So we have a rather interesting
situation as follows.

00:35:26.874 --> 00:35:30.291
We have a single C to G base substitution

00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:36.083
which creates a new
splice donor site in 11B.

00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:39.346
That leads to the loss
of the 55 nucleotides

00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:41.763
as the messenger RNA is made.

00:35:42.924 --> 00:35:45.835
That causes a reading frame shift.

00:35:45.835 --> 00:35:49.750
That leads to a human-specific
coax terminal sequence

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.917
that is key for basal progenitor
amplification, we believe.

00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:59.034
So if ARHGAP11B should have
contributed to the increase

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.566
in the evolutionary increase
in brain size in humans

00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:06.803
and neanderthals, it would have done so

00:36:06.803 --> 00:36:09.053
by a single point mutation.

00:36:10.483 --> 00:36:12.234
And with that, I would
just like to acknowledge

00:36:12.234 --> 00:36:16.150
my collaborators Marta, who
is now a post-doc in Boston

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.602
with significant help from Mareike Albert,

00:36:18.602 --> 00:36:22.349
Takashi Namba, and Elena
Taverna, and Nereo Kalebic,

00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:25.017
who did the ferret work
that I briefly mentioned.

00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:29.349
This is Dresden at night, and
these are people in my lab

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:31.000
I didn't have time to mention.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.933
These are people who have left the lab.

00:36:33.933 --> 00:36:36.100
This is the famous Semper Opera.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.757
I am not over time yet, I noticed.

00:36:37.757 --> 00:36:38.968
(laughter)

00:36:38.968 --> 00:36:41.151
And we have the good
fortune of collaborating

00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:45.307
with Svante Paabo, very
beautiful collaboration with him.

00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:47.730
The fetal tissue was given
to us by Robert Lachmann

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.371
and Pauline Wimberger,
and we have a lot of pine

00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:52.539
for medic support from Michael Hiller.

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:55.119
And these are present collaborators

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:57.297
outside of Glasten in Leipzig.

00:36:57.297 --> 00:37:00.564
And this is the reconstructed
church in Glasten,

00:37:00.564 --> 00:37:03.663
and I don't mention this
people's work on prominent,

00:37:03.663 --> 00:37:05.487
but I would like to
acknowledge our support

00:37:05.487 --> 00:37:08.038
by the Max Planck Society, the
German Research Foundation,

00:37:08.038 --> 00:37:09.967
and the European Research Council,

00:37:09.967 --> 00:37:11.719
and with that, I thank
you for your attention,

00:37:11.719 --> 00:37:13.840
and I am curious which
questions you will write down.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.567
(applause)

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.846
My job at the beginning at
least is a little simplified

00:37:19.846 --> 00:37:22.919
because of the talks
you've heard from already,

00:37:22.919 --> 00:37:26.086
especially from Rick and from Wieland.

00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:29.629
As you all are well aware,
the human brain is the largest

00:37:29.629 --> 00:37:32.671
among primates, living primates.

00:37:32.671 --> 00:37:33.975
I just wanted to emphasize it's not

00:37:33.975 --> 00:37:36.315
the largest mammal brain.

00:37:36.315 --> 00:37:38.964
Elephants and whales and
cetaceans have larger,

00:37:38.964 --> 00:37:41.981
and also more highly
folded cerebral cortices,

00:37:41.981 --> 00:37:45.071
but in terms of brain number
in the cerebral cortex,

00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:48.198
neuron number, humans have
the largest total number.

00:37:48.198 --> 00:37:51.429
So my area of interest,
similar to Wieland's is,

00:37:51.429 --> 00:37:54.935
one of the more obvious
features of the human brain

00:37:54.935 --> 00:37:57.055
is its size and the number of cells,

00:37:57.055 --> 00:37:59.031
and that brings us right to the issue of

00:37:59.031 --> 00:38:01.382
where they all come from, which has been,

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:02.865
as you hear, a sort of interesting problem

00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:05.487
or central problem for many of us.

00:38:05.487 --> 00:38:08.401
The developmental stages
are clearly where we'll

00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:10.364
find the answer to how that happens,

00:38:10.364 --> 00:38:13.013
and in my lab, we've been
looking at human brain

00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:15.551
development through the second trimester,

00:38:15.551 --> 00:38:18.498
which is when most cortical
neurons are developed.

00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:21.487
Cross section through the
developing cortex looks

00:38:21.487 --> 00:38:22.919
very different in humans than it does,

00:38:22.919 --> 00:38:25.678
for example in a mouse,
which is the animal system

00:38:25.678 --> 00:38:28.165
that most neuroscientists
have used to study

00:38:28.165 --> 00:38:30.631
early stages of brain development.

00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:32.382
So this is the cross section of the mouse,

00:38:32.382 --> 00:38:33.702
and you heard from
Wieland very beautifully

00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:36.615
how there are apical progenitors
which we call radial glia,

00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:39.165
shown here in red, marked by Sox2,

00:38:39.165 --> 00:38:41.665
one of the transcription
factors that they express,

00:38:41.665 --> 00:38:43.328
and their daughter cells are these

00:38:43.328 --> 00:38:45.855
intermediate progenitors
that line up right above them

00:38:45.855 --> 00:38:47.687
in this subventricular zone.

00:38:47.687 --> 00:38:49.606
The beginning, the middle,
and the end of neurogenesis

00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:51.783
in the mouse looks just like that.

00:38:51.783 --> 00:38:54.223
In the human, it starts
out very similarly.

00:38:54.223 --> 00:38:56.365
There are radial glial cells
and intermediate progenitors

00:38:56.365 --> 00:38:58.582
forming these two layers,

00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:01.151
but then very rapidly,
the subventricular zone

00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:04.111
undergoes this enormous
expansion that you've heard about

00:39:04.111 --> 00:39:07.246
and becomes an outer
subventricular zone shown here,

00:39:07.246 --> 00:39:09.615
and all these colors represent
cells that are cycling.

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:11.615
They're producing daughter cells.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:13.455
You may notice the
ventricular zone at this stage

00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:15.748
becomes very small, and so the majority

00:39:15.748 --> 00:39:18.593
of cortical neurons at these
stages almost certainly

00:39:18.593 --> 00:39:22.077
are coming from this zone,
not from the ventricular zone.

00:39:22.077 --> 00:39:23.997
And moreover, this isn't
the end of neurogenesis.

00:39:23.997 --> 00:39:26.735
This is half-way through gestation week 17

00:39:26.735 --> 00:39:28.687
when the middle layers are being formed.

00:39:28.687 --> 00:39:30.825
So the middle and upper
cortical layers are

00:39:30.825 --> 00:39:33.068
presumably being generated by the cells in

00:39:33.068 --> 00:39:35.259
this outer subventricular zone.

00:39:35.259 --> 00:39:36.979
But the actual nature of those progenitors

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:39.838
really haven't been studied,
and so we looked at it

00:39:39.838 --> 00:39:41.501
in a variety of ways.

00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:44.242
First I want to show you
how dynamic this area is.

00:39:44.242 --> 00:39:46.577
In this case, we're looking at
the outer subventricular zone

00:39:46.577 --> 00:39:48.611
in a slice culture where we've labeled

00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:51.320
just the progenitor cells in green,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.621
so there are neurons we don't see.

00:39:52.621 --> 00:39:55.274
But the progenitors are highly dynamic.

00:39:55.274 --> 00:39:56.827
When we look at them more carefully,

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.857
we find two classes, and
one that I really want

00:39:58.857 --> 00:40:00.347
to emphasize is this one.

00:40:00.347 --> 00:40:03.055
It's a radial glia-like cell.

00:40:03.055 --> 00:40:05.259
It has a process that goes
up to the pia surface,

00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:06.707
which is the basal fiber,

00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:08.266
but it doesn't have an apical contact

00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:10.765
with the ventricle the
way the epithelial cells

00:40:10.765 --> 00:40:13.865
or the ventricular or
apical radial glia do.

00:40:13.865 --> 00:40:16.006
Otherwise it looks just
like a radial glial cell.

00:40:16.006 --> 00:40:18.344
It stains with all the markers
that you normally would see

00:40:18.344 --> 00:40:20.771
in radial glial cells,
and if you back-fill

00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:24.232
the surface of the cortex
with a label like this,

00:40:24.232 --> 00:40:27.424
the DiI crystal, it fills
the fibers of these cells

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:31.265
that end in cell bodies in
the outer subventricular zone.

00:40:31.265 --> 00:40:33.358
These cells hadn't been
described at the time,

00:40:33.358 --> 00:40:37.123
so we call them outer subventricular
radial glia-like cells

00:40:37.123 --> 00:40:39.089
or ORG cells, and as you heard,

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:41.224
Wieland calls them basal radial glia.

00:40:41.224 --> 00:40:43.488
They're the same cell
type, and they're enriched,

00:40:43.488 --> 00:40:47.856
it turns out, in the
human developing brain.

00:40:47.856 --> 00:40:49.544
Now we've looked at them dynamically,

00:40:49.544 --> 00:40:52.905
and were struck by a behavior
that hadn't been seen before.

00:40:52.905 --> 00:40:55.712
These are four of the
cells that are labeled

00:40:55.712 --> 00:40:59.295
in one slice of cortex,
and as they divide,

00:41:00.738 --> 00:41:03.037
you may notice how they
sort of jump and divide,

00:41:03.037 --> 00:41:04.911
and if you didn't notice
it in those images,

00:41:04.911 --> 00:41:07.792
I hope you'll be able to
see it in this single cell.

00:41:07.792 --> 00:41:09.728
Because as they go through M phase,

00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:12.247
the actual cytokinesis
stage when they divide,

00:41:12.247 --> 00:41:14.473
they jump first and then undergo this

00:41:14.473 --> 00:41:16.806
cell division or cytokinesis.

00:41:16.806 --> 00:41:18.896
Very distinctive behavior
that hadn't been described

00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:22.760
before, and so we called it
mitotic somal translocation, MST

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.338
and it was one of the defining
features of these cells

00:41:26.338 --> 00:41:28.722
because there were no specific
markers that we could use

00:41:28.722 --> 00:41:30.739
to distinguish them from the traditional

00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:33.206
ventricular radial glia.

00:41:33.206 --> 00:41:34.607
But when we looked for
them in other species,

00:41:34.607 --> 00:41:37.607
and this is in the mouse,
we found them there as well,

00:41:37.607 --> 00:41:40.848
and if you watch the cell,
it's what we call now

00:41:40.848 --> 00:41:43.494
a mouse outer radial glial cell,

00:41:43.494 --> 00:41:45.952
and you see it goes through a little jump,

00:41:45.952 --> 00:41:48.217
much more modest than the human cells.

00:41:48.217 --> 00:41:50.089
It has this basal fiber, and it's located

00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:52.606
in the subventricular
zone if the mouse had

00:41:52.606 --> 00:41:54.631
a subventricular zone.

00:41:54.631 --> 00:41:57.079
So these cells are present in
small numbers in the mouse,

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:00.176
and are usually expanded in primates,

00:42:00.176 --> 00:42:02.592
and especially in humans.

00:42:02.592 --> 00:42:03.703
Are they neurogenic?

00:42:03.703 --> 00:42:05.204
Do they actually make neurons?

00:42:05.204 --> 00:42:07.752
And to test that, we
actually dissociated cells

00:42:07.752 --> 00:42:10.388
from the progenitor
zones, labeled them with

00:42:10.388 --> 00:42:14.351
a virus marker that actually
just infected progenitors,

00:42:14.351 --> 00:42:17.508
and then put a single progenitor
in each multi-well place,

00:42:17.508 --> 00:42:19.740
and here's an example of a
single one of the progenitors

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.172
in this well, and a higher
magnification view is there.

00:42:23.172 --> 00:42:25.523
Then we time-lapse imaged the behavior,

00:42:25.523 --> 00:42:27.418
and you could identify
the outer radial glia

00:42:27.418 --> 00:42:28.867
by their first division.

00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:30.724
They put out a primary
process just like they would

00:42:30.724 --> 00:42:33.508
in in situ, and then
they jumped and divided,

00:42:33.508 --> 00:42:38.302
and that made that cell classified
as an outer radial glia.

00:42:38.302 --> 00:42:40.092
We had other cells that
rounded up and divided.

00:42:40.092 --> 00:42:41.485
Those were the intermediate progenitors,

00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:43.899
and we looked seven weeks later in culture

00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:45.276
at what the clones were like.

00:42:45.276 --> 00:42:48.172
What does a single outer radial glia cell

00:42:48.172 --> 00:42:50.668
actually produce, at least in vitro?

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.476
And the answer was really surprising.

00:42:52.476 --> 00:42:54.556
The cells I showed you, after seven weeks,

00:42:54.556 --> 00:42:56.988
have produced a clone
of at least 700 cells,

00:42:56.988 --> 00:42:58.643
which included neurons of both

00:42:58.643 --> 00:43:01.035
deeper and upper cortical layers.

00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:02.699
And in this clone, there
were no astrocytes,

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:05.136
and some of the clones that
were additionally astrocytes

00:43:05.136 --> 00:43:09.540
plus neurons, and this is
an enormous output of cells.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.788
If we do the same experiment
with a radial glial cell

00:43:11.788 --> 00:43:16.108
in a mouse, we get 20 to 40
cells after a month or so.

00:43:16.108 --> 00:43:20.334
So 700 to 1000 cells from a
single outer radial glial cell,

00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:24.045
I think underscores how
enormously proliferative

00:43:24.045 --> 00:43:25.485
these cells are.

00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:28.140
And so it helps support this model

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.859
which is still a work in progress

00:43:29.859 --> 00:43:31.636
of what we think makes
human cortical development

00:43:31.636 --> 00:43:33.701
distinct from say the mouse.

00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:36.872
And in the ventricular and
subventricular zones shown here,

00:43:36.872 --> 00:43:40.052
we think cells in human behave
very much like the mouse,

00:43:40.052 --> 00:43:42.660
but what makes the human so distinct

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.419
is the outer subventricular zone,

00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:46.306
which is filled with
these outer radial glia

00:43:46.306 --> 00:43:48.217
which are born initially
from the ventricular zone

00:43:48.217 --> 00:43:51.619
and move away, and they
go through these multiple

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:53.740
self-renewing asymmetrical divisions,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.786
producing these daughters,
shown here in green,

00:43:56.786 --> 00:43:59.556
which are transit
amplifying progenitor cells,

00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:02.508
and they actually divide
symmetrically at least twice.

00:44:02.508 --> 00:44:04.292
We know they do that more than once,

00:44:04.292 --> 00:44:06.519
producing clones of cells which then have

00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:08.369
the same birthdate and migrate, therefore,

00:44:08.369 --> 00:44:10.075
to the same cortical layer.

00:44:10.075 --> 00:44:12.619
And over time, one of these
ORG cells will produce

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:16.571
multiple clones of cells in
multiple different layers.

00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.508
And the radial fibers
support neuronal migration.

00:44:19.508 --> 00:44:22.234
So that allows an increase
in the cortical size

00:44:22.234 --> 00:44:24.269
tangentially as well as radially.

00:44:24.269 --> 00:44:25.523
So we think this cell is very important

00:44:25.523 --> 00:44:27.802
for cortical expansion
both developmentally,

00:44:27.802 --> 00:44:31.635
as shown here, and also
in evolutionary terms.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.922
But as I said, we had no
markers for these cells.

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:37.187
We had no real idea of
what made them distinct

00:44:37.187 --> 00:44:39.692
molecularly from the
ventricular radial glia

00:44:39.692 --> 00:44:41.719
for example in the mouse.

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:43.586
So we took as an approach for this

00:44:43.586 --> 00:44:45.387
is single cell RNA sequencing.

00:44:45.387 --> 00:44:48.634
So we dissociated early cells, shown here,

00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:50.947
took those individual
cells and collected them

00:44:50.947 --> 00:44:55.114
in microliter tiny little
nano-sized capture sites

00:44:59.385 --> 00:45:01.036
in a chip, a microfluidic chip

00:45:01.036 --> 00:45:03.875
which is made by Fluidyne Corporation,

00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:06.002
and when they're captured
in these little sites,

00:45:06.002 --> 00:45:09.187
you can then do lysis
and reverse transcription

00:45:09.187 --> 00:45:11.659
and amplify them and
then sequence the genes

00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:13.915
for each individual cell.

00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:15.702
And that's an unbiased way,
that is we take all comers

00:45:15.702 --> 00:45:19.153
and see what those gene
differences look like.

00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:21.187
Here is an example of a heed map

00:45:21.187 --> 00:45:23.387
where we have the cells in all these rows

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.352
and genes in columns, and
you can see how they cluster

00:45:26.352 --> 00:45:28.421
according to the genes that they express,

00:45:28.421 --> 00:45:31.903
and that allows us to identify
molecular characteristics

00:45:31.903 --> 00:45:34.569
of specific cell types.

00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:36.236
And just to look at
some of the progenitors,

00:45:36.236 --> 00:45:38.109
and this is when we first
did our initial study

00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:41.421
of about 300 cells that
were captured this way,

00:45:41.421 --> 00:45:43.830
we can see three different cell states.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.173
Here in the lower left are
the radial glial genes,

00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:49.341
the ones that are the most
enriched in radial glial cells.

00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:51.373
In the brackets are the
intermediate progenitors,

00:45:51.373 --> 00:45:53.173
which are the daughters
of the radial glia,

00:45:53.173 --> 00:45:55.084
and then here on the
right on the upper side

00:45:55.084 --> 00:45:58.708
are the enriched genes mostly
in young immature neurons.

00:45:58.708 --> 00:46:00.484
What this shows us is that some genes

00:46:00.484 --> 00:46:03.168
that are initially
expressed in the radial glia

00:46:03.168 --> 00:46:05.005
persist in their daughter cells,

00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:07.196
the intermediate progenitors,
and genes that are expressed

00:46:07.196 --> 00:46:10.701
in those progenitors persist
as neurons are produced.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.907
This is very useful in a
way because it helps us

00:46:12.907 --> 00:46:15.122
watch the lineage of each of these cells.

00:46:15.122 --> 00:46:17.860
So an example shown here actually confirms

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.970
what we saw from the time-lapse imaging.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.508
Radial glial cells shown here on the left

00:46:21.508 --> 00:46:23.740
producing intermediate progenitors

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.690
which then generate neurons,
and these are some of the genes

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.106
both known and new genes expressed

00:46:28.106 --> 00:46:30.299
at each of these different stages.

00:46:30.299 --> 00:46:32.331
We confirm the expression of the new genes

00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:35.202
by in situ hybridization
shown here in slices.

00:46:35.202 --> 00:46:37.511
Genes that we predict would
be expressed in radial glia

00:46:37.511 --> 00:46:39.362
are located here at the ventricle.

00:46:39.362 --> 00:46:41.267
Genes expressed in
intermediate progenitors

00:46:41.267 --> 00:46:44.187
or radial glia are expressed here,

00:46:44.187 --> 00:46:46.563
and then the neural genes are expressed

00:46:46.563 --> 00:46:48.394
in the cortical plate.

00:46:48.394 --> 00:46:52.356
Now not only did this give
us an idea of the transition

00:46:52.356 --> 00:46:55.482
or lineage of cell types,
but it gave us insight into

00:46:55.482 --> 00:46:58.365
activated gene networks that
might actually be signaling

00:46:58.365 --> 00:47:00.095
individual cell types, and to focus on the

00:47:00.095 --> 00:47:02.922
outer radial glia for this talk.

00:47:02.922 --> 00:47:05.997
These are all schematically shown genes

00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:08.770
that are coherent in networks
expressed exclusively

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.600
by outer radial glia at
these developmental stages,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.381
and one of those gene
networks and pathways

00:47:15.381 --> 00:47:17.797
is the LIFR STAT3 signaling pathway

00:47:17.797 --> 00:47:19.996
known to most stem cell biologists

00:47:19.996 --> 00:47:22.649
as an important self-renewal pathway.

00:47:22.649 --> 00:47:24.419
So we find that these
outer radial glia cells

00:47:24.419 --> 00:47:26.565
are actually able to self-renew themselves

00:47:26.565 --> 00:47:28.201
and create their own niche.

00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:31.332
If we inhibit this pathway,
as shown here on these graphs

00:47:31.332 --> 00:47:33.532
on the lower right, we
significantly inhibit

00:47:33.532 --> 00:47:36.427
the generation of the radial glial cells,

00:47:36.427 --> 00:47:38.196
but not the intermediate progenitors,

00:47:38.196 --> 00:47:40.186
or for that matter, the
ventricular radial glia.

00:47:40.186 --> 00:47:42.491
So it's selective to this one cell type.

00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:44.905
And it helps support an idea shown here

00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:48.080
that distinguishes the
human from the mouse.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.666
In the mouse, as you
know, as we just heard,

00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:53.138
they have radial glial cells
and intermediate progenitors

00:47:53.138 --> 00:47:54.954
and the radial glial
cells line the ventricle

00:47:54.954 --> 00:47:56.932
where they can receive
trophic factor signaling

00:47:56.932 --> 00:47:59.557
from the CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.

00:47:59.557 --> 00:48:02.178
In the outer subventricular
zone, the cells

00:48:02.178 --> 00:48:04.357
have actually moved
away from the ventricle,

00:48:04.357 --> 00:48:07.036
and they're not able to
access the growth factors

00:48:07.036 --> 00:48:09.994
in the CSF, but instead,
they develop their own

00:48:09.994 --> 00:48:11.358
signaling pathways.

00:48:11.358 --> 00:48:12.962
They can produce their own growth factors,

00:48:12.962 --> 00:48:14.375
and they create their own niche

00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:16.875
for self-renewal and expansion.

00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:18.776
We think that that is one
of the reasons, of course,

00:48:18.776 --> 00:48:20.674
that these cells were able to undergo

00:48:20.674 --> 00:48:23.761
the kind of prolonged
and massive proliferation

00:48:23.761 --> 00:48:27.778
that I've shown you and that
Wieland mentioned earlier.

00:48:27.778 --> 00:48:30.192
We've also gotten some
insights into diseases,

00:48:30.192 --> 00:48:32.298
and I just want to mention
two of them very quickly.

00:48:32.298 --> 00:48:33.907
One of them is this.

00:48:33.907 --> 00:48:36.391
And as I've just mentioned,
these outer radial glial cells

00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:38.562
make their own niche, and
they have factors that

00:48:38.562 --> 00:48:42.196
promote self-renewal, and when
we looked at all these genes

00:48:42.196 --> 00:48:43.711
in the literature, we
found that they'd all been

00:48:43.711 --> 00:48:46.282
reported earlier or already discovered

00:48:46.282 --> 00:48:48.541
in this particular kind of tumor,

00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.938
the glioblastoma multiforme,
which is a terrible

00:48:50.938 --> 00:48:54.457
and inoperable brain
tumor found in adults,

00:48:54.457 --> 00:48:56.503
not in children.

00:48:56.503 --> 00:48:57.957
But when we look
carefully at the published

00:48:57.957 --> 00:49:00.250
single cell heed maps, like this one,

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:04.141
for radial glial genes,
rather for genes that are

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.774
expressed in tumors as
well as radial glia,

00:49:06.774 --> 00:49:09.194
we cross those reference points,

00:49:09.194 --> 00:49:13.194
we found that in fact, the
most aggressive glioblastomas

00:49:13.194 --> 00:49:15.194
were enriched in the
same genes that we found

00:49:15.194 --> 00:49:17.824
in the outer radial glial cells.

00:49:17.824 --> 00:49:20.941
They had apparently an
outer radial glial signature

00:49:20.941 --> 00:49:24.497
in the most aggressive
grade of glioblastoma.

00:49:24.497 --> 00:49:27.058
So then we looked in surgical specimens

00:49:27.058 --> 00:49:29.239
that we got from our colleagues at UCSF,

00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:31.613
sectioned and stained, and cultured them

00:49:31.613 --> 00:49:33.836
just like we had primary tissue,

00:49:33.836 --> 00:49:35.978
and shown here are glioblastoma cells

00:49:35.978 --> 00:49:37.605
from one of the patients.

00:49:37.605 --> 00:49:39.948
And focus your attention on this cell

00:49:39.948 --> 00:49:42.031
as it undergoes division.

00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:45.164
I hope you can see it.

00:49:45.164 --> 00:49:45.997
Yeah, there it is.

00:49:45.997 --> 00:49:47.173
Watch that one.

00:49:47.173 --> 00:49:48.378
Here we go.

00:49:48.378 --> 00:49:50.331
Right, so you may have
noticed how it jumped

00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:53.748
and divided exactly like
the fetal cells do in situ.

00:49:53.748 --> 00:49:56.220
So it looks as if we have
outer radial glial cells

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.819
in these glioblastomas
and in fact, that work has

00:49:58.819 --> 00:50:01.564
progressed to the point where
we now have good evidence

00:50:01.564 --> 00:50:04.626
that these may be the cells of origin for

00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:07.948
these very aggressive glioblastoma tumors.

00:50:07.948 --> 00:50:10.866
The next slide, which has
to do with microcephaly,

00:50:10.866 --> 00:50:12.394
and microcephaly, of
course, is a condition

00:50:12.394 --> 00:50:14.961
where the brain is orders
of magnitude smaller

00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:16.508
than it would normally be.

00:50:16.508 --> 00:50:20.177
The most dramatic cases
of this occurred in Brazil

00:50:20.177 --> 00:50:22.932
last summer when there was an outbreak

00:50:22.932 --> 00:50:25.068
of Zika-induced microcephaly,

00:50:25.068 --> 00:50:28.147
but initially it wasn't
clear that the Zika virus

00:50:28.147 --> 00:50:30.530
was producing the microcephaly.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.052
We were struck by the fact that literature

00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:35.409
suggested there was one specific factor

00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:38.764
that mediated the entry of
the Zika virus into the skin,

00:50:38.764 --> 00:50:41.678
and that was something
called the AXL receptor.

00:50:41.678 --> 00:50:44.512
And our data set from
the outer radial glia

00:50:44.512 --> 00:50:45.762
that we've been talking
about and the other cells

00:50:45.762 --> 00:50:48.028
in the developing brain
shown here for all of the

00:50:48.028 --> 00:50:51.964
receptors known to mediate
entry of flaviviruses.

00:50:51.964 --> 00:50:53.964
And the Zika virus uses
the ones shown here

00:50:53.964 --> 00:50:56.528
with the black dots to
get into other cell types.

00:50:56.528 --> 00:50:59.299
And I'll emphasize that the AXL receptor,

00:50:59.299 --> 00:51:01.900
which mediates Zika
entry into other cells is

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:06.066
highly enriched, but only in
certain cells in our data set.

00:51:06.066 --> 00:51:07.795
Shown here it's enriched in astrocytes,

00:51:07.795 --> 00:51:10.763
in radial glial cells, not
intermediate progenitors,

00:51:10.763 --> 00:51:12.580
not in neurons, not in interneurons,

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.026
and also in microglia and endothelium.

00:51:16.026 --> 00:51:18.515
It has a very specific
pattern of expression,

00:51:18.515 --> 00:51:20.004
which we predicted might be the

00:51:20.004 --> 00:51:22.484
tropism of the virus as well.

00:51:22.484 --> 00:51:24.045
That is, the virus would
enter the cells that

00:51:24.045 --> 00:51:25.531
express that receptor.

00:51:25.531 --> 00:51:28.081
So we managed some
collaboration with Joe Darigia

00:51:28.081 --> 00:51:29.499
to get active virus from
a patient who traveled

00:51:29.499 --> 00:51:33.900
to San Francisco from Brazil,
and he was donating blood,

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.828
and the blood actually turned
out to have active virus.

00:51:35.828 --> 00:51:39.004
So we cultured the virus and
exposed our tissue sections.

00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:41.656
Shown here in green is the Zika virus

00:51:41.656 --> 00:51:45.118
reproducing in cells in the
outer subventricular zone,

00:51:45.118 --> 00:51:47.686
which included the
outer radial glial cells

00:51:47.686 --> 00:51:48.684
that I've been talking about.

00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:49.585
It seems to be that they're a

00:51:49.585 --> 00:51:53.254
very favorite target of the Zika virus.

00:51:53.254 --> 00:51:55.670
So shown here, in fact, is
the outer radial glial cell

00:51:55.670 --> 00:52:00.038
packed with the viral particles
just prior to rupture.

00:52:00.038 --> 00:52:01.947
So those outer subventricular
zone cells are specifically

00:52:01.947 --> 00:52:06.584
and especially vulnerable to
infection with the Zika virus.

00:52:06.584 --> 00:52:10.526
When these patients are
born with microcephaly,

00:52:10.526 --> 00:52:13.009
it makes sense, of course, that
the neural progenitor cells

00:52:13.009 --> 00:52:14.424
might be selectively affected,

00:52:14.424 --> 00:52:15.640
and there's much more that goes on

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.140
in this devastating
condition than just infection

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.605
of these outer radial glia, but this seems

00:52:19.605 --> 00:52:22.259
to be a part of the picture.

00:52:22.259 --> 00:52:23.891
And we also took advantage of the fact

00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:28.643
that AXL, we hypothesized, was
mediating entry of the virus

00:52:28.643 --> 00:52:31.351
to block it with a variety
of different chemicals

00:52:31.351 --> 00:52:33.572
and antibodies and
shown here is an example

00:52:33.572 --> 00:52:36.338
of a chemical block of the AXL receptor,

00:52:36.338 --> 00:52:38.650
and these are cultured human cells

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.980
that are exposed to the virus,

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.799
and green dots are the cells
that are actually infected

00:52:42.799 --> 00:52:45.764
with the virus, and if you
block the AXL receptors,

00:52:45.764 --> 00:52:47.902
shown here on the right,
you can significantly reduce

00:52:47.902 --> 00:52:50.550
the cells that get infected.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:53.331
Confirming that the AXL
receptors are probably mediating

00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:56.914
entry into at least
these human cell types.

00:52:57.972 --> 00:52:59.483
Now I was very interested,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:52:59.483 --> 00:53:01.694
to find markers or
genes uniquely expressed

00:53:01.694 --> 00:53:04.259
in these outer radial glia
that we could use as a tool

00:53:04.259 --> 00:53:07.779
to try to learn more about the cell types.

00:53:07.779 --> 00:53:09.098
Now we're very gratified
in our first 300 cells

00:53:09.098 --> 00:53:10.514
that we were able to do that.

00:53:10.514 --> 00:53:13.207
Shown on the left are novel markers

00:53:13.207 --> 00:53:14.609
that express themselves only in the

00:53:14.609 --> 00:53:16.969
ventricular radial glia, shown here,

00:53:16.969 --> 00:53:19.018
and on the right are the
more interesting, to me,

00:53:19.018 --> 00:53:22.551
novel gene markers that are expressed in

00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:24.984
outer radial glia only.

00:53:24.984 --> 00:53:28.702
And we justified or rather,
we've validated these markers

00:53:28.702 --> 00:53:30.783
first by showing that they stain cells

00:53:30.783 --> 00:53:33.268
with the morphology and
location of outer radial glia,

00:53:33.268 --> 00:53:36.001
but also dynamically, we
watch cells in our time-lapse

00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:38.613
imaging jump and divide,
and then we fix them

00:53:38.613 --> 00:53:40.273
and stain them with
these markers to confirm

00:53:40.273 --> 00:53:41.200
that the cells that were jumping

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.912
were in fact expressing these
outer radial glial markers,

00:53:44.912 --> 00:53:45.745
and they were.

00:53:45.745 --> 00:53:48.528
So this gives us, now,
a whole new set of tools

00:53:48.528 --> 00:53:51.432
to start looking at these
outer radial glial cells.

00:53:51.432 --> 00:53:53.366
One of the first things we noticed,

00:53:53.366 --> 00:53:56.984
challenges, or I should say
modifies this classic model

00:53:56.984 --> 00:53:59.612
of human cortical, or
primate cortical development

00:53:59.612 --> 00:54:01.185
that Pasko Rakic proposed known as

00:54:01.185 --> 00:54:03.347
the Radial Unit Hypothesis.

00:54:03.347 --> 00:54:06.476
Very influential and
still very very concise

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:09.313
explanation of how radial units form

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:13.681
and how they multiply over
time and also evolution.

00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:16.081
And I want to emphasize the
radial glial scaffold here,

00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:18.765
which are all these fibers
go from radial glia down here

00:54:18.765 --> 00:54:21.882
to the cortex along which neurons migrate.

00:54:21.882 --> 00:54:23.682
And the model proposed that this scaffold

00:54:23.682 --> 00:54:26.370
persists throughout cortical development.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.354
And we were struck,
when we had new markers,

00:54:28.354 --> 00:54:31.081
as I mentioned just a moment
ago, that there seems to be a

00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:34.498
discontinuation of the radial
glial fibers at later stages.

00:54:34.498 --> 00:54:38.170
And that was evident from
these two cell markers.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:41.380
In red, I'm showing you HOPX,
which is a gene expressed

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.314
throughout the outer radial
glial cell cytoplasm,

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.095
and you can see red
fibers that you can trace

00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:47.827
all the way up to the pia surface.

00:54:47.827 --> 00:54:49.931
In green is CRYAB, which
is a marker our data

00:54:49.931 --> 00:54:53.865
suggested was only in
ventricular radial glia,

00:54:53.865 --> 00:54:56.181
and the green fibers only went up to the

00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:58.269
outer subventricular zone
and never went further

00:54:58.269 --> 00:55:00.370
at these later stages,

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.248
suggesting that these
fibers and these fibers

00:55:02.248 --> 00:55:05.738
were discontinuous, and we
checked that in a different way

00:55:05.738 --> 00:55:08.730
by using DiI, which is a lipophilic dye

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.822
that can be transported
along radial fibers.

00:55:11.822 --> 00:55:13.554
And if we put those crystals on the top

00:55:13.554 --> 00:55:15.727
or the bottom of this slice, either way,

00:55:15.727 --> 00:55:17.582
we were able to show
these continuous fibers

00:55:17.582 --> 00:55:21.198
at ages up to around gestational week 16.

00:55:21.198 --> 00:55:23.538
But beyond that, the
picture was quite different.

00:55:23.538 --> 00:55:25.928
If we put DiI at the
surface, it backfilled fibers

00:55:25.928 --> 00:55:28.331
only to the outer subventricular zone

00:55:28.331 --> 00:55:30.618
where they end in outer
radial glial cells,

00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:32.785
and if we put the DiI at the ventricle,

00:55:32.785 --> 00:55:35.865
it only went generally as far as the same

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:38.231
outer subventricular
zone, suggesting a kind of

00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:42.818
a hand-off of cells from
one zone to the other.

00:55:42.818 --> 00:55:45.097
And that led to this
model which is a model

00:55:45.097 --> 00:55:47.634
that suggests that the
second half of neurogenesis,

00:55:47.634 --> 00:55:49.369
the upper cortical layers are produced

00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:52.585
by outer radial glia, not by
these ventricular radial glia,

00:55:52.585 --> 00:55:55.840
which now have transformed
into truncated radial glia.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.098
So we think there are
three kinds of radial glia

00:55:58.098 --> 00:56:01.137
in human cortical development.

00:56:01.137 --> 00:56:04.231
And we've now expanded
our single cell analysis

00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:06.250
to all these different cell types.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.280
It's given us an idea
not only of the diversity

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.352
of cell types that are
produced in the human brain

00:56:11.352 --> 00:56:14.570
compared to the mouse,
but we've also identified

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:19.243
unique markers for each of
these different cell types

00:56:19.243 --> 00:56:20.722
at different stages of development,

00:56:20.722 --> 00:56:24.264
in different brain regions,
and one of them I want

00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:26.833
to mention is DAB1 which
is a reelin affector.

00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:29.882
It's found in radial glia at the ventricle

00:56:29.882 --> 00:56:32.490
and the outer radial glia, but not in the

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.931
truncated radial glia,
which would be here.

00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:36.593
And what's interesting
is that these two cells

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:38.619
have fibers that go all
the way up to the pia

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:40.631
where they can receive reelin signaling,

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:42.137
and the tRG's don't.

00:56:42.137 --> 00:56:44.584
So it very nicely justifies or validates

00:56:44.584 --> 00:56:47.164
the discontinuous glial scaffold model

00:56:47.164 --> 00:56:49.289
that I showed you earlier.

00:56:49.289 --> 00:56:51.060
And then I just wanted
to summarize the points

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.291
that I've made so far,

00:56:52.291 --> 00:56:54.381
that the development or
evolution of these three

00:56:54.381 --> 00:56:57.634
neural stem cell types,
the ventricular, outer,

00:56:57.634 --> 00:57:01.321
and truncated radial glia,
we think help understand

00:57:01.321 --> 00:57:04.417
the expansion and organization
of cerebral cortex.

00:57:04.417 --> 00:57:06.217
That these outer radial
glial cells are enriched

00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:08.632
in self-renewal and proliferation genes,

00:57:08.632 --> 00:57:12.737
and that has led to some
disease associated effects,

00:57:12.737 --> 00:57:14.666
and that the mechanism
for human developmental

00:57:14.666 --> 00:57:17.380
and evolutionary brain
expansion could be co-opted

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.550
in disorders like brain tumors,

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.783
and could be targeted in
disorders such as microcephaly.

00:57:22.783 --> 00:57:24.111
And finally, I want to
thank all the people

00:57:24.111 --> 00:57:27.017
that did all the work,
especially Aparna, Alex, and Tom,

00:57:27.017 --> 00:57:28.233
very gifted post-docs.

00:57:28.233 --> 00:57:31.201
Alex and Tom are setting up
their own labs now at UCSF,

00:57:31.201 --> 00:57:33.441
and our sponsoring organizations.

00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:34.274
Thank you for your attention.

00:57:34.274 --> 00:57:36.169
(applause)

00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:38.669
(chime music)
