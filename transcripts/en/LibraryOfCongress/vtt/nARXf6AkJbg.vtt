00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.830
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Well good morning.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.400
Good morning on this
very rainy day, alas.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.390
And welcome to the
History and Biography Stage

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.150
of this year's National
Book Festival.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.760
We're delighted to see
all of you here and want

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.420 position:56%
to extend a special welcome to those
who are watching us live on C-Span.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
I'm Jane McAuliffe, Director of
National and International Outreach

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.710
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.730
And all of us at the library
are proud to host, once again,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.630
this free public event
which brings together many

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.810
of our country's favorite authors.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.420
We're especially grateful
to the many sponsors

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.210
who make this festival possible.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
And we're thrilled that
the library has been able

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.540
to hold this festival for 17 years.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.310
The library is thriving because of
people like you, library patrons

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.730
and book lovers who not only enjoy
reading but recognize the value

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.340 position:56%
that literature has for our society.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
Now the History and Biography Stage
has been a perennial favorite here

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.850
at the book festival.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
Today we have a terrific lineup
of authors on this stage --

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580
a dozen in all -- and many

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.780
of them are making their first
book festival appearance.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.980
Two of the authors, however --
A. Scott Berg and John Farrell --

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.320 position:56%
have been with us before and we are
so pleased that they are coming back

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.870
for a return appearance this year.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.160
As an additional bonus, all of
the authors here at the History

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.140
and Biography Pavilion will
be signing their books right

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.050
after their presentations
downstairs on the expo floor.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.840
We begin today with a panel
discussion marking the 100th

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.580
anniversary of John
F. Kennedy's birth.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.500 position:56%
Three authors -- Steven Levingston,
Kathy McKeon, and Thomas Oliphant --

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.030
will talk about their recent books
on this fascinating 35th president,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.100
his family, his campaign, and his
role in the civil rights effort.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.220
I'm sure this will
be an informational

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.680
as well as inspiring discussion.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.720 position:56%
But before we get started, I want to
give a special thanks to Wells Fargo

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.070
which has generously sponsored the
History and Biography Stage here

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.010 position:56%
at the festival for seven years now.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.520 position:56%
Wells Fargo Regional President
Michael Golden is here with us today

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.720
and would like to say a few words.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.020
Mike?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Golden: Thank you.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.640
As Louise said, I'm Mike Golden.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.650
I serve as Regional President
for our operation here

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.280
in the capital region
and it's my pleasure

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.700
to have been here all seven years.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.530
My family and I relocated

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.940
to the greater Washington market
almost seven years ago now,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.450
and this was the very first
event that I had the pleasure

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.890
of attending publicly after we
moved here from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.480
So it's been a real
pleasure to be a part

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.560
of this festival for seven years.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.060
Our company, Wells
Fargo, is extremely proud

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.570
to have been a charter sponsor
of the National Book Festival

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.650
and also the sponsor of this
stage for all seven years.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.520
You know, we celebrate the
wonderful work that the Library

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.070
of Congress does in promoting
literacy and active reading

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.220
because Wells Fargo's had an
active role of promoting literacy

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.960
across our country
for a quite long time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.620
Here locally in the
greater Washington market,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.070
last year our team members read
to more than 110,000 students

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.620
in different school systems in
this great market, and we donated

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.950
over 61,000 books in our
Reading First program.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.010
And downstairs you will find
Wells Fargo team members working

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.660
in two different pavilions with
a number of fun activities --

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.550
that's the Let's Read
America Pavilion as well

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.850
as the Hands-on History Pavilion.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.080
So I hope you'll take some
time to stop by there.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.800
But now it's my pleasure to
welcome Mary Louise Kelly

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.980
of the National Public Radio
who will now moderate our panel.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.780
Thank you very much.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Good morning.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.810
Can you all hear me?

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.110
Excellent.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.410
That's a good start.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.220
I'm going to lay four dates on you.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.390 position:56%
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born 100
years ago this year, May 29, 1917.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.720
He was married September
12, 1953, elected president,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.270
took the oath of office
January 20, 1961.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:03.220
And of course died November 22,
1963 in Dallas at the age of 46.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.000
And I start with those dates
because they're so well known.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.150
The arc of his life
is so well known.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
So many books have already
been written about him,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.480
and yet as evidenced by the trio
of authors on stage with us today,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.570
there is still so much curiosity
about that extraordinary life.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.500
So it's a privilege to get to kick
off the book festival by talking

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.590
about that extraordinary life
for a few minutes with you all

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.860
and maybe asking what lessons
from that life might apply

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.780
to today's interesting times.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.360
So welcome to each of
the three of you --

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.160
Tom Oliphant, Kathy
McKeon, Steve Levingston.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.460
Welcome to you all.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.870
I thought we would start by letting
each of you share a little bit

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.960
of the particular vantage
point that you bring

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.580
and what grounds your book covers.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.120
And I know you each brought
a few pictures we can share

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.540
to give you a little bit of a taste
of some of this new literature

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.370
and scholarship coming
out on Kennedy.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.750
So we're going to go, I guess,
in the order we're seated.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.560
Tom Oliphant, that means you get
the first word with your book,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.560
The Road to Camelot: Inside
JFK's Five-Year Campaign.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.520
And your book, I know, is about
his rise to the White House

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.590
and how close he came to losing.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.280
So maybe you can tell us
a little bit about that.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.690
I'm going to let you just
briefly talk us through some

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.080
of the pictures you
brought to share.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.540
So we'll go to this first one
and just tell us a little bit

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.000
about the perspective
that you bring.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.210
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: That
picture is of what they call

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.920
in politics a boiler room.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:51.310
It's actually the sun porch of Bob
Kennedy's house in Hyannis Port.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: OK.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.910
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
And it is shortly

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.370
after dawn after the election.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.530
Kennedy at that point knows that he
is going to be the president-elect,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.750
but there are still a lot of
states in play and this was one

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.420
of those election nights
that was an all-nighter.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.110
Kennedy didn't go to bed until
around 3:00 for a short nap.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.180
And in those days, the first sign

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.100
that you'd been elected
president was the appearance

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.750
of secret service agents.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.050
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: A-ha.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.580
They showed up and you knew
you were in good shape.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.940
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Around dawn.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.580
And it was when he woke up
in his house in the compound,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.760
he noticed the agents and
that was the first clue

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.560
to him that this had happened.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:49.270 position:56%
While he was sleeping -- the last
thing I'll say -- on election night,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:55.490
the state that in the public's
mind and in journalism's coverage

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.070
that tipped this thing that made
it pretty clear that he was going

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.090
to be the next president was
Minnesota which went back

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:09.520
and forth all through the night and
didn't fall over into his column

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.120
until shortly before dawn.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.210
And the wise guys in that room
and the one just to the left

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.140
at that point knew that
they had, as one put it,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.110
fallen over the finish line.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Ah, OK [laughing].

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.290
Alright. We're going to
quickly flip through a few

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.590
of the others you brought.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.580
Stop me if you want or just
tell us what we're seeing.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.880
Why'd you pick this one?

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.730
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: That's
a look at this guy right

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.890
at the beginning of
the whole process.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.560
The hour mentor in this kind
of work, Theodore White,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.810 position:56%
in The Making of the President 1960,

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.120
wrote a story of a
year plus campaign.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.060
What Curtis Wilkie and I
discovered in our research was

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.270
that this process was
actually five years

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.290
of conscious pursuit
of national office.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: OK.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.140
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: And it
started in the late summer of 1955

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.520
and that's what John
Kennedy looked like then.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.090
You can still see a trace of
the skinny kid after the war.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Yeah.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:22.200
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: By the end
of 1956 when he made the decision

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.840
to actually run for
president, he had filled out.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.590
But that's what he looked
like when this all began.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: OK.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.320
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Everybody
remembers the rackets committee,

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.220
as we called it in journalism.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:45.130
It was a senate investigation of
corruption in the labor movement

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.690
that focused primarily
on the Teamsters Union

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.790 position:56%
and introduced the country for the
first time to the guy in the middle,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.030 position:56%
Bob Kennedy, and to the evil figures

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.350
in the Teamsters Union back
then, first a guy named --

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: So
what's the date on this phot?

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.590
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: This would
be in the summer of 1957.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: 57.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.490
Alright.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.790
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: And
he'd already decided to run.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:20.810 position:56%
His principal antagonist on the left
was Eleanor Roosevelt, shown here.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:26.800
She nipped at his heels for at
least three years, a little longer.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.970
She didn't trust him and
she didn't like him mostly

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.490
because of his behavior during the
heyday of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.790
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Mmhmm.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.520
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: But she
changed, as Kennedy did.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.510
And by this moment, when he
was nominated for president,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.190
you see Sam Rayburn
moderating a -- quote --

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.230
debate which really wasn't much
of one before the Texas delegation

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.500
and a few hangers-on
from Massachusetts

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.270
at the Democratic Convention
in Los Angeles.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.560
Johnson, of course, and
Kennedy are shown there.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.310
This is two days before
he was actually nominated.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Alright.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.910
Thank you so much.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.840
Kathy, we're going to come to you
and let you give a little preview

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.850
of your book, Jackie's Girl: My
Life With the Kennedy Family.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.650
For those of you who
haven't had the chance

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:27.400 position:56%
to read this delightful book yet, it
is Kathy's story of her time working

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.790
for Jacqueline Kennedy and as
her personal assistant living

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.680 position:56%
with the Kennedy family for 13 years
and sometimes nannying to the kids.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.820
And Jackie's Girl was what
Rose Kennedy called you.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.120
Is that right?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.420
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yes.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.720
Yes.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.020
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: The nickname?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.320
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yes.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.620
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: OK.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.920
So let's go through your
pictures and you can tell us.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.500
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: This was at
my wedding in '71 and it was

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.230
in Astoria Manor in New York.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.880
And I sent John [inaudible]
Jackie, I called Madame,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.190
an invitation to Mr. Onassis.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Hang on one second.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.950
Can you all hear Kathy OK?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.450
Kathy, maybe take your mic and
just hold it a little bit closer

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.960
to your mouth so we make sure
we can hear your stories.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.260
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Like that?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.560
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: You
might need to unpin it.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.860
Sometimes they undress us.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.160
They don't get close.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.460
You can unpin it.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.250
Tom, can you help her so she can
just hold it a little closer?

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.240
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
I'm good for something.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.670
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Hold like this.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.370
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Hold it up.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.390
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: So I sent
them all an invitation

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.790
and they all sent it back
saying they were coming.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.710
And I was really a little
nervous about this whole thing

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.750
because I didn't want my
guests to be crowding them.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.500
You know, I want them
to have a good time.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.800
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Aw.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.100
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: So I was
very proud that she came

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.400
to my wedding and the guests.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Oh, of course.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.000
It's lovely.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.300
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yes.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.600
And that's a picture of my wedding.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Alright.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.200
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: This
picture was up in Cape Cod.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Hold it just a
little pointing towards your mouth.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.110
Sorry. I just want to make
sure everybody can hear you.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.870
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: This
picture was taken in Cape Cod.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.170
John --

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Cape Cod.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.770
OK.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.070
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yeah.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.370
John and Madame riding the horse.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.040
John wasn't a big fan of horses,
but that was Colin's little pony

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.570
and then she outgrew the pony
and John was riding it then.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.870
But he got a --

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
And here we are.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.070
He's younger there, it looks like.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.700
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: This picture
is in Newport Road Island.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.690
It was called the Windmill House.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.740
And John is eating cupcakes
and the dog is there begging.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.520
And she's, Madame, is
figuring out, should I have one

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.050
of those cupcakes or not?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.090
[ Laughter ]

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.510
I don't know if she had one,
but she was looking at them.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.250
[ Laughter ]

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.420
This was the first
summer in Cape Cod

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.970 position:56%
on the Kennedy beach and was in '65.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.010
And me and John had a little
shovel with us and we dug a hole

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.560
and we decided to bury Shannon.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.310
[Laughter] And so he actually
loved it because it was nice

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.540
and cool in there in the sand.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.710
And then after that,
when that was finished,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.450
John decided he'd take Shannon
down to the ocean and wash him off.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Aww.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.040
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: This
picture was in Colorado.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.180
It took, for me to go to Colorado,
Madamee sent me to Bloomingdale's

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.660
to get all my skiing clothes.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.960
I had no skiing clothes.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.230
I didn't know how to ski
and I had no skiing clothes.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.450
So she told me to go and meet this
lady in Bloomingdale's and I did.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.010
She gave me the credit
card and off I went

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.080
and I got all my clothes there.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.830
And I got myself a pair of gloves.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.230
The secret service guy
didn't have a pair of gloves.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.070
He borrowed my gloves but
he never gave them back.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.130
[ Laughter ]

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.430
Yeah.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And Kathy,
would you just tell the story

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.510
of the day you met
the Kennedy family?

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.240
As I said, you were 19 years old.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.490
You'd just arrived from
Ireland to New York.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.940
You're looking for work
as a domestic servant

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.290
and you get this summons
to Park Avenue.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.590
What happened?

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.890
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Oh yeah.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.190
I was only 19 years old.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.710 position:56%
I had a job taking care of two boys,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.310
but then my cousin was
working outside of 1040

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:10.050
and he was a New York City police
officer and he got really close

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.840
to one of the secret service men.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.460
And the secret service
man said, you know,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.580
Jackie Kennedy is looking
for a nice Irish girl.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.920
You think you would take the job?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.880
And I said, sure I take the job.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.810
But I said, I have another
job but they said, OK,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.110
she's looking for somebody.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.300
And I decide I'll take the job.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.350
I went up to the 15th
floor on the elevator.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.400
I rang the doorbell
and the lady let me in.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.420
And then I met John and
John came down the hall

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.020
and he says to me, my name is John.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.570
And I said, my name is Kathy.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.850
And he says to me, do you want
to see my dog doing a trick?

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.080
And I said sure.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.990
He said, OK, Shannon, you put
the bone underneath the cushion.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.100
[inaudible] set the green
cushion on the couch.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.670
And he said, go Shannon.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.980
So Shannon went digging away
to get the bone and he got it.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.630
Oh, do you want to see
him do another trick?

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.930
And I said yeah.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.550
And then he made Shannon roll over.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.980
And all of a sudden this nice,
soft voice came down the hallway

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.890
and she says, John,
what are you doing?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.570
You're ruining my couch!

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.950
Right? And all of a sudden John
disappeared and then she --

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.410
oh yeah, he took off so fast.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.540
Then she says, I'm Mrs. Kennedy.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.460
And I said, my name is Kathy,
and she said, I know that.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.280
And then she said -- she just
looked at me for a little while

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.910
and then she says,
when can you start?

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.960
And I said, well I have a
job already, Mrs. Kennedy.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.120
But she said, OK, do you think
you could start tomorrow?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.680
[Laughter] And I said, well I have

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.160
to let this other lady
know that I'm leaving.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.340
You know? Then I have
to get her reference.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.410
And she says to me, you
don't need no reference.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.170
You've already got the reference.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.510
So actually John and
his dog interviewed me.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.250
[ Laughter ]

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.030
And he was listening in the
hallway of the whole story.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.330
Yes.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.480
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: That is hard
to top as job interview stories go.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.780
[Laughing]

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.080
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yeah.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.380
Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Yeah.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.980
Alright. [Laughing] Steve
Levingston, let's get to yours.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.280
Kennedy and King: The
President, the Pasture,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.580
and the Battle Over Civil Rights.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.650
So you chose to do
the story together,

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.640
tying together Kennedy's
life, King's life,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.560
this fascinating interaction
of these two men who were

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.790
at the forefront of the civil
rights movement in the early '60s.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.710
Talk us through some of
the slides you've brought.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.080
What are we seeing here?

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.490
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Well,
my book is basically the story

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.660
of the relationship, the
complicated relationship,

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.580
between John Kennedy
and Martin Luther King.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.570
And it focuses on Martin Luther
King's influence on John Kennedy

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.940
in pushing him to become what
is arguably the first civil

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.560
rights president.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.630
But -- there's a big but there --

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.800
when John Kennedy first
came into office,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.790
he was not a civil rights advocate.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.690
He was rather opposed to
pushing forward on civil rights

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.650
because it took away
from his domestic agenda

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.020
and other foreign affairs
that he wanted to focus on.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.550
So Martin Luther King really had to
push him and these photos will sort

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.680
of show you the arc of the
evolution of John Kennedy.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.110
The first one is from
the 1961 Freedom Rides

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.050
which probably most
of us remember here.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.800
This is when white supremacists and
racists bombed one of the busses

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.210
that was trying to bring down
segregation in interstate travel

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.880
and tried to trap those
freedom riders inside.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.600
They finally managed to
break out but this was one

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.770
of the early horrible incidents

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.430
that Kennedy really didn't
pay that much attention to.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.320
He didn't really come out
strongly on really the moral issue

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.320
that was involved in civil rights

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.650
and that's what always drove
Martin Luther King forward.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:57.590
Now we jump forward to the
Birmingham campaign in 1963.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.320
There were other issues before
this, but this is a significant one

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.610
because it really did
change the view of Kennedy

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.160
as he was stumbling
and dithering along.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.190
This is a photo of a children's
march which King agreed

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.470
to do reluctantly because he was a
little afraid of throwing children

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.040
into the protests for
fear of them getting hurt.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.670
But he knew that what they
were working for was the future

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.130
of these children and the
children wanted to do it.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.430
So they went forward.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.790
But here is some of the reaction.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.530
The police and the
fire departments --

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.130
the fire department
somewhat reluctantly

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:39.880
under the police orders --
used high-powered water canons,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.780
knocking children and
others to the ground.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.590
These fire hoses were so powerful
that they tore the clothes off

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.800
of the protesters and
lacerated their skin.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.670 position:56%
And the police, under the really
aggressive police chief Bull Connor,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.960 position:56%
brought out these police dogs who --

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.320
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: This
is the same day, Steve?

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: This is around
the same time, during the protests

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.110
in Birmingham which spread
out over a period of time.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.410
They brought out the police dogs

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.800
who were rather vicious
and attacked people.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.700
Here these next two photos will
show you the difference in the life

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:24.030
between Martin Luther King, Jr.
and John Kennedy during this time.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:29.340 position:56%
This is Easter weekend in 1963
during think protests in Birmingham.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.270 position:56%
Martin Luther King is being arrested
and carted off to jail there

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.740
with his friend Reverend
Ralph Abernathy.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.900
And it was in jail that he wrote
this tremendous piece called The

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.950
Letter From Birmingham where he
outlined really the principles

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.790
of the civil rights movement and
a defense of civil disobedience.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.900
And it was a beautiful
piece of work.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.040
Here on that same weekend is John
Kennedy with his beautiful children

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.650
and beautiful wife going to church,
celebrating the Easter Sunday.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.430
This is at his father's
estate in Palm Beach.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.940
Quite a contrast between these
two men who were very different

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.100 position:56%
and that was one of the reasons
there was such difficulty in the two

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:18.290
of them coming to an agreement on
what needed to be done for America.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Yeah.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.860
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: This was
almost you could say the event

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.250
that pushed Kennedy over the edge.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.700
This was on June 11, 1963
when the governor of Alabama,

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.300
George Wallace standing there,
was blocking the schoolhouse door

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.820
in the University of Alabama

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.980
to prevent two black
students from registering.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.470
Kennedy federalized the
National Guard in that city

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.980
and was appalled not only by
this but by all the other things

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.530
that had occurred and in
a sense had an epiphany.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:57.260
And on that very night of June 11,
1963, we can go to the next photo

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.820
and we'll see John Kennedy was
eager to go on television live.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.260
He didn't even have a
speech really prepared.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.590
He cobbled something together with
some of his staff and he announced

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.670
that he wanted to introduce
civil rights legislation --

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.820
which unfortunately he
wasn't able to see through.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.750
Lyndon Johnson had to
follow that through

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.800
after Kennedy's assassination.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.120
But more importantly
for Martin Luther King,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.840
this was really the first
time that a president

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.050
of the United States spoke
about the civil rights movement

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.660
in moral terms.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.260
He defined that this
was a moral crisis

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.330
in America that had to be fixed.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:40.050 position:56%
After the speech, Martin Luther King
and many other blacks were ecstatic

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.900
that they had finally been
able to make Kennedy come

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.530
around after starting
from such a low base two

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.600
and a half years earlier.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Thank you.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.310
Alright. Well thank you, all
three, for introducing your books.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.030
I've got a few questions that I
want to throw at all three of you

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.150
and then we will for the
last few minutes open it

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.140
up to questions from the audience.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.250 position:56%
So as things are popping into your
head as you're listening, get ready.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.410
I know we will carve out
a few minutes at the end.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.670
I want to start with a political
question and I guess I'll aim this

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.410
at Steven and Tom since your books
have more of a political slant.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.540
It is fascinating to
me as a reporter

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.560
in Washington today
covering politics,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.980
covering national security,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:26.750
how often JFK still
comes up in conversation.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.020
You know, whether you're talking
about secret back channels

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.180
to the Kremlin, which RFK
was known to meet many times

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.270 position:56%
with that Soviet intelligence agent.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.580
Or you're talking about
President Trump bringing members

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.980
of his immediate family
into the administration,

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.560
which of course was a path well
trod already by the Kennedys.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.680
My question to you would
be, would the Kennedy brand

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.090
of politics work in
Washington today?

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.390
Would it translate?

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.690
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston:
You do that one.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Tom.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.290
[ Laughter ]

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.590
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Thanks, Steve.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:06.240 position:56%
I got a laugh at the Kennedy library
this spring during the centennial

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.570
week when this was first
published in saying

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:17.250
that there was a direct line from
what John Kennedy did between 1955

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.480
and 1960 and Donald Trump.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.190 position:56%
Trump is not even imaginable without
Kennedy and that's because in effect

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.780
on the fly Kennedy invented modern
politics -- all the elements of it.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:39.850
The media type, the TV commercials,
polling, the outside-in approach

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:45.430
to organizing where you're not
thinking of a national convention

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:51.430
as an affair where big shots and
powerful people broker nominations.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.520
You're seeing it as the culmination
of a process in which starting

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.410
in 1960 politicians began to sort
of let this new group of people

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.270
into the process called voters.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.510
And so that's one reason.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:14.370
And people in national politics
today, if you're starting

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:19.070
out a campaign there's
always somebody in the office

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.270
who has encyclopedic
knowledge of Kennedy's victory.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.570
It's still studied [laughing].

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.890
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Well and
one of the things -- it's true.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.190
It's still studied today.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.780
And I was struck reading
your book by your description

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:36.200
of Kennedy's campaign as this
bold outsider insurgent campaign

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.970
that managed to exasperate and
defy the party establishment.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.840
And I wondered -- I mean, you
were writing this during the

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.140
2016 campaign.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.440
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
Well, it is -- I know.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Very different
candidate, different time, but --

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.110
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: It's
very hard to think of --

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.830
because of all that happened
subsequently, it's hard to think

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.570
of him for what he was at the time.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.380
But he was a nobody.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.360
He was very young.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.330
His resume was extremely thin.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.300
His connections to what we would
call the Democratic Party were

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.200
extremely tenuous at best.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.460
Everything had to be
built from the ground up.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.250
That is the story of
his political career.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.220
It was true when he ran for
Congress in 1946 as well

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.700
as when he was running for
president in 1960 and as a result,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.500
because this new kind of politics
really was born with his candidacy,

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:37.750
people still understand how
important it is to study it.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.850
But it makes me think of a
question maybe Kathy can help me

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.890
with [laughing] and that is, did
she -- from talking to her --

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.370
did she hate this game or love it?

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.720
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: I
think she loved it.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.020
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Why?

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.490
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Because she --

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Put your
mic back up so we can hear you.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.510
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: OK.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.470
I think she loved it because
she was always out there

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.750
to help the president
and Bobby Kennedy.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.080
Steve, how about you?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.960
As you were researching and
writing, were there through lines

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.810
that you were seeing
parallels that apply to today?

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.150
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Well, what I
would say in terms of the relevance

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:22.000
of this story of Kennedy
and King today is this.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.630 position:56%
Civil rights progress is never over.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:31.990
Civil rights progress moves
forward and gets thrown back.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.280
It happened during the
brief time that I looked

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.900
at the progress in '61 to '63.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.970
There's two examples in the book.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.350
One is that night that John Kennedy
made that transformative speech --

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:53.190
June 11, 1963 -- was the same night
that Medgar Evers, an NAACP worker

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.220
in Jackson, Mississippi, came home
and was excited about the speech

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.660
as well but as he was
crossing the driveway

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.130
of his home he was gunned down.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.150
So we had elation and tragedy.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.110
The same thing sort of
happened after the march

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.670
on Washington in August of '63.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.610
The march on Washington
was a wonderful event.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.390
The civil rights movement
was overjoyed

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.560
by how it occurred peacefully.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.160
Martin Luther King
gave his, you know,

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.700
his famous I Have a Dream speech.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.980
Everything went beautifully.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.330
And then a couple weeks later
we had another terrible event,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.140
a 16th Street Baptist
Church bombing in Birmingham

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.260
that killed four little girls.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.250
So the progress goes forward.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.920
It gets struck back.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.540
You could flip it all the way to
today to see some of the relevance.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.670
We had a black president and
we'd thought we were entering a

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.290
postracial world.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.310
Well we've had a backlash again,
as we all know, since that time,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.200
and a rise of white
supremacists and violence.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.570
So really the issue to take
away from all of this is

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:04.170
that this progress is delicate
and it needs to be protected.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Quick point
and then I want to bring Kathy in.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.340
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: I kept running

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.660
into still another
element of this, Steve.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:15.530
And that is that in great movements
like civil rights you always have

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.490
to remember there's a moral
track -- the movement --

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.720
and there's a political track
to kind of get things done.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:30.430
And of course in my research
Kennedy is all politics

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.200
until he becomes president.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.310
But what fascinated
me about your work --

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.540
and maybe you could talk
about it just a little bit --

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:45.340
is that Dr. King was not
above politics completely.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.900
And I'm thinking especially of
his reluctance to get busted

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.270
at Rich's Department Store in
Atlanta almost on the final weekend

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.770
of the campaign in 1960 because
he was worried about the impact

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.930
that would have on the election.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.230
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Right.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.530
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: But he did.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.830
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: He did.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.130
Yeah.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.430
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: I
mean, he played politics

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.730
because he knew he
had to play politics.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.850
And he got arrested for joining in
a sit-in right before the election,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.150
a couple weeks before the election.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:18.030
And that really in some ways
turned the election to Kennedy

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.230
because both the candidates,
Richard Nixon and John Kennedy,

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.670
came under pressure to speak out
about Martin Luther King's arrest.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:31.850
Well the Nixon campaign offered
a no comment and that was it.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.270
John Kennedy, through various
machinations with his family

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.730
and his team, decided that he
wouldn't speak out directly

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.160
but he would make a call to
Coretta, Martin Luther King's wife,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.680
and just tell her how concerned
he was about Martin Luther King

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.800
and about Coretta because
she was four months pregnant.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.530
And that, of course,
got into the media

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:58.230
and that rallied the black
constituency and they flocked

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.150
to the polls when election
time came.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.250
And after that they claimed,
and with some validity,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.940
that they elected John Kennedy and
they expected him to work for him

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.860
when he was in the White House and
that's because so much frustration

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.260
and anger once he was in
there and he moved so slowly.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.950
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Let me ask if
I may -- I just want to get, let.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.330
There's a story I want Kathy
to tell us before we open it

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.940
up to audience questions
and it's about the challenge

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.440
that is no doubt familiar to all
three of you writing history,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.460
writing memoir, which is that
we all know how the story ends.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:38.180
There was a moment, Kathy, in
your book that so touched me

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.560 position:56%
where you were asked a question that
I think everybody of a certain age

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.950
in America has been asked which is,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.370
where were you when
Kennedy was shot?

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.530
And in your case, you
write about being asked

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.440
that question by his daughter.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.740
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yes.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
By Caroline Kennedy.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.340
What happened?

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: I was asked that
question by Caroline in her bedroom.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.890
She says, Kath, where were
you when my father was shot?

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.590
And I said I was in Ireland.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.630
And she said, I thought you
were in the United States.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.260
I said, no I was in Ireland.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.240
And I said, everybody
in Ireland was very,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.980
very sad about what
happened to your father.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.850 position:56%
And my mom -- there was a picture in
the Sunday's paper, a color picture

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.910
in the middle of the paper.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.500
And my mom cut it out.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.850
She got it framed.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.150
She put it into it.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:27.570
She hung it up in the kitchen
in the middle between the Pope

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.260
and the Sacred Heart
and President Kennedy.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.600
And it was there for years,
but it's not there anymore.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.610
I think it fell out of the frame.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.510
You know? It was just
a newspaper picture.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.810
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: You know --

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.160
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: And
Caroline was really,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.520
really shocked that
I was in Ireland.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.490
And I told her that I
was going to a dance

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.650 position:56%
and I was -- we were all dressed up.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.730
We went to a little store
to get some gum and the lady

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.810
in the store said, Kath,
there is no dance tonight.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.110
And I said why?

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.660
She said the president of
the United States was shot.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.960
Everything is canceled.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.640
Everything is closed down.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.940
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And you
wrote about being able to listen

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.110
to the funeral on the
radio in your home.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.410
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: Yes, yes.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.710
I listened to the funeral
on the radio.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:16.840 position:56%
One radio and it was a battery radio
and it had to be charged every week

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.140
because it would die out.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.380
And my father used to keep
it for football games.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.710
And we watched -- no, we
listened from the radio

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.700
and we could hear the
horse's hooves going up

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.850
and down the street
walking on the cobblestones.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Ah.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.450
&gt;&gt; Kathy McKeon: I know you
want to get a word in but I want

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.280 position:56%
to make sure we have time for a
couple of questions and then get you

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.660
to your signings on time.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.430
So if you have questions,
you'll see mics.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.800
There's one on each side here.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.840
You can make your way forward.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.980
If you would tell us your name, if
you have an affiliation you want

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.330
to share, and if you could
keep your question short

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.570
and keep it a question,
I would be grateful.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.870
Thank you.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.170
Please, sir.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:54.470
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.770
Thank you for being here.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.310
John Kennedy --

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Bring the mic to you.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.910
There we go.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.920
&gt;&gt; John Kennedy remains my hero.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.510
This question, I guess,
is for Mr. Oliphant

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.500
but can be addressed
to all three of you.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.530 position:56%
One of the things I always find
fascinating about President Kennedy,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:18.730
or even Senator Kennedy as well,
was his self-effacing humor.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:25.910
Whether it was during
his various speeches,

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:31.810 position:56%
he seemed to always extemporaneously
come out with some kind

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:37.570 position:56%
of humorous remark about himself,
like I said, in a self-effacing way.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.380
And I find that in today's politics

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.580
or politically world
vastly different,

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.400
of a vastly different aspect.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.160
I was wondering if you
could share that aspect

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.840
of not only Senator Kennedy
but President Kennedy as well.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.440
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Humor as a political tool.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.740
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
One of the things

00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.840
that I thought was a gas during
the three years of poring

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.230
over research materials
before Curtis Wilkie

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:11.410
and I started writing is what an
interesting politician Kennedy was.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:16.540
And everything applied,
including humor.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:22.890
And as a matter of almost political
strategy, he used humor to deal

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.420
with two issues that were
problems from the beginning

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.850
of his political career
in 1946 until he died.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.040
One was his family's wealth.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:41.580
And one of the, they called them
openers in Kennedy's speeches

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.030
that he used all the time --

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.380
he almost never talked
about his wealth seriously.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.070
It was always humorously.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.580
And he said it was when he
was running for the senate

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.900
against Henry Cabot Lodge in 1952
and he said he'd been talking

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.980
to his father about what it
would cost and etc., etc.,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:05.690
etc. Kennedy was also already
appearing to be ahead in the race

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:08.860
and the question was how much
more to invest down the stretch?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.840
And Kennedy would say to
audiences, so my father said to me,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.580
he said look, I am willing to pay
for your victory but I'll be damned

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.290
if I'm going to buy a landslide.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.450
[Laughing] And the other topic
that occasioned humor as much

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.510
as serious talk was his religion.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.950
You know, he was about to become
the first and only Catholic

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.460
to be elected president
of the United States

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.070
and humor helped him
get into the topic.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:43.830
At political dinners especially
he used to tell a story

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.370
about Al Smith's candidacy in 1928,

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.970
the first Catholic
nominee, who had trouble.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:58.400
And he said the campaign unfolded,
the election occurred, Smith lost.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.600
And the day after the election
he sent a one-word telegram

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.510
to Pope Pius the 11th: unpack.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.270
[ Laughter ]

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Unpack.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.870
[Laughing] Very good.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.170
We've got one over here.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.470
Yes, sir?

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.220
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering how much
truth there was to the theories

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.570
that the election was
stolen for Kennedy.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Was the election stolen?

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Let me pick that
up on something Steve said first

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.690
of all because it's very important.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:39.750
There hasn't been a lot of serious
studies of the vote but a couple

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.700
that we found buttress this
point about the importance

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.990
of African American
votes at the end.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:50.660 position:56%
There's a little story attached to
that too because unbeknownst to John

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.610
and Robert Kennedy, the
liberals in his office arranged

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.570
to have Kennedy's intervention
in the King case publicized.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.490
And they printed at least a
million, maybe a lot more,

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.190
of a two-page leaflet that had
Kennedy's activism on one side

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.270
and Nixon's no comment and
Eisenhower's no comment

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.930
on the other, and distributed
them in churches all

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.910
over the country the weekend
before the election on a --

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.790
the paper was tinted blue and
they called them blue bombs.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.230
And if you study the vote, you
can see the spike in the turnout

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:31.990
in Michigan, in New York, in New
Jersey, in upwards of ten states.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.090
Eisenhower himself thought

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.260
that Kennedy's intervention
had won him the election.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.680
The Republican National
Chairman that year, later Senator

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.150
and Interior Secretary
Thruston Morton

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.100
of Kentucky was positive
that's what did it.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.490
And so I wanted to make
that point first of all.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:57.790
Secondly, we studied very
hard Illinois and Texas.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.980
And very quickly, it's interesting
to me that after all these years,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.940
the same counties and the
same precincts are cited

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.750
and nothing else.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.040
It's an evidentiary
burden that the advocates

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.420
of a fix have yet to satisfy.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Steve,
do you want to jump in?

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.400
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Well the only
thing I would say along those lines

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.280
is the black voters did turn out in
huge numbers and I looked at some

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.090
of the numbers myself as
well and certain states --

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.020
I can't remember which -- but
it was such a close election

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.330
that Kennedy eked by by several
thousand votes in some states,

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.070
but there were 200,000 African
Americans who turned out.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.650
So they clearly turned the
tide in several states.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.170
And after the election was over,
the African American leaders said

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.990
that they believed that the black
vote was responsible for more

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.640
than 100 electoral votes.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.040
It was a hundred and something.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.420
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Quite possibly.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.200
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: So that
hasn't been disproved yet,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.690
so I guess we'd have to say
that it's pretty accurate.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.920
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Can I just
do three numbers real fast?

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Real short numbers.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.100
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: In 20 of
the states that night in 1960,

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.760
the margin was below
five percentage points.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.730
And only North Carolina
was four to five points.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:17.580
All the others were below 4%.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.600
And Kennedy won 13 of them.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.370
And in five his margin
was less than 1%.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.950
So I think we've got
a very strong case.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.250
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Yeah.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: There we go.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.850
Alright. Yes, sir?

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.150
You get the last question.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.450
&gt;&gt; OK. Thank you very much.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.750
I'm British.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.280
Kennedy, John Kennedy, indeed
was an inspiration to me.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:46.550 position:56%
And in fact, in the UK a memorial
scholarship was created in his name.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.990
And it was that scholarship
that brought me to the States

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.080
where I've spent the rest
of my professional life.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.720 position:56%
But what I want -- I was very
struck by his morality and his sense

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.240
of politics, first of all
with respect to civil rights.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.560
But then there was another
event that nobody has mentioned

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.860
and I wonder if you
have any comments.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:14.260
And that is Cuba and what he did
at that moment and in that crisis.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.390
I think that's also
extremely important.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.690
Thank you.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I think maybe
a little bit outside the scope

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.780
of all three of your books.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.080
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Actually --

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Actually, alright.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.680
We got a bite.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.980
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Cuba,
is that what you said?

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Cuba.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.930
Cuba and the Cuban missile crisis.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:35.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Yeah [laughing],
Cuba got Kennedy into a big mess.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.970
And he listened to his advisors
when he probably shouldn't have

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:45.680
and he was devastated by what
happened on the invasion.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.980
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.280
The October crisis.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.580
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
The missile crisis.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.880
&gt;&gt; The October crisis.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.180
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant:
Oh, the October crisis?

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.780
&gt;&gt; Thomas Oliphant: Yeah,
that's something different.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.560
That is a bit out of
my depth, I think.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.330
So I think we need to --

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.310
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Let me
just try very briefly one point.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Sure.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: And that is
that I think his astonishing, still,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.210
behavior during the missile crisis
-- I mean, the part I want to know,

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.240
and I talked to a friend at Harvard

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.120
who is beginning the next
big biography of Kennedy,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.280
I want to find the kid deep
in the bowels of the Pentagon

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.420 position:56%
who when they were searching for
something other than the alternative

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:35.080
of war or appeasement who
found the blockade idea.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:44.060
Because that's Kennedy at his best
-- experimental, looking for things

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.120
that nobody's thought of.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.420
That's him.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.040
But I'll tell you, the missile
crisis in some way is the cost

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.270
of his having been too
political about Cuba earlier.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:43:00.480
We found Lou Harris poll -- I mean,
it happened in civil rights too.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.370
Polls were driving a
lot of what he did.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:07.250
But on Cuba, after the
third debate with Nixon

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.800
where Nixon was doing better
on particularly on a couple

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.580
of foreign policy issues,
Lou Harris is the first guy

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.980
to be a full-time pollster
on a presidential campaign.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.370
And his analysis after the
debate (based on polling) said

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:28.040
that the issue that really has
America exercised right now is not

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.440
the Soviet Union.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.850
It's Cuba.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:35.780 position:56%
And that immediately led to some
truculent rhetoric on Kennedy's part

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.670
that I think helped lay the
basis for the Bay of Pigs

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:46.380
which in turn laid the basis for
those hideous 13 days in 1962.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Fascinating.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.690
So many stories that
we can tell up here.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:54.510
I want to thank all three
of you -- Steve, Kathy, Tom.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:44:02.880
[ Applause ]

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.180
Thank you.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.610
Fascinating perspectives
on the campaign

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.200
and the civil rights movement
and on the personal lives

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.710
of this extraordinary family.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.010
Thank you all.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.310
Thank you all.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.610
And enjoy your day.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.910
Enjoy the book festival.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.710
Thanks for coming.
