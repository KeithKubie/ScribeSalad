tragedy from an underlying feminine
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679
tragedy from an underlying feminine
symbolically feminine unconsciousness

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
symbolically feminine unconsciousness
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.060
symbolically feminine unconsciousness
right and it's something that can always

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
right and it's something that can always
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070
right and it's something that can always
be pulled back into that unconsciousness

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
be pulled back into that unconsciousness
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649
be pulled back into that unconsciousness
that would be the microcosm of that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
that would be the microcosm of that
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390
that would be the microcosm of that

family allele dynamic where the mother

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
family allele dynamic where the mother
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310
family allele dynamic where the mother
was so over protective and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
was so over protective and
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929
was so over protective and
all-encompassing that she interferes

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
all-encompassing that she interferes
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.340
all-encompassing that she interferes
with the development of the competence

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
with the development of the competence
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.170

not only of her sons but also of her
daughters of her children in general and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
daughters of her children in general and
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070
daughters of her children in general and
it seems to me that that's the dynamic

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
it seems to me that that's the dynamic
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.109
it seems to me that that's the dynamic
that's being played out in our society

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
that's being played out in our society
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120
that's being played out in our society
right now is that there's this and it's

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
right now is that there's this and it's
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740
right now is that there's this and it's
it's related in some way that I don't

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
it's related in some way that I don't
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929
it's related in some way that I don't
understand to this to this insistence

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
understand to this to this insistence
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999
understand to this to this insistence
that all forms of masculine Authority

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
that all forms of masculine Authority
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280
that all forms of masculine Authority
are nothing but tyrannical power so the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
are nothing but tyrannical power so the
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.880
are nothing but tyrannical power so the
symbolic representation is tyrannical

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
symbolic representation is tyrannical
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280
symbolic representation is tyrannical
father with no appreciation for the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
father with no appreciation for the
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560
father with no appreciation for the
benevolent father and benevolent mother

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
benevolent father and benevolent mother
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020
benevolent father and benevolent mother
with no appreciation whatsoever for the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
with no appreciation whatsoever for the
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969
with no appreciation whatsoever for the
tyrannical mother right and that's that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
tyrannical mother right and that's that
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219
tyrannical mother right and that's that
and because I thought of ideologies as

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
and because I thought of ideologies as
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020
and because I thought of ideologies as
fragmentary mythologies that's where

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
fragmentary mythologies that's where
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580
fragmentary mythologies that's where
they get their archetypal and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
they get their archetypal and
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709
they get their archetypal and
psychological power right and so in a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
psychological power right and so in a
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.929
psychological power right and so in a
balanced representation you have the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
balanced representation you have the
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.719
balanced representation you have the
terrible mother and the great mother as

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729
terrible mother and the great mother as
 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.700
terrible mother and the great mother as
Norman laid out so nicely and you have

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
Norman laid out so nicely and you have
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320
Norman laid out so nicely and you have
the terrible father and the great father

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
the terrible father and the great father
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.360
the terrible father and the great father
so that's the fact that culture mangles

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
so that's the fact that culture mangles
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.680
so that's the fact that culture mangles
you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690
you
 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.810
you
to death well it's also promoting you in

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820
to death well it's also promoting you in
 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.700
to death well it's also promoting you in
developing you you have to see that as

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710
developing you you have to see that as
 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.350
developing you you have to see that as
balanced and then you have the heroic

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
balanced and then you have the heroic
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.660
balanced and then you have the heroic
and adversarial individual but in the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
and adversarial individual but in the
 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.670
and adversarial individual but in the
postmodern world and this seems to be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
postmodern world and this seems to be
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.950
postmodern world and this seems to be
something that's increasingly seeping

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960
something that's increasingly seeping
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.510
something that's increasingly seeping
out into the culture at large you have

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520
out into the culture at large you have
 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.310
out into the culture at large you have
nothing but the tyrannical father

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320
nothing but the tyrannical father
 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.040
nothing but the tyrannical father
nothing but the destructive force of

and it's a it's an appalling ideology
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.160
and it's a it's an appalling ideology
and it seems to me that it's sucking the
