1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,670
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,700
Did I have to say archaeologists like
to insult me by calling me a pseudo

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:09,270
scientist?

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,090
I can't think of anything
more pseudoscientific than
the Clovis first doctrine,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,740
which locked American archeology for
50 years in a particular framework,

6
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:24,270
which we now know was totally wrong.
Nothing good about it at all. Uh,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,740
a complete mistake.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,430
What I'm hoping the book will do in the
long run is that it will lead to more

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,200
attention being focused on the Americas.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,250
This is a very neglected
area of the world. Uh,

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,520
as far as deep and ancient
archeology goes, I'm, it's,

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,120
the recent history of the Americas
has been relatively well studied,

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:48,480
but the deep and ancient history has
not been, has not been well studied.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,900
And I think America is going to contain
revelations for us about our story and

15
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,810
about our past.
And I'm serious when I,

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,050
when I suggest that America is the most
plausible and the most likely homebase

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,510
for a lost civilization. If you're
going to propose a loss of realization,

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,660
you need, there are certain
preconditions. You need a,

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,520
you can't have it on a small island.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,090
There's got to be a large land mass with
enormous resources and the ability for

21
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,780
population to grow and for those
resources to be, to be mobilized.

22
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,310
And what I suddenly realized,
you asked earlier why I,

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,320
why I started to write this book at all
is what the new evidence is pointing to

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,750
is that the Americas have
been wrongly neglected.

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
That here we have a giant continental
land mass with extraordinary resources

26
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,540
that has just been ruled out of
the story of human civilization.

27
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,541
But once we take account of the fact that
there was a giant cataclysm over North

28
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,280
America 12,000,
800 years ago,

29
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:52,281
and once we start looking as I do in
America before at the incredible deep

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,380
indepth similarities between,
for example,

31
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,190
the religious system of ancient
Egypt and the religious system of the

32
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,210
Mississippi Valley,

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,470
then you realize that you're into or
into a global mystery here and that the

34
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:09,030
answer to that mystery may not at all be
in the old world and may very much be,

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,320
uh, in the, in the Americas. See, it's
odd. I mentioned Manville earlier on.

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,310
It's kind of odd that we should find a,

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,700
what is essentially the
ancient Egyptian religion, uh,

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,730
manifesting in the symbolism of Mountville
the ascent to a Ryan that transit to

39
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,230
the Milky Way, the journey
along the Milky Way. Very,

40
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,190
these are very specific
and idiosyncratic ideas.

41
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,490
And what makes it doubly hard
is Mountville isn't that old.

42
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,730
Manville as a site is
about a thousand years old.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,820
Ancient Egypt had already been
gone completely from the world, uh,

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,970
for at least 600 years
before Manville was created.

45
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,130
The end of ancient Egypt.
There's, there's Manville and uh,

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,380
w w w what we're looking at in the
foreground is mount B and we're looking at

47
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,300
mount a and the in the,
in the distance, um, and,

48
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,480
and the complete circle of mountains.
What,

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,830
what is odd about it is we find this
system of ancient Egyptian ideas in

50
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:10,180
Manville 500 years after ancient Egypt
has gone from the world. The Romans,

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,160
the Romans were the end of ancient
Egypt by 400 d ancient Egypt has gone.

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,170
Manville doesn't even exist then,

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,380
but 600 years later it is created and
it manifests the entire set of ancient

54
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,161
Egyptian ideas.

55
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:27,610
Clearly it did not get that as a result
of direct transmission from ancient

56
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,140
Egypt unless they were time travelers.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,730
The only way I think it could have got
it is as a result of a legacy pass down

58
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:38,410
from a much earlier civilization that has
influenced and affected many different

59
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,800
parts of the world and the
characteristics of that civilization.

60
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,030
There's the shamanistic heart of it, the
use of altered states of consciousness.

61
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:50,350
The focus on those are amongst the reasons
that I would suggest that America is

62
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:54,940
the place that we should be looking and
the big mysteries are in the areas that

63
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,510
were so devastated at the end of the
last ice age up in the north of North

64
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:03,340
America, the channeled scab
lands in particular and
then the Mississippi Valley.

65
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,380
The whole story of the Mississippi Valley.
Yes,

66
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,880
Mountville is a thousand years old,

67
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,080
but then you can go back to
poverty point in Louisiana,

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,690
which is 2,700 years old.

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,430
You can go to Watson break in Louisiana,
which is 5,500 years old.

70
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,820
You can go to sites like Conley,
which are 8,000 years old.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,580
The system keeps on going back and
disappearing back into time, and I,

72
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,420
I think the most fruitful new work on
exploring the origins of civilization is

73
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,020
going to occur counterintuitively
in the Americas,

74
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,380
the very last place on earth that
archeologists have ever thought to look.
