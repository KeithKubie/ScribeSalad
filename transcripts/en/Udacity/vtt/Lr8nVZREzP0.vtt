00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay, I had a question. Now, why would the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.210
lactase gene be turned off in the first place?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.630
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, but we should really flip

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.960
it around and ask why would the lactase gene be

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.720
turned back on in the first place? Evolutionarily speaking, the

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.240
natural state is for the lactase gene to turn off

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.110
after you're weaned off of breast milk. So, the question

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.290
of why it turned back on, we really need to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.940
go talk to an expert who can tell us a

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.210
lot about human evolution and the trait of lactose intolerance.
