00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.960
&gt;&gt; Today is a special vision to
imagine a biography as literary,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.460
you know, the story arc
is not yours to chart.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.960
A life was lived and an author
as skilled as Stacy Schiff has

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.666
to respect the facts of that life.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.016
But within those confines, she
was among a very few writers

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.316
who can infuse true long ago stories
with the benefits of storytelling.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.070
Gorgeous sentences are
essential, but also,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.613
an ability to infuse emotion and
enliven events that she did not see,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.353
but surely, someone else did.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.790
Prize awarding panels
anticipate each of her next books

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.853
like a time travel experience

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.573
that readers could not have
known were available to them.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.556
Through her extraordinary efforts,
readers get an intimate portrait,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.936
for instance, of the half century
Nabokov marriage, in which husband

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.736
and wife were equally committed,
not just to a literally livelihood,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.650
but to a transportation out
of quotidian household woes

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.933
and toward a lofty, idealistic
dual commitment to art.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.876
Similarly, she has sent
readers aloft into the mysteries

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.180
of "The Aviator" and "Little Prince"
author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.506
and then later, endeavoring to
revisit the Boulevard des years

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.720
of a founding father in Paris.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.880
I keep thinking of her recent book
as Benjie Franklin, The Sexy Years.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.600
&gt;&gt; That's preparation, of course,
for her next, which is Cleopatra.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.330
On behalf of the festival organizers

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.796
and the many indefatigable
volunteers today, and of course,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.710
my hardworking colleagues
at the Washington Post,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.596
I'm honored to welcome and
to hear from Stacy Schiff.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.573
Thanks for turning out.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.373
I suspect you're all melting out
there 'cause I'm melting up here.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.573
If you inferred from these
remarks that I have no life

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.790
of my own, you are correct.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.373
But I have been through this
biography business a few times,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.770
and I have the following
observation to offer.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.160
No matter how wisely, how
careful you choose your subject,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.870
you wind up with one
of two problems.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.186
You either have the needle in
the haystack problem as I did

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.546
when I started out on
the life of Mrs. Nabokov,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.200
the wife of the writer, a woman who
was pathologically private, stoic,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.410
selfless, formal, all qualities
that make for a lousy book, or--

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.340
and nothing could be
worse, I decided after this.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.840
And so, I went on to write a book

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.140
about Benjamin Franklin's
exhaustively documented years

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.073
in France, thereby incurring the
haystack in the haystack problem,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.300
in which I assure you,
nothing could be worse.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.046
For those eight years that
Franklin spends in France,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.163
that they're the eight years of the
American Revolution and the peace

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.696
that follows, the documentation here
in America is two and a half times

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.330
as great as it is for the
rest of his life combined.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.093
And that's not counting
the French materials.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.660
In Paris, Franklin was
surrounded by a net of French spies

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.110
who were surrounded by
a net of British spies,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.516
and as far as I can tell, each of
these men was paid by the word.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.596
Nothing, nothing-- I promise you--

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.620
was too trivial for them to
report on, including the state

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.076
of Franklin's laundry, which
was always immaculately white,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.003
and his dinner menu.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.493
There was a precocious
amount of apple pie consumed

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.113
by his household, by the way.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.373
Everyone who owned a pen wrote
a memoir in the 18th century,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.406
and those who didn't
appear to own a newspaper.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.406
They were both official
French newspapers

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.870
and unofficial French newspapers,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.033
and their reports reliably
contradicted each other.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.550
I might add that John Adams
was also in Paris at the time.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.226
He appears to have
owned several pens.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.556
He missed his wife dreadfully,
he had very little to do,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.086
and he wrote a great deal
about Benjamin Franklin.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.746
But that's another story.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.013
I should also say, actually,
in deference to Richard Holmes,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.536
I thought of Richard Daley--
because I spent a year and a half

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.046
in Paris doing this research-- most
of Franklin's materials did not get

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.200
through to the American Congress.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.990
So the best place to
read them is the Ministry

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.876
of Foreign Affairs in Paris.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.320
And Richard has a wonderful line on
one f his essays about the problem

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.706
with doing any kind
of research in Paris,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.216
is that if your editor calls you
and they find that you're not home,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.646
they assume that you're
out having a good time.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.853
I just wanna go in
the record of saying

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.520
that I wasn't having a good time.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.386
I was in the archives
everyday, which was great

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.683
if you don't mind working under low
light and turning over your passport

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.683
and arriving at the appointed
time and reserving your documents

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.730
in advance and filling out a
pass to go to the ladies room

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.826
and not complaining when the
archivist go out on strike.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.300
[ Laughter ]

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.700
&gt;&gt; So what then did
Benjamin Franklin

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.233
and Cleopatra have in common?

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.596
Or put another way, why would a
relatively experienced predominantly

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.490
sane biographer, who is neither
Greek nor Latin, and who's happiest

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.913
in a dusty archive, attempt a
biography of a 1st century queen.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.870
Let me say at the outset that
I didn't think entirely--

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.143
I wasn't entirely sure
it was possible.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.020
I'd had Cleopatra in my mind
as a subject for a long time,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.710
but I just didn't see a way to write
a traditional chronicle of her life.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.596
She fascinated me for
every possible reason.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.880
I kept thinking of her as
that sort of rare combination

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.896
of Delilah meets Catherine the
Great meets Jackie O, you know.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.606
It was sort of history and
legend all bound together.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.240
And from the biographer's
point of view,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.316
this was really the Mount Everest.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.416
The idea struck me less though
as biography than paleontology.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.940
We may live in the post-factual
age as someone recently said,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.053
but she lived in a pre-factual one.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.230
I was probably most fascinated

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.420
because I was startled
by my own ignorance.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.230
Here was a woman whom we think of
as Egyptian, but who was in fact,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.250
Greek, whom we remember
as beautiful,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.520
but whom every ancient chroniclers
swore was more intelligent

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.876
and more charming than
she was beautiful.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.080
Here was a woman whom we had
somehow conflated with Nefertiti

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.406
who lived 1300 years
before Cleopatra,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.900
and to whom Cleopatra
was not even related.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.366
And here was a woman who
successfully ruled a rich

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.650
and fractious country
for over two decades.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.950
She's the only woman in
antiquity who ruled by herself,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320
whom we have reduced to
the slinky seductress.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.140
She was however, and not so
incidentally, the richest person,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.086
man or woman, in the
Mediterranean world,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.336
she lived in the most
cultured city of her day.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.476
Alexandria at the time is really
the center of culture of all.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.463
Rome is still a backwater.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.100
And hers was the most
enlightened of atmospheres.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.086
She knew things that would be
forgotten until the renaissance,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.566
the value of pie, the
behavior of linear perspective,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.633
the existence of the equator.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.570
And gender mattered less than
competence in her palace,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.786
as it did generally
in Egypt at the time.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.320
In Cleopatra's Egypt, women
operated mills, and they owned land,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.020
they leased vineyards, they divorced
husbands, they inherited equally.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.710
In short, they enjoyed rights
that they would not again enjoy

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.050
for something like 2000 years.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.446
And yet, after all of that,
Cleopatra melt into a puddle

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.066
of myths and misconceptions.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.243
She has become to us a
cigarette, a mascara, a videogame,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.770
a slot machine, a strip club, or
a synonym for Elizabeth Taylor.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.633
And at this time of year, you will
see her name all over the internet

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.640
because hers is the most
popular of Halloween costumes.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.020


00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.026
Someone asked me recently
when I realized

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.736
that this book could
actually be written,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.040
and I answered a little
glibly but not inaccurately,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.103
that I realized it could be
written when I finished writing it,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.403
but there was another moment.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:00.870
There was one other moment in truth.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.736
It was when I finally
noticed that we had an act--

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.736
we had actual 2000 year
old quotes from Cleopatra,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.503
and that we could hear just the
tiniest murmur of her voice.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.063
For the most part,
that's thanks to Plutarch.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.930
On the one hand, it pays to remember

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.746
that Plutarch was writing a good
century after Cleopatra's death.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:20.966
He is as far removed from her
as we are from Ulysses grant.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.860
On the other, as a modern
biographer recently reminded me,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:28.546
there were no tape recorders
in the 19th century either.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.593
It goes without saying that quoted
material is generally approximate.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.293
And as I learned from Ben Franklin,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.280
even the most comprehensive material
can refuse to give up answers.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.130
Probably, I couldn't see
my way to writing Cleopatra

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.636
until those years buried
in Franklin's archive.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.873
Five years in those miles and miles
of paper, and I still can't tell you

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.620
who the mother of his son was.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.286
I doubt anyone ever will.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.210
And I knew there were questions
that could never be answered,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.616
but I also knew that that had
nothing to do with the millennia

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:04.513
that separate us from Cleopatra.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.590
What went on between Virginia
Woolf and her brother,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.533
how did Shelley die, what
was the problem really

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.580
with Emily Dickinson,
where is Jimmy Hoffa.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.886
None of these questions
have answers either.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.226
In some cases, they have answers--

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.890
they don't have answers because we
have an overload of information.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.796
Too many accounts can
spoil the truth.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.266
How then was it possible
to write about her?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.293
I should probably mention
at this juncture

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:33.760
that I'm here on false pretenses.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.946
It is true that I have written
a biography of Cleopatra,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.936
but it is not true that you can
buy it today, because it isn't

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.810
on sale for another two weeks.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.410
But then you can buy it.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.276
You could buy several
copies, in fact.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.743
And the one-- and it's beautiful,
so you might wanna buy one

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.900
for your living room table
and the other to read.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.590
And the one you wanna buy is the
one with my name, Stacy Schiff,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.116
on it, not the other one.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:55.713
Anyway, its publication
date is November 1st.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.030
But let me go back to that line of
dialogue and Plutarch for a minute.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.510
&gt;&gt; It comes in the course of a
marvelous account of Cleopatra

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.310
and Mark Antony out fishing on a
carefree Alexandrian afternoon.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:10.956
Plutarch meant to use the incident

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.023
to illustrate what he calls
Antony's boyish pranks,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.850
but it offers something
else as well.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.650
The most accomplished
military commander of his day,

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.916
Antony is unable to
lure a single fish

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.440
from the fertile waters of Egypt.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.766
Humiliated, it's always worse
when you have your girlfriend

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.230
at your side and even worse
when she's the queen of Egypt,

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.103
he arranges for one of his servants

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.770
to attach several pre-caught
fish to his line.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.673
And these, he begins to reel in one
after the other with great gusto.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.546
The scam is not lost in Cleopatra.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.463
She is competitive by nature, and
she has very impish sense of humor.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.586
And so, she arranges for
all of their friends to come

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.600
and watch her highly skilled
roman friend the next day.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.140
When she also arranges is
for one of her servants

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.386
to attach an imported salted
herring to Mark Antony's hook,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.240
and this he pulls from the waters
of Egypt to peals of laughter.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.183
On the spot, she advises him to
forget about fishing and attend

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.643
to his real responsibilities.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.186
He is meant to be hunting,
not for fish, but for cities,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.406
kingdoms, and continents.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.390
She's sly and she's saucy, but
there is also something a little bit

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.250
familiar on her tone.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.173
It's one known to every woman whose
husband owns a set of golf clubs.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.806
Of course, it also made me
wonder about Plutarch's wife.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.913
So yes, there were some
terrific constraints.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.006
I was used to knowing what
my subject had had for dinner

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.290
and what he or she fretted
about before he fell asleep.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.403
And in this case, the record
was as skewed as it was spotty.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.030
All bets were off.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.480
The Nile is not where it used to
be, ancient Alexandria is lost,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:55.993
some of it is in the harbor of
Alexandria, and I don't scuba dive.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.610
The Egyptian coastline has changed,
so have the language, the culture,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.123
the religion on the calendar.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.593
Don't even ask me about the prices.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.486
And you have to get used
to counting backward too.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.706
I mean, Cleopatra was born
in '69 and she dies in 30 BC.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.240
This drove the copy editor crazy.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.080
Essentially, you check all
your preconceptions at the door

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.546
when you enter the world of
Ptolemies, Cleopatra's dynasty.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.053
It's difficult to write
about maternity in a family

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.816
where children routinely
poisoned their parents

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.690
and parents dismember
their children.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.710
This was admittedly new to me.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.626
At the same time, great literature
is about ambiguity, and it struck me

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.470
that biography could
occasionally afford to be as well.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:43.810
You can't demand order, even
answers, at the classical world.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.323
And arguably, you rarely can at all
when it comes to the human heart.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:52.860
But you can do a lot with it,
especially given the last 50 years

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.333
of fine scholarship on
the Hellenistic World.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.066
Virginia Woolf once remarked
of an imperfect novel

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.260
that the string didn't
quite unite the pearls,

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.526
but that the pearls were there.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.373
That was very much on
my mind as I worked,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.000
as was Julian Barnes' great
alternate definition of a net,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.813
a series of holes tied
together by string.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.076
There were huge unknowns, but
there were no knowns among them,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:19.940
several subjects that no one
had really approached before.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.920
For starters, there
was Cleopatra's wealth.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.190
There was her relationship
with Herod

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:28.376
and how the two rulers dealt very
differently with the rise of Rome.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.210
There was her education about
which we can be really specific

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:35.633
and which reveals a great deal
about how she thought and spoke,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.373
and of course, I have
one terrific advantage.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.280
Human nature is remarkably constant.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.046
It has changed not one iota
since the 1st Century BC.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.290
You can read Cicero and
how not to spoil a child,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.543
you can read countless text and
how women are shrill and unbending

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.676
in their demands, but
loose in their morals.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.820
They should stay home and
take care of the children.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.660
A friend of one's friend
was already one's enemy.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.613
Essentially, every
problem that Cleopatra had

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.660
with Rome is the problem that
a woman in power faces today

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.766
with very little variation and
arguably, better birth control.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.150
The successful woman is
sexualized, shrill, and unnatural.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.973
And when a woman sleeps with two of
the most successful and powerful men

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.140
of her day, she is a seductress,
even if both of those men happened

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.836
to be celebrated for their
voracious sexual appetite.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.140
It helps to remember, by the way,
that the commentators are human too,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.763
and we, all of us, write in
the time in which we live.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.170
Let me give you just one example.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.833
At the end of one of the best 20th
Century biography of Cleopatra,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.413
we see Cleopatra preparing to
meet Octavian who's defeated her.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:46.813
She has been on a hunger strike.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.146
It's the two of their
first interview,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.413
and its days before
she will kill herself.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.356
Here is how the biographer
introduces this fraught

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.603
and critical moment.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.736
I quote, "She was essentially
a woman.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:14:59.886
And now, in her condition
of physical weakness,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.233
she acted precisely as any
other overwrought member

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:04.646
of her sex might have behaved
under similar circumstances."

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.300
How we constitute and
reconstitute history was

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.410
on my mind all the way
through as I worked.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:15.903
This of course, is a central
problem always in writing history.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.820
Those closest to events
have the best information

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.826
and the most at stake.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.330
The most informed source is
also the most involved source,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.110
the later chroniclers know
less, but they can say more.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.586
With each book, I've been well
into the work before I realized

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:35.886
that there was something
utterly rudimentary

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:37.770
that I had forgotten to research.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.690
In this case, it was that I needed
to understand precisely who the men

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.423
who left as Cleopatra's story were.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.820
I had gone to the desert
where Cleopatra was exiled.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.826
I had soaked up the Alexandrian
color, all of it before I realize

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.933
that I needed to know my sources,
as well as I knew my subject.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.066
Of those who actually knew
Cleopatra and who wrote

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.480
about her, there are three.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.436
Julius Caesar who was married to
someone else during their affair

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.323
and focused on Rome and
understandably reluctant

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.990
to mention Cleopatra,
Nicolaus of Damascus,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.640
the source for her dealings with
Herod who had been the tutor

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.173
to her children and who
changed sides after her death,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.293
and Cicero who rarely had
a kind word for anyone

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.416
and who could really not stomach
a smart, rich, educated woman

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.386
with a quick wit and a
better library than he had.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:29.910
I tried to always keep in
mind who was a sensationalist

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.283
and who was scold, who
had set eyes on Egypt,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.150
and who despised the place.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.703
From those endless French
newspapers of the 1770's,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.450
I knew the difference too,
between propaganda and hearsay.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.823
In Cleopatra's case, we
owe a huge debt to both.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.083
Biased and inaccurate
though they may have been,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:51.956
the Romans who left us her
story did us a tremendous favor.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.733
Normally, women are
difficult to write about,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.803
they keep lousy records,
and their lives tend

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.130
to slip through the cracks.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.580
Cleopatra owes her
immortality to her enemies.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:05.763
Had they hated her less, they would
not have preserved her for us.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.623
She's one of the few women

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.446
in history whose detractors have
enlarged, rather than erased,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.933
her role, just one of the
few losers whom we remember.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.756
Had she been a man, she would
have been forgotten today,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.803
like most of the other eastern
sovereigns whom Rome eliminated.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.976
And for the record, had
Rome not intervened,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.056
had Cleopatra been
dealt a stronger hand,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.566
she would have faced a different
but equally vicious enemy.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.980
In the normal course of events, she
would have been deposed, poisoned,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.473
or hacked to pieces, or exiled
by one of her own four children,

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:42.840
in which case, we would never
have heard of her at all.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240
Thank you.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.740
[ Applause ]

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.523
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.336
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.203
Could you say something about
how well Cleopatra understood the

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:08.963
strategies that the different
Roman factions were practicing

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.496
against her, and therefore kind

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.536
of assess her political
acuity and deftness?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.940
Thank you.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.740
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.273
Essentially, what Cleopatra is left

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.586
with is a Rome completely pulled
apart by civil wars, and especially

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.426
after Caesar's death,
the great conundrum

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.693
for her is whom to side with.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.056
I mean, she has banked entirely on
Caesar, she's in Rome at the time

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.586
of his murder, she may in fact be
contributing factor to his murder,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.510
and all chaos, as many of you
know, suddenly breaks loose.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.223
So which of the possible
successors should she side with?

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:46.546
And it's very clear that
for the first year or so,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.926
she tries to sit things out.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.923
Everyone comes calling, it's almost
like a fairytale moment where,

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.323
you know, each picture in turn
comes to see if she will back them,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.070
and she definitely temporizes.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.736
There's a real hesitation
there to figure

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.536
out whom she should
ally herself with.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.803
And of course, in the end,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.803
she chooses Mark Antony,
Caesar's protege.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.670
It's interesting when
you think about it

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.483
because had she allied herself
with Octavian who becomes Augustus,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.266
who would have seen the
unlikeliest of choices,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.580
all would have worked
out very differently.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.213
But at that time, he seemed like
he was entirely the dark horse

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:20.946
and Antony made a great
deal of sense.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.466
And what's fascinating there is just
the way she adapts herself to each

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.760
of the factions in turn and does try
to do her best to supply everyone

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.313
with what he asks so
as to hedge her bets.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.400
There's a real sense of
political strategy with her.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.710
Yes?

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.756
&gt;&gt; I wondered what languages
besides Latin you had to work off

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.463
of for your original sources,
and did you have any issues

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.843
with the translations that were
made of these original sources.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.453
&gt;&gt; The only two languages that-- as
a smart person would have learned

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.180
for this book where Latin and
Greek, neither of which I have.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:19:59.813
What I did do, and which
helped tremendously,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.653
was to compare translations, because
needless to say, over the years,

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:07.556
there have been rather
a few translations

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.023
of Suetonius or Plutarch or Dio.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.170
&gt;&gt; And in some-- in
comparing those translations,

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.643
a lot of nuance falls out.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.310
So there was a great deal
for me of going back and back

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.926
over various passages with someone
who is, in fact, an expert in Greek,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.233
and trying to see what
meanings I could leach

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:25.646
from sort of between the lines.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.020
It's a nightmare for me not
to be able to speak a language

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.873
in which these sources exist.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.163
On the other hand, these
sources are so much later.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.723
These are-- these men
are writing 100 and 150

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.310
and 200 years after Cleopatra.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.990
I didn't feel as if
the literal word,

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.430
there were no letters
from Cleopatra.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.763
There was, alas, no diary.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:46.673
So I didn't feel as if my being
unable to read her was going

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.370
to be an issue, as it would
have with the Nabokov's.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.063
The Nabokov's did me a huge
favor, because in their letters,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.310
when they wrote something
intimate to each other,

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.490
they broke from Russian and
they wrote it in French,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.263
which I do speak and read.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.796
So that they could be talking
about, you know, who was gonna take

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.463
out the laundry in Russian, and
then it would suddenly break

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.680
in into this wonderfully
intimate romantic paragraph

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.180
of French, blessedly.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
Yes?

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.386
&gt;&gt; Would you-- can you hear me?

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.223
What do you think of
Cleopatra's political background?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.213
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Cleopatra's?

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.290
&gt;&gt; Political background.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.556
&gt;&gt; Her political background?

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.423
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.956
She was clearly schooled to rule
and in those days what was great

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.993
or what was interesting anyway is
that pretty much anyone of the--

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.186
any one of the children was
educated in the same way.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.706
And it's fairly clear to us today.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.893
And this was something that
fascinated me which it seemed

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:42.373
to me now when I touched before.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.973
It's pretty clear what
she would have read

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.373
and what she would have studied.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.760
And in fact her education,
her sense of rhetoric,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.243
her training in rhetoric would
have been nearly identical

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.530
to that of Caesar.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.823
And the text that were known
to her and memorized by her,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.370
much of it Homer, Aeschylus,
Euripides were the same texts

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.196
that anyone living
anywhere in the Greek world,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.476
anyone of an elite
education living anywhere

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.010
in the Greek world
would also have known

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:12.980
so that you very much
spoke a common language.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.333
And it was from those texts that you
really drew your political lessons.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.346
Did she know her Egyptian history?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.880
I can't imagine she didn't.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.813
Have we any proof of that?

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.210
No. Yes?

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.210
&gt;&gt; Would you say that
there is any woman today

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.676
that symbolizes Cleopatra's
situation?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640


00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.660
&gt;&gt; I have a hard time
thinking of anyone

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:39.880
who would dismember her children.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.546
&gt;&gt; They may have political--

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.480
&gt;&gt; Although actually no, I
don't I can't think of someone.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680
[Laughter] No.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.013
I think that, I think the gustiness

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.746
of Cleopatra I mean I think
there's a huge amount of strategy.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.223
This was a woman who was a champion
strategist and who could be ruthless

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.270
and who could truly plot
out a military campaign.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.100
Is there an exact parallel
to that of someone today?

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:10.476
No. But I think there are numerous
women we could all name who've shown

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.356
those qualities.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.073
What's unusual about
Cleopatra is that she comes

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.573
from a line of female rulers.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.040
She has plenty of female
role models.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.536
So there have been, there were
other women in Egyptian history

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.543
who had done what she did,

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.076
whereas for us this is now
something of a novelty.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:30.143
So she's coming at it interestingly

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:31.816
in a less traditional
way than we are.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.003
&gt;&gt; I think I've broken it.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.493
I'm just wondering why
you have chosen biography

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.220
as your particular form
of historical writing.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.626
Do you think biography helps
us get at certain political

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.316
or historical social
questions in a different way,

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:56.036
or do you think it lands more
compelling research and writing?

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.463
&gt;&gt; You know, someone once described
biography I think very accurately

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.210
as gossip with footnote.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.006
[Laughter] I'm really
good on the footnotes,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.273
although I never knew I
wrote vertical footnotes

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.073
until Richard spoke just now.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.563
Human nature interest me greatly and
I think as a reader I always prefer

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:14.506
to come to my history through
the character of someone else

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.563
and through the live intelligence
and personality of someone else.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.970
It just makes it more accessible.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:24.293
Somehow, it makes it more exciting,
but that's my reader's answer.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.113
My writer's answer is that
I quick early on discovered

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.216
that I loved having
this parallel existence,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.410
that I loved living two lives.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:36.436
I've long wanted to write an essay

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.403
about how the biographer's two
lives, the life she writes about

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.803
but she understands
and the life she lives

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.470
of which she is completely clueless.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.200
And there's the sense there always
of just being able to see the world

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:49.676
through two different optics
which I find hugely appealing.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.296
And the other and obvious reason I
suppose is that when I began writing

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.340
and I have no idea how to write a
book, although I had been an editor,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.926
biography appealed because it
has a very natural beginning,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.380
middle and end.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.380
And it's a very easy kind of--

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.846
it seemed to me a relatively
easy thing to structure.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.170
There's also a very gratifying
element to biography of course

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.990
which is that no matter
what happens,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.190
in the end you get
to kill your subject.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.590
[ Laughter ]

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.590
[ Pause ]

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.123
&gt;&gt; Two quick questions.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.013
What are you reading now
and what are some ideas

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.783
for future biographies?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.470
&gt;&gt; Just a little louder.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.350
&gt;&gt; What are you reading now
and what are some future ideas

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.123
for biographies, individuals?

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.843
&gt;&gt; What I'm reading now is almost
inevitably fiction and I don't know

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.310
if that's because I feel
nonfiction as homework but I--

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.660
or because I just-- I so-- and I'm
such a sucker for literary style

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.023
that I would almost always prefer to
pick up a novel then I were to pick

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.406
up a biography which I
can always be guaranteed

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.013
to find perfect satisfaction.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.530
And so what I'm reading now

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.643
and of course we're all reading now
is the Franzen, and what I'm reading

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.070
after that is just 'cause it's on
the night table is A Happy Marriage.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.030
But it's all fiction.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:13.163
There is nothing--
oh, that's not true.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.563
Run true now is George Washington
biography is on the table.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:17.260
But you know what, it's
gonna sink to the bottom.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.466
I can tell you now.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.520
As for my next subject,
like Richard I don't have

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.680
to answer that question.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.310
But if any of you has an idea,
please talk to me later, okay?

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.383
&gt;&gt; Can you say a little bit more
about the tradition of female rulers

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.296
that Cleopatra came from?

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.080
&gt;&gt; Cleopatra, as I said, is
the only ruler, the only woman

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.720
in antiquity to have ruled alone.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:50.090
For reasons that are not
entirely clear at least to me,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.240
there is a huge sense of equality
among the Ptolemies, her dynasty.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.240
The women and the men are equally
gifted at making decisions.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.350
Most of the other women who do rule
either rule temporarily or rule

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.293
in tandem with a little brother
or a husband or a brother

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:07.623
to whom she is married
for that matter,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.070
which is not Cleopatra's case.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.280
But there doesn't seem to be
a very serious distinction

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.993
between the genders
in terms of ruling.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.496
It seems either one of us it seems
to have gone over perfectly well.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.830
I'm sorry.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:24.416
I just forgot what I
was supposed to say.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.886
And where this comes from,
I mean, whether this is

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.633
because the goddess Isis is
such a powerful influence,

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:31.853
whether it's because it is--
there's just a sense that women

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.300
and men have been ruling
beautifully together for so long,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.196
whether it's because some of
those earlier Ptolemaic queens

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:44.323
where incredibly effective,
cruel but effective, is unclear.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:45.950
But what becomes abundantly clear is

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:47.836
that there was really no problem
accepting a female pharaoh

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.396
when Cleopatra came to the throne.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.243
It also-- it makes-- she makes
it much easier by getting rid

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.956
of her brothers and her other sister
which is always a helpful thing

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.276
to do when you're a monarch.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:03.543
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that there are no
letters or diaries from Cleopatra,

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.543
so how do we know so much
about her personality?

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:10.663
&gt;&gt; I'm still looking for the diary.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.663
How we know about the personality,
I thought those little glimpses

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.330
like the line I talked
about from Plutarch.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.673
And again here you're
squaring sources.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.880
But what's interesting is how
much the sources tend to repeat

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.210
or echo each other so that the
impishness that I referred to,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:29.786
for example her response to Antony

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:31.886
on the fishing expedition is very
much mirrored in other accounts

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.726
in which she is irreverent and sly

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.510
and by no means a docile
and unassuming presence.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.050
So I was taking my cues
from the material we have

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.860
which is I say is 100 or 200
or 300 years after her birth.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.306
But time moved differently
in those days.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.780
I don't need to tell you this.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.646
It was slower in those days.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.446
And there is a sense that
these stories that were handed

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.046
down were being handed
down with some consistency.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.576
&gt;&gt; In response to your
request for a new topic,

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.176
I think John Hay [phonetic]
would be--

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:07.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.843
&gt;&gt; -- a good one.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.443
[Laughter] I don't think that there
has been a one volume good biography

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.110
on him but I also do
have a question.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.110
As somebody who myself would one day

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.863
like to enter the historical writing
field, so now as I feel overwhelmed

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:20.883
by the fact that so much has
already been written and obviously

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.736
when you write something new you
don't wanna repeat what others have

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.390
already said.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.563
You want your own perspective,
something new, something different,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.083
something that's not
gonna bore people.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.240
How do you go finding your own
personal perspective on subjects?

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.193
&gt;&gt; That's also a great question.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.840
I long ago interviewed
Joe Ellis [phonetic]

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.676
from something I was writing
about the anxiety of influence

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.473
with the previous biographers
and I asked him

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.480
where do you read the
secondary sources?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.773
I think I was working on
Ben Franklin at that time.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.973
Do you read the 376 other Franklin
biographies, and he was very clear

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.020
about saying that is
essentially a Bermuda Triangle.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.086
Do not go there.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.486
You will never emerge.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.286
You will spend the next five years
reading the secondary sources.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.616
&gt;&gt; So what I have done in so far
as I have been saying about that is

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.356
to decide that it's my
Franklin or it's my Cleopatra.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.380
And what's different are
not necessarily the answers

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:15.766
or the materials, it's
the questions we ask.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.340
So I'm bringing to the
subject questions or problems

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.716
that the previous biographer
didn't bring

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.153
or the previous hundred
biographers didn't bring and that

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.170
that those secondary materials
are just gonna have to lie there.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.173
It's easier when you
don't have to read them.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.586
For this book I felt there were
some secondary sources I had to read

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.513
because there was so
little primary material.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:37.420
For Ben Franklin, it was really easy

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:39.806
to ignore all secondary
materials except one

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:42.513
that concerned minor characters.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.460
I mean, I think I read a lot of
biographies of the Lee brothers,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:47.593
the people who came in
peripherally to my story.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.540
Yes?

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.073
&gt;&gt; How do you know somebody hasn't
asked it if you haven't read them?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.540
[ Laughter ]

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.340
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.273
I don't. I could be wrong.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.340
I'll just cross my fingers.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.540
We're done.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.873
Thank you very much.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.920
