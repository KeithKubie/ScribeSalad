00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.230
- Wewahitchka High School is
a great little school here.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.200
It's a rural area, about
350 kids, seven through 12.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.260
A great school though,
our kids are interested

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.270
in bettering themselves.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.020
Ms. Cameron Totman is a
reading ELA teacher here,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.490
English Language Arts teacher.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.390
Particularly what
impressed me about Cameron

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.470
is she wants to individualize
education for each student.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.920
She's jumping on the LearnStorm

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.600
at the Kahn Academy as one of her tools.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.640
- The activity that you guys

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
are gonna do next is talking
about the growth mind-set.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.860
I was introduced to LearnStorm this year

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.630
by one of our math teachers
who was participating.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.920
She thought that we would benefit

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.580
from the growth mindset content

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.830
and activities that came with LearnStorm.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.860
- One thing that I learned from

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.200
the growth mindset activities is that

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.330
your intelligence can grow,
just like your muscles can grow.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.630
And that's something
that really stuck with me

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.705
'cause I didn't know that before.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.288
(upbeat music)

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.170
- This is my first year
actually using Kahn Academy

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.780
in a classroom and I've found
it extremely valuable tool.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.580
I was teaching a class for students

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.650
who were trying to
improve their test score

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.970
on the SAT and ACT and
so we found some specific

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.743
lessons that worked really well with them.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.930
Definitely the LearnStorm
portion of the program

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.110
was more enjoyable to students I think,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.270
then just the regular skills
practice that they were doing.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.370
They were motivated by seeing their daily

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.104
progress on that progress tracker.

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:41.104
(students cheering)

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:47.140
- LearnStorm really helps me
because it really helped me

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.623
realize that I had more
potential than I thought I did.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.731
- LearnStorm made everything
fun, made learning fun.

00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:58.020
LearnStorm helped me build more confidence

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.390
and believing in myself
that I can do this.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.300
I don't really think I would have

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.063
got through high school without it.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.600
- [Cameron] I think the biggest
impact that LearnStorm had

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.610
on my students this year
was for those students

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.120
who really took the time and engaged

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600
in the self reflection activities.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.760
They've learned the skill of goal setting.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.100
They've learned things that are going

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.030
to affect them their whole lives

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.233
and they're going to be able
to keep going and keep growing.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.300
- [Jay] The world is
going digital and we need

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.520
to start up finding good
digital resources in schools.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.830
Kahn Academy has been the first one that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.780
I felt like could be a significant,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690
a very significant part of a curriculum

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.099
here at Wewahitchka high school.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.682
(upbeat music)
