00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.233
Voiceover: The Cozy Car Company

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:05.772
ships some of their new cars to Japan and Vietnam.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.833
The number of cars that will be shipped to Japan

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:12.103
during the next t months is modeled by the function

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:15.833
j of t is equal to 2 to the tth power.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.035
The number of cars that will be shipped to Vietnam

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:21.633
during the next t months is modeled by the function

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.433
v of t is equal to 2t squared.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:29.101
Which country had received more cars

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.833
from the Cozy Car Company after 5 months,

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.566
or will have received after 5 months?

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.192
Let's see how much Japan is going to receive after 5 months.

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:39.633
t is in months,

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:45.567
so j of 5 is going to be equal to 2 to the 5th power,

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:50.433
which is equal to 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.301
and let's see,

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.334
2 times just 4, 8, 16, 32.

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:58.567
Japan will have received 32 cars,

00:00:58.567 --> 00:00:59.900
and Vietnam,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.633
so v of 5 is going to be 2 times 5 squared,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:11.059
which is going to be 2 times 25, which is equal to 50.

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:12.634
Based on these 2 models

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.100
for how much they're going to receive after t months,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.568
after 5 months, Vietnam is going to receive,

00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:23.534
Vietnam is going to receive more cars.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.667
I guess the answer to that is Vietnam.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.200
Vietnam will have received more cars after 5 months.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.767
Which country had received more cars

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.366
from the Cozy Car Company,

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.333
or will have received more cars after 7 months?

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:42.333
Once again, let's try this out.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.433
j of 7 is equal to 2 to the 7th power.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:46.967
Let's see.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.633
2 to the 6th is going to be 32 times ...

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:55.233
we can read this as 2 to the 5th times 2 times 2,

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.700
which is going to be equal to,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.367
this is going to be equal to 32 times 4,

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:05.100
which is 128 cars after 7 months will have gone to Japan,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.900
and to Vietnam,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.049
v of 7 is going to be equal to 2 times 7 squared,

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.833
so that's equal to 2 times 49,

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:18.366
which is equal to 98 cars.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:22.233
After 7 months, Japan would have received more cars,

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.200
so Japan,

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:29.500
Japan will have received more cars after 7 months.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.366
This is interesting.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:32.833
We see that the exponential function,

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.033
notice where you have the t as the exponent,

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.633
that although it might start off a little bit slower

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:42.033
than this, what's essentially a quadratic function

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.033
when you have something squared,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.034
it starts off slow.

00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:47.633
After 5 months, you would have shipped fewer cars

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.100
than using the quadratic model right over here.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.305
But then, it more than catches up,

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:55.766
and it starts to increase at a faster and faster rate,

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:58.433
and even by 7 months, it's able to pass up

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:00.630
the quadratic function.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.233
Which country will have received more cars

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.039
from the Cozy Car Company ...

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.637
Will the country which received more cars

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.036
from the Cozy Car Company after 7 months

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:12.968
continue to receive more cars than the other country

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:14.700
in future months?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.900
Once the exponential function passes up

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.967
the quadratic function,

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:20.167
it just goes faster.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.167
It just keeps increasing at a faster and faster rate.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.900
You could see that if we wanted to compare 8 months,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500
so j of 8, this is the exponential function,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.033
this would be 2 to the 8th power,

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:32.833
which would be this times 2,

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.233
they'd get 256 cars,

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.567
and v of 8,

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:41.167
v of 8 is going to be 2 times 8 squared,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:45.000
which is 2 times 64, which is 128.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.166
Notice now we would have shipped twice as much to Japan

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.034
as Vietnam,

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.300
which isn't what the case right over here.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.633
We shipped more to Japan than Vietnam

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.233
but not twice as much.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.500
We could keep going.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.501
We could, if you want, you could go to j of 9.

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.767
j of 9 is 2 to the 9th power,

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:07.100
which is going to be 256 times 2 or 512 cars,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.267
while v of 9,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.966
v of 9 is going to be 2 times 9 squared,

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:15.566
which is 2 times 81,

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:17.701
which is 162,

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.700
so now it's more, way more than double,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.967
actually more than triple.

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:24.900
So you see that once you get past those initial few months,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.983
the exponential function is increasing

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:29.366
at a much, much, much faster rate.

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:30.368
We could actually visualize that.

00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:31.766
Let's actually get out a graphing calculator

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:35.233
to visualize these 2 things to see how that is happening.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.403
Let's graph it.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.833
The first one, let me graph the exponential,

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:43.166
so 2 to the, well, I'll just say x power.

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:45.100
We'll say x is our independent variable here,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.000
so 2 to the x power.

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.235
Then let's do the quadratic one.

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:51.033
This is y of 2, although it will be v of 2.

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:55.033
Let's say 2 times x,

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.633
2 times x squared.

00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:00.017
Now let me set the range.

00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:02.233
Let me set the range here.

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:02.700
Let's see.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.766
Let's say x starts at 0,

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:09.599
and then let's say it goes up to 10.

00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:11.867
Let's say it goes up to 10.

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:13.500
The x-scale could be 1.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:15.566
X-scale could be 1.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.700
Now y's minimum, let's say we'll start at 0,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.333
and then y-max, let's say, let's go to 1,000.

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.399
Let's go to 1,000, and let's make the y-scale 100,

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:28.066
100,

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:29.933
and now I think we're ready to graph.

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:31.333
Let's graph this.

00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:33.166
Let's see what happens.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.834
It's munching on things.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.700
That, right over there, that's the exponential,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.367
and then there, you see right over there,

00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:41.034
you have the quadratic.

00:05:41.034 --> 00:05:43.368
Actually, let me zoom in a little bit on this

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:44.700
so that we can see where they pass ...

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.684
or actually, let me zoom in a little bit on this.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:52.367
I'll do it with a box so that we can really see,

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:54.501
we can see where they,

00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:57.000
or attempt to see where they pass each other up.

00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:02.200
I'm going to start there.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:04.134
I'm going to make my box,

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.267
let's see, go ...

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:08.000
Whoops.

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:11.600
It's weird using a calculator on a computer like this.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:14.100
But you see, you definitely see,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.451
even what we've already graphed,

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:18.633
that the exponential really just starts to shoot up

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:20.166
while the quadratic is just going ...

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:22.166
Well, it's still increasing at a decent pace

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.966
but nowhere near as fast,

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.833
and the difference is becoming more and more pronounced

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.600
as time increases.

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.834
Let me just make sure that's as low as that,

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:33.603
and let's graph over in this range right over here.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:34.634
Let's see.

00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:36.852
That, right over there, that's the exponential function.

00:06:36.852 --> 00:06:38.800
That's 2 to the t power.

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:42.633
Then that right over there is the quadratic.

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:44.168
You see, you definitely see ...

00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:45.367
Actually let me ...

00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:47.100
You definitely see that earlier on,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.633
the quadratic has higher values,

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.833
and you see that right over here,

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:52.833
after 5 months, we ship more cars to Vietnam.

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.833
But then the exponential passes it up

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:56.568
and then just keeps shooting faster

00:06:56.568 --> 00:06:59.400
at an ever increasing pace.
