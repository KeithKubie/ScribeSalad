[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:10.619
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So
it is a huge pleasure

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:12.660
to be able to announce
our chef here in a moment.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.159
I'm going to take
about five minutes

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.630
and give a quick
background that's

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.480
not going to do Chef justice
on the amazing attributes

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.850
that he's had over
the past years.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.900
I'm Scott Giambastiani.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm with the food team--
the Google food program.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.240
And it's my pleasure
to announce Chef here.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.180
A quick bio on his
background, and then we'll

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.650
get into the demonstration.

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:36.270
Questions, I believe, are
going to be kind of fielded

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.350
throughout the demo.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
He would appreciate that
interaction from you guys.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.594
And then after
the demonstration,

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.010
there will be some
sampling of two

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.900
of the dishes, which
I'll talk about.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.420
And then right at 12:35,
since we started late,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.870
Chef will go into
a book signing.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.578
So I know everyone
has their books there.

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:56.160
And thank you for coming
on time, if not early.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.640
So with that, James Syhabout,
our guest here today,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.580
was born in northeast Thailand
before his family immigrated

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.790
to Oakland in 1981 amongst
a community of refugees

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.520
after the conclusion
of the Vietnam War,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280
growing up watching his mother
cook in Thai restaurants.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.110
After graduating from the
California Culinary Academy--

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.050
a fellow alumni.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.820
Thank you, Chef--
back in '99, James

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030
left to hone his
craft abroad, working

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.780
in some of the most
reputable kitchens I'm

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.705
sure you've heard of, including
The Fat Duck in the UK,

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:27.900
then under Dan Patterson
at Coi in San Francisco,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.120
as well as a season
at elBulli in Spain.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.310
So some really
top-end restaurants.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.750
Then in 2009, James opened his
first restaurant in Oakland,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.700
called Commis, which
holds two Michelin stars.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.167
He then opened Hawker
Fare in Oakland,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.750
which is now closed,
and then reopened

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.360
in San Francisco in 2015.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.430
He's also the co-owner of
Old Kan Beer and Company.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.049
Anyone been there yet?

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.090
I have to check that out.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.860
Beer garden-- super cool.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.380
He's the founder of
Hawking Bird, both of which

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.400
are in Oakland.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.460
His book today, which
everyone has, "Hawker Fare,"

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.990
was created to honor his
heritage and immigrant parents.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.300
His parents were born from
two distinct Asian cultures.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.860
His mother's ancestral
village is in Isan, Thailand,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.550
and his father in Pakse, Laos.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.860
His family arrived
in Oakland in '81,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.440
again, as a community of
refugees after the war.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.650
And the book is not only
a beautiful articulation

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.810
of the stories of his life,
his travels, and his family,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.210
but also has amazing recipes.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.550
But more so, the imagery in
there is just spectacular.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.299
So I see a lot of you
flipping through it.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.570
So please make sure to
find your favorite recipe

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.006
and have him sign that.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.630
Each recipe in the
cookbook is detailed

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.030
by the story of its
inspiration and creation.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.210
And then today, Chef will
demonstrate two recipes--

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.940
the duck laap and Da's
blistered green beans,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.460
which I had at the
restaurant when I was there.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.010
As I mentioned, if you want to
try the vegetarian options--

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.830
it sounds like that's a
no-- those are available.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590
I do want to thank Paul Rivera.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.746
Raise your hand, Paul.

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:57.870
Paul's one of our Googlers
out of San Francisco who

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.619
had reached out to the
food team and said,

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.520
you need to get him back here.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
When was your last talk?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.100
You did one a while back.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.820
JAMES SYHABOUT: I think
right before we opened

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.060
Hawker Fare in San Francisco.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.980
I think 2015, yeah.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.380
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: All right.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.046
So every three years, we need to
just bring him back here again.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.177
So it's a huge pleasure to be
able to welcome Chef James.

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:14.760
So please give him
a round of applause

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.801
and let him do his thing.

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.758
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:19.258
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Thank you, everyone.

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:22.420
Thank you for whoever
traveled here.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.350
I know the traffic.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.150
Sometimes, five miles can be a
long five miles down the 101.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.810
So how many of you have
read the book already?

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.930
Yeah?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.040
So there may be
some reiterations--

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.730
so I apologize--
of, like, the story

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.830
of how the book came about.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.075
But the format of this demo--

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:42.390
I want it to be like a
conversational piece.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.290
So please interrupt me.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.020
The questions don't have to
be directly about the dish

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.520
I'm cooking.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.020
It could be general.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.330
It could be about culture.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.910
It could be about ingredients.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.050
It could be about anything
in general, you know?

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.270
Talk about favorite hobbies.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.290
So I'm going to demo two dishes.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.470
The first one we do
is the Da green beans.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.064
My mother's name
is [INAUDIBLE]----

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:09.860
Da for short.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.330
And this dish is kind
of a tribute to her.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.940
It's a traditional Thai dish.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.730
Actually, we had this
recipe at the restaurant,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.480
but it kind of morphed
to a home-cooked meal.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.460
Usually it's called [THAI].

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.300
It's made with candied pork,
green beans, homemade chili

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.460
paste, oyster sauce, sugar.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.050
That's very, very simple.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.910
The question you might ask
is, how did we get to bacon?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.750
So the story about
the bacon part,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.960
which I'm going to
start and get going--

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.035
growing up in Oakland,
we were on welfare.

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:54.670
So food stamps is
how we survived

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.030
and how we fed ourselves.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.670
And with food stamps,
you were limited

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.090
to what you can buy
at the grocery stores.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.950
And that's when I was
introduced to Oscar Mayer bacon.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:16.160
And instead of candied pork,
bacon was the substitute.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.689
Is it on?

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:18.730
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Fans.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.242
Thank you.

00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:21.700
JAMES SYHABOUT: So
that's how bacon

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.060
was the substitute for that.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.160
So just like a lot of
the recipes in the book,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.970
it's not meant to be authentic.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.710
It's kind of a filtration
of traditional dishes

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.990
that got adapted to our
living situation in Oakland

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.310
back from when we
were growing up.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.520
These are just Blue
Lake green beans.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.010
Just pick off the stem end.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.050
And you're just going to
deep fry ahead of time.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.740
And you can leave
this at room temp.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:03.450
The oil's about 375 degrees.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.990
It's a very, very quick fry,
just enough for the skin

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.240
to blister and crinkle
up, but still remains

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.449
a good crunch and texture.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.740
Throw the rest of them in here.

00:06:18.308 --> 00:06:20.869
It's a fairly
quick, easy recipe.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.796
At the restaurants that we
served at, we didn't use bacon.

00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:32.140
[LAUGHS] We used just
sliced pork that's

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.620
been cooked down
with sugar and water

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.210
until the water and the juice
of the pork's completely dry.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.790
And then the sugar caramelizes
and caramelizes itself.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.200
But at home, time was an issue.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.810
So my mother didn't
know what bacon was.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.450
And she knew it was a pork
product and it was pork belly.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.140
And she grabbed a package
of Oscar Mayer bacon

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.380
and started making this at home.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.880
And actually, the very first
time I actually had this dish

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
was with the bacon.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880
So I didn't know better.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.830
I didn't know where
she was coming from.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.430
I never had the
traditional way until we

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.907
opened our restaurants.

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:20.520
That's good enough.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.690
I'm going to get all of it out.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.220
So we'll just push
this to the back.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.410
So the beans can sit chill
out for a little bit.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.460
I like this.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.064
This is cool.

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:36.980
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: You
can ask me to do this.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.902
I haven't done this
in months over here.

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:40.610
You keep talking.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.420
We'll get this thing rolling.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.680
JAMES SYHABOUT: OK.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.610
Cool.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.820
So I'm not sure if
this is Oscar Mayer.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.690
But it doesn't have to be.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.230
It's just a funny thing.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.260
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Get that one on high.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.880
Thank you.

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:01.650
JAMES SYHABOUT: When
we wrote the book,

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.970
I think I had,
like, 120 recipes.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.860
And we only had
room for about 90.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.110
So I had to do a lot of edits.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.320
And to me, it's
like, which recipe

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.210
counts to include in the book?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.640
Which recipe tells a story?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.140
Which recipe sets
a tone and mood?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.690
And also unique-- not to
be innovative in any way--

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.750
just more to make
the story cohesive

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.470
of what I wanted to write--
like a memoir of growing up.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:36.140
So this is a direct
reflection of a dish,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.024
of a sense of place
and time in my life.

00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:46.359
The bacon gets rendered a
little bit with the fat.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.339
Use a spoon.

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:53.219
Dirty dishes.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.930
So if you were to
do this with bacon,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.241
I would suggest buying
a slab, and cutting it

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:04.240
thicker in batons, like
we do at the restaurant.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.280
You get more of a better bite.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.290
And that's the
only change I made

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.670
to my mom's original recipe.

00:09:12.532 --> 00:09:14.240
We'll let the fat
render it a little bit.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.031
It doesn't have to
be super crispy.

00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:19.280
The rest of our ingredients
are really, really simple.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.000
We have oyster sauce.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.910
It's a Thai brand.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.790
Homemade curry paste--
making curry paste,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.290
you can make a lot of it.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.950
It lasts.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.540
It's pretty much bomb-proof.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.990
Between the shrimp paste,
all the dry ingredients,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.555
the capsaicin, it's
a preservative.

00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:44.080
If you have this in your
pantry, you can pretty much make

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.040
a lot of the recipes in
the book really easily,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.730
like the [INAUDIBLE]
noodles, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.125
also have the same paste.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:54.230
So this is very, very versatile.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.570
So if you really have
to muscle your way

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.700
in to just making this for this
dish, just make a lot of it.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.000
It just saves you
so much more time.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.750
The bacon's there.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.125
I don't want it
completely crisp.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:07.940
A little caramelization's fine.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.600
I just want to add
the curry paste.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.290
Kind of fry the
curry paste to get it

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.150
fragrant into the bacon fat.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:26.310
So I'll use the
back of the spoon

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.720
to try to make it evenly--

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.948
[INAUDIBLE] spice.

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:38.164
Turn on the heat a little bit.

00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:40.830
And then we're going
to add the green beans.

00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:51.687
Just turn off the heat.

00:10:51.687 --> 00:10:53.770
And pretty much everything's
cooked at this point.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.500
You can kind of go off the heat.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.265
Oyster sauce, sugar.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:03.640
AUDIENCE: Most of
the ingredients

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.310
you can find at
regular Asian markets?

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.460
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.230
You go to a Restaurant United,
you'll find everything.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.730
Yeah.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.630
Except for some of the
specialty Thai brand sauces.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:19.160
You might have to try a
little bit more searching.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.680
I think Chef [INAUDIBLE] took
a trip to Oakland to some Lao

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.964
marks and Thai markets to
find a couple of ingredients.

00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:28.630
AUDIENCE: He was
searching a little bit.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.680
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah,
a little hunting.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.000
But you know, oyster sauce
brands are very important.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.650
Some have higher salinity.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.930
Some are sweeter.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.540
Same thing with fish sauce--

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:46.520
in the book, there's a landscape
photo of all the bottled sauces

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.720
and stuff you would use.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.922
So I did that just because,
sometimes, your mind spins

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.630
when you go to an
Asian market, you know?

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.610
You're staring at the soy
sauce shelf for, like, an hour.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.520
I'm like, which
one am I getting?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.985
So I made that picture,
so, pretty much, you

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:11.056
just walk to a store with that
photo and just know the labels.

00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:14.960
This is makrut lime leaves
or kaffir lime leaves.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.680
A little bit of chiffonade then.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.680
We don't waste anything in our
household, even the little old

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.120
end bits, unlike Commis,
where we waste everything.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.330
We like a perfect leaf.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.260
Use 10% of it.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.429
Throw away the rest.

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:31.470
Or it goes to staff meal.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.370
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Chef,
other than the bacon,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.360
which is not, you say, typically
traditional for this dish,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.530
this dish is pretty
common in general.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.120
Are there other
aspects of this dish

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.600
that you do differently
from a traditional bean

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.855
dish like this?

00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:47.230
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Actually, there's

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.694
a version of it with catfish--

00:12:48.694 --> 00:12:49.860
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Catfish?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.235
JAMES SYHABOUT:
--actually, yeah,

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:54.590
where you roast
the catfish whole,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.030
pick the meat out, let it
little dry a little bit,

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.450
and you fry it.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.820
And you just crumble it on top.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.540
Yeah.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.090
So there's a pescatarian
version of the dish as well.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.680
And there's also a condiment
that you make with catfish

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.265
with the same
curry paste, sugar.

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:14.950
You take the catfish,
and it's caramelized,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.740
and the same sauce.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.840
And it's almost like a Thai
version of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.730
So you come home sometimes,
a warm pot of rice

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.770
has been cooking.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.950
I just sprinkle that on
top, fry an egg on it,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.700
and I have a meal.

00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:31.533
AUDIENCE: What
does your mom think

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.707
of your rendition of the dish?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.530
JAMES SYHABOUT: She
thought it was funny.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.880
She thought it was interesting.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.380
She didn't remember
much, obviously.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.671
And she was like, I used bacon?

00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.950
I'm like, yeah.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:49.700
Yeah, Oscar Mayer.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.370
We went to Safeway.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.161
You don't remember?

00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:52.830
The grocery outlet.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.087
We got a package of
Oscar Mayer bacon.

00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:56.920
Yeah, it's so funny.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.798
She knocked my
curry paste, though.

00:14:05.798 --> 00:14:08.040
She's like, it's
not spicy enough.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.210
I'm like, you know, I want
it more fragrant than spicy.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.710
I kind of threw it back at her.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.602
Like, was grandma's curry
paste different from yours?

00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:17.310
She's like, yeah.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.040
I was like, exactly.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.590
You know, everyone kind of
adopts their own flavor,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.655
which brings me to talk about
the book and the recipes.

00:14:25.655 --> 00:14:29.060
The recipes are
a baseline guide.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.095
Feel free to adapt to your
spice level, sweetness level.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.790
Don't search for authenticity,
because it is a unicorn.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.570
It doesn't exist.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.320
A unicorn, for me,
has three horns.

00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.090
Perfect example--
I went to Thailand

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.640
for a month on the first
trip with John Birdsall,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.140
my co-author, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.180
And we had som tam, or tam som--

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.860
papaya salad-- maybe
twice a day for 30 days.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.990
And my argument, just
to prove it, was,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.660
how can you argue Auntie's
papaya salad is more authentic

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.660
than the other person's?

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.400
You can't.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.210
It's situational.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.070
People come from
different backgrounds.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.153
People have different
tastes and different palates

00:15:19.153 --> 00:15:21.700
and different lives.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:30.080
I did that not just to
argue the term authenticity.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.060
I am the same type.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.900
But what's authentic
is the nuances

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.770
and the foundation of the dish.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.950
Papaya salad, depending
on where you're from,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.350
always has, some
sort of fish sauce.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.200
Either it's clarified
or it's [INAUDIBLE],,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.380
depending on if you're from the
north, or you're from the south

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.464
or you're from central Thailand.

00:15:47.464 --> 00:15:48.380
There's always papaya.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.850
There's always tomatoes.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.980
Central Thai people
like to not have

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.940
[INAUDIBLE],, because they're
used to something sweeter

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.470
and having peanuts and dried
shrimp, where in the north

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.590
we use [INAUDIBLE],,
fermented whole fish,

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.860
sometimes salted river crabs.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.000
And it's not spicy and
there's no sugar in it at all.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.820
So it's more and more savory.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.370
So it's like, OK,
which one is authentic?

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:15.140
It's like, they're all authentic
in their own very unique way.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.120
So when you make
these recipes, I

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.680
think it's easier
actually to make

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.514
the first one exactly dead-on
to the recipes and then eat it.

00:16:27.514 --> 00:16:29.180
It's just like, what
do I like about it?

00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:34.660
How can I make it to
my liking, if you don't

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.170
like a certain thing about it?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.170
Kind of adjust as you go.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.980
Making the recipes are
hard, because, when

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.730
I was writing the book and doing
recipes for the first time,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.290
I'll do taste memories.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.630
And that's how my fine dining
culinary skills came into play.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.350
I can analyze flavors.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.970
I know techniques.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.582
But I got into trouble, where
I was kind of overthinking it.

00:16:59.582 --> 00:17:01.540
My mom always tells me,
you're overthinking it.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.577
Just throw it in.

00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:05.160
And that's the beauty
about this food.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.910
They're very, very instinctual.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.175
I'm near my gram scale
taring everything,

00:17:11.175 --> 00:17:12.050
measuring everything.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.869
She's looking at me, shaking
her head, like you're just

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.369
wasting your time.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.740
And she's right.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.500
And the times that she made
this dish or other dishes

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.099
maybe 100 times, they
all taste different.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.099
There's no measurements.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.700
Sometimes, she
omits ingredients.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.980
She replaces ingredients.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.070
But the nuances are there.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.677
And they're all
just as satisfying.

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:37.510
And I don't remember
the different versions,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.710
but I just know that
nuance is there.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.469
And that's what I
remember the most.

00:17:41.469 --> 00:17:43.010
And that's kind of
where I cook from.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.474
And the rest is kind
to my personal taste.

00:17:46.474 --> 00:17:47.390
But she had this dish.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.181
She was like, you put
too much bacon in it.

00:17:49.181 --> 00:17:51.530
I'm like, I love bacon.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.160
What's wrong with more bacon?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.620
It's like, "mo'
bacon, mo' better."

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.130
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
You mentioned

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.090
this is a simple dish.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.890
And I don't want to downplay
the fact that I just

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.889
counted the ingredients.

00:17:58.889 --> 00:18:01.640
It's almost, like, 15 or
16 different ingredients.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.640
And the reason I mention that
is, trying to make vegetables

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.870
delicious and craveable
is not always easy.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.900
And I come from a background
of Italy and English,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.332
as far as my parents go.

00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:14.540
And my mom would cook beans--

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.220
typically just boiled beans.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.140
And so to compare
that to this, which

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.974
is just screaming
with flavor and aroma,

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.140
you guys are in for a treat.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.220
So really, really cool.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.310
JAMES SYHABOUT: Cool.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.060
Yeah, the hard part of this
dish is the curry paste.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.145
If you have a shrimp allergy,
just omit the shrimp paste.

00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:31.770
You'll be fine.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.810
You won't miss it.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.100
I substituted oyster
sauce for a Thai light soy

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.060
sauce or a seasoning sauce.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.370
You won't get the viscosity.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.640
You won't coat
the beans as good.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.735
But it'll still have
the same umami flavor.

00:18:46.735 --> 00:18:47.950
AUDIENCE: What is galangal?

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.700
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Galangal-- it's a rhizome.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.230
It's almost like ginger.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.240
You cannot use ginger
as a substitution.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.120
A lot of people
make that mistake.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.225
It's totally different.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.550
It has sharp, almost
citrus notes to it.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.330
It's more fibrous, so you've
got to really, really chop

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.360
it to digest it.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.440
It's mostly used
to steep in things

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.222
like soups and
curries and whatnot.

00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:22.180
It's edible, but you have
to slice it very thin

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.082
or pound it into
the chili paste.

00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:26.790
AUDIENCE: If we're in
a bind and you just

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.062
want to buy a curry paste,
which one would you recommend?

00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:31.770
JAMES SYHABOUT: Which
one do I recommend?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.070
I recommend a brand
called Mae Anong.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:42.560
M-A-E, second word, A-N-O-N-G.
It comes in a pouch,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.630
not in a tub.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.320
Yeah.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.060
And they actually make
different curry pastes.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.350
That's what my mom used
at the restaurants.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:55.710
Because making the curry
paste is so labor intensive.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.110
And it's not as cost effective.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:05.330
Back then, my mom opened her
restaurant in '88 in Concord.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.465
I mean, that with a
side of rice was $4.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.750
So making your own
curry paste was not

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.020
in the books with three
people in the kitchen doing

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.666
200 covers with a lunch menu
that was, like, 26 items.

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:23.666
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Wow.

00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:24.622
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:26.907
It was a true mom
and pop restaurant.

00:20:26.907 --> 00:20:27.740
Any other questions?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.417
AUDIENCE: What's
that called again?

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:30.500
JAMES SYHABOUT: Mae Anong.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:37.470
M-A-E, second word, A-N-O-N-G.
I might have spelled it wrong.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.224
But if you go to
any Thai market,

00:20:40.224 --> 00:20:41.640
you'll see different
curry pastes.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.995
Some comes in the tub.

00:20:42.995 --> 00:20:46.140
But this comes in a pouch.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.080
Yeah.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.520
JAMES SYHABOUT: Let me see it.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.527 --> 00:20:51.610
JAMES SYHABOUT: That's it.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.151
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:53.260
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yep.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.090
So she makes a basic red.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.970
And also, she makes
a Peking version

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:03.110
that has pretty much more
kaffir lime leaves in it.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.885
Yeah.

00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:07.770
But I prefer just to get
the red as your base ground

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.190
and then add fresh
kaffir lime leaves in it.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.942
Yeah.

00:21:10.942 --> 00:21:12.025
[INAUDIBLE] make your own.

00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:13.690
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Chef,
can we pass a little slice

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.640
of the galangal around
so people can see that?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:15.841
JAMES SYHABOUT: Of course.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:15.910
Yeah.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.160
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Thank you.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.387
JAMES SYHABOUT: It's
different aromas.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.096
Any questions on
the green bean dish?

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.430
I'm going to make
sure the recipe works.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.710
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Is this one
of your more popular sellers

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.340
at the restaurant?

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.215
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:50.500
We sell a lot of green beans.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.840
I always joke with my GM.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.830
It's like, we can just be,
like, a five-dish restaurant.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.270
We'll be fine.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:04.290
It's this, fried chicken,
[INAUDIBLE],, and [INAUDIBLE]----

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.520
barbecue chicken--

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.049
and sticky rice.

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:09.590
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I think I
ate all those when I was there.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.589
JAMES SYHABOUT: The rest
is kind of like filler.

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:15.232
[LAUGHS] And [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:15.232 --> 00:22:16.440
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Nice job.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.190
JAMES SYHABOUT: Next dish,
we're going to make laap.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.865
You might see, on Thai
menus, different spellings.

00:22:22.865 --> 00:22:26.130
Some people call it larp with
a P. Some people spell it

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:31.480
with a B. I don't
know the correct way.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.360
I think they're all correct.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.260
Depending on where you're from,
your pronunciation of the dish

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.470
is different.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.790
Laap is a genre of salads--

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.980
protein salads pretty much.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.120
And when I say salad, it's not
meant to be like a Caesar salad

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.380
where you eat it by itself.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.010
[LAUGHS] I think
people get it wrong.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.600
When people say "salad,"
in Western culture,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.810
we think it's a first
course, and that's

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.930
what we eat before
our next thing.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.820
Lao and Thai food,
everything comes

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.280
to the table at the same
time, or as it comes,

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.180
and you eat everything
with each other.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.090
There's counterparts to it.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.030
It's a constructed meal
rather than sequential.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:21.640
So growing up, laap was
also a very masculine thing.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.640
When we had dinner
parties or birthday

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.760
parties in our backyard,
it's the men who

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.220
makes the laap, not the women.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.830
I think it goes back
to the villages.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.700
The men were herders and
took care of the livestock,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.540
so they did all the butchery.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.060
And it's nose-to-tail cooking.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.440
Nothing gets wasted.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.310
But I chose duck only because
I remember, as a child,

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.610
we used to get live ducks from
[INAUDIBLE] whenever my parents

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.860
would do the slaughter.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.140
I remember plucking
feathers for them.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.660
I remember holding the duck
while my father slit the duck's

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.230
neck and bled it and made
different variations of laap.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.630
One was a raw one with blood
coagulated over the meat.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.350
It was like a panna cotta.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.260
It was called laap [INAUDIBLE],,
which didn't make it

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.925
to the book for many reasons.

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.550
One, because no one's
going to make it.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.640
And also, I didn't want
the animal rights people

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.280
knocking on my door.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.360
But that's going to be
the B-sides of the book.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.610
However, I got a whole duck.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.301
I'm going to butcher this guy.

00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:36.050
I got some gloves.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.670
You can use just duck
breast or duck legs

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.220
if you need to buy parts.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.890
You don't have to buy a
whole duck to use the recipe.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:54.700
I champion the legs
more than the breast.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.090
The connective
tissue is delicious.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.600
It's a darker, richer flavor.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.127
It is something that more
resembles, say, a wild duck.

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.210
That's what I'm going for.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.500
So I'm going to take this apart.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.342
I'm just going to
make a small portion.

00:25:15.342 --> 00:25:17.050
But today, I'm just
going to mix the two.

00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:23.854
That is the breast.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.952
And we'll put some
offal in it too.

00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:31.410
Like I said, nothing
goes to waste.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.490
Having laap be gamey
is a good thing.

00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:47.095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
difference between what

00:25:47.095 --> 00:25:49.980
you consider Thai and Lao?

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.230
JAMES SYHABOUT: Thai and Lao--

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.729
OK.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.090
Same same, but different.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.100
That's the kind of term they
use a lot, when it comes to--

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.750
in, like, in Lao,
like in Thailand.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:11.870
So a lot of it goes back to
politics, history or politics.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.250
The northeastern part of
Thailand, where I'm from--

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.450
which is about a third
of Thailand now--

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.020
used to be part of
the Lao Kingdom,

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.840
when Thailand was called Siam.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.710
The French came
in, colonized Laos,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.830
which was also part of
Thailand-- like the Isan area,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.850
that's part of Laos.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.810
And then, you know--

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.160
I don't know what happened,
but that part of the land

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.850
was not fertile.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.509
It was landlocked, it
was dry, it was humid.

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:45.050
You can't do anything
with that land.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.740
It was like-- but it was
like the French traded it,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.380
gave it to Thailand
for I don't know what.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.250
But maybe some kind of
political deal they had.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.300
It's like, hey, we'll give
you this plot of land.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.860
You know?

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.770
And borders got redrawn.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.470
And now, part of Isan--

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.080
that part of Laos is now part--

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.020
it's Thailand.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.680
So when people
ask me-- like, oh,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.110
that's why I'm [INAUDIBLE]
to say where I'm from,

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.250
or it's like, oh, I'm Thai-Isan.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:18.010
Which means I'm nationally
Thai, but I'm culturally Lao.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.390
Does that make more sense?

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.690
It's like saying you're Basque.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.190
You know?

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.870
It's like, are you Spanish,
or are you French Basque?

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:30.985
So a lot of the food,
as we know, is Thai,

00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:33.110
like you see in restaurants,
and Thai restaurants--

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.270
and rightfully so, like laap--

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.350
a lot of it
originated from Laos.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.800
Because-- from Isan,
which is now Thailand.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.270
So you actually call it Thai.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.680
And during the
Industrial Revolution

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.990
in Bangkok, a lot of
the blue collar workers

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.300
that are taxi drivers or
construction workers--

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.770
they're all Lao.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.610
So they go to the
city, you know,

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.330
to roll the dice on
the dream, and make

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.200
a living in a big city.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.764
And they brought
their food with them.

00:28:04.764 --> 00:28:06.680
This is more delicious
than central Thai food.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.305
It was spicier.

00:28:07.305 --> 00:28:08.180
It was different.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.560
So they started
cooking themselves.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.600
And then the public--

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.340
the existing public
in central Thailand--

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.890
started taking notice.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.144
What is this food?

00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:19.310
It's so different from ours.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.030
It's delicious.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.620
It's very, very spicy.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.939
It's funky, it's higher in
salt. And then, you know,

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:28.480
the butlers and the
maids were making

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.150
this dish for their bosses.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.780
And they started to like it.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.580
And then that's how the
Lao culture, you know,

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.490
infused into Thai culture.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.540
And a lot of dishes, now,
became "Thai," per se--

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.130
which is still
correct, you know?

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.500
It's just, like, the origin--

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.650
tracing back dishes is very,
very interesting to me.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.930
Like, the food
travelled with people.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.800
So I'm just going to
rough chop this breast.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.360
I'm going to do a
mixture of both.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.460
I'm making a small portion, so.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.600
I saved the skin, the fat.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:15.340
That's, like, the
most prized part.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.100
That's where you
make the cracklings,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.420
to go on top of the laap.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.650
Bones, we save.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.389
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Is it
just kind of, like, more rustic?

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:32.930
You know, just kind
of get a cleaver,

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.770
and do a coarse cut yourself?

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.159
Or would you be able to, like,
ask your butcher to, like,

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:38.700
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.550
JAMES SYHABOUT: No.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:44.080
Just-- like I said, I think,
like, the best part of laap,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.960
the dish itself, is
actually making it.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.460
Yeah.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.750
It's like the most
satisfying part, for me.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.560
It's just this-- it's
very, very rustic.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.610
It's very primitive.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.300
So that's the meat.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.530
Take off the meat, as much
as you can, from the skin.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.300
We're going to render the skin.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.170
The skin, we're going to
slice really, really thin.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.420
And we're going to start
rendering it in it's own fat.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.740
And we'll chop the meat for the
laap, to make some cracklings,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.139
or chicharrones.

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.680
That's what they
call it, these days.

00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:19.960
Yeah.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.550
It's like, don't worry about
having, like, perfect cuts.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.380
The best part of this
food, and this dish,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.580
is my mom did all this thing
with, like, a two dollar tin

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.850
knife that you get
at the grocery store.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.010
I still have one, actually.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.880
And I was-- funny story.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.070
When I was doing
the cookbook shoot,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.357
and we shot the whole-- all the
recipes Hawker Fare Oakland.

00:30:41.357 --> 00:30:42.940
We were closed for
lunch at that time.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.790
So we did-- so it's
probably to say

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.210
this book has made in Oakland.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:51.570
Like, from the
recipes, to the photos.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.370
But I went out
and bought, like--

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.967
the brand's called Kiwi.

00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:01.050
It's like a wooden handle.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.690
They come in different shapes.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.440
I actually bought,
like, a couple of those

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.740
knives to do the recipe.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.426
And it just kind of
puts me in the mood.

00:31:09.426 --> 00:31:11.340
It's just like-- it's like, OK.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.240
I don't need, like, a
$200 like Masamoto knife

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.461
to cook this dish.

00:31:16.461 --> 00:31:17.460
It's kind of ridiculous.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.600
Kind of overkill.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.892
It just goes to show that,
you know, like, a simple--

00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:28.030
we'll chop this first.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.410
So this, usually, you get
a cleaver or a heavy chef's

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.302
knife, and you just go--
you just go at it, actually.

00:31:42.206 --> 00:31:43.682
As my mom would do.

00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:46.043
But she would, like,
chop the livers into it.

00:31:46.043 --> 00:31:49.630
Give it, like, a more
iron-y flavor to it.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:02.110
Yeah-- I always remember
coming home after school,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.596
and just hearing that noise.

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:06.074
I was like, I know what
we're having for dinner!

00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:08.946
[LAUGHS] I know!

00:32:08.946 --> 00:32:11.342
And you smell sticky rice
steaming in the background.

00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:16.030
It's like, oh-- dad must
have requested laap.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.946
But he doesn't have time
to do it for himself,

00:32:17.946 --> 00:32:19.280
so mom has to do it.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.730
If you don't like duck, it can
be done with chicken, as well.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.679
It works just as well.

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:30.220
And I would just
use, like, you know,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.190
thigh meat, The breast meat
becomes too stringy and, like,

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.320
mealy.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.171
It doesn't have,
like, nice succulence.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.970
And sometimes we'll
slice offal into it--

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.033
like, the gizzards
into it, as well.

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:46.840
And why not?

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.400
I got it.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.440
I have it, so.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.800
All right.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.310
All right.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.518
We're going to start cooking.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.740
So we've got to render
the skin, first.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.690
So I got--

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.370
I got this down.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.200
Got it all figured out, now.

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:23.390
I like to start
from, like, a cold--

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.200
cold pan.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.480
Just the duck.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.020
We're going to cook this down,
until it gets, like, crispy.

00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:36.516
Should be fairly
quick, actually.

00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:45.230
Yeah.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.500
Like, go back to laaps, and
salad-- laap is a salad.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.640
It's always eaten
with sticky rice.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.362
Or with lettuce.

00:33:53.362 --> 00:33:55.035
In this case, cabbage.

00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:59.010
Kind of depends on what it is.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:03.540
So we're going to
render the fat.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.287
And of course, beer.

00:34:06.287 --> 00:34:07.870
And weirdly enough,
we're asking you--

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:08.710
like, the last
thing we want to do

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.914
is, like, what's the best
pairing to eat with laap,

00:34:10.914 --> 00:34:13.190
and like, the food in the book?

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.409
And I was being honest.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.200
Everyone laughed,
thought it wasn't a joke.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.690
I was like, "Heineken."

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.170
So for some reason,
why-- like, even

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.060
to this day in the
cookbook there's,

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.579
like, some pictures
of a backyard party.

00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:28.179
Because, like, Heineken
was always there.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.789
I think it's more--

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:32.080
I think when we came to
America, we viewed it as, like,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.995
an exotic beer.

00:34:33.995 --> 00:34:35.620
I don't know if it's
the green bottle--

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.320
they don't drink Sing Ha,
they don't drink Beer Lao.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.740
Just so used to that, you know?

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.239
Back home.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.030
So it's like Heineken,
which makes sense.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.280
It's, like, really refreshing.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.710
And like, you know,
it's a sessional beer.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.100
You know?

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.100
Seemed like [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.933
But yeah-- Heineken's
like the best pairing.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.830
Yeah, I tried other
craft beers with it.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.183
Like, lighter session
beers, lagers.

00:34:58.183 --> 00:35:01.550
I was like, eh,
it's not the same.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.795
I think it's just more of,
like, a mindset for me.

00:35:05.795 --> 00:35:07.420
And Peter was like,
you drink Heineken?

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.960
I'm like, yeah-- situational.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.870
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
There you go.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.110
I find your cuisine--

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.319
this cuisine-- to be,
probably, the most interesting.

00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:15.734
It's one of my
personal favorites.

00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:16.720
I haven't been to Laos.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.820
I've had, obviously,
a lot of Thai food.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.990
But, you know, the
interesting complexities

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.096
of different ingredients--
umami, textural, color.

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:25.470
Are there other
cuisines that you

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.410
would recommend that are similar
to this, other than Thai, Laos,

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:29.350
Burmese, maybe?

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:29.800
JAMES SYHABOUT: Burmese-- yeah.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:29.892
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah.

00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:32.890
That have same-- that have
that same kind of complexity,

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.171
that just keeps it so exciting?

00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:37.670
JAMES SYHABOUT: I love Malaysian
food-- uh, Indonesian food.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.760
You know, they do
more curries, because

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.940
of the Muslim population.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.840
But I think it's
just as interesting

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:48.804
to do a lot of permutation to
the spice levels, what not.

00:35:48.804 --> 00:35:49.690
Yeah.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.820
Indonesian food.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.450
Burmese, like you
mentioned, as well.

00:35:57.684 --> 00:35:59.350
Vietnamese food seems
to be a little bit

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.440
on the lighter side of things.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.620
Like, they definitely have
a French influence there.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.260
Like bahn mis-- you know, French
Baguettes, and so on, and so

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.760
forth.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.950
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: How's
it smell, back there?

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.980
We're torturing everyone
behind this wall.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.127
They're like, hey-- that's
not on the menu today!

00:36:17.127 --> 00:36:18.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.420
JAMES SYHABOUT: So I'm going
to reserve this duck fat,

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.831
but I'm going to take
the cracklings off of it.

00:36:24.831 --> 00:36:27.247
AUDIENCE: How'd you go from
this kind of food, growing up,

00:36:27.247 --> 00:36:30.570
to Commis and [INAUDIBLE]
and [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.320
JAMES SYHABOUT: Oh--
an interesting story.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.820
I always loved cooking.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.000
So I spent my summers--

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.374
we didn't-- you know, parents
couldn't afford to send you

00:36:37.374 --> 00:36:38.220
to camp.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.230
So my camp was restaurant camp.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.420
My first job was
at the restaurant.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.010
I was 10 years old, washing
pots and pans, woks,

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.995
you know, like, at the mop sink,
because I wasn't tall enough.

00:36:51.995 --> 00:36:53.620
I was making five bucks a week.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.825
It was like-- I felt
like I was rich.

00:36:55.825 --> 00:36:57.307
[LAUGHS] You know?

00:36:57.307 --> 00:36:58.140
It's was like, hey--

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.816
I can go into to 7-Eleven
and get all the candy I want!

00:37:01.816 --> 00:37:04.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:07.840
But I mean, you know--

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.480
I would come home late
at night, turn on the TV.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.980
I started watching
chefs of the world.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.780
I can't remember what
the PBS program is.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.210
And I saw, like, you know--

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.100
[INAUDIBLE] in these
white toques, you know?

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.324
Copper everywhere, and
their Bonnet stove.

00:37:27.324 --> 00:37:31.260
I was like, there's an
elegant side of cooking

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.700
that's beyond like, my
mother's cooking, which

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.464
is kind of like, makeshift.

00:37:36.464 --> 00:37:37.380
Right?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.540
And I loved food.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.680
And my mom was doing all she
can to prevent me to cook.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.180
You know?

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.830
It was like, oh, it's
such a hard life.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.580
So much sacrifice.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.470
I was like, yeah,
but I enjoy it.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.560
And I had to convince her.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.692
I'm like, look-- there's
an upside to this.

00:37:54.692 --> 00:37:56.025
Like, chefs are highly regarded.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.030
So I went to culinary school.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.390
I knew what I wanted to do
when I was, like, you know--

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.225
10 or 11.

00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:08.100
I wanted to be a chef, but
in, like, the higher echelon

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.540
level of cookery--

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.890
haute cuisine.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.880
So you know-- I obsessively
went to magazine racks

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.790
in downtown Oakland, looking
through, like, "Gourmet"

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.200
and "Bon Appetite,"
at that time.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.975
"Art Culinaire" was a big
one that blew my mind.

00:38:24.975 --> 00:38:29.130
And high school, you know,
they had all these, like,

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.730
career talks, and
stuff like that.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:33.412
I got into, like, AP class--

00:38:33.412 --> 00:38:35.620
I'm not supposed to tell
this story to my kids, ever.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.900
My wife banned me.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.400
She's like, I don't
know what to do.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.441
You know, I got into a
[INAUDIBLE] program, which

00:38:40.441 --> 00:38:42.460
is, like, a college prep class.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.495
I was like, I want to be a chef.

00:38:44.495 --> 00:38:47.404
Like, I don't need to
read "Scarlet Letter."

00:38:47.404 --> 00:38:51.980
[LAUGHS] I said, I don't need
to remember these big words.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.500
I did it for a year, and
I told my counselor--

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.385
I was like, I need
to drop out of AP.

00:38:56.385 --> 00:38:58.020
I could do the work.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.240
I just-- I don't see
it benefiting me.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.760
So I dropped all my AP classes.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.340
Took only what I
needed to graduate.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.260
And I started roaming around
Oakland-- the kitchens.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.002
At that time, it
was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:13.002 --> 00:39:15.540
It was nearby the campus.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.280
So I tried to get in there.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.054
And I was, like, about 15 then.

00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:21.220
The owner was like, no way--

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.930
I'm not having no minor.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.170
I was like, I'll wash dishes!

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:25.980
I'll do whatever you want.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.950
But then, it wasn't until,
like, culinary school I got,

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:34.800
you know, into-- exposed to,
like, you know-- brown butter,

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.460
creme fraiche.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.670
We never used dairy
in our cooking.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.900
It was like, coconut milk
was the closest thing.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.120
And then, like, from
there on, I was just

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.100
kind of hungry for more.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.280
And interestingly
enough, my first job

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.910
out of culinary school
wasn't at a fine dining

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.530
or a European restaurant.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:58.025
It was actually at a pan-Asian
place, called Betelnut.

00:39:58.025 --> 00:40:00.150
Not Betelnut-- it was called
Xanadu's, in Berkeley,

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.297
on Fourth Street.

00:40:01.297 --> 00:40:03.150
With Alex Ong.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.485
And then, from then
on, I did that.

00:40:05.485 --> 00:40:06.970
Started paying back tuition.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.970
And, you know, I still
wanted to pursue this.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.420
And then someone told
me about Manresa.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.094
And the rest is kind
of history, after that.

00:40:14.094 --> 00:40:15.510
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
You can't skip

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.634
over these big restaurants.

00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:19.500
What are some of the ways that
Manresa or Fat Duck have kind

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.610
of sculpted you to how you are?

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.027
And I'm sure there's memorable
episodes in those kitchens.

00:40:24.027 --> 00:40:25.401
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:26.960
I mean, Manresa was
like, you know--

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.110
it was like walking into here.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.443
It was like Starship Enterprise.

00:40:29.443 --> 00:40:30.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.900
It was shiny-- it was
things I saw on TV.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.250
Everyone's in, like, nice,
pristine chef whites.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.860
Everyone's like--
you know, an order

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.870
comes in, everyone's
simultaneously saying,

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.080
"yes, chef."

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.640
Everything is in unison.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.120
I was like, whoa.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.870
I never cooked on a
French top before.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.230
I burned a lot of things
on it, my first go.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:54.240
And it was the
discipline-- that's

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.190
the main thing I went there for.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.940
It's like, the discipline,
of like, you know--

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.550
I need to make myself
kind of OCD to do this.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.100
I was kind of OCD anyways.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:07.510
But like, the precision--

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.090
and respect for the craft.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:12.030
Also, exposure to
different ingredients.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:17.250
And also, like, the mindframe of
creativity, and how that works.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.080
But also, keeping
in mind, like, you

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.760
know-- like, flavor
is paramount.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.900
At the end of the day, our
job is to make food delicious.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.370
But also, like,
the artistry of it.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.330
It's a performance.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.780
It was a big production.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.760
Not just-- even after the
food leaves the kitchen pass,

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.540
you know, how is it served,
what utensils are used,

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.840
how the servers
explain your dish.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.020
Like, I really got into
and educated myself

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.160
on that standpoint
through Manresa.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.380
And then, you know, obviously
Manresa was inspired

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.960
by European restaurants.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.560
Because David Kinch--
because he worked in Europe.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.564
And, like, elBulli-- what
the hell is this place?

00:41:57.564 --> 00:41:58.730
It's like, are they on Mars?

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.510
Are they on Earth?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.280
And I needed to go
see it for myself.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.900
I was getting a filter
of it through him.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.550
And it was my first
time leaving home.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.130
I lived at home for my last--

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.240
all my life.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.430
Even after culinary
school, when I was working.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.346
So I was like, yeah--
if I'm going to go away,

00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:17.050
I'm going to go away pretty far.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.910
So I went to
[INAUDIBLE],, Fat Duck.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.620
A three month trip
became a year.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:31.050
And came back, and just kind
of a whole new sense of eating,

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.450
and an approach to
cooking, in general.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.601
And just to see how the rest
of the world eats, culturally.

00:42:39.601 --> 00:42:41.600
You know, I was, like,
having dinner at 9:00 PM.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600
That's new to me.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.240
Like in Spain-- you know?

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.080
It's just understanding--
like, having a global view

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.000
kind of really helping
shape, like, my cuisine.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.596
And also understand, like, food.

00:42:53.596 --> 00:42:54.970
You know, it was
like-- it's like

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.149
the international language.

00:42:57.149 --> 00:42:58.815
Either things taste
good, or they don't.

00:42:58.815 --> 00:42:59.780
No matter what it is.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.700
I think you should just
go there and try it.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.290
When I went to the
Basque country,

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.881
I landed, I didn't know what
half the things I was eating

00:43:05.881 --> 00:43:06.380
were.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.180
Actually, 90%--
like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.160
I'm like, well, I'll try it.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.840
That's what I'm here
for, is to learn.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.130
It's trial and error.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.455
It's a classic,
traditional dish.

00:43:15.455 --> 00:43:17.330
I mean, if it's a classic
dish, that means it

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.450
must taste really, really good.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.300
It stood the test of time.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.800
Yeah.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.480
That's how I kind
of got into it.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.635
But then I eventually
circled back to Hawker Fare

00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:29.770
because it's, like--

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.260
I want to say Commis is,
like, what I love to do,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.000
but, like, the Hawker
Fare is kind of who I am.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.780
It's kind of bridging the gap.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.280
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
bland, that kind of food,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.960
coming from this kind of food?

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.460
JAMES SYHABOUT: It
didn't taste bad.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.790
Because it was more,
like, soothing.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.930
It was more herbaceous.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:56.120
The flavor delivery
was different.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.840
You know, here, it's
more of the back--

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.610
you know, it's spice
and salt. So it's

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:02.609
the side of your tongue.

00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:03.830
It's the tip and the back.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.810
Where your [INAUDIBLE]
is more fats.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.590
So everything, like,
coats the pallet more.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.010
Texture, I was used to--

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.130
chewing on gristle and
tripe, different things

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.470
like that, and everything.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.360
But like, having, like,
a really silk, like,

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.350
puree, or something--

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.320
you know, that was new to me.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.400
The closest thing we
have is tofu, right?

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.780
We didn't have, you know--

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.760
blancmange, or panna
cotta, or pom puree.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.310
That's like, OK--

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.840
I understand why
this is elegant.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.710
And richness.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.640
I think Asian food has
richness in flavor,

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.430
but European food is just rich.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.680
Rich.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.880
Like-- it's, like,
indulgent, right?

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.660
Nobody would, like, say Asian
is like-- maybe Japanese food.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.910
But people don't
say it's indulgent.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.593
People always say
it's very flavorful.

00:44:53.593 --> 00:44:56.630
Like, real Asian food--
it's rare you say, like,

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.320
Asian food's rich.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.565
I think we're going to--

00:44:59.565 --> 00:45:01.060
I want to feed you guys.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.480
So I think we'll start
handing out food, actually.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.610
What do you think?

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.610
What's up, chef?

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.690
Dude-- you're late, man.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.932
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:12.932 --> 00:45:14.890
JAMES SYHABOUT: So I'm
going to make this laap.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.190
It's pretty much a one-pot dish.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.492
I keep everything in the pan.

00:45:19.492 --> 00:45:21.947
Gonna add some chilis.

00:45:21.947 --> 00:45:24.630
I like to use a
mortar and pestle.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.880
You can use a coffee
grinder, but be

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.632
careful not to pulse too much,
where it gets obliviated.

00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:34.270
I like having, like, bits
of skin, some bits of seeds

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.160
in there, as well.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.329
I like to toast the chilis
in, like, a dry pan,

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:44.870
or on the flame, if you have
the luxury to do the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.950
in a barbecue.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.770
It gives the skin--
the dry chilis

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.140
get really croquant,
and really crisp.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.012
It breaks things a bit down.

00:45:56.692 --> 00:45:59.084
Put this here.

00:45:59.084 --> 00:46:02.080
I'll move this over here.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.520
And then we're going to
start seasoning away.

00:46:08.389 --> 00:46:09.930
Everything's all
measured out for me.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.180
I'm cheating.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.450
Toasted rice powder goes in.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.120
Just sticky rice-- the stuff
you eat with your hands--

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.770
just dry.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:23.070
Toasted in a dry pan, to the
color of, like roasted coffee.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.130
Each province in Thailand
have a different color

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.310
that they recommend,
but we always--

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.690
in Laos, it's always
very, very dark.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.470
We want to get, like,
that toastiness color.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.514
This is ground a
little bit too fine.

00:46:36.514 --> 00:46:38.680
It should be-- if you did
it in a mortar and pestle,

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.560
it has little bits of rice.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.824
It adds, like, a
smokiness to the dish.

00:46:42.824 --> 00:46:46.355
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:46.355 --> 00:46:48.980
JAMES SYHABOUT: Almost used as,
like, a binding agent, as well.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.940
And it's almost
like an emulsifier.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.200
But it's also for,
like, texture, as well.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.525
Fish sauce-- this
is, like, the--

00:46:56.525 --> 00:47:00.020
I want to say extra
virgin of fish sauce.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.490
It's fish sauce, and
then you have [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.850
or [INAUDIBLE]---- which
is also a fish sauce.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.570
So we have two-- we're
doing a fish sauce process.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.430
All the sediment
falls to the bottom,

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.570
the clear stuff
floats to the top.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.780
You decant it.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.950
You get the clear
stuff more refined--

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:18.990
like, say, in first press.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:25.620
And then you have, like, the
deliciousness of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.470
which is--

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:30.810
a lot of city, like, Thai
people really don't like it.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.130
It's really, really strong.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:34.639
But that separates us
from the North and South.

00:47:34.639 --> 00:47:37.180
There's also-- you know, it's
high salt, so it acts as, like,

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.910
a preservative.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.130
So we got that all in.

00:47:42.758 --> 00:47:46.800
I'm going to slice
some lemongrass.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.980
Lemongrass, I like to
slice from the root end.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.220
And you kind of slice
this slightly on a bias.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.482
It actually makes
it more tender.

00:47:55.482 --> 00:47:58.065
It's easier-- it makes it easier
to slice, because the fibers,

00:47:58.065 --> 00:48:01.403
you're cutting
against the grain.

00:48:01.403 --> 00:48:02.345
Paper thin.

00:48:07.055 --> 00:48:10.100
So, on this recipe,
there isn't any citrus

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.830
at all, or lime juice.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:13.910
The citrus comes
from the lemongrass,

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:21.290
not as much for flavor, but
more so for the aromatics.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.940
And you have to
slice this fairly

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.410
paper thin to make
it digestible,

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:27.250
or it can become, like,
pretty unpleasant to eat.

00:48:35.063 --> 00:48:35.563
OK.

00:48:35.563 --> 00:48:37.030
That's plenty.

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.970
Throw that in there.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:48.809
Shallots-- sliced to the
side, rather than half-moons.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:58.100
And laap is technically
served room temp--

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.980
it never should be warm.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.880
You can serve it
warm, but, you know,

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.270
if it's left out to room temp,
that's perfectly OK, too.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.180
OK.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.800
Put the shallots in there.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.410
We're going to add fresh
Thai chilis to this batch.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.664
I like it--

00:49:22.664 --> 00:49:24.320
I like when Thai
chilis are in there,

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.605
because they're like little
minefields, you know,

00:49:27.605 --> 00:49:28.569
as you chew.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.431
Catch somebody off guard.

00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:38.940
It becomes lots of fun.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.528
That's when the
Heineken comes out.

00:49:41.528 --> 00:49:44.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:44.216 --> 00:49:46.140
We can do scallions.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.480
With scallions, I like to
use the white and the green,

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.750
so we have a mixture of both.

00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:58.075
The scallions, too-- like, I
learned I was making a mistake,

00:49:58.075 --> 00:49:58.950
making these recipes.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.710
I was cutting things too fine.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.142
Like, I'm still used to--

00:50:03.142 --> 00:50:04.642
the only thing about
fine dining is,

00:50:04.642 --> 00:50:07.330
I became a jarhead
of refinement.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.120
Which kind of works against me,
when I was making these dishes.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.820
I was overthinking it.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.800
Things were too fine,
and it gets lost.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.820
You know, things were cut
certain ways with intention,

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.030
so it would be very distinct.

00:50:28.054 --> 00:50:28.810
All right.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.990
That goes in.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.726
And then we have cilantro.

00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:34.350
Cilantro, mint.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.156
Cilantro, like, you
use all of it-- the

00:50:37.156 --> 00:50:38.280
stems, and stuff like that.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.320
That's the one thing,
every time my mom comes

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.916
to Commis the first
thing she walks up to is

00:50:42.916 --> 00:50:44.778
to look at the compost bin.

00:50:44.778 --> 00:50:46.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:46.425 --> 00:50:50.566
And she always is like--

00:50:50.566 --> 00:50:52.650
did somebody misplace this?

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.230
I'm like, no, mom-- we
only want the flowers.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:56.730
It's like, we already
have cilantro.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.188
Like, the guys would be eating
cilantro salad for the last,

00:50:59.188 --> 00:51:01.250
like, two weeks.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.660
And she just shakes her head.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.160
And she goes, how
do you guys make--

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.825
how do you make any money here?

00:51:06.825 --> 00:51:07.860
And I'm like, we don't.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.740
It's an art project.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.680
[LAUGHS]

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.180
Add that.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.451
Add a little mint.

00:51:13.451 --> 00:51:13.950
Torn.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:15.783
And like I said, it's
kind of a rustic dish,

00:51:15.783 --> 00:51:23.762
so you don't have to chop
your mint or cilantro fine.

00:51:23.762 --> 00:51:24.720
Use everything you can.

00:51:27.312 --> 00:51:29.931
Kind of piece it together.

00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:32.370
AUDIENCE: Is it true that
Commis doesn't make any money?

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.203
JAMES SYHABOUT: Most--
restaurants are hard.

00:51:34.203 --> 00:51:36.219
They're difficult.
Margins are so slim.

00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:36.760
Like Commis--

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.080
JAMES SYHABOUT: Huh?

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.720
AUDIENCE: I would have thought
that with all the recognition,

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:39.900
it would--

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.608
JAMES SYHABOUT: I
mean, it's sustainable.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.582
I'm not going to be driving
a Tesla anytime soon.

00:51:48.582 --> 00:51:54.040
[LAUGHS] Yeah-- then just mix
it like you would a salad.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.600
The more herbs, the better.

00:52:05.416 --> 00:52:07.040
It's supposed to be
spicy and aromatic.

00:52:10.912 --> 00:52:12.364
Add this guy.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.329
I should taste this, huh?

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.235
And it's always eaten with,
like, a wedge of cabbage.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.210
The cabbage, it's kind of like
you break off petals of it,

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.490
and you either eat
the laap first,

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:54.730
with a ball of sticky rice--

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.430
how many people had
sticky rice before?

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.370
No?

00:52:59.370 --> 00:52:59.870
Cool.

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.161
You know how to eat sticky
rice with your hands, right?

00:53:02.161 --> 00:53:04.970
I always tell people,
pretend it's a tortilla.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.740
That's the easiest
way to explain it.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.790
Like, the sticky
rice is your utensil.

00:53:12.269 --> 00:53:15.060
Little slices of cucumber,
some garnish on the side.

00:53:26.055 --> 00:53:28.180
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's
a pretty veg-forward dish,

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:28.780
if you consider it.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.040
There's a lot going on, there.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:30.915
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:53:30.915 --> 00:53:32.942
I actually made this
with tofu, before.

00:53:32.942 --> 00:53:34.400
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
It's delicious.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.900
JAMES SYHABOUT: For a guest.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.010
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
What do you guys think?

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.926
JAMES SYHABOUT: And then
Thai chilis for the--

00:53:37.926 --> 00:53:40.401
Thai chilis for the brave,
and that's all of it.

00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:40.900
Yeah.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.508
Thank you.

00:53:41.508 --> 00:53:42.716
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Nice job.

00:53:42.716 --> 00:53:44.144
Nice job.

00:53:44.144 --> 00:53:47.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:47.654 --> 00:53:48.570
JAMES SYHABOUT: Sorry.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.353
I didn't mean to make a mess.

00:53:50.353 --> 00:53:54.902
[LAUGHS] Cool.

00:53:54.902 --> 00:53:55.860
How's the food tasting?

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.445
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
It's delicious.

00:53:56.445 --> 00:53:58.770
JAMES SYHABOUT: Thank you to the
team, back there, that produced

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.220
the food you guys are eating.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:00.720
Yeah.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.510
They did a very good job.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.010
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Thank you, team.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.622
So a huge thanks to
not only everyone

00:54:08.622 --> 00:54:10.080
in the back, who
prepared the team,

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.260
but also to Laura and the
team that set this up.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.140
Getting these food talks
going looks easy, here,

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.390
but it's a massive amount
of work to pull chefs out

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.760
of their restaurants, to
get these kitchens reserved,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.180
and to have all of you show
up so eagerly, as you did.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.020
So thank you for
coming, and thank you

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.970
to the team that planned it.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.892
Enjoy your snacks, and then
Chef will be signing books

00:54:28.892 --> 00:54:29.600
right after that.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.766
And I know most of you have
a day job to go back to,

00:54:31.766 --> 00:54:34.230
so we'll try to keep
it short and sweet.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.240
So again, huge round of
applause for Chef James.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.740
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Thank you very much.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:39.948
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Nice job.

00:54:39.948 --> 00:54:42.690
[APPLAUSE]
