00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.500
Vegas, baby!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.710
It's Paradise.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.780
Not metaphorically either, this literally
isn't the city of Las Vegas -- look at a map

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.139
and you'll see the name Paradise -- and when
you visit and check the weather: same thing.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.420
Here is Las Vegas and here is Paradise which
contains *nearly everything* people associate

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.900
with Las Vegas including the sign.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.160
Now, you might think Paradise is just a relatively
unknown city mistaken for its larger neighbor,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.710
like elsewhere, but Paradise isn't a city
at all: it's an unincorporated place.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.710
What's that?

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.670
Quick government recap: citizens living in
a city have to follow the rules of the city,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.680
and also those of the county, and also, the
state, and also the nation.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.329
It's a government layer cake.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.000
And each layer collects its own taxes to enforce
its own rules.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If some folk find these layers oppressive,
they can hitch their wagons and head for open

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
lands outside the borders of any city -- to
live like the rugged individualists they are

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.000
-- free of rules.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
Well, except for those of the nation, and
also the state, and also the county -- but

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.500
moving outside a city, there's one fewer 'and
also' layer because they are in an unincorporated

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
place.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.490
But if they make it nice and the population
grows, inevitably people want police and sewers

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.710
and schools and rules.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.750
And soon, a charter is written, a mayor elected
and a city incorporated.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.810
What makes Paradise weird is that unlike most
unincorporated places that contain mostly

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.189
blowing tumbleweeds and perhaps a yurt where
nobody wants to live, there are almost a quarter

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.509
million residents in Paradise in a space the
size of Disney World.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.150
That density is *way* past the point you'd
expect people to incorporate a city.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.170
And it's not like Paradiseians just couldn't
bother, Paradise is almost unique in being

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.799
*officially* unincorporated … so… why?

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.180
It started with the Mormons who first settled
these lands in the 1880s… actually no -- jump

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.899
cut to: 1950!

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.360
When we still tested out nuclear bombs in
the open, near population centers.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.610
Nevada^† recently legalized gambling and
a casino empire grew in Vegas.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.530
Well -- *just* outside of it to avoid city
taxes.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.149
As for necessary services, the casinos were
rich enough to provide their own notably,

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.440
using their security forces as de facto police.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
Which might not sound on the up and up, but
this was the mob running things -- and of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.000
course they don't any more.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.240
Actually, really, they don't, it's all run
by about two companies now.^‡

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.450
Anyway, the official City of Las Vegas in
the 1950s was on the verge of bankruptcy -- and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.750
with profitable casinos touching its border,
the mayor was all like, 'who are you kidding?,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.500
this is totally part of Las Vegas because
I say so, and you're going to pay Las Vegas

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
taxes.'

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500
The Casinos said 'no'.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.690
There was a dispute that only the county,
the next level of government up, could resolve.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.810
The casinos, by the way, payed taxes to the
county direct.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.310
So *shockingly* the county told Vegas, *no*
you can't annex this land and tax its businesses

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.840
just because you want to.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.980
And to prevent Vegas from trying anything
funny in the future the county created the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.940
officially, unofficially, unincorporated place
named Paradise.^§

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.200
Everything that happens within it's borders,
the actual city of Las Vegas has no control

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.410
over --here the county rules and sets lower
taxes of all sorts, which is why when new

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.730
casinos are built, it's generally in Paradise
not Las Vegas.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.010
But if all this makes you think that the origin
of Paradise was just some kind of city-sized

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.330
tax dodge... you're right!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.650
This episode is brought to you by Audible.com--

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.200
audiobooks for you to listen to.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.760
I listen to *a lot* of audiobooks every year,
and I use Audible to do it.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.000
And I am going to recommend to you the book
that I listened to on my most recent vacation

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.400
to Las Vegas, which was “The Graveyard Book”
by Neil Gaiman.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.530
It’s a fictional story, so I don’t really
want to give any spoilers -- let’s just

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.830
say that Neil Gaiman is an excellent storyteller
and he has an excellent narrating voice to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.870
go along with it.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.230
And he really lends personalities to all of
the characters that he creates, in the unique

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.470
way that only an author can.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.040

Now before you go around correcting everybody
that your vacation was in Paradise, not Las

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.500
Vegas, Las Vegas city and Paradise are both
in Las Vegas Valley, so you can say you went

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.380
to Las Vegas, while never setting foot in
Las Vegas, and still be technically correct

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.790
that you went to Las Vegas.
