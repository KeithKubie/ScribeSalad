00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.070
In the last video, we studied
a super simplified economy

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.380
that only sold one
good or service.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.030
But now let's think about things
a little bit more generally,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.910
or a little bit more
complex economies.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
And let's say that in
year one economists

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.530
have determined that the
level of prices of the goods

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.130
and services produced
in that economy is 100.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.766
So they've essentially
just multiplied

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.140
and divided by
the right numbers,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.330
so that their index
that they generate just

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.414
says that that is 100.

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:34.580
And they do this so that
they can measure the prices

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.380
in other years
relative to year one.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.930
So let's say in year
two, using their index,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.990
they realize that
prices are now 110.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.694
Now, this is not a
simple thing to do.

00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:51.360
This would have been
a very simple thing

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.740
to do if there was only one
good or service in the economy,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.214
like in our last
example, apples.

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:58.130
You could have just taken
the price of apples.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.000
It went from $0.50 to $0.55.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.410
In the real world, this is
not a simple thing to do.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.830
You have a gazillion
goods and services.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.070
Some prices go up.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.810
Some prices to go down.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.880
The quantities of the
goods and services change.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.860
In fact, there might
be goods and services

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.950
that were offered
in year one that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.290
don't exist anymore in year two.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.770
And there are goods and
services in year two

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.560
that didn't exist in year one.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.460
But for the sake of
this video, let's just

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.610
assume that economists
are able to say this.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820
If you call the general level
of prices 100 in year one,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.360
it's now 110.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.110
Or another way to think
about it is things

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.870
have gotten 10% more expensive.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.710
Now, assuming that we know this
relationship-- and once again,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.020
it's not an easy
thing to figure out,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.020
and it actually turns out
there's no perfect way

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.550
to do this-- how
can we figure out

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.660
a relationship between
real GDP and nominal GDP?

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.230
And remember, whenever
we talk about real GDP--

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.830
so we're going to talk
about real GDP in year two--

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.650
whenever you talk
about real GDP,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.400
you're talking
about GDP in terms

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.480
of the prices in some base year.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.000
So in this example, we'll
think about real GDP

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.170
in year two in terms
of a year one dollars.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.980
So whatever were the
goods and services

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.680
that were produced in year two,
we're going to think about,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.080
well, what if they were at the
same prices as in year one?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.730
And that will give us
the real GDP in year two.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.690
So one way to think about
it is really just a ratio.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.110
So let me write nominal GDP.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.290
So this is GDP in
year two, measured

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.197
in year two dollars,
divided by-- I

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:38.780
guess we could call
this a proportion,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.050
really-- divided by the
real GDP in year two.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.860
And this is measured
in year one dollars.

00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.850
Well, that's going
to be the same thing

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.830
as the ratio of the prices
between year two and year one.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.160
This is going to be the ratio
of-- we use this indicator

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.100
right over here-- 110 to 100.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.670
And I want you to just sit and
think about this for a second.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.400
It's just saying, look, these
are measuring the same goods

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.160
and services.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.900
The real GDP is measuring
them in year one prices.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.580
The nominal GDP is measuring
them in year two prices.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.740
So if things got
10% more expensive

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.100
between year one and
year two, the nominal GDP

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.500
should be 10% larger
than real GDP.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.020
We should have the
exact same ratios.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.380
And now we can manipulate this
thing using any type of algebra

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.440
that we want.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.050
For example, we could
say, well, nominal GDP--

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.770
And I'll just write nominal now.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.200
This is where I
kind of specified

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.575
exactly what we're
talking about.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.980
This is a nominal
GDP of year two.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.790
So now we could say
nominal GDP is equal

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.980
to-- we can multiply both
sides times the real GDP--

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.620
is equal to 110 over
100 times the real GDP.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.880
And remember, this is
nominal GDP in year two.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.330
This is real GDP in year two,
measured in year one dollars.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.130
Or we can divide both
sides of this equation

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.220
by this 110 over 100.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.651
And then we get nominal
GDP in year two divided

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:39.960
by 110 over 100 is equal
to real GDP in year two.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.850
This is nominal GDP in year two.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.150
And writing it this
way kind of feels

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.100
like you're taking your
nominal GDP in year two,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.660
and there's been
a general increase

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.730
in the level of prices.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.010
That's called price inflation.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.630
We see that right over here.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.270
And now we're deflating
it to get real GDP.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.694
We're dividing it by
the ratio of the prices.

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:05.360
We're dividing it essentially by
how much the prices have grown,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.880
or I guess you could say the
ratio between the year two

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.540
prices and the year one prices.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.754
So this quantity right
over here is 1.1.

00:05:12.754 --> 00:05:14.420
So another way you
could think about it,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.550
we're deflating the
nominal GDP in year two

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.270
to get the real GDP in year two.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.485
We're getting it in, remember,
this is in year one prices.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.740
And because of that, this
number right over here

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.370
is referred to as a deflator.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.270
This is our GDP deflator.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.900
You pick a base here, in
this case, it was year one.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.820
That base year could
have been 1985.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.415
It could've been 2006.

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:46.540
Who knows what it could be.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.415
It could be anything.

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:50.505
Your GDP deflator is going to
be relative to that base year.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.630
It's going to say, well,
if that base here was 100,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.270
your deflator's going to
say how much things are now

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.110
in this year.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.730
And you can even go
backwards in time.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.180
Year zero, the deflator
might have been 85,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.110
because maybe things
have gotten cheaper.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.037
Or you could actually
had prices go down.

00:06:04.037 --> 00:06:05.620
You could have
actually had deflation.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.810
So maybe in year two your
deflator would be at 98.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.640
But the reason why
it's called a deflator

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.910
is because generally you have
inflation as time goes on,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.770
and generally you're going to
be deflating your nominal GDP.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.890
You're going to be dividing it
by a value greater than one.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.680
It's going to be something
over 100 divided by 100,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.878
which is your base year,
to get your real GDP.
