Vsauce!

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.459
Kevin here.

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.130
The toothbrush dates back to at least the
ancient Babylonians and Egyptians who frayed

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.480
the end of a stick to scrub their teeth.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.920
But in the 15th century the Chinese invented
something closer to the modern toothbrush

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.019
using bristles from pigs' necks attached to
a bone or bamboo handle.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.309
Pig or Horsehair was used for toothbrushes
until nylon was invented in 1938.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.669
Ancient toothpaste recipes have ranged from
the ashes of burnt mice heads and eggshells

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.670
to more abrasive crushed bone and oyster shell
concoctions of Greeks and Romans.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.750
In the 1800s toothpaste was actually a powder
containing soap and chalk and it wasn't until

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.719
1890 that tubes with paste came into the picture
but unfortunately the tubes were often made

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.329
of lead which leaked into the toothpaste.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.989
And in case you still got a cavity, Ozark
folklore held the belief that carrying the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.600
jawbone of a donkey in your teeth and walking
backward could cure a toothache.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.140
The Chinese have been making a form of toilet
paper since at least the 2nd century by mixing

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.280
mulberry bark, hemp and rags with water - mashed
into a pulp, then pressed and hung to dry

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
in the sun.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.750
But other cultures have wiped with everything
from sticks, moss and corn cobs to pebbles

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.340
carried in a special bag or a sponge on a
stick dipped in a bucket of salt water.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.430
When New Yorker Joseph Gayetty invented aloe-infused
sheets of manila hemp to prevent hemorrhoids

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.719
in 1857 the public scoffed at the idea because
why pay for wiping paper when they already

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.390
had old newspapers?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.619
TP eventually caught on because of the advent
of the flush toilet and people needing a paper

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.700
that navigated plumbing — and pages from
the Sears Roebuck catalog just clogged the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.700
pipes.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.900
But there was a time you didn't flush urine
— you collected it to wage wars.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.179
Urine contains saltpeter which along with
charcoal and sulfur creates gunpowder.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.759
Outhouses in cities had trays under the seats
that were pulled out from behind and night-soil

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.370
collectors came by and emptied the contents
into a wagon where it was delivered to concrete

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.120
tanks to recover the salt peter.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.390
During the Civil War in the US while the men
of the south were off fighting the women were

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.640
doing their part by collecting their urine
- a contribution immortalized in poems...

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.010
...What could make a Yankee soldier sadder,
Than dodging bullets fired by a pretty woman's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.120
bladder.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.110
And as always - thanks for watching.
