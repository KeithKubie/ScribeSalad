00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.560
There we go.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.820
See, most people forgot about the Rubik's Cube back in the eighties, so it had its'

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000
heyday and then disappeared the
mathematicians remain obsessed with it.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
They wanted to find out the number of moves it would take to solve the most

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.050
difficult combination.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.620
People probably are aware that there is
some maths involved in a Rubik's Cube

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
and the group is the number of different
combinations that there are on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.779
Rubik's Cube. It's all the different
ways that you can scramble up a cube

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.920
Other things do have permutations and
symmetry there's just something nice and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.060
tactile and you can gather
and you can see everything

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.840
as it happens.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.770
And this number would be called God's
number. If you have perfect knowledge of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.130
how to do the Rubik's Cube you would be
able to solve the most difficult

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.179
position in its perfect

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.980
most efficient algorithm.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.020
And they managed to work out that it was
less than 30.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.600
And over the years, they started to whittle this down closer and closer.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.120
No matter how much you scramble up a Rubik's Cube, you can solve it in 20 or fewer twists.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.959
It's called God's number because you
have to be some kind of omniscient being

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.620
to work out those 20 moves. It's just so difficult to calculate what those moves are.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.020
I couldn't look at a cube and say I
need to do these 12 moves or whatever

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.740
but there are people who can so they do
Rubik's Cube solving competitions and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.460
they have obviously speed challenges
and see who can solve it the fastest but

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.510
one of the other things that they do is
a kind of efficient solve and the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.040
competition there is look at a Rubik's
Cube and then just write down a list of

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.120
moves that will solve it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.660
Which I think is probably more impressive than people who can solve it really quickly.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.280
It was called the super flip. Now the
super flip is essentially completely solved

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.790
except each edge position was flipped
over.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.900
If you take one of those pieces off and turn it around, you get a whole new universe

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.120
and you can't get back to the solved Rubik's Cube if you do that.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.600
Four point three times ten to the nineteen it's a massive number, that is a massive number of combinations

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:54.920
It's 43 quintillion 252 quadrillion
3 trillion 274 billion 489 million 856 thousand

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.380
It's just a mind-numbing number of
possible arrangements

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.960
So this was a big craze in the 1980s. Big craze.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.820
In the 1880s, exactly 100 years earlier, there was a similar puzzle that was also a big craze.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.980
They had their code that checked the
reduced number of cases.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.400
They ran it on the Google servers and they did. They exhaustively checked and we know now for

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.830
a fact that God's number is 20.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.830
Every Rubik's puzzle can be solved in 20 or fewer moves.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.220
You might think, well how do we know how? How do we know that?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.220
Did we just check all 43.25 billion billion different ways
of solving it and we effectively did that.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.899
And there are 12 factorial ways to
arrange the edges.
