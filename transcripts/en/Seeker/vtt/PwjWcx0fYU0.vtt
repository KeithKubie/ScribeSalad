00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
Laughter.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
It’s the best medicine.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.170
It’s the glue between friends.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.050
It’s the universal language!

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.820
But nothing sounds more contrived and obvious
than the forced laughter of strangers.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.820
Hey!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.820
I’m Natalia, Nice to meet you.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.500
I really like your hair.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
[forced laughter]

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Hey!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.340
It’s Natalia Reagan for DNews!

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.940
Laughter between strangers seems to lack a
genuine enthusiasm, and now science says that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.039
“contrived nature” can be easily detected-
even across cultures!

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.359
New research shows that listeners spanning
24 societies could detect when people are

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.609
laughing with strangers versus laughing among
friends based on their spontaneity, duration,

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.799
and acoustics of their guffaws.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.640
In this study, released in PNAS, researchers
recorded laughing pairs and had ‘listeners’

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.129
try to determine the affiliation of the laughers-were
they friends or strangers?

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.850
According to the study, “laughter is characterized
by neuromechanical oscillations involving

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.380
rhythmic laryngeal and superlaryngeal activity”.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.049
Say that 10 times fast!

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.500
The study included 966 listeners from 24 countries
across five continents, including India, Namibia,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.330
Peru and Slovakia listening to English speaking
laughers.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.909
Listeners were accurate in their determinations
roughly 61% of the time.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.259
The ‘listeners’ were not all familiar
with the English language (again, the laughers

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.869
all spoke English) but they still were able
to identify the ‘stranger’ laughers from

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:33.880
the friends.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.060
The idea that laughing is a cross-cultural
universal affiliative behavior has been proven

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.549
time and again, but this supports the idea
that humans- regardless of language barrier,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.390
can distinguish authentic from inauthentic
laughter.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.990
But why is this important?

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.439
Let’s start at the beginning, shall we...

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.720
The history of laughter goes way, way, WAY
back, scientists surmised that human laughter

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.350
began with a common ancestor some 20 million
years ago.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.780
That means laughter is older than language
and is a shared behavior by all humans.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.979
Heck, as babies we learn to laugh before we
learn to speak!

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.310
And laughter is an affiliative behavior, meaning
one that helps form cohesion between individuals

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
of a group.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.600
Other affiliative behaviors, include touching,
hugging, playing, and grooming!

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.470
Laughter helps forge bonds between individuals.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.440
And laughing feels good.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
Why?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.849
That’s because it suppresses the release
of stress hormones like cortisol while releasing

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.940
the feel good hormone, dopamine.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.860
Evolutionarily speaking, forming affiliative
bonds and coalitions was AND is vital for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860
survival.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.200
Being able to read groups of people from audio
cues is important.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.660
And even though laughter is often the result
of a humorous moment, comedy isn’t the only

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.050
cause for laughter.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.080
According to the Encyclopedia of Linguistics,
laughter is an integral part of human conversation.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.159
Linguistic analysis of conversations have
found that laughter often occurs at the end

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.769
of a talking turn between individuals as an
invitation to share in joint laughter.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.700
And since humans are heavily dependent on
our ability to communicate with one another,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.049
laughing is an effective way to give immediate
feedback during a conversation, regardless

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.049
if it’s rife with hilarity.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.610
Given the significant role that laughter plays
in our species existence, it’s no wonder

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.810
humans across cultures have developed the
ability to determine affiliations based on

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.329
laughter, regardless if they speak the same
language.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:31.540
What about you?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.239
Have you ever used laughter to communicate
with someone who doesn’t speak your language?

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.500
Test it out and tell us how you did in the
