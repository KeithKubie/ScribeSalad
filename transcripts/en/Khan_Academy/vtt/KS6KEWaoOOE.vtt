00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.860
- Let's say that I run a website

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.320
that currently has this off white color

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.770
for it's background

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.620
and I know the mean amount of time

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.130
that people spend on my website,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.370
let's say it is 20 minutes

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.080
and I'm interested in making a change

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.950
that will make people spend
more time on my website.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.600
My idea is to make the background color

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.910
of my website yellow.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.270
But after making that change,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.150
how do I feel good about
this actually having

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.040
the intended consequence?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.510
Well that's where significance
tests come into play.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.620
What I would do is first
set up some hypotheses,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.790
a null hypothesis and an
alternative hypothesis.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.560
The null hypothesis tends
to be a statement that,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.810
"Hey, your change actually had no effect,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.420
"there's no news here,"
and so this would be that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.760
your mean is still equal to 20 minutes

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.730
after the change to yellow, in this case,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.900
for our background.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.720
And we would also have an
alternative hypothesis.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.000
Our alternative hypothesis is actually

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.700
that our mean is now greater
because of the change,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
that people are spending
more time on my site.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.867
So our mean is greater than
20 minutes after the change.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.230
Now the next thing we do is we set up

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.260
a threshold known as
the significance level

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.270
and you will see how this
comes into play in a second.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.890
So, your significance level

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.530
is usually denoted by
the Greek letter Alpha

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.200
and you tend to see
significant levels like

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.050
1/100 or 5/100 or 1/10

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.140
or 1%, 5%, or 10%.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.550
You might see other ones,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.140
but we're gonna set a significance level

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.290
for this particular case.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.770
Let's just say it's going to be 0.05.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.360
And what we're going to
now do is we're going to

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.440
take a sample of people visiting

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920
this new yellow background website

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.700
and we're gonna calculate statistics.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300
The sample mean, the
sample standard deviation,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.060
and we're gonna say,
"Hey, if we assume that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.210
"the null hypothesis is true,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.830
"what is the probability
of getting a sample

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.000
"with the statistics that we get?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.860
And if that probability is lower than

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.320
our significance level,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.490
if that probability is less than 5/100,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.230
if it's less than 5%, then
we reject the null hypothesis

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.330
and say that we have
evidence for the alternative.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.960
However, if the probability
of getting the statistics

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.620
for that sample are at the
significance level or higher,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.640
then we say, "Hey, we can't
reject the null hypothesis,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.870
"and we aren't able to have
evidence for the alternative."

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.270
So what we would then do, I
will call this step three.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.760
In step three, we would take a sample.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.380
So let's say we take a sample size,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.810
let's say we take 100 folks
who visit the new website,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.360
the yellow background website,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.410
and we measure sample statistics.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.380
We measure the sample mean here,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.470
let's say that for that sample,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.637
the mean is 25 minutes.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.910
We are also likely to,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.160
if we don't know what the actual

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.790
population standard deviation is,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.150
which we typically don't know,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.930
we would also calculate the
sample standard deviation.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.260
Then the next step is
we calculate a p-value.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.060
And the p-value, which
stands for probability value,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.340
is the probability of getting a statistic

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.320
at least this far away from the mean

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.300
if we were to assume that
the null hypothesis is true.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.681
So one way to think about it

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.419
it is a conditional probability.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.586
It is the probability that our sample mean

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.550
when we take a sample of size n=100

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.380
is greater than or equal to 25 minutes,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.337
given our null hypothesis is true.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.700
And in other videos, we have
talked about how to do this.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.030
If we assume that the
sampling distribution

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.130
of the sample means is roughly normal,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.930
we can use the sample mean,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.550
we can use our sample size,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.720
we can use our sample standard deviation,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.590
perhaps we use a t-statistic,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.050
to figure out what this
probability is going to be.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.340
And then we decide whether we can reject

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.560
the null hypothesis.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.110
So let me call that step five.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.250
So step five, there are two situations.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.417
If my p-value, if it is less than Alpha,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.600
then I reject my null hypothesis

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.330
and say that I have evidence
for my alternative hypothesis.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.440
Now, if we have the other situation,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.607
if my p-value is greater than or equal to,

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.120
in this case 0.05,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.800
so if it's greater than or
equal to my significance level,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.830
then I cannot reject the null hypothesis.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.210
I wouldn't say that I
accept the null hypothesis,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.560
I would just say that we do not

00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.690
reject the null hypothesis.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.330
And so, let's say, when I do
all of these calculations,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.700
I get a p-value which would
put me in this scenario

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.610
right over here.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.670
Let's say that I get a p-value of 0.03.

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.550
0.03 is indeed less than 0.05

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.900
so I would reject the null hypothesis

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.060
and say that I have evidence
for the alternative.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.333
And this should hopefully
make logical sense

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:51.960
because what we're saying is, hey, look,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.120
we took a sample and if we
assume the null hypothesis,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.287
the probability of getting
that sample is 3%, it's 3/100,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.750
and so since that probability

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.210
is less than our
probability threshold here,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.190
we'll reject it and say we have evidence

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.400
for the alternative.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.660
On the other hand, there
might have been a scenario

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.130
where we do all of the calculations here

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.750
and we figure out a p-value that we get

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.917
is equal to 0.5, which you
can interpret as saying

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.430
that hey, if we assume the
null hypothesis is true,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.000
that there's no change due to
making the background yellow,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.770
I would have a 50% chance
of getting this result.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.110
And in that situation,
since it's higher than

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.290
my significance level,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.060
I wouldn't reject the null hypothesis.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.260
A world where the null hypothesis is true

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.220
and I get this result,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.680
well, you know, it
seems reasonably likely.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.850
And so, this is the basis for
significant tests generally

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.832
and as you'll see, is
applicable in almost every field

00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:55.960
you'll find yourself in.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.930
Now there's one last
point of clarification

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.430
that I wanna make very, very, very clear.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.680
Our p-value, the thing that we're using

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.480
to decide whether or not we
reject the null hypothesis,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.555
this is the probability of
getting your sample statistics

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:13.000
given that the null hypothesis is true.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.200
Sometimes people confuse
this and they say,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.280
"Hey, is this the probability
that the null hypothesis

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.447
"is true given the sample
statistics that we got?"

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.000
And I would say, "Clearly,
no, that is not the case."

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.020
We are not trying to gauge the probability

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.940
that the null hypothesis is true or not.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.720
What we are trying to do is say,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.330
"Hey, if we assume the
null hypothesis were true,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.110
"what is the probability
that we got the result

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.830
"that we did for our sample?"

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.580
And if that probability is low,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.070
if it's below some threshold
that we set ahead of time,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.560
then we decide to reject
the null hypothesis

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.880
and say that we have
evidence for the alternative.
