00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.930
In 1980 America, the Cold War was still very
much hot, Ronald Reagan was elected President,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.990
and the United States’ Olympic hockey team
shockingly upset the USSR in what would be

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.060
dubbed “The Miracle on Ice.”

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.609
Oh, and the new president of Iraq, Saddam
Hussein, was given a key to the city of Detroit.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.550
How did this come to pass?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.019
Honoring an individual with a key to the city
is actually a more tangible variation of another

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.540
practice known as “Freedom of the City”
or, if conferred onto the military, “Freedom

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.540
of Entry.”

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.731
More commonly called this in Europe, the practice
traces back to ancient Rome and their honoring

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.750
of the sacred boundary known as the “pomerium.”

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.760
The pomerium, Latin meaning “behind the
wall,” was the open space just inside of

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.059
the old city’s’ walls.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.040
This space was dedicated to the gods as gratitude
for protection.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.369
Besides the religious significance, the authority
of a Roman general was only valid outside

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.260
the pomerium and not within the city’s walls.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.170
No military affairs were allowed beyond the
pomerium.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.790
In fact, any soldier or general who crossed
that line lost all military power and became

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.790
simple civilians.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.190
The only exception was during victory celebrations,
in which generals and soldiers entered the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.850
city in honor to celebrate their success in
battle.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.430
In other words, they had the “Freedom of
the City.”

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.420
It was in medieval Europe when physical keys
started being used, around the sixth or seventh

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.420
century.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
When a monarch or ruler came upon a city or
town, the leaders would greet him and hold

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.310
a celebration in his honor (with dancing,
food, wine…lots of wine).

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.659
They would, then, present him with a real
key to the city’s gate, allowing this ruler

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.770
unlimited access.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.120
There was also a related custom of giving
such keys to certain respected merchants and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.870
tradesmen, who could enter the city without
needing to pay a tax or toll.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.240
It seems the first time such an honor was
given in the United States was in New York

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.190
City on June 27, 1702.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.850
Mayor Philip French (mayor of New York City
for only one year) gave the Viscount Cornbury,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.170
Edward Hyde, the British governor of New York
and considered the most powerful man in the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260
colonies, “Freedom of the City.”

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.390
Additionally, Mayor French declared that all
those in the city who were too poor to purchase

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.260
their own freedoms were given “Freedom of
the City Gratis” for the day.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.390
So that’s how the custom of giving a key
to the city started and how it made its way

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.819
to the United States.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.120
So why was Saddam Hussein given such an honor
by the city of Detroit?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.420
Hussein became President of Iraq on July 16,
1979.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.310
Six days later, he ordered the execution of
twenty one Iraqi government officials (including

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.680
five ministers) who were accused of being
“traitors.”

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.580
Hussein was a Sunni Muslim, though religion
was never truly a huge part of his belief

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.580
system.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.980
What Hussein did value was loyalty and political
support.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.880
So, when Reverend Jacob Yasso of the Chaldean
Sacred Heart in Detroit, Michigan publicly

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.580
congratulated Hussein on his rise to power,
the compliment didn’t go unnoticed.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.140
Jacob Yasso was born in Telkaif, Iraq and
after high school, was recruited to Rome where

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.010
he completed his masters degree in Philosophy
and Theology.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.790
In 1960, he was ordained a priest in the Chaldean
Catholic Church.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.050
Chaldean Catholics are Catholics whose ethnicity
stems from the ancient area of Mesopotamia,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.180
more specifically northern Iraq, southeast
Turkey, Syria, and northwest Iran.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.270
In 1964, he was appointed to serve the growing
Chaldean community in Detroit.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.360
In response to Yasso’s congratulations,
Saddam sent the church $250,000.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.800
This came as a surprise to Yasso considering
this regime had actually criticized Yasso

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.130
for questioning their nationalization of Iraqi
schools.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.800
According to an interview Yasso gave in 2003
with the AP, Saddam Hussein was making donations

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.780
to Chaldean churches across the world at that
time, so giving money to his church wasn’t

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.739
necessarily out of the ordinary for Iraq’s
president.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.030
Plus, Detroit had the largest Chaldean population
in the United States, who predominately supported

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.769
the rise of Hussein in Iraq.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.370
Yasso and Hussein kept in touch, and about
a year later, in 1980, along with about twenty

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.690
five people from the Detroit Chaldean community,
he was a guest of the Iraqi government and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.690
arrived in Baghdad.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.349
Then, he was led into Saddam’s palace.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.099
In the same interview, Yasso states “We
were received on the red carpet.”

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.500
At some point during the celebration, Yasso
presented Saddam Hussein a gift from then-mayor

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.759
of Detroit, Coleman Young, a key to the city,
which of course at this point in the practice

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.560
of giving keys out didn’t unlock anything,
but was merely a symbolic honor.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.189
This act of honoring of a man today generally
thought of as having been a ruthless tyrant,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.979
didn’t happen in a vacuum.

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.409
In the late 70s, the United States employed
the well-known philosophy, “an enemy of

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.110
our enemy is our friend.”

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.990
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was engaged in a war
against Iran.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.599
Considering the US’s own issues with Iran,
the State Department very much supported Iraq

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.599
in the war.

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.419
In fact, there is some evidence that the State
Department actually encouraged Detroit mayor

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.319
Coleman Young to ask Rev. Yasso to present
a key to the city of Detroit to Hussein.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.509
In Baghdad, Saddam graciously accepted the
honor and asked Yasso, “I heard there was

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.319
a debt on your church.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.319
How much is it?”

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.910
Yasso said yes there was, approximately for
$170,000.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.379
Saddam gave him a check for $200,000 dollars,
enough to pay the debt and build a new recreation

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.379
hall.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.330
In the 2003 interview, Yasso went on to say
that Saddam was an American puppet and once

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.099
the US government didn’t need him anymore,
he was no good.

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:33.939
However, he did admit that while Saddam Hussein
may have been

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:48.629
a “good person” at some point, “money
and power changed the person.”
