00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm standing in front of a small waterfall.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, this waterfall has a height of about 1.5 m.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can and should calculate the speed that you'd expect

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
these water droplets to be falling as they hit the ground.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It turns out that when we measure the speed of these water droplets,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it's actually a little less than what we would calculate,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that's because work is being done by the air resistance.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When we measure the speed of these water droplets, they're moving at 4 m/s.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I want you to tell me how much work is being done on each 1 g drop of water

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as it falls the 1.5 m to the ground.
