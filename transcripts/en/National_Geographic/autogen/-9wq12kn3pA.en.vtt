00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.290
- [Lindsay] Within the
last couple of decades,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.093
this population has dramatically
decreased in number.

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:12.320
(camera clicks)

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.620
There is one really close.

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:16.642
(camera clicks)

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:19.225
(gentle music)

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.470
- They are incredibly challenging to study

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.960
because when they do surface,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.040
they don't bring much of
their bodies out of the water.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.490
So, it's difficult to
identify individuals,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.300
and it's difficult to really discern

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.227
what type of behavior is occurring.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.440
(gentle music)

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.171
- [Lindsay] For photo identification
of individual dolphins,

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.040
for many, many species,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.510
we use the shape or the coloration

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.270
that you find on the dorsal area

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.973
particularly the dorsal fin.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.030
The main cause of
mortality for this species,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.800
previously, was entanglement in gillnets.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560
The river guard program was put in place

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.850
to remove the illegal gillnets

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570
which are being set on the
dolphin sanctuary areas.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.380
So the chances of dolphins
becoming entangled in these nets,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.813
of course, are far less if
they simply aren't there.

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:25.240
(gentle music)
(boat running)

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.770
- [Lindsay] We're quit hopeful
because we've seen a decrease

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.920
in adult mortality and
there are several new calves

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.120
in the last two years as well.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.670
The last population estimate

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.930
was for 92 individual
dolphins in the area,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.700
and that's an increase on 12

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.470
from the previous estimates.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.760
So were very hopeful

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.023
that this population is now
on the road to recovery.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.610
- [Lindsay] I think one of the
most spectacular things about

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.610
this particular population
is the setting itself.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.610
They are such an integral
part of the communites

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.270
that live around the river.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.956
The people that live in the
Mekong area rely entirely

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:11.110
on the river habitat as do the dolphins.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.180
The dolphins and the humans,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.740
it's all part of one big system

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.542
that's really clear to see.

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:19.125
