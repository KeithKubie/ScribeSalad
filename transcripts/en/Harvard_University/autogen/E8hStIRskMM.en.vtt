and it's only recently that we've really

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
and it's only recently that we've really
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.999
and it's only recently that we've really
begun to understand where we actually

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009

Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170
Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right
 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.190
Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right
and therefore that the universe is much

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
and therefore that the universe is much
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.550
and therefore that the universe is much
larger than the Milky Way alone five

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
larger than the Milky Way alone five
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.249
larger than the Milky Way alone five
years later he proved that the universe

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259
years later he proved that the universe
 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.460
years later he proved that the universe
is expanding and therefore that it had

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470
is expanding and therefore that it had
 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.700
is expanding and therefore that it had
an origin in time we now know that at

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710
an origin in time we now know that at
 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.320
an origin in time we now know that at
origin was 13.8 billion years ago but

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.990
Digital Sky Survey I'll try to go
through a fair bit of detail on how we

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000
through a fair bit of detail on how we
 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.820
through a fair bit of detail on how we
actually go about doing these

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830

sdss and tell you some of what we've

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400
sdss and tell you some of what we've
 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.090
sdss and tell you some of what we've
learned about cosmology from that so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100
learned about cosmology from that so
 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.410
learned about cosmology from that so
let's get started with with the big

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420
let's get started with with the big
 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.350
let's get started with with the big
pictures of cosmology so the real I

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
pictures of cosmology so the real I
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.210
pictures of cosmology so the real I
think primal question here is what's the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220
think primal question here is what's the
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.310
think primal question here is what's the
universe made of so of course the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320
universe made of so of course the
 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.810
universe made of so of course the
composition of the universe is a very

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
composition of the universe is a very
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.810
composition of the universe is a very
basic question of physics and as you may

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820
basic question of physics and as you may
 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.160
basic question of physics and as you may
well know this is something that's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170
well know this is something that's
 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.810
well know this is something that's
turned out to have very surprising

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820
turned out to have very surprising
 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.290
turned out to have very surprising
answers the first set of surprises were

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300
answers the first set of surprises were
 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.000
answers the first set of surprises were
these ideas of dark matter so when

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010
these ideas of dark matter so when
 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.949
these ideas of dark matter so when
astronomers started measuring the

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
astronomers started measuring the
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.440
astronomers started measuring the
motions of stars in our own galaxy or in

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450
motions of stars in our own galaxy or in
 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.150
motions of stars in our own galaxy or in
other galaxies or the motions of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160
other galaxies or the motions of
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.130

they found that these stars and galaxies

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140
they found that these stars and galaxies
 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.320
they found that these stars and galaxies
were orbiting the out there there there

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330
were orbiting the out there there there
 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.380
were orbiting the out there there there
center too quickly and this indicated

center too quickly and this indicated
 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.940
center too quickly and this indicated
there must be more mass there that's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950
there must be more mass there that's
 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.100
there must be more mass there that's
holding these these objects onto bound

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.040
holding these these objects onto bound
orbits these days we can actually see

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050
orbits these days we can actually see
 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.479
orbits these days we can actually see
this quite directly with gravitational

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489
this quite directly with gravitational
 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.490
this quite directly with gravitational
lensing this is a cluster of galaxies LT

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500
lensing this is a cluster of galaxies LT

all the yellow objects are clusters of

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
all the yellow objects are clusters of
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.640
all the yellow objects are clusters of
galaxies and they're actually bending

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650
galaxies and they're actually bending
 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.680

the light of a galaxy in the background

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
the light of a galaxy in the background
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.310
the light of a galaxy in the background
this is the same galaxy seen four times

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320
this is the same galaxy seen four times
 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.540
this is the same galaxy seen four times
being bent by the light of the galaxy so

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
being bent by the light of the galaxy so
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.730
being bent by the light of the galaxy so
from this we can quite directly infer

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740
from this we can quite directly infer
 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.409
from this we can quite directly infer
the amount of mass that must be in this

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419
the amount of mass that must be in this
 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.940
the amount of mass that must be in this
cluster and it's much larger than what

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950
cluster and it's much larger than what
 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.969
cluster and it's much larger than what
the stars would

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979
the stars would
 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.100
the stars would
would provide and at the great surprise

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110
would provide and at the great surprise
 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.869
would provide and at the great surprise
is that this extra matter this dark

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879
is that this extra matter this dark
 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.169
is that this extra matter this dark
matter is not just more of us it's not

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:44.179
matter is not just more of us it's not
 

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:47.139
matter is not just more of us it's not
just more protons or or electrons or

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:47.149
just more protons or or electrons or
 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:48.579
just more protons or or electrons or
whatnot it actually has to have some

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:48.589
whatnot it actually has to have some
 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.439
whatnot it actually has to have some
exotic form and we've been able to show

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449
exotic form and we've been able to show
 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.570
exotic form and we've been able to show
that fairly directly well having

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
that fairly directly well having
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.879
that fairly directly well having
discovered dark matter in the context of

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889
discovered dark matter in the context of
 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.829
discovered dark matter in the context of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies

00:04:59.829 --> 00:04:59.839
galaxies and clusters of galaxies
 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.899
galaxies and clusters of galaxies
astronomers set out to try to measure

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909
astronomers set out to try to measure
 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.429
astronomers set out to try to measure
the total amount of dark matter in the

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439
the total amount of dark matter in the
 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.749
the total amount of dark matter in the
universe and to do that we need to

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759
universe and to do that we need to
 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.149
universe and to do that we need to
measure the motions on even larger

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159
measure the motions on even larger
 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:08.829
measure the motions on even larger
scales and the most extreme version of

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:08.839
scales and the most extreme version of
 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.929
scales and the most extreme version of
this is to try to measure the

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939
this is to try to measure the
 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.909
this is to try to measure the
gravitational effect on the expansion of

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919
gravitational effect on the expansion of
 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.859
gravitational effect on the expansion of
the universe itself Christine just

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:14.869
the universe itself Christine just
 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:16.510
the universe itself Christine just
mentioned that that we've known for

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520
mentioned that that we've known for
 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.760
mentioned that that we've known for
almost a hundred years that the universe

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770
almost a hundred years that the universe
 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.790
almost a hundred years that the universe
is expanding but if you have a universe

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800
is expanding but if you have a universe
 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.899
is expanding but if you have a universe
that has more matter on it than you

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909
that has more matter on it than you
 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.670
that has more matter on it than you
would imagine you'd expect that that

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680
would imagine you'd expect that that
 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.189
would imagine you'd expect that that
expansion would slow down over time

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199
expansion would slow down over time
 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.299
expansion would slow down over time
because of the action of gravity and the

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:28.309
because of the action of gravity and the
 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.499
because of the action of gravity and the
by measuring the amount of that

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509
by measuring the amount of that
 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.350
by measuring the amount of that
deceleration you would infer the amount

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360
deceleration you would infer the amount
 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.529
deceleration you would infer the amount
of the amount of material well I should

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539
of the amount of material well I should
 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.089
of the amount of material well I should
pause to just give you a little bit of a

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099
pause to just give you a little bit of a
 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.429
pause to just give you a little bit of a
sense of of the expanding of what it

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439
sense of of the expanding of what it
 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.839
sense of of the expanding of what it
means to measure expansion so we're

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849
means to measure expansion so we're
 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.389
means to measure expansion so we're
using Doppler shifts to measure how fast

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399
using Doppler shifts to measure how fast
 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.739
using Doppler shifts to measure how fast
galaxies are moving away and these

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:44.749
galaxies are moving away and these
 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.379
galaxies are moving away and these
Doppler shifts are really exactly like

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389
Doppler shifts are really exactly like
 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.540
Doppler shifts are really exactly like
what you get when you know when a police

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
what you get when you know when a police
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.859
what you get when you know when a police
car is coming toward you're away from

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:50.869
car is coming toward you're away from
 

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.269
car is coming toward you're away from
you hear that you hear the sound change

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279
you hear that you hear the sound change
 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.790
you hear that you hear the sound change
in our case we're looking for the

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800
in our case we're looking for the
 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.639
in our case we're looking for the
transition of particular atomic

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:57.649
transition of particular atomic
 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.069
transition of particular atomic
transitions in the spectra of galaxies

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:00.079
transitions in the spectra of galaxies
 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.290
transitions in the spectra of galaxies
and watching them shift in wavelength

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300
and watching them shift in wavelength
 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.239
and watching them shift in wavelength
towards the red this allows us to

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:04.249
towards the red this allows us to
 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:05.559
towards the red this allows us to
measure how fast the galaxies are moving

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569
measure how fast the galaxies are moving
 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.379
measure how fast the galaxies are moving
away from us and in a uniform expanding

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389
away from us and in a uniform expanding
 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.959
away from us and in a uniform expanding
universe then you expect that galaxies

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969
universe then you expect that galaxies
 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.189
universe then you expect that galaxies
that are further away from us

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199
that are further away from us
 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.339
that are further away from us
intrinsically are moving away faster

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349
intrinsically are moving away faster
 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.109
intrinsically are moving away faster
basically this is as if you know we all

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:17.119
basically this is as if you know we all
 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.509
basically this is as if you know we all
stood up and you know instead of sitting

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:19.519
stood up and you know instead of sitting
 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.459
stood up and you know instead of sitting
seat to seat next to each other we all

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469
seat to seat next to each other we all
 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.529
seat to seat next to each other we all
stood up and had to put one spare seat

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539
stood up and had to put one spare seat
 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.389
stood up and had to put one spare seat
between us in this room that would be

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:25.399
between us in this room that would be
 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.129
between us in this room that would be
hard right now but you would then see

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139
hard right now but you would then see
 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.230
hard right now but you would then see
that if you get to get your neighbor to

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240
that if you get to get your neighbor to
 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.429
that if you get to get your neighbor to
move wait your neighbor only has to move

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439
move wait your neighbor only has to move
 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.259
move wait your neighbor only has to move
one seat but somebody at the other side

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.269
one seat but somebody at the other side
 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:33.879
one seat but somebody at the other side
of the room has to effectively move 20

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889
of the room has to effectively move 20
 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.079
of the room has to effectively move 20
seats because we got to stick in an

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:35.089
seats because we got to stick in an
 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.420
seats because we got to stick in an
extra seat between every pair of people

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430
extra seat between every pair of people
 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.209
extra seat between every pair of people
so this relationship between the

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219
so this relationship between the
 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.609
so this relationship between the
velocity of a galaxy and the distance is

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:42.619
velocity of a galaxy and the distance is
 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.619
velocity of a galaxy and the distance is
called Hubble relation and for small

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629
called Hubble relation and for small
 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.179
called Hubble relation and for small
distances this gives us a way of

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:46.189
distances this gives us a way of
 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.589
distances this gives us a way of
measuring the relative distance to

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599
measuring the relative distance to
 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:48.590
measuring the relative distance to
objects

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600
objects
 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600
objects
now this recession velocity is also

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610
now this recession velocity is also
 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.330
now this recession velocity is also
known as a redshift and it's written as

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340
known as a redshift and it's written as
 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.520
known as a redshift and it's written as
the letter Z and so I will very often

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530
the letter Z and so I will very often
 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.290
the letter Z and so I will very often
say the word redshift in this talk and

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300
say the word redshift in this talk and
 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.760
say the word redshift in this talk and
what I mean is this recessional velocity

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
what I mean is this recessional velocity
 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.280
what I mean is this recessional velocity
the word redshift comes into our to our

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290
the word redshift comes into our to our
 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.210
the word redshift comes into our to our
lingo so much because redshift is when

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220
lingo so much because redshift is when
 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.380
lingo so much because redshift is when
you when you measure an object that's

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390
you when you measure an object that's
 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.970
you when you measure an object that's
moving away from us very quickly it's

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980
moving away from us very quickly it's
 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.920
moving away from us very quickly it's
very far from us this means that the

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930
very far from us this means that the
 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.480
very far from us this means that the
light has taken a very long time to get

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490
light has taken a very long time to get
 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.310
light has taken a very long time to get
to us and that means that object was

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320
to us and that means that object was
 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.140
to us and that means that object was
that light was emitted very early in the

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150
that light was emitted very early in the
 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.210
that light was emitted very early in the
universe or earlier in the universe so

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220
universe or earlier in the universe so
 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.770
universe or earlier in the universe so
the measurement of redshift is also a

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780
the measurement of redshift is also a
 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.770
the measurement of redshift is also a
measurement of the time that that you're

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780
measurement of the time that that you're
 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.210
measurement of the time that that you're
viewing that object that when you when

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220
viewing that object that when you when
 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.890
viewing that object that when you when
you observe a Galaxy at higher redshift

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900
you observe a Galaxy at higher redshift
 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.360
you observe a Galaxy at higher redshift
you're observing a portion of the

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370
you're observing a portion of the
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.640
you're observing a portion of the
universe that is younger and that's a

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650
universe that is younger and that's a
 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.210
universe that is younger and that's a
very important thing alright well let's

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220
very important thing alright well let's
 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.280
very important thing alright well let's
try to connect this idea to how we're

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.290
try to connect this idea to how we're
 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.440
try to connect this idea to how we're
actually trying to weigh the universe so

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.450
actually trying to weigh the universe so
 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.270
actually trying to weigh the universe so
here's a very simple plot of the size of

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280
here's a very simple plot of the size of
 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.570
here's a very simple plot of the size of

the Big Bang is 14 billion years ago but

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.210
the Big Bang is 14 billion years ago but
 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.730
the Big Bang is 14 billion years ago but
if you think that the universe is

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.740
if you think that the universe is
 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.520
if you think that the universe is
decelerating because of matter then in

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.530
decelerating because of matter then in
 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.990
decelerating because of matter then in
fact it should be expanding quicker at

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000
fact it should be expanding quicker at
 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.070
fact it should be expanding quicker at
the beginning and then it should start

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080
the beginning and then it should start
 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.470
the beginning and then it should start
to decelerate and that means that you

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:10.480
to decelerate and that means that you
 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.800
to decelerate and that means that you
that that the the Big Bang the time of

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.810
that that the the Big Bang the time of
 

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.880
that that the the Big Bang the time of
zero size is is less time in the past so

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:17.890
zero size is is less time in the past so
 

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.320
zero size is is less time in the past so
that would say that objects that a given

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.330
that would say that objects that a given
 

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.580
that would say that objects that a given

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.560
redshift should actually appear to be

that blights traveled less distance to

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.010
that blights traveled less distance to
 

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.710
that blights traveled less distance to
get to us that means the objects would

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720
get to us that means the objects would
 

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.909
get to us that means the objects would
be a little bit brighter so you would

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919
be a little bit brighter so you would
 

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:29.190
be a little bit brighter so you would
expect that by measuring objects at a

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.740
expect that by measuring objects at a
given redshift if you measure them to be

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:31.750
given redshift if you measure them to be
 

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.940
given redshift if you measure them to be
a little bit the brighter you measure

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:32.950
a little bit the brighter you measure
 

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.770
a little bit the brighter you measure
them to be the more deceleration there

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:34.780

over States our knowledge by a factor of
two because all we really know is that

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.070
two because all we really know is that

two because all we really know is that
it's dark we don't actually know its

it's dark we don't actually know its
 

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.400
it's dark we don't actually know its
energy but if you believe that its

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:23.410
energy but if you believe that its
 

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.810
energy but if you believe that its
energy then it's actually out weighing

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:24.820
energy then it's actually out weighing
 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.040
energy then it's actually out weighing

all the rest of the matter in the
 

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.290
all the rest of the matter in the
universe by about a factor of two so

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.300
universe by about a factor of two so
 

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.880
universe by about a factor of two so
here's here's just referring to this

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:29.890
here's here's just referring to this
 

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.440
here's here's just referring to this
picture if you observe the objects if

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:31.450
picture if you observe the objects if
 

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.450
picture if you observe the objects if
you think the universe is accelerating

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:33.460
you think the universe is accelerating
 

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.190
you think the universe is accelerating
then it decelerates initially and then

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200
then it decelerates initially and then
 

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.960
then it decelerates initially and then
dark energy starts to turn on and you

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:36.970
dark energy starts to turn on and you
 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.430
dark energy starts to turn on and you
actually get an acceleration at late

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440
actually get an acceleration at late
 

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.320
actually get an acceleration at late
times and so you find that the

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.330
times and so you find that the
 

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.450
times and so you find that the
accelerating universe you have the

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:42.460
accelerating universe you have the
 

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.550
accelerating universe you have the
photons have traveled farther longer to

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560
photons have traveled farther longer to
 

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.110
photons have traveled farther longer to
get to us that traveled further and

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120
get to us that traveled further and
 

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.770
get to us that traveled further and
therefore objects appear to be fainter

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:48.780
therefore objects appear to be fainter
 

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.240
therefore objects appear to be fainter
so we're left with this idea of a cosmic

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.250
so we're left with this idea of a cosmic
 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.340
so we're left with this idea of a cosmic
composition where we are here in the

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.350

atoms part of the pie only four percent

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:55.990
atoms part of the pie only four percent
 

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.950
atoms part of the pie only four percent
of the pie and in fact the stars are

00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:58.960
of the pie and in fact the stars are
 

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.230
of the pie and in fact the stars are
only about point only about half a

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240
only about point only about half a
 

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.630
only about point only about half a
percent so most of the gas is not even

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
percent so most of the gas is not even
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.820
percent so most of the gas is not even
in stars most of the atom Martin stars

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:05.830
in stars most of the atom Martin stars
 

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.990
in stars most of the atom Martin stars
but then we have dark matter which is

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000
but then we have dark matter which is
 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.940
but then we have dark matter which is
out laying the atoms by six to one and

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:08.950
out laying the atoms by six to one and
 

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.970
out laying the atoms by six to one and
we have dark energy which is outweighing

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:11.980
we have dark energy which is outweighing
 

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.910
we have dark energy which is outweighing
the matter by about a factor of two so

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920
the matter by about a factor of two so
 

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.050
the matter by about a factor of two so

discovered the fifth force and that it's
 

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.620
discovered the fifth force and that it's
actually some some repulsive force on

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.630
actually some some repulsive force on
 

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.470
actually some some repulsive force on
the very largest scales or maybe we just

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480
the very largest scales or maybe we just
 

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.790
the very largest scales or maybe we just
don't understand one of the normal

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800
don't understand one of the normal
 

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.620
don't understand one of the normal
forces maybe we misunderstand gravity

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:04.630
forces maybe we misunderstand gravity
 

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.030
forces maybe we misunderstand gravity
and we like to think that gravity is

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040
and we like to think that gravity is
 

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.680
and we like to think that gravity is
always pulling on things but maybe on

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:07.690
always pulling on things but maybe on
 

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.060
always pulling on things but maybe on
the largest scales it actually pushes

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.070
the largest scales it actually pushes
 

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.350
the largest scales it actually pushes
stuff up pushes stuff around ah maybe

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360
stuff up pushes stuff around ah maybe
 

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.020
stuff up pushes stuff around ah maybe

so what can we do observational e well

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440
so what can we do observational e well
 

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.870
so what can we do observational e well
the main thing we try to do is measure

the main thing we try to do is measure
very accurate distances so I said that

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.280
very accurate distances so I said that
 

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.590
very accurate distances so I said that
the supernovae were measured to be too

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600
the supernovae were measured to be too
 

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.480
the supernovae were measured to be too
faint that means they're too distant and

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.490
faint that means they're too distant and
 

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.860
faint that means they're too distant and
we're trying to measure extremely

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.780
second half of the 20th century
astronomers were arguing about something

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:18.790
astronomers were arguing about something
 

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.550
astronomers were arguing about something
called the Hubble constant and they

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560
called the Hubble constant and they
 

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.110
called the Hubble constant and they
argued about whether was fifty or a

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120
argued about whether was fifty or a

there's a factor of two disagreement in

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.250
there's a factor of two disagreement in
 

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.440
there's a factor of two disagreement in
the distance scale universe people

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.450
the distance scale universe people
 

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.090
the distance scale universe people
actually were disagreeing on what on how

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.100
actually were disagreeing on what on how
 

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.250
actually were disagreeing on what on how
far away the galaxies were by the factor

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:32.260
far away the galaxies were by the factor
 

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.680
far away the galaxies were by the factor
of two level and we're now doing this at

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:34.690
of two level and we're now doing this at
 

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.470
of two level and we're now doing this at
one percent so how do we do this well

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480
one percent so how do we do this well
 

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.640
one percent so how do we do this well
we're doing it with something called the

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:38.650
we're doing it with something called the
 

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.040
we're doing it with something called the
baryon acoustic oscillations so this in

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.050
baryon acoustic oscillations so this in
 

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.660

detail in the slides coming up but in

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:44.380

brief sound waves that propagate in the

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:47.620
brief sound waves that propagate in the
 

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.530
brief sound waves that propagate in the
first 400,000 years after the Big Bang

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:49.540
first 400,000 years after the Big Bang
 

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.960
first 400,000 years after the Big Bang
so very early on these sound waves

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:51.970
so very early on these sound waves
 

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.240
so very early on these sound waves
create a very distinctive feature in the

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.250
create a very distinctive feature in the
 

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.920
create a very distinctive feature in the
clustering of galaxies and that feature

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:55.930
clustering of galaxies and that feature
 

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.230
clustering of galaxies and that feature
is that pairs of galaxies if I have two

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240
is that pairs of galaxies if I have two
 

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.510
is that pairs of galaxies if I have two
galaxies they are slightly more likely

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:00.520
galaxies they are slightly more likely
 

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.430
galaxies they are slightly more likely
to be separated by 500 million light

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440
to be separated by 500 million light
 

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.770
to be separated by 500 million light
years then by then they are by 400 or

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:04.780
years then by then they are by 400 or
 

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.090
years then by then they are by 400 or
600 million light years so there's a

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.100
600 million light years so there's a
 

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.800
600 million light years so there's a
characteristic scale of the clustering

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:07.810
characteristic scale of the clustering
 

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.260
characteristic scale of the clustering
of pairs of galaxies that's imprinted in

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.270
of pairs of galaxies that's imprinted in
 

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.870
of pairs of galaxies that's imprinted in
the early universe and when we get to

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880
the early universe and when we get to
 

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.060
the early universe and when we get to
see this scale then we get to infer

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.070
see this scale then we get to infer
 

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.770
see this scale then we get to infer
distances because if I tell you that I'm

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:16.780
distances because if I tell you that I'm
 

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.290
distances because if I tell you that I'm
six feet tall you just get to break out

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
six feet tall you just get to break out
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.600
six feet tall you just get to break out
a protractor and measure what the angle

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.610
a protractor and measure what the angle
 

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.420
a protractor and measure what the angle
is from my head to my feet as it appears

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.430
is from my head to my feet as it appears
 

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.520
is from my head to my feet as it appears
to you and then you can infer the

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.530
to you and then you can infer the
 

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.530
to you and then you can infer the
distance from me to you so just by

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:28.540
distance from me to you so just by
 

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.060
distance from me to you so just by
telling you how tall I am

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.070
telling you how tall I am
 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.640
telling you how tall I am
and allowing you to measure angles you

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:32.650
and allowing you to measure angles you
 

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.550
and allowing you to measure angles you
can measure distance so that's the idea

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560
can measure distance so that's the idea
 

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.650
can measure distance so that's the idea
this is called a standard ruler and

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:37.660
this is called a standard ruler and
 

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.650
this is called a standard ruler and
that's that's how we use this okay so

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:40.660
that's that's how we use this okay so
 

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.260
that's that's how we use this okay so
let's uh let's start trying to explain

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.270
let's uh let's start trying to explain
 

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.460
let's uh let's start trying to explain
these sound waves well we're going to

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:44.470
these sound waves well we're going to
 

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.270
these sound waves well we're going to
start with the Cosmic Microwave

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.280
start with the Cosmic Microwave
 

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.620
start with the Cosmic Microwave
Background so the Cosmic Microwave

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:46.630
Background so the Cosmic Microwave
 

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.380
Background so the Cosmic Microwave
Background is the radiation the relic

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:49.390
Background is the radiation the relic
 

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.500
Background is the radiation the relic
heat left over from the Big Bang and to

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.510
heat left over from the Big Bang and to
 

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.800
heat left over from the Big Bang and to
call it heat might sound ambitious even

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:55.810
call it heat might sound ambitious even
 

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.570
call it heat might sound ambitious even
for Bostonians because this is only

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.580
for Bostonians because this is only
 

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.000
for Bostonians because this is only
three degrees above absolute zero so

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.010
three degrees above absolute zero so
 

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.190
three degrees above absolute zero so
this is a relic heat left over three

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:02.200
this is a relic heat left over three
 

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.670
this is a relic heat left over three
degrees above absolute zero and but it's

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680
degrees above absolute zero and but it's
 

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.950
degrees above absolute zero and but it's
incredibly useful because this radiation

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:07.960
incredibly useful because this radiation
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.140
incredibly useful because this radiation
has traveled to us basically unimpeded

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.150
has traveled to us basically unimpeded
 

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.240
has traveled to us basically unimpeded
through throughout the history of the

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.250

this is actually caused because we are

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.700
this is actually caused because we are
 

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.970
this is actually caused because we are
moving relative to the microwave

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:53.980
moving relative to the microwave

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.720
well that was the map as we had in 1992
and since then people have been working

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:00.730
and since then people have been working
 

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.080

these fluctuations are tiny only a part

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:22.420
these fluctuations are tiny only a part
 

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.240
these fluctuations are tiny only a part
100,000 but they're incredibly important

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:24.250
100,000 but they're incredibly important
 

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.000
100,000 but they're incredibly important
because the details of these little

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.010
because the details of these little
 

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.010
because the details of these little
ripples are actually telling us about

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:29.020
ripples are actually telling us about
 

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.050

the composition of the very early

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.060
the composition of the very early
 

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.520
the composition of the very early

universe and about a fair number other
 

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.890
universe and about a fair number other
things as well but they're really

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:33.900
things as well but they're really
 

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.140
things as well but they're really
exceptional for measuring composition so

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.150
exceptional for measuring composition so
 

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.480
exceptional for measuring composition so
let's try to understand that well now

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:39.490
let's try to understand that well now
 

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.650
let's try to understand that well now
we're going to get into this idea of the

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:40.660
we're going to get into this idea of the
 

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.150
we're going to get into this idea of the
acoustic oscillations so if I look at

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160
acoustic oscillations so if I look at
 

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.030
acoustic oscillations so if I look at
this map from the W map case when you

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040
this map from the W map case when you
 

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.740
this map from the W map case when you
look at the temperature fluctuations you

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:46.750
look at the temperature fluctuations you
 

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.290
look at the temperature fluctuations you
see fluctuations on large angular scales

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.300
see fluctuations on large angular scales
 

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.510
see fluctuations on large angular scales
you know there's you know this region is

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:51.520
you know there's you know this region is
 

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.950
you know there's you know this region is
a little hotter than that region for

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:52.960
a little hotter than that region for
 

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.080
a little hotter than that region for
example and you see fluctuations on

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.090
example and you see fluctuations on
 

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.640
example and you see fluctuations on
small angular skills but if you take a

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:56.650
small angular skills but if you take a
 

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.350
small angular skills but if you take a
just a part of this map and you blow it

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360
just a part of this map and you blow it
 

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.820
just a part of this map and you blow it
up and you just look at it your eye is

00:16:59.820 --> 00:16:59.830
up and you just look at it your eye is
 

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.700
up and you just look at it your eye is
drawn to a characteristic scale of the

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:02.710
drawn to a characteristic scale of the
 

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.560
drawn to a characteristic scale of the
blob enos there is sort of it there is a

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.570
blob enos there is sort of it there is a
 

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.630
blob enos there is sort of it there is a
scale in this map a sort of typical size

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640
scale in this map a sort of typical size
 

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.810
scale in this map a sort of typical size
of the blobs and that is not caused by

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:09.820
of the blobs and that is not caused by
 

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.220
of the blobs and that is not caused by
the resolution of the telescope that's

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.230
the resolution of the telescope that's
 

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.600
the resolution of the telescope that's
actually caused by very important

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:12.610
actually caused by very important
 

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.510
actually caused by very important
physical process in the early universe

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520
physical process in the early universe
 

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.770
physical process in the early universe
so the way that we analyze maps like

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:16.780
so the way that we analyze maps like
 

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.449
so the way that we analyze maps like
this is by taking them and splitting

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:18.459
this is by taking them and splitting
 

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:21.270
this is by taking them and splitting
them up into into their wavelengths so

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280
them up into into their wavelengths so
 

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.380
them up into into their wavelengths so
basically we're trying to split them up

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.390
basically we're trying to split them up
 

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.690
basically we're trying to split them up
into the long wavelength modes the

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:24.700
into the long wavelength modes the
 

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.310
into the long wavelength modes the
medium wavelength modes on the short

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:26.320
medium wavelength modes on the short
 

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.440
medium wavelength modes on the short
wavelength modes and plotting how much

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:28.450
wavelength modes and plotting how much
 

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.420

so it's like taking a piece of music and

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:32.380
so it's like taking a piece of music and
 

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.110
so it's like taking a piece of music and
trying to figure out how much of the

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120
trying to figure out how much of the
 

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.810
trying to figure out how much of the
volume is in low see how much is in

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:36.820
volume is in low see how much is in
 

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.730
volume is in low see how much is in
middle e how much is in high G and

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:38.740
middle e how much is in high G and
 

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.360
middle e how much is in high G and
plotting that up so this was the the

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:42.370
plotting that up so this was the the
 

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.220
plotting that up so this was the the
picture that came from the wmf satellite

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.230
picture that came from the wmf satellite
 

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.010
picture that came from the wmf satellite
of this big bump at one degree angular

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.020
of this big bump at one degree angular
 

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.450
of this big bump at one degree angular
scale so this was this characteristic

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:48.460
scale so this was this characteristic
 

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.790
scale so this was this characteristic
scale your eyes picking out a one degree

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:50.800

sort of dominant frequency in the map

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:53.950
sort of dominant frequency in the map
 

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.060
sort of dominant frequency in the map
and you also see harmonics at

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.070
and you also see harmonics at
 

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.470
and you also see harmonics at
this and if this picture looks too

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480
this and if this picture looks too
 

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.720

but from the plot data one two three

00:18:03.629 --> 00:18:03.639
but from the plot data one two three
 

00:18:03.639 --> 00:18:06.570
but from the plot data one two three
four five six seven and if you squint at

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:06.580
four five six seven and if you squint at
 

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.830
four five six seven and if you squint at
the yellow points the eighth and maybe

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840
the yellow points the eighth and maybe
 

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.019
the yellow points the eighth and maybe
the ninth p so these are basically

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:10.029
the ninth p so these are basically
 

00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:12.450
the ninth p so these are basically
overtones of this fundamental scale in

the early universe you're seeing you're
 

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.259
the early universe you're seeing you're
seeing our harmonic you're seeing a

seeing our harmonic you're seeing a
 

00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:17.639

fundamental mode and then of the

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:17.649
fundamental mode and then of the
 

00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:19.259

organ pipe you get the fundamental mode

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.490
organ pipe you get the fundamental mode
 

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.129
organ pipe you get the fundamental mode
of the organ pipe and then you can get

00:18:23.129 --> 00:18:23.139
of the organ pipe and then you can get
 

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:26.850
of the organ pipe and then you can get
overtones of that mode so what's causing

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:26.860
overtones of that mode so what's causing
 

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.379
overtones of that mode so what's causing
this so this is these are actually

00:18:28.379 --> 00:18:28.389
this so this is these are actually
 

00:18:28.389 --> 00:18:30.389

the early universe now the key idea here
 

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.549
the early universe now the key idea here
is this idea of recombination it happens

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559
is this idea of recombination it happens
 

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.259
is this idea of recombination it happens
at redshift of a thousand so when the

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:37.269
at redshift of a thousand so when the
 

00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:38.789

400,000 years after the Big Bang this

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:45.850
400,000 years after the Big Bang this

400,000 years after the Big Bang this
this age I'm talking about okay why is

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:48.580
this age I'm talking about okay why is
 

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.710
this age I'm talking about okay why is
this important well it's important

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720
this important well it's important
 

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.629
this important well it's important
because prior to this time the universe

00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:51.639
because prior to this time the universe
 

00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:54.480
because prior to this time the universe
is sufficiently hot and dense that it's

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:54.490
is sufficiently hot and dense that it's
 

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.610
is sufficiently hot and dense that it's
actually ionized so all the atoms have

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:56.620
actually ionized so all the atoms have
 

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.379
actually ionized so all the atoms have
had their electrons plucked off so you

00:18:58.379 --> 00:18:58.389
had their electrons plucked off so you
 

00:18:58.389 --> 00:19:00.919
had their electrons plucked off so you
have basically electrons and free nuclei

00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:00.929
have basically electrons and free nuclei
 

00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:03.269
have basically electrons and free nuclei
floating around instead of neutral

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:03.279
floating around instead of neutral
 

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.669
floating around instead of neutral
instead of neutral gas this is very

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679
instead of neutral gas this is very
 

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.980
instead of neutral gas this is very
important because free electrons are

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:07.990
important because free electrons are
 

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.200
important because free electrons are
extremely good at scattering photons if

extremely good at scattering photons if
you try to send a photon through such a

if you take a piston and try to compress
a piston it heats up the gas it heats up

the balloon you'll hear it but you'll

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.730
the balloon you'll hear it but you'll
 

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.310
the balloon you'll hear it but you'll
hear it because a sound wave travels out

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320
hear it because a sound wave travels out
 

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.130
hear it because a sound wave travels out
from the balloon to you so the wave

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:05.140
from the balloon to you so the wave
 

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.140
from the balloon to you so the wave
travels out at the speed of sound which

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.150
travels out at the speed of sound which
 

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.940
travels out at the speed of sound which
at these early times is fantastically

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:08.950

of light it's a relativistic sound way

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:11.950
of light it's a relativistic sound way
 

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.320
of light it's a relativistic sound way
of traveling outwards that's because the

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.330
of traveling outwards that's because the
 

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.280
of traveling outwards that's because the
radiation pressure is really strong and

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.290
radiation pressure is really strong and
 

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.560
radiation pressure is really strong and
it will travel out until you get to this

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.570
it will travel out until you get to this
 

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.770
it will travel out until you get to this
epoch of recombination at that time the

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:22.780
epoch of recombination at that time the
 

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.330
epoch of recombination at that time the
universe becomes neutral

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.340

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.539
universe becomes neutral
photons separate from the gas and that

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:27.549
photons separate from the gas and that
 

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:29.100
photons separate from the gas and that
means that the sound speed in the gas

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.110
means that the sound speed in the gas
 

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.310
means that the sound speed in the gas
drops enormously and the wave stalls so

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320
drops enormously and the wave stalls so
 

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.810
drops enormously and the wave stalls so
you have this wave going out in the gas

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:33.820
you have this wave going out in the gas
 

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.490
you have this wave going out in the gas
it goes out for a certain distance and

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:35.500
it goes out for a certain distance and
 

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.320
it goes out for a certain distance and
then at 400,000 years after the Big Bang

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:37.330
then at 400,000 years after the Big Bang
 

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.240
then at 400,000 years after the Big Bang
it halts well at that point the universe

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.250
it halts well at that point the universe
 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.370
it halts well at that point the universe
is expanding so wherever that's gel halt

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:44.380
is expanding so wherever that's gel halt
 

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.409
is expanding so wherever that's gel halt
has halted it will now be carried along

00:22:46.409 --> 00:22:46.419
has halted it will now be carried along
 

00:22:46.419 --> 00:22:48.029
has halted it will now be carried along
with the expansion of the universe and

00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039
with the expansion of the universe and
 

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:50.519
with the expansion of the universe and
it will expand out to a distance that

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:50.529
it will expand out to a distance that
 

00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:53.700
it will expand out to a distance that
today is 150 megaparsecs or in more

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:53.710
today is 150 megaparsecs or in more
 

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.010
today is 150 megaparsecs or in more
conventional units 500 million light

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.020
conventional units 500 million light
 

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.919
conventional units 500 million light
years so we have this this

00:22:58.919 --> 00:22:58.929
years so we have this this
 

00:22:58.929 --> 00:23:00.600
years so we have this this
characteristic scale of 500 million

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:00.610
characteristic scale of 500 million
 

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.760
characteristic scale of 500 million
light years why does this matter well

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:02.770
light years why does this matter well
 

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.590
light years why does this matter well
because we have the dark matter at the

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600
because we have the dark matter at the
 

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.570
because we have the dark matter at the
center that will preferentially attract

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:06.580
center that will preferentially attract
 

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.760
center that will preferentially attract
material in form galaxies and we have

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:08.770
material in form galaxies and we have
 

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.639
material in form galaxies and we have
this extra gas at a shell of 500 million

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:11.649
this extra gas at a shell of 500 million
 

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:13.019
this extra gas at a shell of 500 million
light years and that will preferentially

00:23:13.019 --> 00:23:13.029
light years and that will preferentially
 

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:15.510
light years and that will preferentially
collect material and form extra galaxies

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520
collect material and form extra galaxies
 

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.789
collect material and form extra galaxies
and so you predict that pairs of

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799
and so you predict that pairs of
 

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:19.320
and so you predict that pairs of
galaxies if you have one galaxy at the

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:19.330
galaxies if you have one galaxy at the
 

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.490
galaxies if you have one galaxy at the
center you will have a slightly

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:20.500
center you will have a slightly
 

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.260
center you will have a slightly
increased chance of having another

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:22.270
increased chance of having another
 

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.139
increased chance of having another
galaxy somewhere out on that shell 500

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:25.149
galaxy somewhere out on that shell 500
 

00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:27.000
galaxy somewhere out on that shell 500
million light years away so pairs of

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.010
million light years away so pairs of
 

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.680
million light years away so pairs of
galaxies are slightly more likely to be

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:28.690
galaxies are slightly more likely to be
 

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.570
galaxies are slightly more likely to be
separated by 500 million light years

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.580
separated by 500 million light years
 

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.940
separated by 500 million light years
than they are by 400 or 600 million

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:32.950
than they are by 400 or 600 million
 

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.779
than they are by 400 or 600 million
light years okay well that's a

00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:38.789
light years okay well that's a
 

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:41.940
light years okay well that's a
distinctive and why do we you know how

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:41.950
distinctive and why do we you know how
 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.649
distinctive and why do we you know how
do we go to why is it so useful it's

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:43.659
do we go to why is it so useful it's
 

00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:45.269
do we go to why is it so useful it's
useful because this distance of 500

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279
useful because this distance of 500
 

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.620
useful because this distance of 500
million light-years is very easy to

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.630
million light-years is very easy to
 

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.649
million light-years is very easy to
compute it's really just the sound speed

00:23:49.649 --> 00:23:49.659
compute it's really just the sound speed
 

00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:51.210
compute it's really just the sound speed
and the amount of time it has to

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:51.220
and the amount of time it has to
 

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.299
and the amount of time it has to
propagate and it turns out that the CMB

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:54.309
propagate and it turns out that the CMB
 

00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:56.549
propagate and it turns out that the CMB
and I satrapies allow us to measure all

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559
and I satrapies allow us to measure all
 

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.169
and I satrapies allow us to measure all
the properties that are needed to

the properties that are needed to
 

00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:00.960
the properties that are needed to
compute this and so we can determine we

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:00.970
compute this and so we can determine we
 

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.940
compute this and so we can determine we
can calculate this scale of 500 million

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:02.950
can calculate this scale of 500 million
 

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.340
can calculate this scale of 500 million
light-years very accurately with the

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.350

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:35.980
although that's a beautiful measurement
 

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.159
although that's a beautiful measurement
but also in low redshift data

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:38.169
but also in low redshift data
 

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:40.499
but also in low redshift data
of galaxy surveys and that allows us to

00:24:40.499 --> 00:24:40.509
of galaxy surveys and that allows us to
 

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:41.970

out that we can measure that well I'll
explain how we do it in a minute but the

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:14.710
explain how we do it in a minute but the
 

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.409
explain how we do it in a minute but the
you know the challenge is that you need

00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:16.419
you know the challenge is that you need
 

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:18.060
you know the challenge is that you need
very large maps of the universe's a

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:18.070
very large maps of the universe's a

500 million light years 500 million
light years is a big scale even for us

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220
light years is a big scale even for us
 

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.340
light years is a big scale even for us
and so we need to have very large maps

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:29.350
and so we need to have very large maps
 

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:33.570
and so we need to have very large maps
to do it okay so now I'll start telling

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:33.580
to do it okay so now I'll start telling
 

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.229
to do it okay so now I'll start telling
you about how we map the universe so the

00:25:36.229 --> 00:25:36.239
you about how we map the universe so the
 

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:39.239
you about how we map the universe so the
the primary way that we do this is by

00:25:39.239 --> 00:25:39.249
the primary way that we do this is by
 

00:25:39.249 --> 00:25:41.700
the primary way that we do this is by
using galaxies so we want to use

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:41.710
using galaxies so we want to use
 

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.590
using galaxies so we want to use
galaxies as signposts pecially measure

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600
galaxies as signposts pecially measure
 

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.940
galaxies as signposts pecially measure
the three-dimensional location of

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:44.950
the three-dimensional location of
 

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.789
the three-dimensional location of
galaxies and from that infer the density

00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799
galaxies and from that infer the density
 

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:50.009
galaxies and from that infer the density
of material across the universe so you

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:50.019
of material across the universe so you
 

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.470
of material across the universe so you
start by measuring two-dimensional maps

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480
start by measuring two-dimensional maps
 

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.539
start by measuring two-dimensional maps
so you measure you just take pictures of

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:54.549
so you measure you just take pictures of
 

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:55.950
so you measure you just take pictures of
the sky and you can find the galaxies

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960
the sky and you can find the galaxies
 

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.599
the sky and you can find the galaxies
the problem is when you see those

00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:57.609
the problem is when you see those
 

00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:59.249
the problem is when you see those
galaxies you don't know which galaxies

00:25:59.249 --> 00:25:59.259
galaxies you don't know which galaxies
 

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:01.950
galaxies you don't know which galaxies
are very luminous galaxies far away and

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960
are very luminous galaxies far away and
 

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.470
are very luminous galaxies far away and
which galaxies are smaller wimpier

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480
which galaxies are smaller wimpier
 

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.810
which galaxies are smaller wimpier
galaxies really close to you so you need

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
galaxies really close to you so you need
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.830
galaxies really close to you so you need
to be able to tell the difference and

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840
to be able to tell the difference and
 

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.090
to be able to tell the difference and
the way that you tell the difference is

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.100
the way that you tell the difference is
 

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.489
the way that you tell the difference is
what spectroscopy the more distant

00:26:11.489 --> 00:26:11.499
what spectroscopy the more distant
 

00:26:11.499 --> 00:26:12.930
what spectroscopy the more distant
galaxies we are going to have larger

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:12.940
galaxies we are going to have larger
 

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.999
galaxies we are going to have larger
Doppler velocities larger red shifts and

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:15.009
Doppler velocities larger red shifts and
 

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:16.830
Doppler velocities larger red shifts and
so you can sort the galaxies as a

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840
so you can sort the galaxies as a
 

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.560
so you can sort the galaxies as a
function of distance by using their

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:19.570
function of distance by using their
 

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.149
function of distance by using their
velocity you don't know the scale on it

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159
velocity you don't know the scale on it
 

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:22.950
velocity you don't know the scale on it
you don't know the scale on the distance

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960
you don't know the scale on the distance
 

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.200
you don't know the scale on the distance
but you at least get to sort them the

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.210
but you at least get to sort them the
 

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.849
but you at least get to sort them the
largest maps use about a million

00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:26.859
largest maps use about a million
 

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:29.399
largest maps use about a million
galaxies and this is a picture of it

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:29.409
galaxies and this is a picture of it
 

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:31.560
galaxies and this is a picture of it
from the sdss where you know we are here

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:31.570
from the sdss where you know we are here
 

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.869
from the sdss where you know we are here
and this is looking at in red shift so

00:26:33.869 --> 00:26:33.879
and this is looking at in red shift so
 

00:26:33.879 --> 00:26:37.560
and this is looking at in red shift so
this is let's see that's a two billion

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.570
this is let's see that's a two billion
 

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.070
this is let's see that's a two billion
light years away sup 2 billion years and

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080
light years away sup 2 billion years and
 

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.419
light years away sup 2 billion years and
you can see the large-scale structure

00:26:42.419 --> 00:26:42.429
you can see the large-scale structure
 

00:26:42.429 --> 00:26:44.279
you can see the large-scale structure
this is just sort of a swath across the

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:44.289
this is just sort of a swath across the
 

00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:45.899
this is just sort of a swath across the
sky so you can see that the universe has

00:26:45.899 --> 00:26:45.909
sky so you can see that the universe has
 

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:47.430
sky so you can see that the universe has
a lot of clustering and we're now

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440
a lot of clustering and we're now
 

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.619
a lot of clustering and we're now
looking for a subtle effect on top of

telescopes inside of a dome we actually

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:40.809
telescopes inside of a dome we actually
 

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:42.570
telescopes inside of a dome we actually
park this telescope in a building the

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:42.580
park this telescope in a building the
 

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.639
park this telescope in a building the
building rolls off and leaves the

00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:44.649
building rolls off and leaves the
 

00:28:44.649 --> 00:28:46.799
building rolls off and leaves the
telescope out in the open air so this

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:46.809
telescope out in the open air so this
 

00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:48.450
telescope out in the open air so this
telescope it's a two and half meter

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:48.460

telescope bye-bye research standards but
 

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.750
telescope bye-bye research standards but
it is unusual because it has such a wide

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760
it is unusual because it has such a wide
 

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.970
it is unusual because it has such a wide
field of view so it for these sorts of

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:56.980
field of view so it for these sorts of
 

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.370
field of view so it for these sorts of
wide field surveys it actually is really

00:28:59.370 --> 00:28:59.380
wide field surveys it actually is really
 

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.629
wide field surveys it actually is really
one of the most powerful telescopes in

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:00.639
one of the most powerful telescopes in
 

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:03.090
one of the most powerful telescopes in
the world what you see here is the boxy

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.100
the world what you see here is the boxy
 

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.280

into the telescope it's actually a wind

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.330
into the telescope it's actually a wind
 

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.930
into the telescope it's actually a wind
it's actually a windscreen that keep the

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:09.940
it's actually a windscreen that keep the
 

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.670
it's actually a windscreen that keep the
wind off the telescope and when the

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:11.680
wind off the telescope and when the
 

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.200
wind off the telescope and when the
telescope moved the telescope's inside

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.210
telescope moved the telescope's inside
 

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.490
telescope moved the telescope's inside
this and when the telescope moves the

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:14.500
this and when the telescope moves the
 

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.130
this and when the telescope moves the
windscreen automatically moves around to

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:17.140
windscreen automatically moves around to
 

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.100
windscreen automatically moves around to
track so the first thing that we do is

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.110
track so the first thing that we do is
 

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.930
track so the first thing that we do is
we take we took images of the sky so

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:21.940
we take we took images of the sky so
 

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.480
we take we took images of the sky so
this telescope conducted really one of

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:24.490
this telescope conducted really one of
 

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.060
this telescope conducted really one of
the largest imaging campaigns when you

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.070

nine years actually conducting a big
 

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.600
nine years actually conducting a big
survey of the sky so this is a picture

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:03.610
survey of the sky so this is a picture
 

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.390
survey of the sky so this is a picture
now of the North Galactic cap so the

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:06.400
now of the North Galactic cap so the
 

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.220
now of the North Galactic cap so the
galaxy the Milky Way would be around the

this picture is unusual because we've

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.110
this picture is unusual because we've
 

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.780
this picture is unusual because we've
actually removed all the Starlight we've

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:15.790
actually removed all the Starlight we've
 

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.280
actually removed all the Starlight we've
got into the images and removed all the

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.290
got into the images and removed all the
 

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.660
got into the images and removed all the
stars and all you're seeing here is the

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:18.670
stars and all you're seeing here is the
 

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.700
stars and all you're seeing here is the
integrated light from the galaxies and

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:20.710
integrated light from the galaxies and
 

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.350
integrated light from the galaxies and
in this you can already start to see

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360
in this you can already start to see
 

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.240
in this you can already start to see
some large-scale structure these sort of

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.250
some large-scale structure these sort of
 

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.340
some large-scale structure these sort of
lumps aren't and you know darker spots

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:26.350
lumps aren't and you know darker spots
 

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.530
lumps aren't and you know darker spots
or not that's not just chance there's

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:28.540
or not that's not just chance there's
 

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.060
or not that's not just chance there's
there actually are large-scale

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.070
there actually are large-scale
 

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.530
there actually are large-scale
structures but these are the structures

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:31.540
structures but these are the structures
 

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.210
structures but these are the structures
that are nearby and you can see how much

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:33.220
that are nearby and you can see how much
 

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.280
that are nearby and you can see how much
harder is to measure structure in this

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:35.290
harder is to measure structure in this
 

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.630
harder is to measure structure in this

certain times of the year and see part

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.110
certain times of the year and see part
 

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.650
certain times of the year and see part
of the southern sky and all told we

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:49.660
of the southern sky and all told we
 

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.870
of the southern sky and all told we
imaged about a third of the sky and all

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880
imaged about a third of the sky and all
 

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.490
imaged about a third of the sky and all
this data has been released to the

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:53.500
this data has been released to the
 

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.210
this data has been released to the
public as a 2010 it's really a

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:57.220
public as a 2010 it's really a
 

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.400
public as a 2010 it's really a
phenomenal amount of data so if you just

00:30:59.400 --> 00:30:59.410
phenomenal amount of data so if you just
 

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.170
phenomenal amount of data so if you just
take a little chunk of this this and

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.180
take a little chunk of this this and
 

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.320
take a little chunk of this this and
blow it up to some not randomly chosen

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.330
blow it up to some not randomly chosen
 

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.880
blow it up to some not randomly chosen
region and then blow it up again and

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:05.890
region and then blow it up again and
 

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.830
region and then blow it up again and
then blow it up again and you can I

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840
then blow it up again and you can I
 

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.940
then blow it up again and you can I
don't think from where you are you can

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:08.950
don't think from where you are you can
 

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.580
don't think from where you are you can
actually get see the detail in the

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:11.590
actually get see the detail in the
 

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.920
actually get see the detail in the
picture overall told it's a trillion

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:13.930
picture overall told it's a trillion
 

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.290
picture overall told it's a trillion
multicolored pixels so it's a trillion

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:16.300
multicolored pixels so it's a trillion
 

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.310
multicolored pixels so it's a trillion
pixel map of the of the sky

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320
pixel map of the of the sky
 

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.380
pixel map of the of the sky
but we then want to continue and try to

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:22.390
but we then want to continue and try to
 

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.940
but we then want to continue and try to
map in three dimensions I've shown you

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:23.950
map in three dimensions I've shown you
 

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:24.960
map in three dimensions I've shown you
this picture before we want to measure

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:24.970
this picture before we want to measure
 

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.390
this picture before we want to measure
spectra and spectroscopy is much more

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:27.400
spectra and spectroscopy is much more
 

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.620
spectra and spectroscopy is much more
expensive because instead of just

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:28.630
expensive because instead of just
 

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.000
expensive because instead of just
measuring collecting the light from an

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.010
measuring collecting the light from an
 

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.200
measuring collecting the light from an
object we're now trying to collect the

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.210
object we're now trying to collect the
 

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.540
object we're now trying to collect the
light and split it up into a rainbow and

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:33.550
light and split it up into a rainbow and
 

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.060
light and split it up into a rainbow and
measure a thousand independent colors of

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.070
measure a thousand independent colors of
 

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.440
measure a thousand independent colors of
that rainbow and so we need much more

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:37.450
that rainbow and so we need much more
 

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.680
that rainbow and so we need much more
light in order to do that and so we can

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:40.690
light in order to do that and so we can
 

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.810
light in order to do that and so we can
only do it on on certain subsets of the

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:42.820
only do it on on certain subsets of the
 

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.350
only do it on on certain subsets of the
objects in until about nineteen ninety

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360
objects in until about nineteen ninety
 

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.080
objects in until about nineteen ninety
all the spectroscopy has done one object

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.090
all the spectroscopy has done one object
 

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.850
all the spectroscopy has done one object
at a time you basically would sit there

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:50.860
at a time you basically would sit there
 

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.350
at a time you basically would sit there
and do one object one object one object

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360
and do one object one object one object
 

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.580
and do one object one object one object
well it takes a long time to get for up

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:53.590
well it takes a long time to get for up
 

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.630
well it takes a long time to get for up
to four million if you're doing what

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640
to four million if you're doing what
 

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.690
to four million if you're doing what
object to the time and so what we do is

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:57.700
object to the time and so what we do is
 

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.660
object to the time and so what we do is
something called fiber spectroscopy so

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:00.670
something called fiber spectroscopy so
 

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.140
something called fiber spectroscopy so
basically these are optical fibers and

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:03.150
basically these are optical fibers and
 

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.120
basically these are optical fibers and
they plug into this plate and the light

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.130
they plug into this plate and the light
 

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.440
they plug into this plate and the light
will go into those fibers and then

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:07.450
will go into those fibers and then
 

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.300
will go into those fibers and then
transmitted off to the off to the

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:11.310
transmitted off to the off to the
 

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.260
transmitted off to the off to the
telescope so I brought a couple place

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.270
telescope so I brought a couple place
 

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.010
telescope so I brought a couple place
here but you can you can see so this is

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.020
here but you can you can see so this is
 

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.510
here but you can you can see so this is
a this is a plate that would go at the

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:18.520
a this is a plate that would go at the
 

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.100
a this is a plate that would go at the
at the focal plane of the telescope so

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.110
at the focal plane of the telescope so
 

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.330
at the focal plane of the telescope so
basically the light would bounce off the

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:21.340
basically the light would bounce off the
 

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.040
basically the light would bounce off the
primary mirror bounced up to the

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.050
primary mirror bounced up to the
 

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.460
primary mirror bounced up to the
secondary and come down and and you know

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:26.470
secondary and come down and and you know
 

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.900
secondary and come down and and you know
come to this come to focus at this

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:27.910
come to this come to focus at this
 

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.030
come to this come to focus at this
location if this plate were covered with

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.040
location if this plate were covered with
 

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.510
location if this plate were covered with
photographic film then when exposed to

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:33.520
photographic film then when exposed to
 

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.920
photographic film then when exposed to
the sky you would actually get an image

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:34.930
the sky you would actually get an image
 

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.620
the sky you would actually get an image
of the sky it here it would not be the

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:37.630
of the sky it here it would not be the
 

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.240
of the sky it here it would not be the
whole sky be you know a chunk of the sky

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.250
whole sky be you know a chunk of the sky
 

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.100
whole sky be you know a chunk of the sky
about six full moons across so about

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:41.110
about six full moons across so about
 

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.740
about six full moons across so about
three degrees across and you get an

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:43.750
three degrees across and you get an
 

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.200
three degrees across and you get an
image of the sky we then we take that

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.210
image of the sky we then we take that
 

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.800
image of the sky we then we take that
image and we are then interested in some

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:49.810
image and we are then interested in some
 

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.420
image and we are then interested in some
particular particular subsets of objects

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:51.430
particular particular subsets of objects
 

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.350
particular particular subsets of objects
there would be about how do we would

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360
there would be about how do we would
 

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.940
there would be about how do we would
detect about a hundred thousand objects

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:53.950
detect about a hundred thousand objects
 

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.480
detect about a hundred thousand objects
on this chunk of sky this big and we

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:57.490
on this chunk of sky this big and we
 

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.610
on this chunk of sky this big and we
only have resource to take spectra of a

00:32:59.610 --> 00:32:59.620
only have resource to take spectra of a
 

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.080
only have resource to take spectra of a
thousand of them so we select which

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.090
thousand of them so we select which
 

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.910
thousand of them so we select which
thousand we want and then at the

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:02.920
thousand we want and then at the
 

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.530
thousand we want and then at the
location where the light is from those

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:04.540
location where the light is from those
 

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.140
location where the light is from those
thousand objects is going to fall we go

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:07.150
thousand objects is going to fall we go
 

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.970
thousand objects is going to fall we go
when we drill a hole at that location

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:08.980
when we drill a hole at that location
 

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.800
when we drill a hole at that location
and we will plug an optical fiber in

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:10.810
and we will plug an optical fiber in
 

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.360
and we will plug an optical fiber in
that and that means when the light comes

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:12.370
that and that means when the light comes
 

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.530
that and that means when the light comes
down there it's going to get it's going

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:13.540
down there it's going to get it's going
 

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.540
down there it's going to get it's going
to get trapped into that fiber and run

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:15.550
to get trapped into that fiber and run
 

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.880
to get trapped into that fiber and run
off to the telescope's I'm going to pass

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:17.890
off to the telescope's I'm going to pass
 

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.560
off to the telescope's I'm going to pass
this round I have to up I'll pass around

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:19.570
this round I have to up I'll pass around
 

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.460
this round I have to up I'll pass around
and I want to warn you it's you cannot

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:23.470
and I want to warn you it's you cannot
 

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.960
and I want to warn you it's you cannot
hurt it I promise there's nothing you

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:24.970
hurt it I promise there's nothing you
 

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.460
hurt it I promise there's nothing you
can do that will hurt this plate but it

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:26.470
can do that will hurt this plate but it
 

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.660
can do that will hurt this plate but it
can't hurt the head of the person in

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:27.670
can't hurt the head of the person in
 

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.840
can't hurt the head of the person in
front of you it has these little flanges

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:30.850
front of you it has these little flanges
 

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.520
front of you it has these little flanges
it weighs more than you think so

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:32.530
it weighs more than you think so
 

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.960
it weighs more than you think so
so do be careful with your neighbors but

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:36.970
so do be careful with your neighbors but
 

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.100
so do be careful with your neighbors but
not but don't worry about being careful

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.110
not but don't worry about being careful
 

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.880
not but don't worry about being careful
at the plate so let me just say a few

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:41.890
at the plate so let me just say a few
 

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.170
at the plate so let me just say a few
words more about about the plates so the

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:46.180
words more about about the plates so the
 

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.050
words more about about the plates so the
fibers themselves I should be careful

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:49.060
fibers themselves I should be careful
 

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.270
fibers themselves I should be careful
I'm probably knocking my little

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:50.280
I'm probably knocking my little
 

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.380
I'm probably knocking my little
microphone the fibers themselves are

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:52.390
microphone the fibers themselves are
 

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.690
microphone the fibers themselves are
only a hundred and twenty microns thick

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:54.700
only a hundred and twenty microns thick
 

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.100
only a hundred and twenty microns thick
so they're about the thickness of a

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.110
so they're about the thickness of a
 

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.470
so they're about the thickness of a
human hair the holes that you see in

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480
human hair the holes that you see in
 

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.060
human hair the holes that you see in
this plate are considerably thicker than

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.070
this plate are considerably thicker than
 

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.440
this plate are considerably thicker than
that becomes considerably bigger than

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:01.450
that becomes considerably bigger than
 

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:02.850
that becomes considerably bigger than
that that's because the fiber is

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:02.860
that that's because the fiber is
 

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.250
that that's because the fiber is
actually held for safety in a little

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:05.260
actually held for safety in a little
 

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.920
actually held for safety in a little
metal tube at the end to give somebody

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:07.930
metal tube at the end to give somebody
 

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.780
metal tube at the end to give somebody
you know that something something to

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:09.790
you know that something something to
 

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.159
you know that something something to
hold onto they can actually plug the

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.169
hold onto they can actually plug the
 

00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:12.570
hold onto they can actually plug the
fiber in if you just tried to plug a

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:12.580
fiber in if you just tried to plug a
 

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.100
fiber in if you just tried to plug a
little you know your hair into it a

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.110
little you know your hair into it a
 

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.810
little you know your hair into it a
brittle hair into it it would break and

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:15.820
brittle hair into it it would break and
 

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.510
brittle hair into it it would break and
the survey would be over very quickly so

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520
the survey would be over very quickly so
 

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.040
the survey would be over very quickly so
we have to protect the fibers the fibers

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.050
we have to protect the fibers the fibers
 

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.840
we have to protect the fibers the fibers
are actually you know they're in these

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:21.850
are actually you know they're in these
 

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.970
are actually you know they're in these
these orange tubes but again that's just

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:23.980
these orange tubes but again that's just
 

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.399
these orange tubes but again that's just
for their protection the holes

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:29.409
for their protection the holes
 

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.190
for their protection the holes
themselves are drilled to about 10

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200
themselves are drilled to about 10
 

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.990
themselves are drilled to about 10
micron precision so it's actually this

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000
micron precision so it's actually this
 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.850
micron precision so it's actually this
this these these plates look simple but

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:35.860
this these these plates look simple but
 

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.190
this these these plates look simple but
they're actually they're very precisely

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200
they're actually they're very precisely
 

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.409
they're actually they're very precisely
machined because we have to get the

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:40.419
machined because we have to get the
 

00:34:40.419 --> 00:34:44.430
machined because we have to get the
light in just the right spot and when we

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440
light in just the right spot and when we
 

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.100
light in just the right spot and when we
have so I should also mention them that

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.110
have so I should also mention them that
 

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:52.409
have so I should also mention them that
so they're actually a hand plugged so

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:52.419
so they're actually a hand plugged so
 

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:54.930
so they're actually a hand plugged so
this is obviously sped up it takes about

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:54.940
this is obviously sped up it takes about
 

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.570
this is obviously sped up it takes about
an hour to plug a plate um you might

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:00.580
an hour to plug a plate um you might
 

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.330
an hour to plug a plate um you might
wonder how we get how we know which

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:03.340
wonder how we get how we know which
 

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.720
wonder how we get how we know which
fiber went into which hole it's very

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:06.730
fiber went into which hole it's very
 

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.380
fiber went into which hole it's very
clever we actually run a fibers are all

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:10.390
clever we actually run a fibers are all
 

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.340
clever we actually run a fibers are all
running off to a to a sort of a

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:13.350
running off to a to a sort of a
 

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.540
running off to a to a sort of a
one-dimensional slit head they're all

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:15.550
one-dimensional slit head they're all
 

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.920
one-dimensional slit head they're all
kind of full incoming to one dimensions

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:16.930
kind of full incoming to one dimensions
 

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.990
kind of full incoming to one dimensions
we actually shine a laser we actually

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000
we actually shine a laser we actually
 

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.670
we actually shine a laser we actually
run a laser down illuminating one fiber

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680
run a laser down illuminating one fiber
 

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.830
run a laser down illuminating one fiber
at a time and you watch each individual

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:22.840
at a time and you watch each individual
 

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.840
at a time and you watch each individual
whole light up in sequence and you

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:24.850
whole light up in sequence and you
 

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.340
whole light up in sequence and you
record that with a video camera so you

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:26.350
record that with a video camera so you
 

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.380
record that with a video camera so you
know which which order the holes the

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:28.390
know which which order the holes the
 

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:32.130
know which which order the holes the
whole / plug you'll see little lines on

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:32.140
whole / plug you'll see little lines on
 

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.730
whole / plug you'll see little lines on
the plate the lines all the lines each

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:35.740
the plate the lines all the lines each
 

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.830
the plate the lines all the lines each
region contains twenty fibers because

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:37.840
region contains twenty fibers because
 

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.300
region contains twenty fibers because
the fibers can't stretch all the way

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:39.310
the fibers can't stretch all the way
 

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.500
the fibers can't stretch all the way
across the plate so if you were just

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:40.510
across the plate so if you were just
 

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.300
across the plate so if you were just
plugging anywhere you wanted you would

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:42.310
plugging anywhere you wanted you would
 

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.220
plugging anywhere you wanted you would
you would inevitably end up with the

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.230
you would inevitably end up with the
 

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.630
you would inevitably end up with the
last hole over here in the last fiber

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640
last hole over here in the last fiber
 

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.300
last hole over here in the last fiber
over here and

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:46.310
over here and
 

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.310
over here and
you'd have to start over so you actually

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320
you'd have to start over so you actually
 

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.800
you'd have to start over so you actually
grab 25 hours at a time plug 25 hours

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:50.810
grab 25 hours at a time plug 25 hours
 

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.600
grab 25 hours at a time plug 25 hours
grab the next 20 plug 25 hours that

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:52.610
grab the next 20 plug 25 hours that
 

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.860
grab the next 20 plug 25 hours that
keeps you organized as you move across

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:53.870
keeps you organized as you move across
 

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.170
keeps you organized as you move across
the plate so let me start this off you

00:35:59.170 --> 00:35:59.180
the plate so let me start this off you
 

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.660
the plate so let me start this off you
also notice it's big and heavy that's

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.670
also notice it's big and heavy that's
 

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.390
also notice it's big and heavy that's
because it has been really stiff so the

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400
because it has been really stiff so the
 

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.710
because it has been really stiff so the
focal surface is only about you know a

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720
focal surface is only about you know a
 

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.690
focal surface is only about you know a
few hundred microns thick so you really

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:10.700
few hundred microns thick so you really
 

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.160
few hundred microns thick so you really
have to have the plate really in the

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.170
have to have the plate really in the
 

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.510
have to have the plate really in the
right location and if you tip the

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520
right location and if you tip the
 

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.790
right location and if you tip the
telescope over if it was floppy or week

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800
telescope over if it was floppy or week
 

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.340

it would you know the gravity sag would

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:18.350
it would you know the gravity sag would
 

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.900
it would you know the gravity sag would
cause problems so you really have to

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:19.910
cause problems so you really have to
 

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.060
cause problems so you really have to
hold it in the right spot so they're

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:22.070
hold it in the right spot so they're
 

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.250
hold it in the right spot so they're

Apache point in one month in 2011 we had
 

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.190
Apache point in one month in 2011 we had
a really clear month we plugged a

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200
a really clear month we plugged a
 

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:36.970
a really clear month we plugged a
hundred thousand fibers so all right

two spectrographs here this is probably

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:47.150
two spectrographs here this is probably
 

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.200
two spectrographs here this is probably
easier more easily seen in this movie so

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:50.210
easier more easily seen in this movie so
 

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.490

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:47.230
were actually very close to the
telescope and basically we're really on

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240
telescope and basically we're really on
 

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.900
telescope and basically we're really on
the west edge of the mountain range so

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:49.910
the west edge of the mountain range so
 

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.130
the west edge of the mountain range so
the hope is that when the prevailing

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.140
the hope is that when the prevailing
 

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.570
the hope is that when the prevailing
winds come over they're basically coming

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:52.580
winds come over they're basically coming
 

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.610
winds come over they're basically coming
over this valley for 50 miles nothing to

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:54.620
over this valley for 50 miles nothing to
 

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.410
over this valley for 50 miles nothing to
stir up the air and we hope that the

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:56.420
stir up the air and we hope that the
 

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.120
stir up the air and we hope that the
first thing that air encounters after 50

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.130
first thing that air encounters after 50
 

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:59.890
first thing that air encounters after 50
miles over the valley is our telescope

00:37:59.890 --> 00:37:59.900
miles over the valley is our telescope
 

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.660
miles over the valley is our telescope
so nothing else has been able to stir up

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:01.670
so nothing else has been able to stir up
 

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.380
so nothing else has been able to stir up
the air so this is now the sort of time

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:05.390
the air so this is now the sort of time
 

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.660
the air so this is now the sort of time
lapse ting over the night I'll so skip

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:07.670
lapse ting over the night I'll so skip
 

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.150
lapse ting over the night I'll so skip
ahead but but basically you know load up

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160
ahead but but basically you know load up
 

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.730
ahead but but basically you know load up
the plate observe a given spot on the

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:12.740
the plate observe a given spot on the
 

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.099
the plate observe a given spot on the
sky for about an hour and when you're

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:15.109
sky for about an hour and when you're
 

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:16.690
sky for about an hour and when you're
done then they're done the plate we

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:16.700
done then they're done the plate we
 

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.120
done then they're done the plate we
basically we only use the plate for an

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.130
basically we only use the plate for an
 

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.099
basically we only use the plate for an
hour so we've we've now drilled about

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:21.109
hour so we've we've now drilled about
 

00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:24.549
hour so we've we've now drilled about
7000 of these plates over the years to

00:38:24.549 --> 00:38:24.559
7000 of these plates over the years to
 

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:31.660
7000 of these plates over the years to
keep the survey moving okay so let's try

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:31.670
keep the survey moving okay so let's try
 

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.250
keep the survey moving okay so let's try
to look at some of the data so this is

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:33.260
to look at some of the data so this is
 

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.829
to look at some of the data so this is
now it's gonna be a movie of sort of

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839
now it's gonna be a movie of sort of
 

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:37.539
now it's gonna be a movie of sort of
flying through a big chunk of this

00:38:37.539 --> 00:38:37.549
flying through a big chunk of this
 

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:38.890
flying through a big chunk of this
three-dimensional map it's hard to show

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:38.900
three-dimensional map it's hard to show
 

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.760
three-dimensional map it's hard to show
3d maps so this is now showing sort of a

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:42.770
3d maps so this is now showing sort of a
 

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.470
3d maps so this is now showing sort of a
thin slice of the map and I'm going to

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480
thin slice of the map and I'm going to
 

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.019
thin slice of the map and I'm going to
move that slice along I'm picking the

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:47.029
move that slice along I'm picking the
 

00:38:47.029 --> 00:38:49.510
move that slice along I'm picking the
slice to be at a given distance from us

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520
slice to be at a given distance from us
 

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.339
slice to be at a given distance from us
so as the movie progresses this black

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:51.349
so as the movie progresses this black
 

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:52.779
so as the movie progresses this black
swath will move out and that's going to

00:38:52.779 --> 00:38:52.789
swath will move out and that's going to
 

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:56.559
swath will move out and that's going to
correspond to the thin slice moving out

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:56.569
correspond to the thin slice moving out
 

00:38:56.569 --> 00:39:00.160
correspond to the thin slice moving out
through the survey this is a fixed angle

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.170
through the survey this is a fixed angle
 

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.569
through the survey this is a fixed angle
on the sky this is about twenty percent

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:01.579
on the sky this is about twenty percent
 

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:03.549
on the sky this is about twenty percent
of the survey volume about twenty

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:03.559
of the survey volume about twenty
 

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:04.539
of the survey volume about twenty
percent the air so it's about four

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:04.549
percent the air so it's about four
 

00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:06.220
percent the air so it's about four
percent of the sky so I'm showing you

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.230
percent of the sky so I'm showing you
 

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.630
percent of the sky so I'm showing you
basically four percent of the sky and

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640
basically four percent of the sky and
 

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.559
basically four percent of the sky and
then just a slice going out from us to

00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:11.569
then just a slice going out from us to
 

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:13.359
then just a slice going out from us to
make the map a little bit dynamic i

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:13.369
make the map a little bit dynamic i
 

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:15.190
make the map a little bit dynamic i
start the objects off when they enter

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200
start the objects off when they enter
 

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.750
start the objects off when they enter
into the thin slice i'll start them off

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760
into the thin slice i'll start them off
 

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.819
into the thin slice i'll start them off
faint and red and then break them up to

00:39:18.819 --> 00:39:18.829
faint and red and then break them up to
 

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:20.680
faint and red and then break them up to
black and then dim them out to faint in

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:20.690
black and then dim them out to faint in
 

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.240
black and then dim them out to faint in
blue so you'll see things move around as

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:22.250
blue so you'll see things move around as
 

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.549
blue so you'll see things move around as
you as we go through you'll see though

00:39:24.549 --> 00:39:24.559
you as we go through you'll see though
 

00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:26.410
you as we go through you'll see though
you'll basically slicing through the

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:26.420
you'll basically slicing through the
 

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.210
you'll basically slicing through the
large scale walls and filaments and

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.220
large scale walls and filaments and
 

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.410
large scale walls and filaments and
voids at the University you can actually

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:29.420
voids at the University you can actually
 

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.210
voids at the University you can actually
see the large-scale structure of the

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:31.220
see the large-scale structure of the
 

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.819
see the large-scale structure of the
universe the black circle here has a

00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:33.829
universe the black circle here has a
 

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.980
universe the black circle here has a
radius of 500 million light years so

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:35.990
radius of 500 million light years so
 

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.779
radius of 500 million light years so
that's our characteristic scale as the

00:39:37.779 --> 00:39:37.789
that's our characteristic scale as the
 

00:39:37.789 --> 00:39:39.490
that's our characteristic scale as the
movie plays you'll see that gets smaller

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:39.500
movie plays you'll see that gets smaller
 

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.839
movie plays you'll see that gets smaller
because you're moving further away

00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:40.849
because you're moving further away
 

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:42.130
because you're moving further away
you're looking at a slice that's further

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.140
you're looking at a slice that's further
 

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.289
you're looking at a slice that's further
away from us so that scale will appear

00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:44.299
away from us so that scale will appear
 

00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:46.480
away from us so that scale will appear
to be angularly smaller you'll also see

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:46.490
to be angularly smaller you'll also see
 

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.010
to be angularly smaller you'll also see
the large-scale structure the voids and

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:48.020
the large-scale structure the voids and
 

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.599
the large-scale structure the voids and
patterns will actually appear to get

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:49.609
patterns will actually appear to get
 

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.099
patterns will actually appear to get
smaller that's because they're further

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.109
smaller that's because they're further
 

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:52.950
smaller that's because they're further
away from you are actually seeing them

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960
away from you are actually seeing them
 

00:39:52.960 --> 00:40:00.180
away from you are actually seeing them
seeing them further away

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:00.190
 

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.740
so this is the nearby part of the survey

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:02.750
so this is the nearby part of the survey
 

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.210
so this is the nearby part of the survey
you can you know definitely see some of

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.220
you can you know definitely see some of
 

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.310
you can you know definitely see some of
the walls and filaments popping in and

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:06.320
the walls and filaments popping in and
 

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.670
the walls and filaments popping in and
out so we're now about three billion

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680
out so we're now about three billion
 

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:19.690
out so we're now about three billion
light years away four billion light

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:19.700
light years away four billion light
 

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.320
light years away four billion light
years away now we're getting to the

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:23.330
years away now we're getting to the
 

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.630
years away now we're getting to the
thick part of the survey where we have

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640
thick part of the survey where we have
 

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.340
thick part of the survey where we have
we have a lot more data out here this is

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.350
we have a lot more data out here this is
 

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.840
we have a lot more data out here this is
kind of the peak of the survey density

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:31.850
kind of the peak of the survey density
 

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.430
kind of the peak of the survey density
and once we get to the edge now the

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440
and once we get to the edge now the
 

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.780
and once we get to the edge now the
objects are getting to be faint enough

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:34.790
objects are getting to be faint enough
 

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.280
objects are getting to be faint enough
that we don't get a very high sampling

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:36.290
that we don't get a very high sampling
 

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.530
that we don't get a very high sampling
so with the survey will start to thin

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:38.540
so with the survey will start to thin
 

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.480
so with the survey will start to thin
out here as we get out to the edge about

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:40.490
out here as we get out to the edge about
 

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:52.320
out here as we get out to the edge about
7 billion light years away from us ok

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.330
 

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.120
the density so there many more galaxies

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.130
the density so there many more galaxies
 

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.250
the density so there many more galaxies
in there truly many more galaxies and

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:57.260
in there truly many more galaxies and
 

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.450
in there truly many more galaxies and
we're able to measure we're basically

00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:58.460
we're able to measure we're basically
 

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.280
we're able to measure we're basically
measuring some representative sample of

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:00.290
measuring some representative sample of
 

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.450
measuring some representative sample of
them as you move out and that's a

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:01.460
them as you move out and that's a
 

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:05.730
them as you move out and that's a
varying number okay well that's

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:05.740
varying number okay well that's
 

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.660
varying number okay well that's
qualitatively that's the map that's the

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:07.670
qualitatively that's the map that's the
 

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.190
qualitatively that's the map that's the
kind of thing we're that's the map we're

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200
kind of thing we're that's the map we're
 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.360
kind of thing we're that's the map we're
measuring and we now want to try to

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:10.370
measuring and we now want to try to
 

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.280
measuring and we now want to try to
analyze it quantitatively to look for

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.290
analyze it quantitatively to look for
 

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.080
analyze it quantitatively to look for
these sound waves the way that we do

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.090
these sound waves the way that we do
 

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:15.400
these sound waves the way that we do
this is with something called the galaxy

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.410
this is with something called the galaxy
 

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.990
this is with something called the galaxy
correlation function so it's a

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000
correlation function so it's a
 

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.690
correlation function so it's a
relatively simple idea pick a galaxy and

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:19.700
relatively simple idea pick a galaxy and
 

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.510
relatively simple idea pick a galaxy and
sit on it and now count the number of

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520
sit on it and now count the number of
 

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.540
sit on it and now count the number of
other galaxies in a ring around that

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:25.550
other galaxies in a ring around that
 

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.600
other galaxies in a ring around that
point now repeat that is a function of

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:28.610
point now repeat that is a function of
 

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.840
point now repeat that is a function of
the radius of the ring and then repeat

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:31.850
the radius of the ring and then repeat
 

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.360
the radius of the ring and then repeat
that picking every other galaxy in the

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:34.370
that picking every other galaxy in the
 

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.150

all that and when we're done then in

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:42.590
all that and when we're done then in
 

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.430
all that and when we're done then in
fact in 2005 we got this first detection

four percent measurement of the distance
 

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.090

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:56.450
by measuring the change in angle we're
 

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.359
by measuring the change in angle we're

measuring the distance dial to all these
 

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:00.609
measuring the distance dial to all these
different redshifts well now let's see

00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:00.619
different redshifts well now let's see
 

00:44:00.619 --> 00:44:01.990

what we can learn about cosmology from

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000
what we can learn about cosmology from
 

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.300
what we can learn about cosmology from
this so i'll start by showing you the

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:04.310
this so i'll start by showing you the
 

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.030
this so i'll start by showing you the
prediction for this curve from the

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040
prediction for this curve from the
 

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.060
prediction for this curve from the
microwave background data assuming that

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.070
microwave background data assuming that
 

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.190

the universe is flat and the cotton has

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200
the universe is flat and the cotton has
 

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.080
the universe is flat and the cotton has
a cosmo and that the dark energy is a

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.090
a cosmo and that the dark energy is a
 

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.460
a cosmo and that the dark energy is a
cosmological constant i'll come back to

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:15.470
cosmological constant i'll come back to
 

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.070
cosmological constant i'll come back to
explain those concepts a minute but so

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:18.080
explain those concepts a minute but so
 

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.260
explain those concepts a minute but so
just making those assumptions you get

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:20.270
just making those assumptions you get
 

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.510
just making those assumptions you get
this prediction for the curve so you can

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520
this prediction for the curve so you can
 

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.050
this prediction for the curve so you can
see it's an amazingly good match of the

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:26.060
see it's an amazingly good match of the
 

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.610
see it's an amazingly good match of the
date of the low redshift data

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:27.620
date of the low redshift data
 

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.880
date of the low redshift data
to this prediction from the CMB when we

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:30.890
to this prediction from the CMB when we
 

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.470
to this prediction from the CMB when we
zoom in if you divided by the center

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480
zoom in if you divided by the center
 

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.840
zoom in if you divided by the center
point of the CMB then you get you you

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:34.850
point of the CMB then you get you you
 

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:35.770
point of the CMB then you get you you
get this thing and you can see that

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:35.780
get this thing and you can see that
 

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.690
get this thing and you can see that
we're basically agreeing we're finding

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:37.700
we're basically agreeing we're finding
 

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.730
we're basically agreeing we're finding
agreement at the two percent level of

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:39.740
agreement at the two percent level of
 

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.460
agreement at the two percent level of
the predictions with our measurements so

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:42.470
the predictions with our measurements so
 

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.770
the predictions with our measurements so
that's really wonderful to see it and in

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:44.780
that's really wonderful to see it and in
 

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.720
that's really wonderful to see it and in

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:46.730
detail you know the low red ship date is
 

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:50.650
detail you know the low red ship date is
an excellent match to this model but of

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:50.660
an excellent match to this model but of
 

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.300
an excellent match to this model but of
course we could test other models and so

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:52.310
course we could test other models and so
 

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.090
course we could test other models and so
let's explore some of those tests well

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:55.100
let's explore some of those tests well
 

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.550
let's explore some of those tests well
in general relativity one of the major

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:57.560
in general relativity one of the major
 

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.610
in general relativity one of the major
ideas is that space space is curved and

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:00.620
ideas is that space space is curved and
 

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.160
ideas is that space space is curved and
gravity is basically because gravity we

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:03.170
gravity is basically because gravity we
 

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.100
gravity is basically because gravity we
perceive gravity because this space-time

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.110
perceive gravity because this space-time
 

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.560
perceive gravity because this space-time
is curved and in particular the universe

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:08.570
is curved and in particular the universe
 

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.050
is curved and in particular the universe
as a whole is curved and you can have

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:11.060
as a whole is curved and you can have
 

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.820
as a whole is curved and you can have
options so the universe could be flat

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:12.830
options so the universe could be flat
 

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.790
options so the universe could be flat
like a sheet of paper and to Donnie if

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800
like a sheet of paper and to Donnie if
 

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.960
like a sheet of paper and to Donnie if
it's a two dimensional unit will be flat

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:16.970
it's a two dimensional unit will be flat
 

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:18.370
it's a two dimensional unit will be flat
like a sheet of paper or of course a

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:18.380
like a sheet of paper or of course a
 

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.800
like a sheet of paper or of course a
three-dimensional version or it could be

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:20.810
three-dimensional version or it could be
 

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.720
three-dimensional version or it could be
curved like a sphere we could basically

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:22.730
curved like a sphere we could basically
 

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.370
curved like a sphere we could basically
be like an aunt living on the surface of

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:24.380
be like an aunt living on the surface of
 

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.560
be like an aunt living on the surface of
a sphere that would have curvature or it

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:26.570
a sphere that would have curvature or it
 

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.270
a sphere that would have curvature or it
can be crinkled like a saddle like or a

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280
can be crinkled like a saddle like or a
 

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.210
can be crinkled like a saddle like or a
potato chip and and you can define

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:31.220
potato chip and and you can define
 

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.830
potato chip and and you can define
universities like that this curvature

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:32.840
universities like that this curvature
 

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.900
universities like that this curvature
matters because it means that important

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:37.910
matters because it means that important
 

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.670
matters because it means that important
things about geometry like the idea that

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680
things about geometry like the idea that
 

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.520
things about geometry like the idea that
ass the circumference of a circle is no

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:42.530
ass the circumference of a circle is no
 

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.280
ass the circumference of a circle is no
longer two pi times the radius this is a

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:45.290
longer two pi times the radius this is a
 

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.810
longer two pi times the radius this is a
familiar idea if you're sitting on the

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:46.820
familiar idea if you're sitting on the
 

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.310
familiar idea if you're sitting on the
if you're sitting on the North Pole and

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:48.320
if you're sitting on the North Pole and
 

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.320
if you're sitting on the North Pole and
you walk down to the equator and then

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:50.330
you walk down to the equator and then
 

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.910
you walk down to the equator and then
you walk around the equator you will

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920
you walk around the equator you will
 

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.350
you walk around the equator you will
find that you only have to walk four

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:53.360
find that you only have to walk four
 

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.630
find that you only have to walk four
times as far as you did from the North

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640
times as far as you did from the North
 

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.270
times as far as you did from the North
Pole rather than rather than 2 pi as far

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280
Pole rather than rather than 2 pi as far
 

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.910
Pole rather than rather than 2 pi as far
so curvature does matter it also has the

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920
so curvature does matter it also has the
 

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.680
so curvature does matter it also has the
effect that angles of triangles the

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:02.690
effect that angles of triangles the
 

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.300
effect that angles of triangles the
angles of the 38 the sum of the three

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:04.310
angles of the 38 the sum of the three
 

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.890
angles of the 38 the sum of the three
angles of a triangle don't add up to 180

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:05.900
angles of a triangle don't add up to 180
 

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.920
angles of a triangle don't add up to 180
degrees anymore okay well turns out that

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:08.930
degrees anymore okay well turns out that
 

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.420
degrees anymore okay well turns out that
the acoustic peak is really wonderful

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:10.430
the acoustic peak is really wonderful
 

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.720
the acoustic peak is really wonderful
measurements of this and so if we make a

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:13.730
measurements of this and so if we make a
 

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.480
measurements of this and so if we make a
plot of the density of matter in our

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:16.490
plot of the density of matter in our
 

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.570
plot of the density of matter in our
units let's not worry about it but their

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:19.580
units let's not worry about it but their
 

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.610
units let's not worry about it but their
units called Omega matter and the

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:21.620
units called Omega matter and the
 

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.170
units called Omega matter and the
density of dark energy then if those

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:23.180
density of dark energy then if those
 

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.660
density of dark energy then if those
some to unity along this line then you

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:25.670
some to unity along this line then you
 

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.360
some to unity along this line then you
would have a flat universe and by just

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:28.370
would have a flat universe and by just
 

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.000
would have a flat universe and by just
looking at so if it would som de more

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.010
looking at so if it would som de more
 

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.780
looking at so if it would som de more
than that you'd have a spherical

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:31.790
than that you'd have a spherical
 

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.160
than that you'd have a spherical
universe lesson that would be this this

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:33.170
universe lesson that would be this this
 

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.240
universe lesson that would be this this
potato chip or saddle universe so our

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:37.250
potato chip or saddle universe so our
 

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.920
potato chip or saddle universe so our
data from the from the acoustic

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.930
data from the from the acoustic
 

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.660
data from the from the acoustic
oscillations is really strongly driving

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:40.670
oscillations is really strongly driving
 

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:41.319
oscillations is really strongly driving
us back

00:46:41.319 --> 00:46:41.329
us back
 

00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:44.440
us back
to a flat universe and when we add in

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:44.450
to a flat universe and when we add in
 

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.529
to a flat universe and when we add in
the fact we see the same fingerprint in

00:46:47.529 --> 00:46:47.539
the fact we see the same fingerprint in
 

00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:49.390
the fact we see the same fingerprint in
the microwave background you get driven

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400
the microwave background you get driven
 

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.329
the microwave background you get driven
down to this little region here so the

00:46:52.329 --> 00:46:52.339
down to this little region here so the
 

00:46:52.339 --> 00:46:54.729
down to this little region here so the
data just seeing the same acoustic scale

00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:54.739
data just seeing the same acoustic scale
 

00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:57.069
data just seeing the same acoustic scale
at all these different redshifts allows

00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079
at all these different redshifts allows
 

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:59.769
at all these different redshifts allows
us to vary dramatically see that dark

00:46:59.769 --> 00:46:59.779
us to vary dramatically see that dark
 

00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:01.930
us to vary dramatically see that dark
energy is there and that that the

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:01.940
energy is there and that that the
 

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.859
energy is there and that that the
universe is very close to flat but of

00:47:05.859 --> 00:47:05.869
universe is very close to flat but of
 

00:47:05.869 --> 00:47:07.479
universe is very close to flat but of
course we also want to understand about

00:47:07.479 --> 00:47:07.489
course we also want to understand about
 

00:47:07.489 --> 00:47:09.670
course we also want to understand about
this dark energy and up till now I've

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680
this dark energy and up till now I've
 

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.289
this dark energy and up till now I've
been saying oh it's it's a cosmological

00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:11.299
been saying oh it's it's a cosmological
 

00:47:11.299 --> 00:47:14.170
been saying oh it's it's a cosmological
constant well of course we'd like to

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:14.180
constant well of course we'd like to
 

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.609
constant well of course we'd like to
study if it's a cosmological constant

00:47:15.609 --> 00:47:15.619
study if it's a cosmological constant
 

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:17.769
study if it's a cosmological constant
the cosmological constant is saying that

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:17.779
the cosmological constant is saying that
 

00:47:17.779 --> 00:47:20.469
the cosmological constant is saying that
a given volume of space ways some amount

00:47:20.469 --> 00:47:20.479
a given volume of space ways some amount
 

00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:22.690
a given volume of space ways some amount
and the amount that it weighs is

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:22.700
and the amount that it weighs is
 

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.519
and the amount that it weighs is
invariant with time if you come back

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:24.529
invariant with time if you come back
 

00:47:24.529 --> 00:47:26.440
invariant with time if you come back
later on it's going to weigh the same

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:26.450
later on it's going to weigh the same
 

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.829
later on it's going to weigh the same
amount but maybe it changes of course

00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839
amount but maybe it changes of course
 

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:31.180
amount but maybe it changes of course
it's very reasonable to think that would

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:31.190
it's very reasonable to think that would
 

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.499
it's very reasonable to think that would
change if i take the universe and it

00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:32.509
change if i take the universe and it
 

00:47:32.509 --> 00:47:35.199
change if i take the universe and it
expands if it expands by a factor of 2

00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:35.209
expands if it expands by a factor of 2
 

00:47:35.209 --> 00:47:37.630
expands if it expands by a factor of 2
so that the volume is 8 times larger the

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640
so that the volume is 8 times larger the
 

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.160
so that the volume is 8 times larger the
cosmological constant is saying there's

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:39.170
cosmological constant is saying there's
 

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.660
cosmological constant is saying there's
actually eight times more stuff because

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:40.670
actually eight times more stuff because
 

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.039
actually eight times more stuff because
the volume increased by a factor of

00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:42.049
the volume increased by a factor of
 

00:47:42.049 --> 00:47:44.199
the volume increased by a factor of
eight that's kind of weird so we'd like

00:47:44.199 --> 00:47:44.209
eight that's kind of weird so we'd like
 

00:47:44.209 --> 00:47:45.880
eight that's kind of weird so we'd like
to see if this is changing and we

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:45.890
to see if this is changing and we
 

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:49.029
to see if this is changing and we
typically parameterize this by W so W is

00:47:49.029 --> 00:47:49.039
typically parameterize this by W so W is
 

00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:51.269
typically parameterize this by W so W is
minus 1 is the cosmological constant and

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:51.279
minus 1 is the cosmological constant and
 

00:47:51.279 --> 00:47:53.829
minus 1 is the cosmological constant and
values other than minus 1 mean that this

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839
values other than minus 1 mean that this
 

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:56.559
values other than minus 1 mean that this
density is changing in time so let's

00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:56.569
density is changing in time so let's
 

00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:58.150
density is changing in time so let's
return to this previous figure that I

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160
return to this previous figure that I
 

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.219
return to this previous figure that I
showed where before I showed you the red

00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:00.229
showed where before I showed you the red
 

00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:03.069
showed where before I showed you the red
region and our data but now let's

00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079
region and our data but now let's
 

00:48:03.079 --> 00:48:05.170
region and our data but now let's
imagine altering these hypotheses so

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:05.180
imagine altering these hypotheses so
 

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.249
imagine altering these hypotheses so
we're going to now take the predictions

00:48:06.249 --> 00:48:06.259
we're going to now take the predictions
 

00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:07.719
we're going to now take the predictions
of the CMB but instead of saying that

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:07.729
of the CMB but instead of saying that
 

00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:10.120
of the CMB but instead of saying that
the universe is flat we're going to say

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.130
the universe is flat we're going to say
 

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:11.709
the universe is flat we're going to say
that the universe has a 1-percent

00:48:11.709 --> 00:48:11.719
that the universe has a 1-percent
 

00:48:11.719 --> 00:48:14.319
that the universe has a 1-percent
curvature and that moves the prediction

00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:14.329
curvature and that moves the prediction
 

00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:15.939
curvature and that moves the prediction
down to this blue region not as good a

00:48:15.939 --> 00:48:15.949
down to this blue region not as good a
 

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:18.759
down to this blue region not as good a
fit to the data or we could say they'll

00:48:18.759 --> 00:48:18.769
fit to the data or we could say they'll
 

00:48:18.769 --> 00:48:20.829
fit to the data or we could say they'll
know we'll keep it as flat but now we're

00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839
know we'll keep it as flat but now we're
 

00:48:20.839 --> 00:48:21.759
know we'll keep it as flat but now we're
not going to assume the cosmological

00:48:21.759 --> 00:48:21.769
not going to assume the cosmological
 

00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:23.229
not going to assume the cosmological
constant we're going to allow the dark

00:48:23.229 --> 00:48:23.239
constant we're going to allow the dark
 

00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:25.359
constant we're going to allow the dark
energy to change in time and in

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:25.369
energy to change in time and in
 

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:27.249
energy to change in time and in
particular let's pick a dark energy that

00:48:27.249 --> 00:48:27.259
particular let's pick a dark energy that
 

00:48:27.259 --> 00:48:30.459
particular let's pick a dark energy that
has gotten a factor of 2 weaker since

00:48:30.459 --> 00:48:30.469
has gotten a factor of 2 weaker since
 

00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:33.910
has gotten a factor of 2 weaker since
redshift of one and that would give us

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920
redshift of one and that would give us
 

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.609
redshift of one and that would give us
this grace woth here again not as good a

00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:36.619
this grace woth here again not as good a
 

00:48:36.619 --> 00:48:38.140
this grace woth here again not as good a
fit to the data so the data is really

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.150
fit to the data so the data is really
 

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.799
fit to the data so the data is really
forcing us back to the flat cosmological

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:41.809
forcing us back to the flat cosmological
 

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:44.319
forcing us back to the flat cosmological
constant model and this is a version of

00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:44.329
constant model and this is a version of
 

00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:46.449
constant model and this is a version of
that same idea where I've now plotted

00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:46.459
that same idea where I've now plotted
 

00:48:46.459 --> 00:48:50.319
that same idea where I've now plotted
the curvature so here's flat and the

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:50.329
the curvature so here's flat and the
 

00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:52.449
the curvature so here's flat and the
dark energy density evolution here's the

00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:52.459
dark energy density evolution here's the
 

00:48:52.459 --> 00:48:55.210
dark energy density evolution here's the
cosmological constant and the data is dr

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:55.220
cosmological constant and the data is dr
 

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.960
cosmological constant and the data is dr
back to this blue region so this is very

00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:58.970
back to this blue region so this is very
 

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.460
back to this blue region so this is very
remarkable we've taken what we thought

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:00.470
remarkable we've taken what we thought
 

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.900
remarkable we've taken what we thought
was the simplest model a flat

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:01.910
was the simplest model a flat
 

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.120
was the simplest model a flat
cosmological constant model and we've

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.130
cosmological constant model and we've
 

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.070
cosmological constant model and we've
opened up two degrees of freedom to new

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:06.080
opened up two degrees of freedom to new
 

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.450
opened up two degrees of freedom to new
parameters in the model allowing the

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:07.460
parameters in the model allowing the
 

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.730
parameters in the model allowing the
spatial curvature to vary and allowing

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:09.740
spatial curvature to vary and allowing
 

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.470
spatial curvature to vary and allowing
the dark the dark energy to evolve in

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480
the dark the dark energy to evolve in
 

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.260
the dark the dark energy to evolve in
time and the data is driving us back to

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:14.270
time and the data is driving us back to
 

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.400
time and the data is driving us back to
the simple model so it's very

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:15.410
the simple model so it's very
 

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.339
the simple model so it's very
interesting evidence for for that simple

00:49:18.339 --> 00:49:18.349
interesting evidence for for that simple
 

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:24.550
interesting evidence for for that simple
model ok so we've really had a

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:24.560
model ok so we've really had a
 

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.339
model ok so we've really had a
remarkable few decades in cosmology and

00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:27.349
remarkable few decades in cosmology and
 

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:30.220
remarkable few decades in cosmology and
and we now have I think a very concrete

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:30.230
and we now have I think a very concrete
 

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:34.270
and we now have I think a very concrete
and simple and elegant theory for how

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280
and simple and elegant theory for how
 

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.849
and simple and elegant theory for how
the universe works starting at an age of

00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:36.859
the universe works starting at an age of
 

00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:39.550
the universe works starting at an age of
one second with the formation of helium

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:39.560
one second with the formation of helium
 

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.800
one second with the formation of helium
and determined the light elements onto

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:41.810
and determined the light elements onto
 

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.520
and determined the light elements onto
today on scales from galaxy scales up to

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:45.530
today on scales from galaxy scales up to
 

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.790
today on scales from galaxy scales up to
the scale of the observable universe and

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800
the scale of the observable universe and
 

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.250
the scale of the observable universe and
its really a triumph that it's been able

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:51.260
its really a triumph that it's been able
 

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.320
its really a triumph that it's been able
to be tested in so many different ways

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:53.330
to be tested in so many different ways
 

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.120
to be tested in so many different ways
we have lots and lots of cross checks

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.130
we have lots and lots of cross checks
 

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:57.880
we have lots and lots of cross checks
lots of confirmations and this theory is

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:57.890
lots of confirmations and this theory is
 

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.730
lots of confirmations and this theory is
is very important not simply because it

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:00.740
is very important not simply because it
 

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.140
is very important not simply because it
explains these cosmological observations

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:02.150
explains these cosmological observations
 

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.839
explains these cosmological observations
but because it gives a very robust base

00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:04.849
but because it gives a very robust base
 

00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:07.170
but because it gives a very robust base
it's giving us it has a very specific

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:07.180
it's giving us it has a very specific
 

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.550
it's giving us it has a very specific
prediction for the initial conditions of

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:09.560
prediction for the initial conditions of
 

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.680
prediction for the initial conditions of
the universe and that allows us to

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:11.690
the universe and that allows us to
 

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.660
the universe and that allows us to
simulate forward and provides the basis

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:13.670
simulate forward and provides the basis
 

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.010
simulate forward and provides the basis
for all of our studies of galaxy

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.020
for all of our studies of galaxy
 

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.290
for all of our studies of galaxy
evolution and and the evolution of

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.300
evolution and and the evolution of
 

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.870
evolution and and the evolution of
cosmic structure but along the way we've

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880
cosmic structure but along the way we've
 

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.790
cosmic structure but along the way we've
discovered our this this you know very

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:21.800
discovered our this this you know very
 

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.620
discovered our this this you know very
elegant theory has two new ingredients

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:23.630
elegant theory has two new ingredients
 

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.980
elegant theory has two new ingredients
dark matter and dark energy and we don't

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:26.990
dark matter and dark energy and we don't
 

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.140
dark matter and dark energy and we don't
know what they are so this is really the

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:29.150
know what they are so this is really the
 

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.470

to figure out what dark matter and dark
 

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.820
to figure out what dark matter and dark

00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:40.429
cosmological distance scale and with
 

00:51:40.429 --> 00:51:42.489
cosmological distance scale and with
that starting to probe the nature of

00:51:42.489 --> 00:51:42.499
that starting to probe the nature of
 

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:44.919
that starting to probe the nature of
dark energy it's based on very simple

00:51:44.919 --> 00:51:44.929
dark energy it's based on very simple
 

00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:46.539
dark energy it's based on very simple
physics from the early universe that

00:51:46.539 --> 00:51:46.549
physics from the early universe that
 

00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:48.909

this method has really matured over the

00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:53.089
this method has really matured over the
 

00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:55.359
this method has really matured over the
last ten years to being a very important

00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:55.369
last ten years to being a very important

used the acoustic peak to measure

00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:03.259
used the acoustic peak to measure
 

00:52:03.259 --> 00:52:05.199
used the acoustic peak to measure
distance two percent level accuracy and

00:52:05.199 --> 00:52:05.209
distance two percent level accuracy and
 

00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:07.509
distance two percent level accuracy and
we find really excellent agreement with

00:52:07.509 --> 00:52:07.519
we find really excellent agreement with
 

00:52:07.519 --> 00:52:09.969
we find really excellent agreement with
a flat cosmology with the cosmological

00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:09.979
a flat cosmology with the cosmological
 

00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:12.609
a flat cosmology with the cosmological
constant and there's lots more to do

00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:12.619
constant and there's lots more to do
 

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:13.809
constant and there's lots more to do
because we really want to understand

00:52:13.809 --> 00:52:13.819
because we really want to understand
 

00:52:13.819 --> 00:52:16.479
because we really want to understand
what dark matter and dark energy is and

00:52:16.479 --> 00:52:16.489
what dark matter and dark energy is and
 

00:52:16.489 --> 00:52:17.799

so the next generation of astronomers

00:52:17.799 --> 00:52:17.809
so the next generation of astronomers
 

00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:20.529
so the next generation of astronomers
have a lot of work to do here's my son

00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:20.539
have a lot of work to do here's my son
 

00:52:20.539 --> 00:52:24.669
have a lot of work to do here's my son
making an early suggestion so I'll

00:52:24.669 --> 00:52:24.679

to take any questions thank

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.270
 

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.030
how do the instruments you're using

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040
how do the instruments you're using
 

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.339
how do the instruments you're using
compared with the James Webb dance

00:52:50.339 --> 00:52:50.349
compared with the James Webb dance
 

00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:52.079
compared with the James Webb dance
committee and they're going to launch in

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:52.089
committee and they're going to launch in
 

00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:54.990
committee and they're going to launch in
the next few years yeah so on James Webb

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000
the next few years yeah so on James Webb
 

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.609

Space Telescope is the successor to the

00:52:56.609 --> 00:52:56.619
Space Telescope is the successor to the
 

00:52:56.619 --> 00:52:59.030
Space Telescope is the successor to the
Hubble Space Telescope and it's a

00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040
Hubble Space Telescope and it's a
 

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.470
Hubble Space Telescope and it's a
telescope that's optimized for infrared

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480
telescope that's optimized for infrared
 

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.020
telescope that's optimized for infrared
observations in space it's a very narrow

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:04.030
observations in space it's a very narrow
 

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.180
observations in space it's a very narrow
field telescope so it really looks at

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:06.190
field telescope so it really looks at
 

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.190
field telescope so it really looks at
pinpricks of the sky but it looks

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200
pinpricks of the sky but it looks
 

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.460
pinpricks of the sky but it looks
enormously deeply and that looks in the

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:11.470
enormously deeply and that looks in the
 

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.290
enormously deeply and that looks in the
infrared so we're doing wide field

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:13.300
infrared so we're doing wide field
 

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.630
infrared so we're doing wide field
surveys primarily in the optical so

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640
surveys primarily in the optical so
 

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.520
surveys primarily in the optical so
James Bob is extremely important for

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:17.530
James Bob is extremely important for
 

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.069
James Bob is extremely important for
understanding of the period the early

00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079

galaxies the formation of early galaxies

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:21.940
galaxies the formation of early galaxies
 

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.390
galaxies the formation of early galaxies
will be able to dissect really the

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400
will be able to dissect really the
 

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.770
will be able to dissect really the
evolution of galaxies across a wide

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:25.780
evolution of galaxies across a wide
 

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.809
evolution of galaxies across a wide
range of cosmic history but ultimately

00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:27.819
range of cosmic history but ultimately
 

00:53:27.819 --> 00:53:29.609
range of cosmic history but ultimately
it only covers tiny fractions of the sky

00:53:29.609 --> 00:53:29.619
it only covers tiny fractions of the sky
 

00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:31.200
it only covers tiny fractions of the sky
so it's not it's not as good at napping

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:31.210
so it's not it's not as good at napping
 

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.510
so it's not it's not as good at napping
things you know you want to map things

things you know you want to map things
 

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.620
things you know you want to map things
but once you find there certain things

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:34.630
but once you find there certain things
 

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:35.670
but once you find there certain things
you want to go and look at them in

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680
you want to go and look at them in
 

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:41.520
you want to go and look at them in
detail yes sir electromagnetic energy

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:41.530

my understanding of acoustic energy is

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920
my understanding of acoustic energy is
 

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.630
my understanding of acoustic energy is
that a medium is required for it to be

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640
that a medium is required for it to be
 

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.190
that a medium is required for it to be
propagated oh I'm probably missing

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200

mystic so these are these are ways that

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:57.970
mystic so these are these are ways that
 

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.880
mystic so these are these are ways that
are propagating because of the motion of

00:53:59.880 --> 00:53:59.890
are propagating because of the motion of
 

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.950
are propagating because of the motion of
particles so those particles can move

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960
particles so those particles can move
 

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.130
particles so those particles can move
without a reference to a medium um I'm

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.140
without a reference to a medium um I'm
 

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.930
without a reference to a medium um I'm
not even really sure I mean if we talked

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:06.940
not even really sure I mean if we talked
 

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.380
not even really sure I mean if we talked
about the air in this room I know if you

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:10.390
about the air in this room I know if you
 

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.910
about the air in this room I know if you
look at microscopically I'm not sure you

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920
look at microscopically I'm not sure you
 

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.500
look at microscopically I'm not sure you
would say there's a medium you're maybe

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:13.510
would say there's a medium you're maybe
 

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.579
would say there's a medium you're maybe
thinking that the sound waves are moving

00:54:14.579 --> 00:54:14.589
thinking that the sound waves are moving
 

00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:16.050
thinking that the sound waves are moving
through the air I'm describing the sound

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.060
through the air I'm describing the sound
 

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.760
through the air I'm describing the sound
waves as the air the molecules of the

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:17.770
waves as the air the molecules of the
 

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.559
waves as the air the molecules of the
air are actually moving and that's

00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:19.569
air are actually moving and that's
 

00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:21.030
air are actually moving and that's
what's causing the sound wave propagate

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040
what's causing the sound wave propagate
 

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.620
what's causing the sound wave propagate
but you don't have to really you don't

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:22.630
but you don't have to really you don't
 

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.470
but you don't have to really you don't
have to invoke something that the air

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480
have to invoke something that the air
 

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.240
have to invoke something that the air
that those molecules are moving in you

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.250
that those molecules are moving in you
 

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.760
that those molecules are moving in you
just think it's space so it's the same

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:29.770
just think it's space so it's the same

thing here young lady right there
 

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.099
thing here young lady right there
oh how much data and how long do you

00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:37.109
oh how much data and how long do you
 

00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:38.809
oh how much data and how long do you
think it would take to map the known

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819
think it would take to map the known
 

00:54:38.819 --> 00:54:42.980
think it would take to map the known
universe yeah that's a good question of

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:42.990
universe yeah that's a good question of
 

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.450
universe yeah that's a good question of
course part of the answer depends upon

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460
course part of the answer depends upon
 

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.150
course part of the answer depends upon
how finely you want to map if you want

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160
how finely you want to map if you want
 

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.359
how finely you want to map if you want
to make crude maps then you get one

00:54:50.359 --> 00:54:50.369
to make crude maps then you get one
 

00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:51.740
to make crude maps then you get one
answer if you want to make very fun you

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:51.750
answer if you want to make very fun you
 

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.230
answer if you want to make very fun you
get a different answer um we're very

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240
get a different answer um we're very
 

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.970
get a different answer um we're very
limited in how far we can see so

00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980
limited in how far we can see so
 

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.529
limited in how far we can see so
galaxies get fainter as you go further

00:55:00.529 --> 00:55:00.539
galaxies get fainter as you go further
 

00:55:00.539 --> 00:55:02.000
galaxies get fainter as you go further
away and it makes them harder and harder

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.010
away and it makes them harder and harder
 

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.279
away and it makes them harder and harder
and harder so the surveys that we talked

00:55:04.279 --> 00:55:04.289
and harder so the surveys that we talked
 

00:55:04.289 --> 00:55:05.960
and harder so the surveys that we talked
about for the next generation will get

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:05.970
about for the next generation will get
 

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.690
about for the next generation will get
us out to about redshift of three which

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700
us out to about redshift of three which
 

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.849
us out to about redshift of three which
is a long way it's a big chunk of the

00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:10.859
is a long way it's a big chunk of the
 

00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:12.140
is a long way it's a big chunk of the
university but it's not the whole

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:12.150
university but it's not the whole
 

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:15.140
university but it's not the whole
universe um for those surveys we're

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:15.150
universe um for those surveys we're
 

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.740
universe um for those surveys we're
talking about samples of the level of

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:17.750
talking about samples of the level of
 

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.779
talking about samples of the level of

between 50 million galaxies up up to a
 

00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:24.620
between 50 million galaxies up up to a
border of billion galaxies and you know

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:24.630
border of billion galaxies and you know
 

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:26.089
border of billion galaxies and you know

okay that's very good question so I

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:21.970
 

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.460
think it's fair to say that it is just a

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:11.390
answer is some of that travel was at
earlier times when he got extra credit

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400
 

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.070
give this expanding Universal things get

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:14.080
give this expanding Universal things get
 

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.410
give this expanding Universal things get
travel thank you my god whether those

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:16.420
travel thank you my god whether those
 

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.140
travel thank you my god whether those
variations back then correlate or I

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:19.150
variations back then correlate or I
 

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:21.860
variations back then correlate or I
believed to be caused by quantum

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:21.870
believed to be caused by quantum
 

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:27.870
believed to be caused by quantum
fluctuations yeah so so the usual theory

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880
fluctuations yeah so so the usual theory
 

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.840
fluctuations yeah so so the usual theory
of inflation basically the question is

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:30.850
of inflation basically the question is
 

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.250
of inflation basically the question is
how does how does any dudes get started

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:32.260
how does how does any dudes get started
 

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.620
how does how does any dudes get started
I've told you how given some initial set

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:34.630
I've told you how given some initial set
 

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.270
I've told you how given some initial set
of perturbations how they evolve the

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280
of perturbations how they evolve the
 

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.950
of perturbations how they evolve the
sound waves all about how they evolve it

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960
sound waves all about how they evolve it
 

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.450
sound waves all about how they evolve it
doesn't tell you anything about how they

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:39.460
doesn't tell you anything about how they
 

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.180
doesn't tell you anything about how they
get started and the theory of how they

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:42.190
get started and the theory of how they
 

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:44.060
get started and the theory of how they
get started is this theory of inflation

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.070
get started is this theory of inflation
 

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.590
get started is this theory of inflation
that says that the universe goes to this

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:46.600
that says that the universe goes to this
 

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.420
that says that the universe goes to this
early period of a very very rapid

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:48.430
early period of a very very rapid
 

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:51.830
early period of a very very rapid
expansion and because of quantum

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:51.840
expansion and because of quantum
 

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.910
expansion and because of quantum
uncertainties from one part of the

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920
uncertainties from one part of the
 

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.740
uncertainties from one part of the
universe to the next different parts of

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:55.750
universe to the next different parts of
 

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.180
universe to the next different parts of
universe expand by slightly different

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:57.190
universe expand by slightly different
 

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:59.580
universe expand by slightly different
amounts so if you take you know if you

00:59:59.580 --> 00:59:59.590
amounts so if you take you know if you
 

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:00.990
amounts so if you take you know if you
take some sheet of paper you try to

01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000
take some sheet of paper you try to
 

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.030
take some sheet of paper you try to
expand it really quickly and but you

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040
expand it really quickly and but you
 

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.350
expand it really quickly and but you
pull on different parts of different

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:04.360
pull on different parts of different
 

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.630
pull on different parts of different
different rates than the paper will end

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640
different rates than the paper will end
 

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.060
different rates than the paper will end
up wrinkled and that's those crinkles

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:09.070
up wrinkled and that's those crinkles
 

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:12.930
up wrinkled and that's those crinkles
are the are the initial perturbations

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:12.940
are the are the initial perturbations
 

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.060
are the are the initial perturbations
that then give rise to all the football

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.070
that then give rise to all the football
 

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.710
that then give rise to all the football
the formation of structure galaxies

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720
the formation of structure galaxies
 

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.280
the formation of structure galaxies
clusters on these acoustic oscillations

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:19.290
clusters on these acoustic oscillations
 

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.330
clusters on these acoustic oscillations
we're going to wrap it up with one

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:21.340
we're going to wrap it up with one
 

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.560
we're going to wrap it up with one
really good question right

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:22.570
really good question right
 

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:24.660
really good question right
out there um so you mentioned that there

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:24.670
out there um so you mentioned that there
 

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:26.790
out there um so you mentioned that there
is a number of different theories about

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:26.800
is a number of different theories about
 

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.770
is a number of different theories about
dark matter and dark energy the knee of

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:28.780
dark matter and dark energy the knee of
 

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.200
dark matter and dark energy the knee of
these theories predict or generally

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:31.210
these theories predict or generally
 

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:32.190
these theories predict or generally
believe that there's a connection

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200
believe that there's a connection
 

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.500
believe that there's a connection
between dark matter and dark energy the

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:34.510
between dark matter and dark energy the
 

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.060
between dark matter and dark energy the
same way that there is between normal

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:36.070
same way that there is between normal
 

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:38.270
same way that there is between normal
matter and warmer normal energy

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280
matter and warmer normal energy
 

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.230
matter and warmer normal energy
connection between dark matter and dark

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240
connection between dark matter and dark
 

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.000
connection between dark matter and dark
dinner yeah so there are theories that

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.010
dinner yeah so there are theories that
 

01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:44.610
dinner yeah so there are theories that
try to connect them I wouldn't say the I

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:44.620
try to connect them I wouldn't say the I
 

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.230
try to connect them I wouldn't say the I
mean most theories leave them separate

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240
mean most theories leave them separate
 

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.520
mean most theories leave them separate
but people of course are very

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:47.530
but people of course are very
 

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.410
but people of course are very
interesting yeah like to find a common

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:49.420
interesting yeah like to find a common
 

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.390
interesting yeah like to find a common
confident explanation of everything you

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400
confident explanation of everything you
 

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.070
confident explanation of everything you
try to evoke as hbu tooth fairies as

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:53.080
try to evoke as hbu tooth fairies as
 

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.590
try to evoke as hbu tooth fairies as
possible so yeah so people are trying to

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:55.600
possible so yeah so people are trying to
 

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.430
possible so yeah so people are trying to
figure out if there might be a

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440
figure out if there might be a
 

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.440
figure out if there might be a
connection they do behave rather

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:58.450
connection they do behave rather
 

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:02.550
connection they do behave rather
differently so um you know dark matter

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:02.560
differently so um you know dark matter
 

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.600
differently so um you know dark matter
is is basically normal stuff in the

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:06.610
is is basically normal stuff in the
 

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:08.070
is is basically normal stuff in the
sense that when you expand the universe

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:08.080
sense that when you expand the universe
 

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.560
sense that when you expand the universe
the amount of mass stays constant dark

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:10.570
the amount of mass stays constant dark
 

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:12.120
the amount of mass stays constant dark
energy has this funny property that when

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.130
energy has this funny property that when
 

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:13.290
energy has this funny property that when
you expand the universe you get more of

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:13.300
you expand the universe you get more of
 

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.690
you expand the universe you get more of
it so it's not immediately obvious that

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:15.700
it so it's not immediately obvious that
 

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.220
it so it's not immediately obvious that
the two are related but as people would

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:17.230
the two are related but as people would
 

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:21.360
the two are related but as people would
love to try to find connections okay and

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:21.370
love to try to find connections okay and
 

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:23.490
love to try to find connections okay and
with that we're going to sign off so

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:23.500
with that we're going to sign off so
 

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.680
with that we're going to sign off so
please join us again next month thank
