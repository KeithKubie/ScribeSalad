00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the answer is the second choice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason--for this we can see that it takes one input--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
there's one parameter between the parentheses--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it calls that input "n,"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.446
and then what it outputs is--after the return,

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.977
it outputs the result of "n+1."

00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:19.000
So whatever was the value of "n," which is the input,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the result of "inc" is the value, plus one.
