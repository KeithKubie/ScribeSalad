00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The correct answer of the 1 step is 3, 3, 3, and 3.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For example, for cell A we can only get particles from B or C.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Those will come to A with a 50% chance each.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So 6 times 0.5 is 3 for A.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Each cell has exactly 6 particles in its total neighbors,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so therefore, each of those cells gets a 3.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Asymptotically, this won't change. It's again 3, 3, 3, and 3.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I apologize it is a little bit misleading here that all these answers are the same number,

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but that's what this example gives us.
