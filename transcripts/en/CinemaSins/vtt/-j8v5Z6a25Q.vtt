00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.830
So I saw your Harry Potter and Hunger Games
sins videos.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.139
Yeah?

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.480
Read the books, asshole!

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.180
So you’re saying that any movie based on
a book, I need to read the book first?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180
Yeah.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.450
Okay, All the President’s Men.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.239
That movie’s based on a book, and I’ve
never read it, but that movie’s awesome.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.239
You wanna know why?

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.239
Cause they explain everything.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.360
And that movie’s entertaining.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.380
And it’s better than Harry Potter and Hunger
Games.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.380
Combined.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.900
You’re comparing one of the most important
political stories of our time to fantasy novels?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.580
Now, let’s just say the movie All the President’s
Men didn’t explain everything, maybe there’s

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.600
a phone call or a clandestine parking lot
meeting, but we don’t get to see it.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.999
But all the sudden Woodward &amp; Bernstein know
all this sh*t about Watergate but we didn’t

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.210
see how they learned it.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.670
Right, now you would sit there and tell me
to go read the book.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.019
Well, what I’d probably say—
Or you’d say, “Don’t worry about it,

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.340
you can figure it out in five seconds if you
just think about it.”

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.769
Well, sure, I can figure out that somebody
told them.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.539
Somebody probably that worked at the White
House.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.540
But if I don’t know who it is, if I don’t
understand their

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.250
They make movies like Harry Potter for people
who read the books.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.309
Bullsh*t.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.380
Studio guys would throw themselves off a bridge
if they made book money.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.270
Are you telling me the only people they want
to enjoy the movie are the people who read

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.270
the book?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.720
Filmmakers can’t put everything from the
book into the movie.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.670
Why does it matter if Hagrid is dragging a
tree.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.830
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320
I’ll tell you why.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
Magic.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.780
I’m watching a movie about magic and they’re
making this poor bastard drag a giant f*cking

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.560
tree all the way across campus.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.960
Is he married to Darrin, from Bewitched?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.890
Do they have some kind of a gay pact--
Why does the pact have to be gay?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.310
--to not do magic?

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940
Look, all this is explained--
In the book?

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.020
Yeah, well that’s another thing.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.460
Why do I even care what you people who read
the book think?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.380
You people are the hardest to please in the
world.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.380
You nitpick everything.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.950
Oh, they changed the boa constrictor to a
Burmese python!

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.290
Or they didn’t do Peeves the poltergeist!

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.420
Or they left out the Sorting Hat’s song!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.010
But if I point out one inconsistency in the
movie, you tell me “Go read the book.”

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.010
Makes everything better, right?

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.740
Well, you wouldn’t ask as many stupid questions
after.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.680
And while we’re on the subject of magic…
is it like the Force?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.650
Do you have to believe you have it before
you actually have it?

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.090
I mean, they’re all sitting around waving
wands, doing this pseudo-Latin.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.580
If it really comes down to who pronounces
it the best, aren’t they really just taking

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.580
language courses?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.180
I think it’s like what Malcolm Gladwell
said.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.769
It takes, like, 10,000 hours of practice to
become a master.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.180
Well then Hermoine should be the best wizard
in the whole series.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.980
All she ever does is read, study, correct
people, and go to the library.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.500
She’s a better wizard than Ron.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.769
She’s a better wizard than Harry.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.459
She’s probably a better wizard than Dumbledore.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.170
Dumbledore definitely has more than 10,000
hours of practice.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.330
That’s why he does magic in one movie out
of eight.
