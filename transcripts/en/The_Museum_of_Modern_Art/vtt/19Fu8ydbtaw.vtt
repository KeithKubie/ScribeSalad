Ellen: What we're looking at is a Sprite from
Frank Lloyd Wright's project Midway Gardens,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.960
which was a sort of concert hall/beer garden
in Chicago.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.940
It came to us in a really, really sad state.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.150
Clearly, it's head is missing, that's the
most glaring damage.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.960
But more pressing was the system of cracks
through its in section.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.480
Every time you moved her, her top portion
would sort of wobble.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.400
It was very scary, and she wasn't stable enough
for exhibition.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.220
Ultimately, we discovered that the rebar was
bent, so we had to cut her in half, separate

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.260
the two pieces, and then rotate the top portion,
bring it down on the bottom half.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.960
So looking at it now, it's back together,
and then there's this funny, like marshmallow

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.240
fluff material that we're using as our bulk
fill, the main filling component

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.760
which is more of that resin that we used to put the sculpture back together

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.720
but that's been bulked with glass micro-balloons which you see here.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.760
These are very light little spheres made of glass which help bulk out the fill.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.400
And then the idea of treatment was toâ€¦after
that fill is completed, we come out to the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.040
surface, we would finish it off with a skin
of concrete mesh fill

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.200
using more of that acrylic resin, but this time bulked with actual concrete mortar

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.040
and more of these micro-balloons, and then into that we put sand to match the surface.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.440
This is why I'm wearing a dust mask.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.720
So this is the pigment that will color the
fill.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.760
And then you try to get it around an eighth
of an inch or so thick.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.600
And then you peel them apart, like that.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.400
And you end up with a nice texture that grabs
the sand that we're going to be applying later.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.920
So you just let that cook for a little while.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.480
Jessica, do you wanna take it away?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.680
Jessica: Yeah.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.920
So, while that sets, I'm gonna trace out the
fill and I'll just put it down here.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.800
And then I'm going to start to cut it out.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.040
Basically, I'm just making little dots all
the way around, so that I can find my trace,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.480
and then I would go back and actually cut
it out.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.160
Now, it's just about connecting the dots.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.080
So, to get the texture, we just use a little
bit of acetone, just to reactivate the surface,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:25.200
and we just brush it on, and then add sand.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.400
All right.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.320
So I'm just coating the back with the same
adhesive that we used to make this.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.120
A little sand helps to ease the transition.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.520
Ellen: A final step would be to tone it with
some conservation colors.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.479
Where the fill we're making for the whole
piece is the same color, more or less, the

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.630
same ingredients, but it's not going to match
everywhere because the sculpture isn't all

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.060
the same color everywhere

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.699
so we built in this final step of toning as
needed, the surrounding areas.
