it useless so when might we have quantum

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
it useless so when might we have quantum
 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.550
it useless so when might we have quantum
computers I don't know

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
computers I don't know
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.770
computers I don't know
but personally I think we'll have

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
but personally I think we'll have
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.530
but personally I think we'll have
molecular computers before we have

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540
molecular computers before we have
 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.839
molecular computers before we have
quantum computers that is we'll be able

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849
quantum computers that is we'll be able
 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.729
quantum computers that is we'll be able
to compute on molecules molecular

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739
to compute on molecules molecular
 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.490
to compute on molecules molecular
transistors already exist we can already

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
transistors already exist we can already
 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.140
transistors already exist we can already
make them we can make them out of

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150
make them we can make them out of
 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.260
make them we can make them out of
graphene which is one layer of carbon in

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270
graphene which is one layer of carbon in
 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.959
graphene which is one layer of carbon in
a gigantic sheet the world's smallest

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:26.969
a gigantic sheet the world's smallest
 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.720
a gigantic sheet the world's smallest
molecular transistor is one carbon at

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730
molecular transistor is one carbon at
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.210
molecular transistor is one carbon at
that is a smallest molecular transistor

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220
that is a smallest molecular transistor
 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.520
that is a smallest molecular transistor
that we've been able to make so far so

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530
that we've been able to make so far so
 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.920
that we've been able to make so far so
personally I would bet that molecular

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930
personally I would bet that molecular
 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.520
personally I would bet that molecular
computers will replace silicon power

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530
computers will replace silicon power
 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.880
