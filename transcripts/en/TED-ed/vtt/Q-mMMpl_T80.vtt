00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.564
Each spring, nature lovers eagerly greet the signs

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:12.150
that winter is finally coming to an end.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.249
As the days grow warmer,

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.333
the flowers and trees start to bloom,

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.540
and the world comes alive

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.176
with the melodious call of birds

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:20.097
in search of a new mate.

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:21.784
But where have these enchanting sounds

00:00:21.784 --> 00:00:23.833
been hiding all winter?

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.343
For almost 200 species of song birds,

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:27.520
their winters have been spent

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.981
down in the tropical climates

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:31.524
of Central and South America.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:32.963
While this may sound ideal,

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.137
it involves one of the most perilous journeys

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:38.121
known in the entire animal kingdom.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.232
This journey is called migration,

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:41.261
and for song birds,

00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:43.120
this can involve travelling somewhere

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.572
between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:47.178
in a period of several weeks

00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:48.761
to four months.

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.037
Birds spend weeks preparing

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:51.367
for the intense journey

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.350
by gorging on large quantities of food,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.868
sometimes doubling their weight

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:56.674
prior to departure.

00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:58.168
While flying, birds can lose

00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:00.867
almost one percent of their body weight an hour,

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:04.458
so packing on the pounds is crucial to their survival.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.500
However, more than the physical stress,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.251
migrating birds are now facing

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.930
a new source of hardship:

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.629
landscape change.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:13.259
Just imagine you're the one

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.768
getting ready to take a trip.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:15.798
You've packed the car

00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:17.430
with everything you think you need,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.347
fueled up the tank,

00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:19.637
eaten a huge breakfast,

00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:21.058
and hit the road.

00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:22.926
You've taken this journey before.

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:24.564
You know all your favorite rest stops

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:27.184
and little back-alley diners to grab a bite.

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:29.098
Everything is planned out.

00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:30.903
But just as your fuel gauge starts

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:32.236
dipping into the red zone,

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:34.450
you pass by what should have been a gas station,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.120
except it's closed.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.455
"Not a problem," you think,

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:39.741
"The next one can't be too far away."

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.429
But then that next station never appears.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.998
Unfortunately, as you continue on your route,

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:47.816
the reality of the situation starts to set in.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.665
More and more stations are closed

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:51.511
or just erased from your map.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.500
All of a sudden, your routine trip

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.088
has become a desperate search

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.172
just to find somewhere safe to rest

00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:59.016
and refuel for the night.

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.631
This scenario has become the reality

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.890
for the majority of migrating song birds

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.825
as human land development continues unchecked.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.322
Humans are altering important stop-over sites

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:11.987
that birds have been using for generations.

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:14.485
As migrators pass over the continent,

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:15.896
they run a gauntlet of dangers,

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:18.901
including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands,

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.192
habitat loss in suburban developments,

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:23.905
as well as disorientation from light pollution,

00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:25.364
and even structure collision

00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:28.700
with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.459
Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.735
that comprise the fall population,

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.561
only about half will return

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.387
to breed the following spring.

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.213
Almost one billion of these deaths

00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:42.171
are attributed just to building collisions.

00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.009
With such astounding yearly losses,

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.803
humans risk more than just the loss

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:48.484
of the beautiful colors and songs of birds,

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:51.479
they also play an important role in the ecosystem.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.507
Birds help with insect control,

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.526
pollination,

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:56.614
and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape.

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.960
Without birds, the natural world

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.263
would be a very different place.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.399
Although birds face an on-going threat

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.841
from human land development,

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.316
there are actions that we can all take to help.

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:07.713
Many countries and local governements

00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:09.426
have already passed important laws

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:12.255
that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:14.582
By using more natural, plant-based products,

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.557
we can maintain our farms and gardens

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.642
without the dangerous side effects.

00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:21.753
In addition, as our global populations continue to grow

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.858
and people need places to call home,

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:26.162
green spaces can offer both bird habitat

00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:28.421
as well as a peaceful and natural place

00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.666
for us to enjoy.

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:31.420
Small changes at home

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.416
can also make a huge difference.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:34.415
By hanging up feeders

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:36.954
and building bird houses in outdoor areas,

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.947
we can provide much-needed food and safety

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:40.825
during long migrations.

00:03:41.594 --> 00:03:43.155
Turning out lights in suburban

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:43.994
and urban environments

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:45.080
can also help birds

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.296
that look for stars to navigate.

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:49.331
With our help, these sky travellers

00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:51.383
can reach their destination safely,

00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:54.636
and hopefully keep returning year after year.
