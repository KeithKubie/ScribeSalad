WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.290
They're going to record it over there. I mean,

2
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:04.900
I'm going to record it here to you. Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today evil, although, no,

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.770
I don't know if that's the right word for this next thing. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.380
Cause it's sort of more complicate when you call someone evil,

6
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.810
then you're kind of done with them. But there's been a fellow,

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.450
I've been thinking about him from bitter part of the year as you know,

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.430
such a puzzle to me. I can't quite please him though.

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.110
It's very fun to try. And I heard about him from science writers, Sam Keen.

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.980
Well let's talk about Fritz Haber. So, so first of all, could you just like,

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.970
when did he live and what did he look like and that kind of stuff?

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.140
<v 1>Uh, he was doing his,</v>

13
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:44.141
his great science work right around the turn of the 20th century.

14
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:50.141
So right around 1900 very distinctive looking man bald on top trim.

15
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:54.900
Nice mustache. Wore a little, um, uh, peas Nez. Is that how you say the,

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.800
is that the for notice princess? Okay. One of those very tiny old fashioned,

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.070
uh, pair of glasses that would pinch on your nose.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.000
And he was someone who had very big ambitions.

19
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 0>Just to put that in context, uh, I'd bring a few other of our storytellers in.</v>

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.410
He comes from Breslau, Germany, that's Fred Kaufman reporter, which is a,

21
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:20.240
a fairly small, you know, smaller sort of town. And uh, so does Clara.

22
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.670
That's for topper's wife. We're gonna meet her later. Right?

23
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.360
Clara comes from the same town and they're both secularized Jews.

24
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.100
But this was a moment in German history.

25
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:30.830
He says when Jews had a decent amount of freedom,

26
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.800
and this is the difference between Kaiser Wilhelm and of course Hitler's

27
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.370
Germany. Yeah. Put it in context. Dan Charles, he's a historian.

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.630
His was the first generation when a young Jewish boy could truly imagine that he

29
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.920
could just be a regular part of that society. He could do anything.

30
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.510
And he believed it. Fast forward 10 years for topper as a professor,

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.900
small university is working with chemicals. It's about 1880.

32
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.230
And he throws himself at one of the central issues facing Germany that at that

33
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:00.890
time Germany has a problem, a big problem.

34
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.950
It has enough what they used to call then solar energy, you know,

35
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:08.570
energy from the sun to grow crops to feed about 30 million people.

36
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.230
However that leaves behind 20 million Germans.

37
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.290
Do you mean they're looking at 20 million people going hungry?

38
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.080
That's what we're heading towards. I mean you have to remember it during the,

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.340
during the Crimean war in the 1850s Europe starves,

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180
so around the turn of the century for German scientists like hopper,

41
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:29.550
this was the challenge. He is, he wants to feed,

42
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.000
he wants to feed Germany and actually this wasn't just a German thing.

43
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.300
A lot of people were beginning to worry that with about a billion and a half

44
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:41.040
people on the planet at that point that maybe we were maxing out that the earth

45
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.290
couldn't support this many people and everyone thought, well,

46
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.700
we know the solution. Yeah, we just need a whole lot more of one simple element.

47
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.420
Nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen, they needed more nitrogen.

48
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.350
Nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids and proteins.

49
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.930
And when you stick a seed like a weed seed in the ground,

50
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.320
one of the reasons it grows is because it's sucking up all the nitrogen in the

51
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.710
soil to make it cell walls. Without nitrogen,

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.420
you don't have life

53
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

54
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.120
<v 0>Now of course you could find it some nitrogen out in the world.</v>

55
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.900
Natural deposits would be like seaweed or manure was one, you know,

56
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:18.000
you could find it in cow manure or one no,

57
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.680
which was basically bat poop and seagull poop, which made that poop valuable.

58
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.730
And actually two nations in South America went to war.

59
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.650
Literally over bet. You could say people work best. Crazy. By the way,

60
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:35.580
that's reporter lot tiff Nasir, you know, this was like oil is today. This is,

61
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.760
everybody was desperate for sources, new sources of nitrogen.

62
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.860
And to make the problem even more annoying,

63
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.470
the most common source of nitrogen is in the air around us.

64
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.933
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.071
<v 0>ah,</v>

66
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:53.071
it makes up four out of every five or so molecules that we breathe.

67
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.850
So it's very a lot. Yes,

68
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.000
80% of the air is nitrogen atoms. So all the

69
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.120
<v 3>could you ever need what's right there.</v>

70
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.740
You can't like throw that air onto a plant, you know, they couldn't deploy it.

71
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.710
They couldn't deploy it, meaning they couldn't capture it. That's right.

72
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:11.780
And part of the problem here,

73
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.270
and although once again we're getting a little ahead of ourselves,

74
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.710
we'll be right back to high, but wait, wait,

75
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.860
let's just finish this is that is that nitrogen is try Vaillant try,

76
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.150
try Vaillant. In other words,

77
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.240
nitrogen has really strong attachments to itself.

78
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.850
And what he means is that when nitrogen atoms are just free floating in the air,

79
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:33.560
they will cling to each other.

80
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.160
These little nitrogen atoms will fiercely hold together and it's almost

81
00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:40.790
impossible to pry them apart. His calculation showed that it couldn't be done,

82
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.310
at least not without a tremendous amount of energy.

83
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.110
More energy than seem like possible to make. Yeah. Yes. But you know,

84
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.300
being ambitious harbor starts thinking,

85
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.860
in order to do this we need to Ah, pressure this.

86
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.810
We need to put it under a lot of pressure. So he starts experimenting.

87
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.730
He figures out a way to take a lot of air that's filled with these little

88
00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:06.150
nitrogen bonds clinging to each other and [inaudible] pump it with big iron

89
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.410
[inaudible] under extreme extreme pressure at high temperature.

90
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.630
And then he forces hydrogen into the tech get in there and you have a number of

91
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:16.620
chemical reactions

92
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.400
and what happens is that you're, you're elbowing the month,

93
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.490
the nitrogen apart from excel and then forcing it to on [inaudible] with the

94
00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:35.810
hydrogen in a new way. And when hydrogen and nitrogen bond together,

95
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.690
the thing you get is ammonia,

96
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.580
a liquid that has captured the nitrogen right out of the air.

97
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.110
You literally get a drip, drip,

98
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.230
drip of ammonia.

99
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.770
<v 2>Ah,</v>

100
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 0>it is, it is arguably</v>

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 3>the most significant scientific breakthrough of the mall.</v>

102
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
Bread from the air was the phrase cause hopper had figured out a way to take

103
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.960
nitrogen from the air,

104
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.500
put it into the barren ground and grew wheat.

105
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.510
This has allowed the world to have 7 billion people.

106
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.600
This is what's driving the world towards 10 12 by 2050

107
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.460
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

108
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.460
<v 3>now we're seeing about a hundred million tons of synthetic fertilizer produced</v>

109
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:34.450
industrially each year.

110
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.080
And the tonnages then moves into our food source.

111
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.510
Our food source then moves into our bodies.

112
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.750
And the rough statistics are that half of each of our bodies contains nitrogen

113
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.990
from the harbor process, knows really

114
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.800
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.750
<v 3>And so in 1918 fritz hopper gets a Nobel prize, but this is my,</v>

116
00:07:00.751 --> 00:07:03.660
this is such an interesting guy. Around the same time,

117
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:08.490
officials in the u s government are calling him a war criminal.

118
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.960
All right. Just to back up for one second, after harbor's nitrogen discovery,

119
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.420
he was promoted. You know,

120
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.580
he takes over the leadership of this institute in Berlin and he starts

121
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.930
hobnobbing with a whole different level of society that Stan Charles Again,

122
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.840
I mean, it's a pretty heady thing for, you know,

123
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.940
a Jewish kid from Breslau to be hobnobbing with the emperor and cabinet

124
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.080
ministers. He's part of the club and he really, really relished it.

125
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.170
And not just cause he was vain, which everyone agrees he was,

126
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.670
but because he loves his country. He loves the father land and he loves Germany.

127
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.340
So when World War One begins,

128
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.480
he signs up immediately sends a letter volunteering for duty saying,

129
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.610
you know the process that I use to make food.

130
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.690
Well I can use that same process to make explosives

131
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.880
because the thing that you put into the ground to grow more food is also the

132
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:06.560
thing you can explode to make a bomb.

133
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.000
That's correct because it takes such energy and pressure to separate it.

134
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.540
This try Vaillant bond is so strong that when it comes back together

135
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.830
at energy that's released,

136
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.420
it can be used for life or death.

137
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.980
In any case, back to World War One, there's trench warfare,

138
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:31.340
it gets bogged down and harbor has an idea.

139
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.240
It goes straight to the German high command and he and he pitches this idea.

140
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.140
He says, well,

141
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.670
we can drive those enemy soldiers out of trenches with gas.

142
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.630
Chlorine gas will basically bring it to the front and when the,

143
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.000
when the wind is right, we'll just spray it.

144
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.840
But the generals were not all that convinced now. They just didn't like it.

145
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.180
A lot of them were like, this is not how you fight a war.

146
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.580
It's like playing dirty. Yeah,

147
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.120
sort of unsportsmanlike but he organizes soldiers.

148
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:02.950
He organizes whole gas units and nobody even had to ask takes command of them.

149
00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:06.760
Partially he travels to the front and on April 22nd yeah,

150
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.480
<v 4>1950 1915 Hubbard finds himself in a little town in Belgium called e y.</v>

151
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.350
P. R. E. S actually the Americans called it Yips, whatever you call it.

152
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.380
This was one of the bloodiest arenas on the western front.

153
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.100
The Germans were on one side, the fringe,

154
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.540
the Canadians and the British on the other,

155
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.210
and they're behind the German lines is our, our, our friend, our friend of mine,

156
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.380
uh, for a topic, a friend of, he's bald, he has a pot belly.

157
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.540
He has these pos. Nez spectacles is chomping on a Virginian cigar.

158
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.180
He was always smoking these Virginian cigars and he's wearing a fur coat really?

159
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.120
And what is basically like the Baghdad of his time, but nobody

160
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.890
<v 3>had done what he was about to do on the scale that he was about to do it.</v>

161
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.260
So basically at 6:00 PM on April 22nd when the wind was just right,

162
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:02.550
he says harbors gas troops on unscrew, they opened the valve

163
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.610
<v 4>on almost 6,000 tanks containing 150 tons of chlorine.</v>

164
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.190
That's like an adult blue whale of chlorine. Just trying to imagine that.

165
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:16.990
Is that like a, like a green cloud?

166
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.050
Some people describe it as a cloud and then others describe it as this kind of

167
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:25.470
15 foot wall kind of hugging the land and it's just sort of approach and it's

168
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:31.090
moving at about one meter per second and according to some accounts as it crept

169
00:10:31.091 --> 00:10:32.230
across no man's land,

170
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.270
the leaves would just sort of shrivel and the grass was turning to the color of

171
00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:38.224
metal.

172
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.920
Birds would just fall from the air within minutes the gas reached the allied

173
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:45.640
side and as soon as it did,

174
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.590
soldiers began to convulse. They were gagging, they were choking,

175
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.830
hundreds of them were falling to the ground. What is the guest doing to them?

176
00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:01.090
Exactly. I think what it's doing is it's a, if you breathe it in,

177
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.080
it sort of irritates your lungs to the extent that they sort of filled up with

178
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.500
fluid so quickly that you sort of drown in your own Flamm.

179
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.070
So they weren't actually drowning, literally drowning on land. Wow.

180
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.990
Yellow Mucus was throbbing out of their mouth.

181
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.670
Those who could still breathe would turn blue.

182
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.920
This is the description of hell. Yeah.

183
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.730
But harbor solid has a wonderful success and wished,

184
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.010
wished that the Germans had been better prepared to exploit it because he felt

185
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:37.420
like they really could have made a terrific advance if they had had more

186
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:38.254
confidence

187
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.830
<v 3>and he is celebrated for it.</v>

188
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.160
He gets promoted to the rank of captain and he goes home for a few days a hero.

189
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.900
But when he gets there, he has to contend with his wife, Clara Emma Var.

190
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.900
Clara also from Breslau off also from a Jewish family and also a scientist. Huh.

191
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.970
Unusually so in those times she was actually a sort of a genius herself.

192
00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:07.800
She was one of the first women to earn a Ph d in her country.

193
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.600
And shortly after his return, Clara allegedly confronts him and says, look,

194
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.300
you are morally bankrupt. How could you? Um,

195
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.360
but Haber just kind of ignored her. And according to legend,

196
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.390
he actually threw a dinner party in celebration of the big victory,

197
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.300
invited his friends over. Now we don't actually know if he threw a party.

198
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.760
Like I consider that apocryphal. Dan doesn't think so.

199
00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:34.820
But what's clear is that he saw no reason to question what he had done.

200
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:39.821
And that infuriated Clara especially because she found out he was leaving the

201
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.460
next day to direct more gas attacks. And they probably had an argument. Yeah.

202
00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:45.980
And that was it. They had an argument. That's historian Fritz Stern,

203
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:49.730
who also happens to be fritz Hopper's Godson. They had a quarrel more than that,

204
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.630
let's call it a fight.

205
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.700
And later that night after the party harbor takes a bunch of sleeping pills,

206
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.660
goes to sleep. Um,

207
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.830
and she takes the service revolver,

208
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.910
Ventavis pistol walks outside to the garden and

209
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.090
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.923
<v 3>pulls the trigger,</v>

211
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.370
shoots herself in the chest and is found by her son,

212
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.810
by her son. Yes. Age to 18, I think. Uh,

213
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.430
and he finds her actually still alive with the life about to run out of her, uh,

214
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.700
harbor. It's unknown what happens for the rest of that evening,

215
00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:29.480
but it is a well-documented fact that the very next morning on schedule,

216
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.610
he goes back to the, to the front, to the eastern front, leaving

217
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.620
<v 2>his son, uh,</v>

218
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.940
alone with his dead mother.

219
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.130
<v 3>Oh, cold, Huh? Yeah. Heartless ed was a terrible moment.</v>

220
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.630
Did he run away? Was it duty?

221
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.870
The sign eventually after he emigrates to America

222
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.363
<v 2>kills himself.</v>

223
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:08.830
[inaudible] [inaudible]

224
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:09.880
<v 0>see now around this point,</v>

225
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.500
I just don't want to have anything to do with this guy. This is a,

226
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.220
I just want to take a shower. Walk away. Yeah.

227
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.743
<v 2>Yeah, me too.</v>

228
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.980
<v 0>You know, on the other hand, I mean,</v>

229
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:24.310
if you look at the grand calculus people he's had helped or fed versus people

230
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:26.500
he's killed. I mean, he's felt that billions of people.

231
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.320
I don't know that you could entirely call him bad.

232
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.350
I might even tilt towards saying he's a little good to be honest.

233
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:35.590
You wouldn't though, would you really?

234
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:39.010
Would you really think that this guy's a good guy? Honestly, yeah. You know,

235
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.570
just because of a mathematical summing up, we're talking billions of people.

236
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.580
He's standing there on the front pushing the gas into the lungs or other human

237
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.460
beings. It's merely, it's a war, but still. Then he goes and you know,

238
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.840
and celebrates that and then walks away from his child and his wife did in the

239
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:59.090
garden and says more of that, please. Well,

240
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:02.780
there's something distasteful about the fact that he was too into it,

241
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.410
but like I do think on some level you have to divorce the man from his deeds and

242
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.110
you've got to ask, is the world better with him or without him?

243
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.840
I think you've got to answer it with him. Right.

244
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.840
Well, should we keep going with the story? Yeah. Alright.

245
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.510
So Sam, what happened to this guy after World War One?

246
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.630
<v 1>He actually was very humiliated that Germany had lost and especially humiliated</v>

247
00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:36.081
over the fact that they had to pay enormous war reparations to other countries.

248
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.170
So he decided he was going to invent a process to pay for these reparations by

249
00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:47.190
himself. And what he decided to do is go into the ocean,

250
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.170
into sea water, which contains, um, uh,

251
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.090
very small levels of gold. But you know,

252
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.120
over the entire ocean there's a lot of gold dissolved into the sea and he spends

253
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:03.900
five years and a few tile effort to distill gold from the ocean's waters.

254
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.550
<v 0>Sounds insane. On the other hand, if anyone could do it,</v>

255
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.420
he was trying to repeat this master stroke. Needless to say, he fails.

256
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.550
It was actually a crushing blow for him, for him.

257
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.560
And then things really take a turn.

258
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.400
1933 comes and Hitler takes over.

259
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.760
And one of the first acts that the Nazis do is to basically issue in order that

260
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:31.560
says there shall be no Jews in the civil service. Now harbor was Jewish,

261
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.670
but because he'd served in World War One, he technically would be exempt,

262
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.580
but 75% of the people who worked for him at the institute,

263
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.940
they were Jewish and they would have to be dismissed.

264
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.650
So he decides to take a stand and says, this is intolerable.

265
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.720
I'm going to resign. He says that he's a,

266
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.410
he's always been hiring people based on how smart they are and not who their

267
00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:56.670
grandparents were. So he sends a letter to the Ministry of Education, resigning,

268
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.040
and he leaves Germany telling a friend. He felt like he'd lost his homeland.

269
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.490
And then he starts this period of roaming.

270
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.390
He eventually goes to England. But in a famous incident,

271
00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:13.050
one of England's leading scientists refuses to shake his hand.

272
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.900
And he is basically homeless at this point. You know,

273
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.600
he's a man adrift. Meanwhile, his health is failing.

274
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.130
In 1934 he takes a trip to Switzerland to a sanatorium,

275
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.240
but before he can get there, his heart fails and he dies.

276
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.540
<v 2>Mm.</v>

277
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.560
<v 0>Now there's a footnote to this that is very strange.</v>

278
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.580
Um, I got a little, uh,

279
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.810
less as my dorsal heres stood up when I read the end of this. Right.

280
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.080
So during World War One harbors institute had a formulation

281
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.420
<v 3>of, um,</v>

282
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.770
insect killing gas called Zyklon Zyklon a,

283
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.840
which was originally just a pesticide. And once again,

284
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:02.400
another nitrogen compound, it was developed in his institute. He knew about it.

285
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.060
In fact, his chemist had given this particular pesticide a smell. It was a,

286
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:09.960
it was a warning smell so that people didn't inadvertently breathe it in and get

287
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:13.080
sick. But after the Nazis take over, this is after he died,

288
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.260
they reached back to the shelf and they find this Zyklon stuff and they asked

289
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:25.041
for it to be reformulated to take out the warning smell and it becomes Zyklon B,

290
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.470
the killing gas of the concentration camps.

291
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.260
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

292
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.770
<v 0>did members of Hubbard's family die in the concentration camps? Yeah.</v>

293
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.900
Members of his extended family did.

294
00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:42.770
Certainly friends of his dead is something deeply,

295
00:18:42.771 --> 00:18:46.700
deeply wounding, stressing,

296
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.760
upsetting at the thought that he had anything to do with sibling and B,

297
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.460
but he did the use of it. He could never match.

298
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:21.330
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

299
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.770
<v 0>so how do you feel about him now? Because I don't know.</v>

300
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:28.920
I can't help it feel bad for the guy despite the chlorine gas.

301
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:33.070
Like he didn't intend for that to happen. He could have never imagined that. No.

302
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.180
What? But, but there's part of me that says, you know,

303
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.500
here's a guy who just wanted to do everything better than he had ever been done

304
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:45.090
before, whether it was feeding or killing. And he does, and he does,

305
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.540
but he does it with a kind of immoral athleticism. You know, he,

306
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.310
he does it without humility, without, without a lot of doubt. And you know,

307
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.183
it's a craft,

308
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.690
but it's a craft with consequences and to approach it with kind of crazy joy.

309
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.730
I don't know.

310
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:07.350
I would rather have scientists who carry doubt with them as they proceed.

311
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.940
Yeah, I agree with that. Maybe it's all about doubting.
