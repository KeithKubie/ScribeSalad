00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:01.924
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do
in this video is think about

00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:04.260
how does the value of an expression change

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.409
as a variable that makes
up that expression changes?

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:09.930
So, let's start with a
pretty simple expression.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.566
Let's say we have the
expression 100 minus x.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.699
We wanna know how does
this expression change

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.917
as x increases?

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.619
As x increases and like always,

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.265
try to work it out for yourself.

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.217
Pause the video before I
try to have a go at it.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.547
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:30.961
You say, "Okay, I have 100
and I'm subtracting x."

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:35.127
So, as x increases, as
x increases over here,

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:39.169
I'm going to be subtracting
larger and larger values.

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:42.054
So, if I'm subtracting
larger and larger values,

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:44.451
I'm going to get smaller
and smaller values.

00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:47.763
So, this whole thing, this whole
thing is going to decrease.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:50.262
This whole thing is going to decrease

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:53.546
and if you wanna make it a
little bit more concrete,

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.517
you can actually try
out some values there.

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:56.878
So, you can make a little table here.

00:00:56.878 --> 00:01:00.474
X and then, what is 100 - x going to be?

00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:02.140
I'm just gonna pick some values of x.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.684
I'm gonna make them increase.

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:08.032
Say, x is zero, x is 50, x is 100.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:11.425
Well, when an x is zero,
100 - x is 100 - zero.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:12.807
So, it's 100.

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:14.818
When x is 50, it's going be 100 - 50,

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:16.525
so it's going to be 50.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:19.836
When x is 100, it's 100
- 100, so it's zero.

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:23.534
So, it's pretty clear here
that as x is increasing,

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:28.491
as x is increasing, I'll just
write incr. for increasing,

00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:33.042
we see that 100 - x is decreasing.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.318
We see that that is decreasing.

00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:37.451
Let's do this with a
couple more expressions

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:39.138
that have different forms.

00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:42.165
So, let's say that I have the expression.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:47.165
Let's say that I have the
expression five over x

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:51.368
plus five and x is decreasing,

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:55.310
x is decreasing, but we also know that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.256
it is positive and even
while it's decreasing,

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.735
it's staying above zero.

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:05.407
So, we're saying x is
staying greater than zero.

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.602
So, in this case, so ya know,
this could be a situation

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.731
where x is decreasing from 10 to nine

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:15.731
or a million to 100,000,
but it's staying positive

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.255
while it's decreasing.

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:18.901
Let's think about that.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.309
We are going to be dividing
by smaller and smaller

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.321
positive values.

00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.384
So, as you have smaller
and smaller positive values

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:31.693
of the denominator, you're
dividing by smaller and smaller

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.073
positive values.

00:02:33.073 --> 00:02:35.858
So, if you're dividing by
smaller positive values,

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:38.722
you're going to know that this
thing is going to get larger.

00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:41.038
This entire expression
is going to get larger

00:02:41.038 --> 00:02:43.558
as you divide by smaller
and smaller positive values.

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:44.776
So, if that expression gets larger,

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.382
then you're just adding five to it.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.575
The whole thing is going to increase.

00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:52.639
The whole thing is going to increase as,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.322
the whole thing is going
to increase as x decreases

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:56.987
while staying positive.

00:02:56.987 --> 00:02:58.917
And once again, we can
make a little table to

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.360
take a look at that.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360
So, this is x, this is
five over x plus five.

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.609
Now, let's see. I'll just try out some.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.609
Let's see, I'll go from
x 100 to x is five,

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:17.853
to x is one.

00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:20.453
So, this is clearly x is decreasing.

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:21.834
X is decreasing.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.460
When x is 100, you're gonna have five

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.938
divided by 100, which
would be five hundredths

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:29.595
plus five, so it would be 5.05.

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:33.456
When x is five, you're gonna
have five divided by five,

00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:37.803
which is one plus five, which is six.

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:41.115
When x is one, you're gonna
have five divided by one,

00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:42.212
which is five plus five.

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:43.472
You just, it's 10.

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:46.499
So notice, when x is staying
positive, but decreasing,

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.571
the whole expression,
five over x plus five,

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:52.168
this thing right over here is increasing.

00:03:53.428 --> 00:03:55.653
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:58.274
So, let's say that we have the expression

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.082
and we'll change up the variable here.

00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:04.511
3y over 2y and I'm curious what happens

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.461
to the value of this expression

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:11.461
as y increases, as y increases.

00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:18.634
Well, as you have larger
y's here on the numerator,

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:20.585
you're also going to have larger y's here

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:21.905
in the denominator

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:23.205
and one way you could think about this,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:25.278
this is the same thing as three halves

00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:28.407
times y over y.

00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.377
And no matter what y you have here,

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:32.978
as long as it's not equal to zero

00:04:32.978 --> 00:04:34.179
and actually, let's just
assume that it doesn't

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:35.724
cross zero because at that point,

00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:39.382
at that point, this thing
would become undefined.

00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:40.701
Let's just say that y increases

00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:43.342
and y is greater than
zero just for simplicity.

00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:47.223
So, y is a positive value here

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:50.494
and actually, for any non-zero value,

00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:52.059
you take y, you divide by y,

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.379
you're just gonna get one.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.720
So, it doesn't matter what y is.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.081
Y could be a million over a million.

00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:57.158
This thing is just gonna be one.

00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:58.316
Y could be five over five,

00:04:58.316 --> 00:04:59.840
it's still just going to be one.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.628
The value of the expression
is not going to change.

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:03.721
It's just going to be three halves.

00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:06.585
So, the expression is
just going to be the same.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:08.698
You're not going to have any change

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:13.073
as y increases, as y is
positive and it increases.
