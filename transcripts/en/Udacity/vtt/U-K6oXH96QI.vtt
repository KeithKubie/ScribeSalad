00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.380
Welcome to the coding portions of lesson three. In this

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.531
lesson, we're going to learn how to use Objectify to

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:09.932
save entities in the datastore. We're going to use entities of

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.580
kind profile to save user profile information. And we're going to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790
learn how to get the user ID of a logged

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.690
in user to use it to generate a unique ID

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.680
for the entity's key. Once we've created some data and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.830
saved it in the datastore, we're going to use the Datastore Viewer

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.330
in the Admin Console to look at the data that we've saved. Make sure that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.550
it saved like we thought it would. And

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.900
there's no point putting data into the datastore

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.100
if you can't get it back out. So then we're going to learn how to get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.070
an entity out of the datastore if you

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.370
know its key. Let's go create some profiles.
