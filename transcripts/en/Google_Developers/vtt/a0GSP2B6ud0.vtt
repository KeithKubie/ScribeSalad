00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:01.970
So as [INAUDIBLE]
said, thank you.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.140
My name is Brahim, a
Lead Product Manager

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.700
for monetization, search, and
discovery on the Play Store.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.600
So I had a lot of talks, also,
about your questions earlier

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.350
in the morning, so maybe we'll
get to talk about them later.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.820
But yeah, so today, I'm going to
talk to you about making money

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.450
on Google Play.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.116
Monetization on Google
Play is something

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.899
that's obviously top
of mind for developers

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.440
and that I have been personally
working on for the past three

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.570
years of my life.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.609
And so it's a very
exciting topic for me.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.650
All right, so what we're
going to try to do today

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.900
is give you some insights,
data driven insights.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.010
So we'll share some
numbers that will hopefully

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.280
help you make decisions as you
run your businesses, as you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760
build your apps, as you grow
your businesses-- globally,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.384
hopefully, as you will see
the theme of the presentation.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.800
We'll hopefully
give you some data

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.230
that can help you
make decisions.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.050
So that's the point
of the presentation.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.330
So I just have to
reiterate this point.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.520
I know Michael presented
it, and a few other people

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.200
referred to it.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.860
But having been
here for three years

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.540
and seeing how far we've
come in monetization,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.269
it's incredibly exciting for
me and the rest of the team.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.920
The fact that we've
paid out $5 billion

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040
to developers over the
last 12 months is amazing.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.260
And the more amazing
thing is that we all

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.580
feel like we're just getting
started, that the ceiling is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.950
actually much higher, if at all.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.940
And so we're super
excited about this.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.080
We could not have done it
without all of your work.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.982
And we're super, super
excited about what's

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.940
going to happen next and
the announcement we'll

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.580
make next year at
Playtime London,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.880
hopefully, if we get good
feedback on this one.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.930
The after lunch crowd is
always difficult, so I get it.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.730
I'm just-- but
this is what I got.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.050
OK, so the way we think
about monetization

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.960
is there are different roles.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.240
And in a way, whatever happens
within your app, whatever

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.750
happens in terms of your
pricing is really up to you.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.290
And there's one point
where a user decides

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.160
to up their experience with you.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.670
They want to go into a
premium state of interaction

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.160
with your app, and they
press that Buy button.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.950
Or maybe it'll say the price,
whatever the way you build it.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.139
And so as a user
presses that Buy button,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.240
that interaction
jumps over to Play.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.980
And our goal and what
we do on a daily basis

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.120
is to make sure that we
convert as many of those clicks

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.730
as we can-- wherever the user
is, no matter what the amount

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.610
they're trying to buy, no
matter what app they came from.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.250
So we're trying to
build tools for you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.820
to convert those users, right?

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.780
And I know-- my wife
has a small business.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.510
And on weekends, I go to try
and help her sell pillows.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.240
She designs and builds pillows.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.500
And it is so hard to get someone
to hand over their cash to you.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.090
To actually pull out their
wallet and give you their money

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.167
is incredibly hard.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:46.250
And so when someone presses
the button in your app

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.209
to actually make a
purchase, it's a huge step.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.750
And so we want to make sure we
convert as many of those users

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.950
as possible.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.830
So the rest of the presentation
will keep this in mind-- things

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.180
that we're doing, and
things that you can do.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.420
This is how we'll get
through the rest of the talk.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.840
Stepping back a bit
and talking about how

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.650
does a developer, or
as an entrepreneur,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.360
more generally build a
business, you generally

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.930
have an insight that's driven
based on your experience.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.470
It's what you know best,
the language you speak,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.754
the market and need that you're
particularly familiar with.

00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:20.920
And so you start a business.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.430
It's based probably
somewhere-- in your case,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.650
maybe in Europe, or the Middle
Eastern and North Africa.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.120
And then from
there, you're going

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.430
to look for another market.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.390
You look for a market
that's somewhat similar.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.000
Maybe another Western country.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.805
Maybe a market that has
similar user patterns.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:39.180
And then from
there, you're going

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.596
to go to another
market that maybe

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:42.870
is even more
different than yours.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.710
And all of sudden, the amazing
thing is, all of a sudden,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.890
you are a global developer.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.330
You're running a
global business.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.370
And in the, past this used
to be a monumental event.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.840
This used to be
like when GM started

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
getting most of their
sales from outside the US.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.740
It was like management
changes, and the way

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.940
the company does
things just change.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.042
And today, it happens so
quickly that a lot of developers

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:08.500
actually don't
change their mindset

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.637
as they become
global developers.

00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:12.470
And so what I want to
talk to you about next

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.770
is how do you actually
change your mindset, what

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.910
are things you can do as
you transition from being

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.579
a primarily local market
developer to becoming

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.839
a global developer.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.140
And so we'll share some
data to hopefully help you,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.340
again, make those decisions.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.060
But this shift in
mindset is important.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.490
And actually in digital,
it's happening, obviously,

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.474
much faster.

00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:34.890
It's a lot more seamless because
you have these platforms,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.390
inside Google Play,
that immediately

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.340
have buyers in 130 markets.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.800
And so because it's so
seamless, a lot of times,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.600
you actually don't shift the way
you think about your business

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.520
because it just happens
without you knowing.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.020
And all of a sudden, you
have buyers in 50 markets,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.210
or you have even users
in even more markets.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.310
And so just something that
I would love to highlight

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.750
and I'll talk about more next.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.753
So obviously, we
believe that Google Play

00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:00.600
is an incredibly
good platform for you

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.621
to expand your
businesses globally.

00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.620
And what's exciting to
us is when we look at you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.680
as developers that earn most
of their income from abroad,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.750
those developers are earning
2.5x what their equivalents who

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.870
aren't are, right?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.550
So if you're taking
that jump-- and this

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.800
is the majority of your sales.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.240
This isn't about I have 1% or
2% or 10% or 20% of my income

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.690
coming from other markets.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.230
This is the majority of your
sales are coming from abroad.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.670
When that happens, when you can
jump over that virtual fence,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.455
you're earning
actually a lot more.

00:05:36.455 --> 00:05:38.080
And the point here,
as you can imagine,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.550
is that you should all try that.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.630
You should all do it,
because it's profitable.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.980
And what's cool is that
over the past year,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.090
we've seen 38%
growth in developers

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.950
who are doing just that.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.024
They are taking advantage
of the global audience.

00:05:51.024 --> 00:05:52.440
They're taking
advantage of buyers

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.740
that we have in 130 markets.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.170
And the data that
we'll go to next

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.160
will hopefully show
you, one, is how,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.040
and what are we doing to
make sure you're successful.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.170
But this point about
developers that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.970
are earning most of
their income from abroad

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.060
are earning significantly more.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.060
And we'd love for you,
hopefully with the help

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.640
of some of the data we'll share,
to actually intentionally focus

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.140
on that.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.110
So what have we been up to?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.710
So obviously, you may know this.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.780
But free apps are distributed
in a 190 plus countries.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.920
We have buyers in
130 plus markets.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.490
And in 65 markets
now, you can custom

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.530
tailor your pricing, which
we will talk about later

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.330
is actually an
important aspect of you

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.200
being present in that market.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.210
Tailoring your pricing to a
local market is important.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.380
So that's step one.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.900
We're a global platform.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.140
I think everybody
understands that.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.782
Next is interestingly
something that we've

00:06:48.782 --> 00:06:50.240
learned over the
past few years, is

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.440
that as you go out there and
try to build a global payments

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.090
platform, you actually
have to think very locally.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.880
There is no silver bullet.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.310
There's no payment method
that works everywhere.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.100
There's no easy way to do this.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.740
You just have to go
into each market.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.240
You have to understand
that market--

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.640
the behavior, the
purchase experience, what

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.450
people are most familiar with.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.620
And then you have to build
a product that works there.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.440
And so in the US,
as you'd imagine,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.240
credit cards are very popular.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.120
That is the primary way
that people want to buy.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.630
In Japan, carrier billing
is extremely popular.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.100
And so these are two incredibly
important markets for us

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.220
that behave in
completely different ways

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.990
when it comes to payments.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.040
And so again, we had
to go in and start

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.460
thinking very locally.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.290
And this replicates to
every other market almost.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.510
Every other country,
actually, is this way.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.082
There's a distinction
in behavior.

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:46.790
So what do we do?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.140
So one of things we've done
over the past couple of years--

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.280
so two years ago, we launched
Google Play gift card

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.050
in the US only.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.340
Today, it is in 18 markets.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.670
And I think as of
maybe this morning,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.340
it's in its 19th market.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.480
So we've been very
aggressively rolling

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.870
out the Google Play gift card.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.090
It's been very successful
for us, because one,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.590
it unlocks new segment of users
that just don't-- they just

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.310
don't have access to credit
cards or other kinds of more

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.120
fluid forms of payment.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.600
And two, it gets
the brand out there,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.150
and it gets users-- this
is in the physical world.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.630
This is in retailers.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.500
This is in tens of
thousands of locations

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.540
that we now have the
Google Play brand known.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.800
And your users, while they
are in their usual day-to-day

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.260
habits, they're seeing
the Google Play gift card.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.230
The other one is
direct carrier billing,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.190
which has been very
successful for us.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.299
And it is now in 25 markets,
as Michael [INAUDIBLE] earlier.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.662
And finally, PayPal, which
we launched more recently--

00:08:43.662 --> 00:08:45.370
it's been very successful
for us as well.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.030
It's now in 12 markets and
rolling out to more shortly.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.670
So again, these
are current stats.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.210
They're changing constantly.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.190
But the objective
is as a user comes

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.320
in from any of your
countries, any users

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.924
that you have in any
markets, as they come in,

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:03.340
the objective is
that they'll find

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.700
an option on their
purchase experience

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.160
that is familiar to them
that they want to use.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.760
We want to reduce that hurdle.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.390
So this is a major
part of what I do

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.630
and what the entire team
at Google Play does.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.490
And I'll give you a
bit of a case study

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.732
about the launch of the Google
Play gift card in Germany.

00:09:21.732 --> 00:09:23.190
And this will give
you some insight

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.175
about our overall
strategy for payments.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.970
OK, so as we launched the
Google Play gift card,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.409
over the past year, we had
70% increase in buyers.

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:39.200
This is tremendous.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.820
This is like step
change type stuff.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.320
And if you look at-- a lot of
you are potentially developers

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.730
already selling in Germany, you
would have seen that impact.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.860
And so the launch
of a form of payment

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.660
that is convenient
to a market, that

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.230
is familiar to
users in a market,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.340
has a significant impact.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.630
So the interesting
thing is what did this

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.589
do to the rest of the
purchase flow conversion rate?

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:01.880
Actualy, it increased our
purchase flow conversion rate

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.379
by 25%.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.330
So more of those clicks that
are coming from your apps

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.700
are converted-- to
be clear, 25% more.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.500
And that's huge.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.230
That is incredibly significant
for all of you who are actually

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.380
closing more of those sales
and completing those sales.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.330
And finally, what
this does overall--

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.350
because at the
end of the day, we

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.420
care about overall
sales in the country.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.880
And that actually had
a 3x impact on sales.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.510
So over the last year, sales
in Germany have grown by 3x.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.640
And while this is tied to a
number of things-- including

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.920
growth in Android,
including the availability

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.300
of preferred methods, and the
increase in the conversion

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.160
rate-- this is a
trend that we want

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.500
to see more and more markets in.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.780
We activate the buyers, we
launch good forms of payment,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.921
and then we see an increase
in revenue like this.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.420
This is a success
story that we want

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.780
to replicate in many,
many more countries.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.390
For example, we launched
carrier billing and gift cards

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.740
in Hong Kong.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.040
And in that country, we had
an 80% growth in buyers.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.960
In Russia, we launched
carrier billing,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.750
and we had 100% growth
in number of buyers.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.880
So again, we're
hoping that this will

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.790
be replicated in every market.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.160
And we're working very hard
to make sure that we do.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.084
Shifting a bit to the
purchase experience

00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:29.500
is not only about the forms
of payment available, but also

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.110
where they are available.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.110
And this was-- I always
thought of this as a gap

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.560
where on tablets, carrier
billing was not available.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.960
And just maybe I'll step
back and say carrier billing

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.620
is when you're able to
buy something and put it

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.030
on your operator bill,
your monthly operator bill.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.710
And it was not
available in tablets

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.044
because you could imagine
the setup experience requires

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.460
you to be on the
phone that you're

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.850
going to bill the stuff to.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.147
But we've built new technology
over the past couple

00:11:56.147 --> 00:11:57.980
of years that allowed
us to actually now run

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.170
carrier billing
from Wi-Fi tablets.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.910
And so if you're a user that
primarily uses carrier billing,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.707
and you're on your phone, when
you went to the tablet before,

00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:08.290
you actually couldn't
make a purchase.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.500
You didn't have an
available form of payment.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.770
Today they can, and that's
had a significant impact

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.759
on monetization on
that device segment.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:17.050
So that's been really exciting.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.410
Another thing that
we have learned

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.670
is that locally developed
content is extremely important.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.400
It kind of triggers
the entire ecosystem.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.790
And we've worked really
hard over the past year

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.670
to enable developers in
more and more countries

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.182
to be able to sell
on Google Play.

00:12:36.182 --> 00:12:38.640
And this may not impact all of
you, because if you're here,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.450
you're probably already
a successful developer.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.300
Maybe a dozen-- I've talked
to someone from Bulgaria.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.690
But essentially, we've
launched 22 new markets.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.559
We're at 54 markets today.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.100
And our objective--
this is something

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.900
that we really care about
at the mission level.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.460
We want to make sure
that anyone that

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.350
can build an awesome
Android application,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.490
no matter where they are,
they can earn a living

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.800
on Google Play.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.170
It's that simple.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.780
Anyone anywhere
should be able to earn

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.330
a living on Google Play.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.085
And so we're at 54 countries.

00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:10.460
We're going to
continue to launch

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.290
more and more of these markets
over the next few months.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.350
All right, so what can
you do to make sure

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.800
that you're taking advantage
of this global platform?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.040
This is hopefully the
actionable part for you.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.150
First of all is
localizing your listings.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.020
This is incredibly important.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.260
Now, of course, you can't
localize to every language.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.580
But if you are intentionally
selling in a market,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.620
if you're intentionally
acquiring users

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.910
through ads in a
market, if you want

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.590
to grow your
business in a market,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.210
you have to actually speak
that country's language.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.030
It is an absolute,
just basic thing

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.500
that many developers don't
actually do, unfortunately.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.090
And the Developer Console
offers all sorts of tools

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.960
to make this really
accessible for developers.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.296
So whether you're using
professional translation tools

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.670
or you're actually using the
Developer Console one, which

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.680
gets routed to professionals,
that is really important.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.900
And the data we're seeing is
that apps that are localized,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.260
that have localized listings,
are earning 6x more than those

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.520
that aren't.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.480
So it's very actionable.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.640
Of course, you can't
translate to every country,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.620
every language.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.370
But if you are
intentionally in a market,

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.780
you have to speak
their language.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.150
The other part is
localizing your pricing.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.550
And this is, again-- it's one
of those simple things that

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.121
the local developers do
that the foreign ones don't.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.620
And this is one of those things
that end up impacting sales.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.930
And then you launch in a market.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.013
You're like, I don't know.

00:14:37.013 --> 00:14:39.060
I can't crack this
market for some reason.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.435
But it's because
of little things

00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:43.370
like this, where we have
this incredibly convenient

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.355
auto-convert function
that a lot developers go

00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:48.459
in, they set their default
price, auto-convert.

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:50.750
And then actually, you don't
go through all the prices,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.720
and make sure they
are just rounded off.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.450
They are whatever that
$0.99 equivalent is.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.230
We all know the
$0.99 price in the US

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.710
has been for decades
a price point

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.480
that we know is like, OK, below
which, it's a trivial purchase,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.188
or it's a significant
purchase-- whatever

00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:07.330
it is you're targeting.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.420
But there are equivalents of
those prices in each market.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.520
So again, 101 Yen
is not one of those.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.067
It's 100 Yen.

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:17.900
And as you come through
that purchase flow--

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.480
and you've all probably
optimized your flows--

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.880
every little detail impacts
your conversion rate.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.340
And what we've seen here is that
apps and SKUs with prices that

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.160
are local precise local pricing
actually convert and have 2x

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.219
the sales of those that aren't.

00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:37.010
So this is, again, a
very actionable thing.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.210
Just go through your
pricing, and literally

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.045
make sure it's rounded off.

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:44.670
But in some cases, you actually
have to change it significantly

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.020
because spending patterns
in different markets

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.970
are different, obviously.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.180
So this is another small thing.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.790
The other thing is localizing
your business model.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.500
It is actually important that
based on your category of app

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.290
as well as what market
you're targeting,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.010
the intersection
of those two things

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.850
might mean you have
a different business

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.920
model in different countries.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.680
There are countries where ads
is the primary way of market

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.870
monetizing.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.770
There are others where
in-app is the way to go.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.980
For some app categories,
it is subscriptions.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.910
Others obviously are
paid apps or in-app.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.680
So again-- and this
is one of those

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.710
you have to take care
of at the beginning,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.945
as you build your app, as
you build your feature set.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.320
If it's a
subscription, there has

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.925
to be ongoing
value for the user.

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:32.690
There has to be recurring value.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.520
If you are doing
an in-app, then you

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.420
have to have some
incremental discrete steps

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.430
that a user can purchase.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.100
So again, as you
think through, think

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.700
about localizing your
business models as well.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.230
So I'm going to talk a little
bit more about subscriptions.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.850
We've been investing in
subscriptions quite a bit.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.000
We've seen it be very
successful for apps

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.790
in a number of categories.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.880
And growth, since launch,
has been tremendous.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.680
And so we've actually been
investing quite a bit in it.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.849
As of a couple days ago,
we launched a number

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.960
of new features
for subscriptions,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.150
including seasonal
subscriptions;

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.380
goodwill credits, where
basically, if somebody's really

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.530
not happy, you an give them
an extra month for free

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.589
via an API; and
also an API for you

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:22.470
to refund or revoke
subscription access.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.190
The last upgrades/downgrades
are going

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.202
to launch in the next few weeks.

00:17:26.202 --> 00:17:27.660
So what we're trying
to do is build

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.250
a full-fledged
subscriptions platform

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.810
that is accessible via
APIs that offers you-- we

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.310
take care of all the billing.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.776
We take care of all the
details of auto-renewing.

00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:41.010
And if it is something
that works for your app,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.500
if you think that you have
recurring value for users

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.321
over time, then it's
something to consider.

00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:48.820
And we have seen
apps that have been

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.520
successful in all
sorts of categories,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.740
from education to gaming to
the traditional like music

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.060
and Evernote type of
apps use subscriptions

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.560
and be very
successfully monetizing.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.930
And so again, think
of subscriptions.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:08.290
It is a fast-growing
segment for us.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.600
This was brought
up earlier as well,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.870
which is this focus on quality.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.640
And I wanted to reiterate the
point about those multipliers

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.920
are incredible, right?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.930
I mean, if you are moving one
star up from the three star

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.580
range to the four
star range, you're

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.360
actually multiplying
your sales by four.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.140
And so as you think
about investing in QA,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.920
investing in replying to
reviews, investing in building

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.520
the right product,
this stuff matters

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.340
and has a direct
impact on your sales.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.947
So you're business owners.

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:45.530
You need to do the
math and figure out

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.250
if it adds up for you or not.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.050
But this is hopefully
a metric that

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.390
can help you make that decision.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.614
Is it worth it for you?

00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:54.030
And I think the
point we're trying

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.900
to make is that it
very much is worth it.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.540
OK, so this is, again,
along the lines of quality,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.690
but it's about other
form factors, right?

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.560
And then Android, over
the last of couple months,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.870
we've launched a
number of new form

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.960
factors, a number
of new ecosystems.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.550
And the point here
is that if you're

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.690
going to distribute in a
particular form factor,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:21.569
whether it's atuo or wear or
tablets or TV, you have to,

00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:22.860
again, be intentional about it.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.735
You have to actually
build an experience that

00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:26.920
fits that form factor.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.440
As part of that, we're
seeing that apps that are

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.210
tablet-optimized are actually
monetizing 10 times better than

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.900
those that aren't.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.550
This stuff, again, matters.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.560
And you're business owners.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.120
You're looking to spend
your resources wisely.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.200
So again, if you're
going to spin off a team

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.932
to build a
tablet-optimized app, this

00:19:45.932 --> 00:19:47.390
is the multiplier
you need to think

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.830
of as you look at
your increasing

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:54.100
costs versus the potential
increase in reward and sales.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.210
And I think as these new
ecosystems proliferate

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:02.320
and as new form factors emerge,
be intentional about it.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.690
And that will help with your
sales, as you can see here.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:13.740
OK, so in closing
and in summary,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.950
three points to
really take away.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.970
One is think beyond
your familiar markets.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.650
Really just do that.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.990
I know many of you do.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.490
But there is this
mental shift that

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.490
used to happen in physical
world corporations

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.960
where they go global.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.730
And I think now,
it happens so fast

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.250
and it's so seamless that
a lot of app developers

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.930
don't actually think
about it and actually

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.820
shift their behavior
accordingly.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.720
So whether it is localizing
your listings, localizing

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.090
your pricing, et cetera, be
intentional about these things.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.610
And that's the second
point I just covered.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.950
And finally, focus on quality
and other form factors.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.450
Make sure that if
you are actually

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.110
going to submit your
app for tablets,

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.000
make sure it is a
great experience.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.880
Make sure you build
something tailored for it.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.930
And users will react well, and
users will increase their spend

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.340
in your app because of that.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.160
That's all I have for you.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.220
Thank you very much.
