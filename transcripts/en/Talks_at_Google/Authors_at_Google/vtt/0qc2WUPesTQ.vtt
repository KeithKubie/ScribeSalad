00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.560
MARK MOFFETT: Bella,
thank you so much.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm an escape artist.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
I guess everyone at Google
is a form of escape artist,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.380
but I escape to remote
places all the time.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.430
If you want to find your
way to some tribal group

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.870
or see the world's weirdest
slug, just talk to me.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.210
I'll find the answers
that you need.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
And over the years,
I've just continued

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.650
to do what I did when
I was a child, which

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.600
is just look for things I
like, wherever they are.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.820
And Geographic has given
me opportunities for that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
and other research venues.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
And I just keep going.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.360
And during all that time, I've
spent a fair amount of days

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
with both creatures that
have interesting societies

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.769
and human tribal groups
and hunter-gatherer groups.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.790
And I began to think about
how those groups form and stay

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.980
together over time,
and what that means.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.240
So for the last six
years, I've been a hermit.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.970
Melissa has put up with
me being at home in front

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.170
of the computer, too often.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570
She's in the back, there.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.230
We'll give her
round of applause,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.240
so we can not have to
repeat it at the end.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.730
And so I have been Mr.
Boring for too long.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.090
When this book is out, which
was yesterday, I will disappear.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.810
I'm giving you the chance to
see me, then I'm like Flash--

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.170
out of here.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.930
Well, I'm stuck giving
a few more talks.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.730
But in any case, this is a book
now called "The Human Swarm,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.090
How Our Societies Arise,
Thrive, And Fall."

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.690
And we all know what a human
society is, but in brief, it's

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.890
a well-defined group
with specific members,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.290
with a strong feeling of
allegiance, and often a feeling

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.490
that you can fight for and
even die for that group.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.500
Societies last through
the generations,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.727
and we expect membership
in them to be involuntary.

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:18.560
And when you think of
societies in that way,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
you'll see that a number of
animals have societies, too--

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.710
meerkats, for example.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.550
And then there are insects with
societies, like the honeybee.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.190
And what makes societies
alike and different?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.330
And what this says
about humans is really

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.150
what this book is about.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.570
And to get this in
a nutshell, I want

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.450
you to consider the most
remarkable thing in the world.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.520
It is across the
street from Google.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.340
It is a Starbucks.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.640
Now, you can walk
into a Starbucks

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.810
and not instantly want to kill
everyone, run away in terror,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.000
or at least walk up
to every individual

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.520
and find out who they are
and what they're doing.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.210
This is something
pretty unique to humans

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.370
across the vertebrate animals.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.700
A chimpanzee could not do this.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.040
A chimpanzee would
go on a killing spree

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.080
or just try to get out of
there as fast as possible.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.070
The difference is that chimps
do not allow for strangers,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.610
whereas humans can deal with
strangers, hundreds of them,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.520
and of course, in New York,
potentially tens of thousands

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.750
of them a day.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.130
And nothing bad happens.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.710
So how did this come about?

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.520
I argue that this
is a pivotal turning

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.000
point in human evolution
that's been really ignored.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.090
And it's a part
of our brain that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.330
eventually led to the
possibility of having nations.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.040
Now, to give you a reference
point for the argument,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.840
I'm going to speak to the Social
Brain Hypothesis, which has

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.033
gotten a fair amount of news.

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:09.200
You've probably heard of it.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.280
It's this idea you can
have about 150 friends,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.560
and this is an assessment
based on our brain size.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.560
Chimpanzees can have a
smaller number of allies.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.620
Humans can have more.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.590
The idea is that our brains
are largely big in order

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.140
to increase our social
networks, because they're

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.910
so expensive to maintain.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.420
But the idea ends
up with a problem.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.560
And Robert Dunbar, who
came up with this notion,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.690
addressed this problem
or at least mentioned it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.110
when he first proposed it.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.660
And that is shown here.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.530
It's from this original paper.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.250
"How is it that, despite the
apparent cognitive constraints

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.970
on group size, modern human
societies are nonetheless

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.025
able to form super-large
groups, nation states."

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.800
What is it about us?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.105
What holds us together?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.470
So I just want you to think
about this immense breakthrough

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.080
in our past.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.550
It seems so simple,
and it's ended up

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.930
allowing a huge number of people
to be together, and assess

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.470
each other, and even
relate across societies.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.520
At the same time, it's given
us all kinds of social baggage

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.745
that we have to deal with.

00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:33.370
And yet, I don't
think we're ever going

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.607
to be able to lose societies.

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:36.190
There's some arguments
that we should,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.398
but it's not going to happen.

00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:41.460
Societies give us a sense
of meaning and validation,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.940
and they're a yearning
that's very, very

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.830
basic to our psychology.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.120
It's deeply rooted within us.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.081
Thanks so much.

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.027
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.180
I went a couple of minutes long,
but are there any questions

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.492
out there?

00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:01.700
AUDIENCE: Hi there, Dr. Mark.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.410
Thanks so much for
that presentation.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.223
It was really
interesting to learn

00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:07.640
the parts you talked about
identifying different societies

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.900
in humans and others.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.120
It made me think that
is it true for humans

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.360
that what purpose or
benefit of a human society

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.060
is the ability to make
assumptions about the person

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.712
that you identify in it?

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.970
MARK MOFFETT: Yes, and those
are, of course, biases.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.990
And those kind of biases are
linked to our categorization

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.310
of others.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.948
And I didn't go
into those issues,

00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:31.490
but a big part of
the book is looking

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.330
at how those categorizations
work, which include not just

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.390
societies, but now ethnic
groups and races within them.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.360
So we take a continuum and carve
it up very, very efficiently,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.710
and we don't allow
for intermediates.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.860
We make assumptions about
who belongs and who doesn't.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.600
AUDIENCE: So humans
seem to engage

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.390
in an interesting
activity, whereby

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.640
we go to other societies.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.520
And they see us being different,
and they don't kill us.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.320
And sometimes, we buy things
from them, like tourism.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.450
Are we the only species that
does something like that,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.030
or do you see that
in other animals,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.450
even if they're invertebrates?

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.050
MARK MOFFETT: No, invertebrates
don't do that at all.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.760
Invertebrates are all about us.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.320
They kill them.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.320
Humans are amazing for
the degree of our ability

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.130
to take in other
identities and assess them

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.920
as potential partners.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.090
And things like bonobos can get
together and groom each other,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.340
but they don't form an alliance
to take over the third bonobo

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.060
troop over there
that they don't like

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.980
or to figure out how
to collect something

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.640
from a tree or anything.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.320
None of these alliance type
things that happen in humans

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.840
are found anywhere else.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.110
The closest possibility
are the sperm whales,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.690
where two societies can
apparently get together

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.390
and hunt together more
efficiently sometimes

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.920
for squid-- they eat squid--

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.230
than they can separately.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.090
So they may be able to work
together in the sperm whale.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.573
But it's obviously
a big cognitive leap

00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:06.365
and an interesting part
of the whole story.

00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:07.640
AUDIENCE: Mark?

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.600
MARK MOFFETT: Yeah?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.570
AUDIENCE: Do ant colonies at war
allocate resources differently,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.683
or is it just a boundary
condition between colonies?

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:17.100
MARK MOFFETT: Ant
colonies at war?

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.868
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:20.690
MARK MOFFETT: They
don't allocate.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.770
We don't know that.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.050
That'd be interesting to know.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.900
What is clear is that
warfare arises in ants.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.443
And in fact, I did an article
for "Scientific American"

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.360
on ants and the art of
war, showing that there

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.280
are all kinds of parallels.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.360
And the very
existence of warfare,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.299
which is a mass phenomenon where
both sides face catastrophe--

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.570
so it's not a one sided thing.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.320
If you look at war-- and that's
what we usually mean by war--

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.070
those kinds of
aggression occur when

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.130
societies get tens of
thousands or bigger

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.170
in both humans and ants.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.410
And once you have more and more
individuals in the society,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.330
the per capita cost goes down.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.860
There are lots of
studies showing that.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.380
And so you end up
with this labor pool,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.300
and you just sit around and be
used for things like battles

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.210
or, in the case of
humans, diverted

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.767
into arts and sciences.

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:17.600
Luckily, we don't just
use them for battles.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.320
But arguably, you need
a large population.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.680
But whether they allocate things
differently when they actually

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.525
have the battle, no one knows.

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:30.260
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like human society

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.060
is able to evolve on markers.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.310
So if you think
of nation states,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.900
we're able to evolve
what that means

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.790
and what groups
count in it and not.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.950
Is there a parallel
in the animal world?

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:48.740
Like are ants able to change
their trails as members join

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.270
or as history happens?

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.550
MARK MOFFETT: Well,
ironically, the one case

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.160
where this is known well
is in the slavery ants.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.530
And they are ants
that take slaves,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.160
and they take slaves
that are young ants.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.580
And those ants
emerge in a colony.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.880
And like a baby chick
learning who its mother is,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.330
they learn the identity
of their society.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.300
But those slaves were taken
from a different colony,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.030
so they don't have
the same scent.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.920
And it turns out,
all the ants are

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.260
grooming each other all the
time and probably exchanging

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.380
the scent.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.890
And so it is allowed to
live just because it's

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.990
conforming to this scent.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.530
But that means the scent itself
is changing all the time.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.990
And there are other
cases as well,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.530
showing that ants are
actually quite smart,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.010
despite the tiny brain, at
tracking what the scent is.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.910
And they never make mistakes.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.390
And if that slave goes
out and encounters

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.965
its mother's colony, where
it should be, it's attacked.

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:53.000
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
how societies are temporary

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.700
and there's an identity
split and a society split,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.820
at some point.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.630
So if you think about Google
itself like a society--

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.670
we have like 100,000 people--

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.000
what lessons would there be
for a company like Google,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.658
where you have all these people
that have to work together?

00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:08.450
MARK MOFFETT: Yeah.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.840
Well, legally,
large corporations

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.570
are treated like
individuals, sometimes.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.460
In fact, they have
some properties

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.850
of societies, like this
identity unity and so forth.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.210
Whether they stay
through the generations--

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.030
so since I had for
the original IBM

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.050
that their grandkids would
still be working for it--

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:36.530
is maybe a missing
part of that parallel.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:42.210
But basically, it's hard to say.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.530
Within the corporate
level, no one's

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.220
looked at things in
the corporate level.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.110
Actually, someone should to see
how corporations often split

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.690
apart and so forth over time.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.440
I really can't answer
that in detail,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.690
but it's a very good question.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.620
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.340
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on, like for humans, not ants

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.040
here, the rise of intercultural,
interracial marriages

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.980
and relationships?

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.860
Do you see this
forming new societies,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.818
or is this just blending
different traditions?

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:13.610
Because it seems like
we're able to do this

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.745
a lot more easily
now than in the past.

00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:17.120
Do you have any
thoughts on that?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.690
MARK MOFFETT: Yeah.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.940
Well, it's really interesting.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.530
There's this thought that
the whole world is getting

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.350
Americanized by
movies, and McDonald's,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.840
and McDonaldization, or
whatever that's called.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.100
In any case, when you look
through the literature,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:38.050
the sense is that the societies
stay staunchly separate.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.010
In fact, they may increase
their differences.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.070
Places like China are
perhaps even more Chinese

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.840
than they were before, because
one's need for the help

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.430
of outsiders actually
often causes the in-group

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.920
to become more rigid,
and more set in its ways,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.600
and more distinctive.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.680
That doesn't mean you're
not relating to each other

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.720
all the time in a useful way,
but the societies stay stable

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.020
throughout those processes.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.520
And the interesting part--
another part of your question

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.530
was about people
between societies

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.550
and so forth linking up.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.540
And one of the amazing
things about humans

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.640
is we are able to
take individuals

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.560
from other societies, and
they can join our own.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.610
So in the past, it would have
been refugees or marriage

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.600
partners.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.180
As I said at the beginning,
a certain number of people

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.850
have to transfer
between societies just

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.280
to interbreed when our
societies were small.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.800
In the case of
humans, that means

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.130
they had to take on certain
attributes of the group

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.300
that they're joining.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.180
So they'd have to learn language
and some of the behaviors,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.650
but they'd never
be perfect at it.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.360
We can never completely
drop our identities.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.980
So even today, we see with
immigrants after two or three

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.360
or four generations, there'll
be a lot of nuances taken on,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.103
maybe even their walking
style and so forth.

00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.770
But there's still a
sense of difference,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.250
and that's maintained, actually,
by the rules of the society.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.370
I won't go into it,
but this yin and yang

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.870
of belonging and being different
is a really interesting part

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.430
of the whole human dynamics.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.495
It's amazing it works.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.450
So the societies
that you present

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.200
seem to be very based
on physical proximity.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.500
And I'm wondering if you see any
trends, in humans especially,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.330
of creating societies
that are not

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.076
based on this kind of
proximity or territory?

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:39.600
MARK MOFFETT: Yes.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.860
Actually, there are cases.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.440
The most interesting cases
in the animal kingdom

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.170
are the ones that aren't
based on proximity.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.280
Things like wolves, and
elephants, and chimpanzees

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.130
can spread over the landscape
and still remember each other.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:58.440
And in fact, they can remember
each other sometimes for years.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.720
And this capacity to
retain relationships

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.950
over the long term is
amplified in humans,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.870
because our early
societies, particularly,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.130
were highly spread out.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.550
And you might not see
somebody for years,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.800
and they might look different.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.080
They've aged, certainly.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.850
Or you might meet a
complete stranger,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.400
and yet you can be
comfortable with them

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.977
within moments, as long
as they weren't angry.

00:15:20.977 --> 00:15:23.310
They can be people you don't
want to deal with that day.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:28.590
But this capacity for
dynamics over space and time

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.640
is what really makes
humans different from a lot

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.360
of these species to a different
degree than the others.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.360
AUDIENCE: In terms of like
they're still contiguous,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.470
it seems.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.500
Can I be embedded in
another set of people

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.378
and be a member of a
society somewhere else?

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.420
MARK MOFFETT: Well, it's
an interesting question,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.990
because basically, there's
not a lot of information

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.030
from psychology on some
of these possibilities.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.550
It seems to be if we're part
of two different societies,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.000
we tend to have a stronger
relationship with one of them

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.380
and see ourselves more different
and distinct from the other.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.450
Not to go directly
into an ant example,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.680
but I will go directly
into an ant example.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.038
And that is the very
large colony that's

00:16:15.038 --> 00:16:16.830
taken over Southern
California, most of it,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.250
with a trillion individuals,
controls all the port cities

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.370
of Southern California,
and it's boarded the ships.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.120
And it's now the
same colony that's

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.910
conquered 1,000 miles of
the European coastline.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.500
You can take an ant from
California to Europe,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.702
and it's just fine.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.160
You can take it to
parts of Europe,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.530
where other colonies have
gotten in, and it's killed.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.630
So these ants are
actually expanding

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.820
at a global level as societies,
giving it sort of a situation

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.170
like Alaska and Hawaii is
from the continental US--

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.800
a continuum with leap
frogs from place to place.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.475
Yeah?

00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:56.850
AUDIENCE: One for
work and society,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.710
I have a particular
question regarding humans.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.870
The examples you gave with
the animals and insects,

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.000
they always have, some of them,
a specific feature that drive

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.560
them most-- division or unity.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.410
In humans, in your
research, what

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.430
is the feature
characteristic in us

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.880
that drives division or unity?

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.781
Do you have like a top?

00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:19.800
MARK MOFFETT: Well, it
seems to vary a lot.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.680
I was looking a lot through the
early anthropology literature,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.839
because many anthropologists
don't even think

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.060
hunter-gatherers had societies.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.340
And that's because they're
looking at hunter-gatherers

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.105
today that are embedded in
other societies themselves.

00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:35.730
But if you look at
the early societies,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.870
you can see that there would
be branches spread out.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.370
And there'd be 1,000
or 2,000 people

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.370
that would share this identity.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.570
And how this is
maintained over time

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.170
and what causes the breakdown
is the big question.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.010
Sometimes, you hear
the stories about it

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.480
being very little things, like
someone insulted some aspect

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.950
of some ritual or something.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.830
And sometimes, it seems
to be about big things.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.080
It's really hard to say what
gets people excited sometimes.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.100
But clearly, the last step--

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.530
you know there's
trouble when one

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.220
of these subgroups
within the society

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.250
gives itself its own name.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.910
Names are important.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.430
Once you have your
own name, you're

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.590
probably on the way
out or the way in,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.560
depending on whether you want
to be in that group or not.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.200
MARK MOFFETT: Thanks.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.980
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that I find really interesting

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.150
about human evolution is
our relationship with dogs

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.160
and how we, as a species,
co-evolved with dogs

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.430
in forming those relationships
to the point that today,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.060
you could say that they
really are part of our society

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.360
rather than just us
using them as tools.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.830
I was curious as to your
opinion on that relationship.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.330
MARK MOFFETT: Yeah,
I think they can

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.800
be viewed as part of society.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.008
I had a paragraph about this.

00:19:04.008 --> 00:19:05.508
It's one of these
little things that

00:19:05.508 --> 00:19:06.880
had to get out of the book.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.660
But once you're
totally interlinked,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.780
and your identity is
interlinked with theirs,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.260
by the definition of looking
at society's identity,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.660
dogs become part of,
at least, our families,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.450
but also our societies.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.120
And it's the same with
human crops, which

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.560
are totally dependent on
us, and even ant crops,

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.200
as leaf-cutter ants
are agricultural.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.230
And so their crops
are only found

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.540
with their particular nest.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.470
That nest has a relationship
with that particular breed

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.890
of crop and will
kill anything that

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.307
looks identical to us
that comes from outside.

00:19:48.307 --> 00:19:49.890
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for coming,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.440
and thank you to Dr. Moffett
for your presentation, today.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.710
MARK MOFFETT: Thanks.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.560
It was sort of a practice run.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.140
So let me know anything you
liked, and you can email me

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.230
there with any thoughts.
