INTERVIEWER: So
Robert Anton Wilson

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.487
talks about cultural
reality tunnels, all right?

00:00:07.487 --> 00:00:08.570
So think of that metaphor.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.403
Think of that image.

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:12.190
Think of a tunnel
of reality, right,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.680
a single worldview, a single
way of seeing things, right?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.910
And it's the only
reality you know,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.710
because you live within
your reality tunnel.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.900
But when you're exposed to
new people, to new ideas,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.930
to different ways
of interpreting

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.790
the world, different myths,
different customs, right,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.290
all of these
things-- what they do

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.350
is-- unhinge you from
the rigidity of the world

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.520
you were born into, giving you
what's akin to an aerial view.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520
And it's a wonderful
experience, because there's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.580
so much insight to be
gained from that change

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.370
in perspective, something
I often converse with you.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.439
Don't you think, Issac?

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.230
SUBJECT: Because I
wasn't listening to you.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.195
No, I'm serious.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:52.940
I'm serious.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.040
INTERVIEWER: He
wasn't even listening.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.820
You see, he was in his
own reality tunnel.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.470
No, what I was saying
is the importance

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.542
of going and exploring
new lands, right?

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:03.875
Visiting new places, exposing
yourself to be unfamiliar,

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.030
right, the idea that the
unexamined life is not

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.820
worth living and how important
it is to do, that every day,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.920
to that practice, to not kind
of take things for granted, so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
to speak, to partake in
a dialectical pattern

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.920
of reconcilable
estrangement with the world

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.420
of everyday perception, as
David Linson talks about.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840
This idea of
archetypalizing experience,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.520
italicizing experience.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.360
You know, witnessing
the specific,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120
but beholding it
as the universal.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.930
Everything stands more
clearly for all of its class.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.860
This particular path
becomes the path.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.220
My particular life
becomes the life.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.030
We mythologize ourselves,
and we mythologize the world

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.260
in order to enter a
kind of garden of Eden

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.570
where we can extract Meaning
from our experiences, patterns

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.490
from our experiences.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.570
So that life is not just
mush, but instead, of a movie,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.450
a journey, a motif.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.040
A dream.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.540
A Dream dream within a dream.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.710
Row, row, row, your boat
gently down the stream.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.770
Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily life is but a dream.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.710
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.970
Anything to
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] with?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.570
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.820
--when you used to play the
Street Fighter video game,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.639
didn't you go into that world?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.930
Didn't you enter that ontology?

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.940
SUBJECT: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.180
