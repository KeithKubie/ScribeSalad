00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:09.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: It is a pleasure
to welcome you back, Dr.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.560
Kissinger, to Google.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.790
You were here a few
years ago to a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.670
sellout crowd of Googlers.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.920
Dr. Kissinger is back, having
already met with some of the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.120
key members of our search
and legal team.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.670
And he's come for his demo of
Google Glass and a few other

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.310
things like that.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.470
For those of you who don't
know why Dr. Kissinger

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.670
matters, it's worth
understanding the life that he

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.440
has led and the impact
that he has had.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.750
For those of you that have not
followed it, this is the man

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.760
who, in many ways, made
globalization

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.560
happen in the world.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.940
This is the man who settled
the war that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.880
would have killed me.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.110
This is the man who drove
American foreign policy not

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.880
just in one presidency, but I
would say for decades in terms

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.015
of an impact and role.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:15.290
It'd be fair to say that it's
great to see someone of your

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.230
intellect, educated, professor
at Harvard, in politics and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.910
governance.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.370
Because he understands the
consequences of what he did

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.810
and the impact he had.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.080
But more importantly, he
understands it with the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.420
historic context.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.870
So welcome to Google,
Dr. Kissinger.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.488
HENRY KISSINGER: Thank you.

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:41.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.010
HENRY KISSINGER: Eric is leaving
me in the position I

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.660
was in at a reception once,
where a lady came up to me and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.030
said, I understand you are
a fascinating man.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.454
She said, fascinate me.

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:00.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.630
HENRY KISSINGER: It was not one
of the best conversations

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.440
I ever had.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.960
HENRY KISSINGER: But
I appreciate what

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.870
have you have said.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.100
And I'm a great admirer of what
Google is doing, even

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.120
though I have thought about the
long-term impact, as we

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.655
have discussed.

00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:30.940
ERIC SCHMIDT: So what I thought
we would do is, we

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.890
have some Dory questions that
you all have submitted.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.520
But I thought I'd use the
privilege of the moderator to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.660
ask some questions about what's
going on in the globe

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.070
today, with the benefit of
your perspective and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.030
experience.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.060
And let's start with some
hard current problems.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.440
Let's start with Iran, Syria,
the Middle East.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.220
You actually drove the peace
process 40 years ago.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.020
You actually made peace in the
Middle East 40 years ago.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.180
Not much has happened since, and
a lot of bad things have

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.310
happened since--

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.920
nuclear bomb possibility in
Tehran, the Syrian civil war,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.370
which is horrific.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.660
From your perspective,
two questions--

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.300
what do you think will happen,
just using your judgment, and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.210
also, what should America do,
if anything, about each of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.460
these issues?

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.210
HENRY KISSINGER: In the
next 10 minutes?

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
Google, right?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.960
Things are done quickly.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.510
HENRY KISSINGER: I come
from a generation that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.364
learned from books.

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:13.550
I approach foreign policy as a
history, in the sense that I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:22.790
ask myself what comparable
situations have existed.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:32.020
And I was in office in a period
of domestic discord

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.420
even more intense,
in some respects,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.840
than the current one.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.630
Because it was when the America
lost its innocence in

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.760
foreign policy and began
to learn its limits.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.540
So let me talk about the
peace process in the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.980
Middle East at the time.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.790
When I got into office,
it had been

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.090
stalemated for a long period.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.710
And the attempt was to break
the deadlock with making

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.200
proposals on the theory that
somewhere out there there was

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.280
some formula that would
permit the parties--

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.160
we made a different analysis.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.230
And in the way I think of
foreign policy, which I'm not

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.250
insisting everybody has to,
you have to start with

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.210
analyzing the problem.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.970
What is the issue you
are trying to solve?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.290
And what is it you're
trying to get to?

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.960
So we made what you
may consider a

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.340
simple-minded analysis.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.030
We said, the Soviet Union is
supplying arms to all of the

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.050
Arab countries, and we're trying
to make peace between

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.496
Israel and the Arab countries.

00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:11.610
And The Arab countries have
no incentive to make any

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.440
concessions because they believe
that the Soviet arms

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.700
will always give them
the possibility to

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.850
insist on their demands.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.860
And the Israelis won't make
concessions because they think

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.950
it's just the prelude
to a showdown.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.590
Some of that exists today
in a different form.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.070
So we decided that be would
block any initiative that was

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.630
backed by Soviet arms.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.090
And we had to fight our own
bureaucracy, which wanted to

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.340
do the traditional thing.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.680
So we were waiting.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.230
We were betting on the fact that
some Arab leader along

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.640
the way would change.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.820
And it was a long wait.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.070
It took about four years.

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:25.010
But when the Arab-Israeli board
started in '73, we sent

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.930
a message to Sadat, and said to
him, you're now making war

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.180
with Soviet arms.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.210
But remember, you have to make
peace with American diplomacy.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.790
So then he switched
and began to work

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.110
with American diplomacy.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.160
That was the essence.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.710
We don't have a comparable
situation today.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:56.230
Because if you take Iran, we
know that the acquisition of

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.440
nuclear weapons by Iran will
have huge consequences for

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.690
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:11.108
But Iran is under no pressure
to do anything.

00:08:11.108 --> 00:08:16.170
And if you look at the
negotiating record, and

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.740
compare the American position
today from what it was at the

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.810
beginning of the negotiation
about 10 years ago, you will

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.630
see that with every negotiation,
we have made a

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:34.710
new offer on the theory that
somewhere there is something.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.750
And so in a way, we are
negotiating with ourselves.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.400
So you asked me what
will happen.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:50.350
Absent some significant
additional pressure on Iran,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.880
Iran will get nuclear weapons.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: And then
what happens?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.820
HENRY KISSINGER: And the
addition of pressure now is

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.590
much harder to organize than
it would have been.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:06.060
Because it would have to be the
threat of force by us or

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:12.260
the threat of force by Israel.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.910
And we have moved from--

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.880
the original American position
was Iran could not have any

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.350
principle and any facilities
to produce fissionable

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.070
material, no reprocessing.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.970
We have now moved to agreeing
that there are certain types

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.660
of reprocessing and enrichment
they could do, and that the

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.630
only thing that's a
red line is the

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.530
acquisition of nuclear weapons.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.460
Which if you have enough
fissionable material, it's

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.140
relatively easy to do.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:59.360
So I would say the probability
is that Iran

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.490
will get nuclear weapons.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:09.490
Or, as Netanyahu said last
weekend, that Israel may go to

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.560
war to prevent that.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.530
And then we will have--

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.190
ERIC SCHMIDT: A real mess.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.580
HENRY KISSINGER:
--quite a mess.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, you lived
through '67, '73 wars in the

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.730
government and in
the campaign.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.030
In a situation where Iran
actually gets a nuclear

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:37.620
weapon, and Israel is now on a
war footing, the Sunni will

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.630
then also get nuclear weapons.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.690
And then we'll have
a nuclearized

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.770
Arab-Israeli world.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.060
Is that roughly correct?

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.580
HENRY KISSINGER: Yes.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.630
I would think that if Iran
gets nuclear weapons, the

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.280
Sunni world will acquire
nuclear weapons.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.300
And then nuclear weapons will
have spread into countries

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.190
that are not as technically
able or rich enough to

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.920
safeguard them the way they
were safeguarded in the

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.040
two-power world.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.750
And when I think back to my
experience, we lived,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.476
essentially, in a two-power
nuclear world.

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:27.800
And people sometimes ask me
what was my biggest worry.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.430
I wasn't in a fret.

00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:38.590
I can't say I wasn't worried.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.290
But the day to day activities, I
felt, I was there to handle.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.480
The question I could
never answer for

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.690
myself fully was this--

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.060
what if we reach a point
where the only

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.860
recourse is nuclear weapons?

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.650
Would I be prepared to
recommend to the

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.400
president to use it?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.080
And the issue was that the
casualties that could be

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:15.930
produced in a matter of hours
was so vast that and would

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.200
live in a new world.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.440
And it raised the question of if
anybody had the moral right

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.000
to do that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.570
Luckily, we never got to the
point where I had to give a

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.820
final answer.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.560
But probably I wouldn't
have recommended it.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.940
But I'm not arguing that.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.900
But now you have countries that
don't have these systems

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:50.050
and some countries that have a
ideology according to which a

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.460
lot of human life makes
you more eligible

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.785
for heavenly bliss.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:05.550
So then I think if they do
spread, generally, nuclear war

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.900
will become more likely.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.100
People say, yes, we can
always deter them.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.710
But this isn't like Russia.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:22.810
Russia had comparable risks as
we did, as between religious

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.300
Islam and countries, the
assessment of risk is not

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.550
homogeneous.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: Your history, of
course, was that you were a

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.670
professor at Harvard and worked
on the Richard Nixon

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.850
campaign, and when he became
president, became national

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.520
security adviser, secretary of
state, and eventually held all

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.330
of those jobs.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.380
HENRY KISSINGER: No, I didn't
work on the Nixon campaign.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.130
I worked on the Rockefeller
campaign against Nixon.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: Oh.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.220
HENRY KISSINGER: No,
it was strange.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.550
Could never happen today, that
a principle advisor of one

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:06.110
candidate gets invited by the
other candidate to be his

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.806
security advisor.

00:14:06.806 --> 00:14:13.400
It was very courageous
of Nixon.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: So for
those of you who--

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.870
I was a teenager at the time.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.590
And when this grand bargain
between Dr. Kissinger and the

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.210
president came together, it was
a subject of extraordinary

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.120
interest in the press.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.500
And Dr. Kissinger was followed
everywhere, and was seen as

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.830
this incredibly powerful role.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.470
And in history, people talk a
lot about the relationship

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.710
between yourself and
President Nixon.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.480
I am extremely grateful to you
because I would have been

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.450
drafted, sent to Vietnam,
and, in my view, killed.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.890
And because you managed
to settle the

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.835
war, I am here today.

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:54.690
And for those of you who are not
my age, which is the vast

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.170
majority of you, it's very
difficult to describe what it

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.780
feels like to have a draft card
and have your friends

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.665
being drafted.

00:15:03.665 --> 00:15:05.880
And this really was the reality,
which, of course,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.130
tore the country apart.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.620
What was the nature of the
relationship with you and

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.820
President Nixon that allowed
you two together to do

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.550
something extraordinary
in China, do something

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:26.260
extraordinary in the Israeli
world, and the Vietnam War.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.780
What was the nature of it?

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.960
HENRY KISSINGER: I had never met
Nixon when he asked me to

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.210
be his security advisor.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:46.630
Nixon was personally so insecure
in his personal

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.960
relationships that when he asked
me to be his security

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.420
adviser, I didn't know
what he wanted.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.620
I knew he wanted something.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.620
But he didn't want
to be rebuffed.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.580
So we had a two-hour
conversation.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:12.190
And I left knowing he wanted
something, but not knowing

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.030
what it was.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.280
A week later, John Mitchell
called me up and said, well,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.600
are you going to take
the job or not?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.178
And I said, what job?

00:16:24.178 --> 00:16:26.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.080
HENRY KISSINGER: And Mitchell
said, oh my God, he screwed

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.411
this up again.

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:31.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.310
HENRY KISSINGER: So now
I go to Nixon again.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.520
This time he offers me the
job unambiguously.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.260
And again, this was a different
age, and so you have

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.290
to consider a Harvard
professor's arrogance.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:54.620
I said to Nixon, I've opposed
you for 15 years, and I want

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.740
to spend a week asking my
friends, because I don't want

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.936
to lose my friends.

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.326
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:07.839
HENRY KISSINGER: And he should
have said get lost.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.910
He said take a week.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.390
On the second day of that week,
Nelson Rockefeller, who

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:19.369
had been in Venezuela
and unreachable--

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.329
different period--

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.089
called me--

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:22.800
came back.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.079
And I told him what
had happened.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:31.130
And he said, has it ever
occurred to you that Nixon is

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:35.910
taking a bigger chance on
you than you on him?

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.490
Which was absolutely true.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.190
So I accepted.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.950
So the question is, what
brought us together?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:54.130
The way the relationship
worked was not--

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.990
on a personal basis, we were
not great friends.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:06.130
We saw each other socially
relatively daily, considering

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.172
that we spent many
days together.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.650
But I had studied the making
of peace, the creation of

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.910
international order.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.800
I was going to write a series
of books on that subject.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.810
He was [INAUDIBLE], and
therefore he had also done a

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.780
lot of reading.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:39.280
So strangely, unexpectedly, both
of us liked to begin with

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.000
the question I put to you
before, which is analyzing

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.840
where are we.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.140
What are we to try to do?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.265
And on that basis--

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.850
not on the basis of personal
friendship--

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.390
we came to a very parallel
conclusions.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.770
And for example, take the
opening to China.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:18.010
There had been 163 meetings of
American ambassador and the

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.160
Chinese ambassador in
Warsaw to discuss

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.926
the opening of relations.

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:27.800
And there was a well defined
agenda, which had to do with

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:34.300
Taiwan, claims and assets,
various immunity claims.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.440
It was a long list, and not one
of them had been settled.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:47.930
So when Nixon sent me to
China, there were no

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.640
communications between China
and the United States.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.180
But it was also technically
not possible for me.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:02.780
I couldn't pick up the phone
and call them and say, it's

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.030
going this way.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.870
So we decided--

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.410
we hadn't even met
the Chinese yet--

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:18.440
that I would scrap the entire
program, and that I would say

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.420
to the Chinese, before we go
back to a program, let's first

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.730
try to understand where
each of us is going.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.120
And so if you read the
transcripts of my so-called

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:40.090
secret visit, you will see that
Chou and I talked like

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:45.790
two college professors,
explaining to each other what

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.290
our country is trying to do.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.197
On my second visit, before
Nixon got there--

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:03.070
and the way Nixon and I operated
on these things was

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.090
we never wanted to be in a
position where everything

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.840
depended on Nixon's
conversations

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.010
with the other leader.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.760
Because if you get to that point
among heads of state,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.990
there's nothing to
have recourse to.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.440
So I was sent to China a second
time to work out what

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.040
later became known as the
Shanghai Communique.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.030
And I arrived with a communique
approved by Nixon

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.160
that was a very traditional
communique.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.140
And Chou and I first
accepted it.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.560
Then Mao saw it.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.510
And Mao said, this
is bullshit.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.320
It pretends that we agree
on everything.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.790
And we don't.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.950
So why don't we do something
different.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.610
Why don't we put all our
disagreements into this

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.770
communique, and put a few
agreements at the end.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.540
Then the agreements will
be taken seriously.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.800
So I was stuck in Beijing.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.150
I couldn't call Nixon and say,
we've just reversed everything

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.780
you've already approved.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.340
But I felt absolutely confident
that he would

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.080
approve it.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.410
So I'm saying this not to prove
anything about myself,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.200
but to show what was the nature
of the relationship.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.770
So on the one hand, it was
personally friendly but aloof,

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.530
but substantively
very intense.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: Today, when you go
to Beijing, there the three

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:40.820
major terminals.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.800
You've been many times since.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.570
And there is the little terminal
where your airplane

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.160
landed for the first visit
that you opened up.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.160
Whenever I go by that,
I see that terminal.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.510
And I imagine you in the early
1970s doing that, and a

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.430
country full of bicycles
and gray uniforms.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.940
What was Mao like, and what was
the culture like as you

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.910
engaged it?

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.750
How did it feel when
you landed and when

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.000
you spoke with them?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.480
HENRY KISSINGER: Before
we get to this, let

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.530
me explain to you--

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:26.190
a few months ago, the Chinese
gave a dinner for me.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.370
And they found everybody who had
ever met me, especially on

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.290
the secret trip.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.420
And they all told me the
troubles they went through

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.920
preparing the jet for travel.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.490
There had never been a
707 land in China.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.890
So they didn't have a
game plan for it.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.090
And they couldn't order one,
because they didn't want to

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:56.820
put out the word that
a 707 was coming.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.570
So they constructed
one from pictures.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.950
And they weren't sure what would
actually happen, but it

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.310
would fit properly.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:14.750
So then a lady was in charge of
preparing the guest house

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.170
where I was going to stay.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:22.090
And she got it into her head
that Americans like lawns.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.580
But unfortunately, the space in
front of the guest house,

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.320
because of the Cultural
Revolution, had been planted

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.330
with spinach.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.330
So she had four weeks
to get a lawn down.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.470
HENRY KISSINGER: Those were the
problems the Chinese had.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.280
What was Mao like,
was the question.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:58.220
Also, to give you a flavor of
how these relationships were,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.570
on my first visit, my so-called
secret visit, I was

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:12.210
probably the only visitor to
China who made heroic efforts

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.170
to avoid meeting Mao.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:25.230
And the belief was that with all
the friendship [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.450
between Nixon and me, I knew
he wanted to be the first

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.350
American to meet Mao.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:38.700
And I knew it was a risk to
my relationship with him.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:44.420
So Mao had given orders, we now
know, he didn't want to

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.560
ask for a meeting.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.480
So as soon as I asked for
a meeting, I was to

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.380
be brought to him.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
you don't ask.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.514
HENRY KISSINGER: And
I didn't ask.

00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:58.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:03.050
HENRY KISSINGER: And so my whole
secret visit was spent

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:08.830
talking to Chou Enlai, which
was no hardship.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.300
But what was Mao like?

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.230
I met him five times.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.640
And of course, he's responsible
for the killing of

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.366
tens of millions of people.

00:26:21.366 --> 00:26:27.670
The Mao I met was not
the killer Mao.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:36.500
It was a acting like
a Chinese saint.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.950
He was extremely intelligent.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.000
He conducted the
conversations.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.470
Almost all leading statesmen
that I've met say, I've got

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.900
five points I have to
make to you, and

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.140
they make their points.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.920
He wouldn't do that.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.920
He would begin by saying, what
is your consideration of--

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.210
give you a topic.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.250
Then you'd say whatever
you said.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.240
And he'd keep that
dialogue going.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.770
So you really engaged in a
Socratic dialogue with him.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.195
I had one meeting that
lasted four hours.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.460
And it lasted four hours because
he had decided to

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.140
replace Chou Enlai, which
we didn't know.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.010
But he wanted a Bible in which
he had commented on every

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:43.410
aspect of foreign policy so it
could be used as a reference

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.270
statement for the Chinese
bureaucracy after Chou Enlai

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.520
disappeared.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.480
And David [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.350
was with me, who had
met de Gaulle.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.780
And he said that was one
of the most astonishing

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.013
intellectual performances.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.655
And he would make sarcastic
comments.

00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:21.160
He was always polite, but he'd
say such things as, you

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.793
Americans remind
me of swallows.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.870
He stopped and turned to the
interpreter and said, should I

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.515
have said sparrows?

00:28:31.515 --> 00:28:34.290
No, they decided to
say swallows.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.190
of swallows that fly up into
the air when a storm

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.970
approaches and flap
your wings.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.730
But you, professor, and I know
that the flapping of the wings

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.320
does not affect the coming
of the storm.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.270
So he'd make these comments,
but it would

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.480
always get to a point.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:07.020
So he was a personality that
really dominated any room,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.240
with a really superb
strategic grasp.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.380
Now, he would kill anybody
who got in his way.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.360
That's another side of him.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.262
Which I didn't see.

00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:22.870
But we all know about
it, unchallenged.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: So after my trip
to North Korea, you and I

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.300
spoke a little bit about
North Korea.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:34.180
What do you think will happen
in the relationship between

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.740
China and North Korea?

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.310
You told me, at the time, that
the only thing that matters is

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:45.070
China's support for North
Korea at this point.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.760
HENRY KISSINGER: I think--

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.391
as a general proposition--

00:29:50.391 --> 00:29:53.540
we are now at the point where,
partly because of Chinese

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.280
internal necessities, and
partly because its new

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.635
leadership has a different life
experience than some of

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:06.890
the previous ones-- new
leadership in China--

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:12.310
that it's a possibility of
recasting the Sino-American

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.090
relationship.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:19.710
And a new Chinese leader has put
it in this question, is it

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:24.720
possible for two countries that
are normally adversaries

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.300
to move into a cooperative
relationship?

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.540
And he made that
as a challenge.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:40.670
I believe that he has every
incentive to answer this

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.600
constructively because of the
enormous consequences of the

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.820
changes that he's thinking
of making.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:55.960
If that is true, a good test
case will be Korea.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.320
Because that is an issue that
can only be solved between

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.700
China the United States
initially.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.290
And I'm beginning think
it may be possible.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.690
And if that happens, some of the
proliferation issues that

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:19.460
I mentioned to you before will
be dramatically changed.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.680
If some country is actually
giving up nuclear weapons

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.580
because of the collaboration
of two

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.400
major nuclear countries.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:38.060
And the North Korea you saw
I thought had very little

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.160
likelihood.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.790
And I probably said
that to you.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:47.340
And now I think it's conceivable
to me that it

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.950
could happen, say, in
the next two years.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'd like to move
to some of the Dory questions

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.380
that our employees
have submitted.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.930
And as you can imagine, there
are quite a few questions

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.580
about a young man who's name
is Edward Snowden, who is

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.080
currently in temporary
residence at

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.780
the airport in Russia.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.800
One of the questions is, "How
do you feel that Edward

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.700
Snowden's current political
limbo will play out?

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.410
If you were advising either
the US or Russia on the

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.960
situation, what advice would
you offer either the US or

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.190
Russia?" And I do know that you
give advice to both the US

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.180
and Russia.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.900
There's another question
from an employee.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.420
"Do you still believe, as was
reported around the Pentagon

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.670
Papers, that people who leak
government misdeeds should be

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.860
prosecuted?

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.220
Why shouldn't we prosecute the
officials who committed the

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:50.200
misdeeds first?" What is your
view of Snowden, PRISM, NSA

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.780
spying, Russia, the US?

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.030
What will happen?

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.800
HENRY KISSINGER: My view of--

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.270
I find Snowden despicable.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:21.040
The acquisition by any one
institution of such a monopoly

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:28.830
of information that cannot be
checked by any institutional

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:36.790
process in the hands of a few
people I find worrisome.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:45.070
And so I am not at ease about
the NSA collection.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:56.380
But I recognize the problem with
which they were dealing.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:01.480
And I don't know enough about
it and I don't know enough

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.280
technology to know whether it
could have been done in a more

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.760
discriminating way.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:13.650
But if somebody said to me,
should we take another look at

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.340
this vast collection?

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.848
I would say, yes, we should
take another look at this.

00:34:19.848 --> 00:34:30.260
Should one man assume the right
to pass out that level

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.000
of information, doing such
enormous damage to our

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.710
intelligence capabilities?

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.620
Because once the other side
knows what you are capable of

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.449
collecting, it will
force you into

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.770
another totally new field.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:56.250
Of course, if somebody's aware
of an individual misdeed, he

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:02.500
may fulfill a moral necessity
to be a whistleblower.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.330
But when somebody arrogates to
himself the right to do such

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:16.570
enormous damage to his society
without any attempt to

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:24.070
understand where it comes from,
I think it's just a form

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.590
of, I think, a kind of
self-regard that

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.450
I find quite repulsive.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.410
Now, on the Pentagon Papers,
it's not correct that I

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.370
advocated the prosecution
of it.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.465
I recommended nothing
in particular.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:57.610
But the Pentagon Papers raised,
again, the issue.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:03.826
They were released while I was
preparing the secret trip to

00:36:03.826 --> 00:36:09.150
China, in the same months, and
while we were conducting

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:13.040
negotiations with Vietnam
on ending the war.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.590
And I thought that if you dump
out 15,000 papers, it says

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:23.820
something about the ability of
your government to conduct any

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:31.780
meaningful direct secret
negotiation, that the effort

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.960
there had to be resisted.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.290
And you also understand this
about the Pentagon Papers.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.990
These were papers collected in
the Johnson Administration

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:49.050
about the leaker's perception of
misdeeds in the Kennedy and

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.280
Johnson Administration.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.530
Not one of them touched the
Nixon Administration.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:01.120
And if one had played it as a
straight political thing, it

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.810
would have been possible
for us to say, now

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.060
you see what we inherited.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.060
It's a pity they're out,
but you now understand.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:17.220
We were defending Nixon
and Kennedy papers--

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.770
Johnson and Kennedy papers,
not Nixon papers.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.110
But the magnitude of the
Pentagon Papers were

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.660
children's game.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.060
Because most of them, it turned
out, were really quite

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.710
irrelevant.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.070
Because they were second-level
papers.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:42.610
They came about because McNamara
had ordered a study

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.880
when he was secretary of defense
of what went wrong.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.970
And they were all connected
in one place, and

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.950
so they were leaked.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.330
So I can respect people
who leak about

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.850
a particular misdeed.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.925
I do not respect people who
endanger the national security

00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:06.340
the way Snowden has.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: So you and I have
talked some about your

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:16.240
view of democracy and your view
of history and how the

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.390
globe is changing.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.140
And I wanted to talk a little
bit about that, a little bit

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.420
about leadership, and then I
want to talk a little bit

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.970
about your view of Google and
the things Google should do

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.105
and should not do
as we conclude.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.700
When I interviewed you for my
book, and thank you very much

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:41.190
for that, you indicated that
true great leaders are

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.220
extremely rare.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.630
And I inferred from that that
it's even harder today to

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.490
become a great leader--
to be found, to be

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.320
elected, to be appointed.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.610
You mentioned in our
conversation that de Gaulle

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.030
was one of these great
leaders who

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.030
managed to unify a society.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.570
I know you're thinking
about this in

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.100
terms of global structure.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.660
What do you think will
happen with the next

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.460
generation of leaders?

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:13.140
Are you optimistic, in this new
world, highly connected,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.430
very short-term focused, that
we'll end up with eventually

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.530
better leaders?

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.620
Worse leaders?

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.870
Different leaders?

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.750
HENRY KISSINGER: Of course, you
all understand that I come

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.000
from a different world.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.785
And I see that when I deal
with my grandchildren.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.880
And I don't deplore this.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:53.060
But the task of a leader is to
take its society, or his

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:59.250
organization, from where it is
to where it has never been.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:11.400
And that means, inevitably, that
he will face opposition

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.530
from the world as it
is, to some extent.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.770
Now, that, of course, requires
great insight.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:23.390
But it also requires enormous
moral courage.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:30.210
Because you have to rely on
your own convictions until

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.180
your society has caught
up with you.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.070
Churchill had this quality.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.840
De Gaulle had this quality.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:46.740
I would argue Franklin Roosevelt
had this quality.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:53.600
Now, in the modern technological
world, I see a

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.780
lot of leaders in the technology
side that would

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.210
meet these requirements.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:11.660
But in the political side, the
world is presented, if you'll

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:26.310
forgive me, by Google through
fragmented excerpts from a

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:32.020
wide range of sources.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.340
There's more information
available than anybody ever

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.340
dreamed of.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.710
But how to translate that
information into knowledge

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:47.600
that is relevant to a historical
process and into

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.802
wisdom, into the next step,
that cannot be met.

00:41:53.802 --> 00:41:58.720
At least, I don't think it has
been met by existing search

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.710
engines approach.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:09.660
When I look at my own life, when
I first started meeting

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:16.075
political leaders, they asked
me what to think.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:27.326
Then they now ask
me what to say.

00:42:27.326 --> 00:42:30.060
It's a different problem.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.680
And now they don't even ask that
anymore, because they go

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:41.050
to search engines to tell them
what the dominant view is.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:49.370
I read somewhere that Obama
had 48 million card files,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.710
which told him who the friends
of people were.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:59.360
And I know Romney had 10
million [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.060
But next time, they both
will have 48 million.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.780
And I'm worried about the
future of democracy.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.315
If you don't have debates
about issues that are

00:43:12.315 --> 00:43:17.260
generated out of the gut of the
leaders, but where instead

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.250
the leaders go to technical
experts to tell them what the

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:27.225
mood is, well, I think that the
requirement of a leader is

00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:30.980
to say where you ought to
go, not where you are.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.260
And that's my concern with the
long-term social impact of a

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.470
great institution that I
admire, like Google.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: So you have
expressed privately some

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:54.210
concerns that Google actually
needs to think about our role,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.900
that because so many people are
using Google, that we're

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.890
actually shaping
the discussion.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:06.660
Can you express what should we
do differently, if anything?

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:13.340
HENRY KISSINGER: As I've said
innumerable times here, I know

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.760
I'm from a different world.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.190
I am not attacking this world.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.260
This is the world in which
we're going to live.

00:44:24.564 --> 00:44:34.910
I think that my concern about
Google results from its

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.916
excellence, not from
its failures.

00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:41.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK,
we'll take that.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.340
HENRY KISSINGER: No, if I could
say you're cooking the

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.010
result deliberately--

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.222
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which
we are not.

00:44:50.222 --> 00:44:51.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.670
ERIC SCHMIDT: So we're clear.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.050
HENRY KISSINGER: No.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.290
No, if I could say that, then
that's one problem.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:01.190
That's very relatively
easily fixable.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:07.852
But when you are the best engine
for producing facts--

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:16.310
but when sometimes the issue
is, in terms of long-range

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:23.809
thinking, not what is a fact
but what's a relevant fact,

00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:30.890
then it creates a concern.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:34.312
I don't know what
you should do.

00:45:34.312 --> 00:45:41.100
I talked to you about setting
up an internal system of

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.035
checks and balances, which
indicates how much confidence

00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:47.572
I have in you.

00:45:47.572 --> 00:45:52.670
No, I'm not saying the
government should do this.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:46:00.280
But I'm talking about a
50-year perspective.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.040
I'm not talking about the
next year or two.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.630
And I don't know whether
there is an answer.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:16.400
And this grows out of my respect
for Eric, so that I

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.810
occasionally tell him
a concern I have.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:24.180
This is not something
I'm taking

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:29.100
public or arguing about.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.500
But it's on my mind.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.810
ERIC SCHMIDT: I do think one
of your criticisms is that

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:45.375
we've gone from reading books
to five word sentences, that

00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.290
there is a change in your
lifetime, which you're very

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.850
worried about, about
information.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:53.200
Is that roughly correct?

00:46:53.200 --> 00:47:01.420
HENRY KISSINGER: When I look at,
say, the Lincoln debate,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:08.350
or the Gladstone-Disraeli
Debate, you had political

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:13.260
leaders who absorbed a lot of
facts, and then presented them

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.840
in two hour [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:22.710
to an interested public so
that they internalize.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:27.280
When you learn things in
fragments from a search

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.160
machine, you don't necessarily
internalize it.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:37.360
Because look at it and you
absorb it for the moment.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.060
But you don't have to
internalize it because you can

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.920
always get the answer again
when you need it.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.340
But some things you ought to
internalize even if you don't

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.040
need it at the moment.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.870
But on the other hand, you
make available a range of

00:47:54.870 --> 00:48:00.040
information that is so far
superior to anything previous

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.190
generations had.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:09.290
I look at it from the point of
view that when societies run

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:19.580
up against problems that they
cannot solve, that some

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:25.931
demagogue, Caesar, emerges
somewhere along the line.

00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:28.010
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm sorry--
meaning that the person just

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.250
sort of captures the
conversation as a demagogue?

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:35.350
HENRY KISSINGER: Captures the
conversation as a demagogue.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:41.080
And when 250 million card files
are debating each other,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.210
or printouts, or whatever
you call them--

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: In our case,
it's called big data.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:48.480
HENRY KISSINGER: That's what
worries me, the fact that

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.290
there are a lot of things that
worry me in the world that I

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.980
can't do anything about.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:01.740
And I didn't think we would take
the conversation public,

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.910
but that is my view.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.300
ERIC SCHMIDT: But one answer to
your question, which is why

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.070
I wanted to ask you directly,
would be if Google could

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.280
invent technology that could
take the information that's

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.710
currently arranged and construct
something of the

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:23.290
quality of a Lincoln debate,
or an Israeli debate.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.795
If that worked, that would
be a big improvement?

00:49:29.856 --> 00:49:31.106
HENRY KISSINGER: Yes.

00:49:33.425 --> 00:49:41.480
Or some way to get different
interpretations that people

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:48.780
can reflect about as they're
forming their own opinions.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.700
Because in the political world,
you finally meet people

00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:00.690
who are willing to stand up
against what seems to be the

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:04.470
conventional wisdom
from time to time.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: One of the things
that Google is in fact

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:17.880
working on is the ability to
more deeply understand subject

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.660
area, that information.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.940
And there are research projects
inside the company,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.130
some people here in the room,
who are in fact trying to

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.230
solve the problem that
you laid out.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:32.190
And I'm really glad that you
were able to come to state it

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.870
as clearly as possible.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.380
We've reached the
end of our time.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:41.400
I wanted to tell you
all that, for me,

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.150
great strategy matters.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.570
When I look at politics--

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:49.280
I spend a lot of time in
these worlds now--

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.480
the greatest strategies start
from a principle of, what are

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.610
we trying to accomplish?

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.870
and figuring out a
way to get there.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:51:01.030
The man to my right has had
a series of extraordinary

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.670
strategies.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.170
And I wanted you to hear how he
approached them, and how he

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:10.440
actually dealt with the
reality of the time.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.450
And I would say that the world
is a far, far better place

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.080
because of the opening up of
the world that I think you

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.465
properly deserve
the credit for.

00:51:20.465 --> 00:51:22.060
It is a great honor
to have you here

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.870
at Google, Dr. Kissinger.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.070
Thank you very much.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:25.370
HENRY KISSINGER: Thank you.

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:43.670
[APPLAUSE]
