00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.760
- [Instructor] I had never been curious

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.330
about my family history,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.050
but a rumored link in my lineage

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.020
to Genghis Khan piqued my interest.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.160
I wonder if this was written
for me in particular.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.090
But anyway, back to the sentence.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.740
So they've underlined piqued,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.200
and this form of piqued,
or this spelling of piqued,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.040
P-I-Q-U-E-D, one meaning
of it is to stimulate.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.160
And so this would be
stimulated my interest,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.600
which is exactly what the person

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.610
saying the sentence wants to say,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.300
that this rumored link
stimulated their interest.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.853
So this, another way,
stimu, let me write this,

00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.740
stimulated their interest,
which makes a lot of sense.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.150
And just the phrase, piqued my interest,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.840
is something that you would
hear a lot and it's spelled,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.760
the piqued part is spelled P-I-Q-U-E-D.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.840
Now, piqued could mean other things.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150
It could mean to irritate.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.150
But especially when people are talking

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.010
about piqued my interest,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.030
hey, that piqued my interest,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.860
that means hey, that
stimulated my interest.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.010
So this is the right spelling.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.300
This is the right use of it.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.020
So I would say NO CHANGE.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.830
Now, let's look at these other choices

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.180
just to make sure that we feel good

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.770
about ruling them out.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.990
So peak, P-E-A-K, that's
like a mountain peak,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.630
so the top of the mountain.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.980
That's a mountain peak.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.180
So if you use it as a verb,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.040
you could say he peaked the mountain,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.020
which means that he got to
the top of the mountain.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.110
But that's not what we're
talking about right over here.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.513
Now P-E-E-K, that's the kind of, you know,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.330
look when you're not
supposed to, so to speak.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.010
You know, he peeked through the keyhole,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.560
or she peeked through her fingers

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.090
when she was It playing hide-and-go-seek.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.360
To peek, this is kinda just to kinda look

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.400
when you're not supposed to.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.000
So peek, or to kinda look
very, kinda very quickly.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.390
So that wouldn't be it.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.140
And opaqued, well, this is
doesn't even sound the same.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.570
At least these first three,
piqued, peaked, and peeked,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.850
they all sound the same.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.870
But opaque, opaque means something

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.320
that you can't see through.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.860
And so I guess opaqued
would mean, you know,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.130
I guess if you had a,
imagine if you had a window.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.630
I've actually never used the word opaqued

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.463
in everyday language,

00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:05.250
but if you had a window that is clear

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.250
and then you paint it with stuff
that you can't see through,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.100
I guess you would have
opaqued that window.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.350
So anyway, I would rule
that one out as well.
