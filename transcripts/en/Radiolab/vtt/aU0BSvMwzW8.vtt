1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.050
How did you actually bump into this whole um thing?

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.600
Do you want the long winded version or the short winded version?

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.130
Split the difference. Okay. This is our friend Lou. Oh, Koski.

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:12.360
She's a radio producer.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.390
I was there 2008 and where is their southern Ohio Pike County,

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.950
Ohio and Appalachian part of Ohio. When you say Appalachian,

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.980
I think mountains and stuff. Is that the wrong image? No, it's the right image.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.060
It's country. And why were you out there?

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.650
I knew someone working on the campaign since 2008 so this is Barack Obama part

10
00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:35.830
one. This is Barack Obama part one. And that's why I went.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.810
Lou says it was the end of October one week before the election and in the final

12
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.760
days the Obama campaign was pressing deeper into parts of rural Ohio than almost

13
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.110
any other campaign before it.

14
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.520
So I went and I followed Barack Obama volunteers around just to see how is it

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.320
going to play,

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.470
like how's his race going to play in a a part of the country that's so white.

17
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.870
So she went down to down to town with the campaign,

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.820
eventually ended up in a tiny little hamlet called East Jackson.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.790
Not even on the map population, 400 or so.

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.540
It's right in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and it's a place where,

21
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:15.100
who you are, what color you are. Well, that just gets real complicated.

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
I've got white Irish, German and in and all this,

23
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:24.450
but if anyone would walk up to me today and say, what race are you? I would say,

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.320
Negro. I'd stand in front of the president today and tell him, Hey,

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.020
I am a negro and I am a proud American.

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.890
I'm not black as in color, but I am a negro.

27
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.160
I mean that's just the way I feel. This is clerisy Clery, Shrek, Claris.

28
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.480
He was one of the first people I met in East Jackson. Their legal documents,

29
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.740
I suppose the lie, right? Tell me what you're doing and clerisy.

30
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.170
I'm getting a birth certificate out to show you.

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
I think her experience has taught her that enough people think she's white,

32
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.490
that she goes out of her way when you meet her. This is a lego document.

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.410
Come to let you know she's black. Okay. This is how it reads just in your purse.

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.120
Yes. I keep this in my purse and yes,

35
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.720
it says Harley Harris. That's her father.

36
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.700
And then a comes over and it says color or race and it says what Negro?

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.890
It says Mary Marguerite. Salmons. What's it say? Negro. Okay,

38
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.510
so you go as black. So introduce to me your two daughters. Okay,

39
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.230
well you got to go with go there. Don't yet. My oldest daughter. Okay.

40
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.310
I'm Carlotta. Carlotta Hickson. I'm from East Jackson in Pike County, Ohio.

41
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.970
Carlotta lives right next door to her mom. Yes, and like her mom,

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.190
if you met her, you'd probably just assume she was white.

43
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.210
The only thing you could tell is black on me is my hair of a, it's frizzy.

44
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.044
That's it.

45
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.970
But I've witnessed black all my life and I guess I was just raised that way.

46
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.840
She stuck by it. Carlotta will stand and fight to the end.

47
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.110
I don't think you should deny a part of you that is there now.

48
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.950
My youngest daughter, Alison Manning, that's a whole different story.

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.530
I'm way too white to be black. She denies the fact that she's a negro.

50
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.120
Look at my hair, look at my skin. I mean really creamy cream,

51
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:10.540
cream, cream, lots of cream, you know, um,

52
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.850
let's just go really white. Don't ask me why, but she decided that she's white.

53
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.070
No, not decided a few years ago that I was going to be white.

54
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.860
I had been white since I've been 12 old enough to say that I've been white,

55
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.280
you know, and that aggravates me, that Agora

56
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.140
<v 1>for me, it really just, God,</v>

57
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.120
it just makes me feel mad and to understand like why their thing is so intense

58
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.770
leave. Do you think you just need to unpack what this area is all about? Okay.

59
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Like about five miles from where clerisy lives is a town called Waverly and

60
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.073
Waverley was settled,

61
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.490
but before the civil war by a group of white folks who came up from Virginia

62
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.390
with the express purpose that it should be an all white town even though it was

63
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:01.150
in the north. So to kind of achieve this.

64
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:05.020
One of the things that happened is that a sign was put up on the outskirts of

65
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:09.520
town, warning black people to stay out of Waverley after dark.

66
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.650
And to this day we really is still something like 96% white according to the

67
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.570
census. So that was Waverly. Meanwhile,

68
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.270
right next door you had this place called East Jackson.

69
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.410
We're clerisy now lives and you know, back in the day,

70
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.470
completely different situation was happening there.

71
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.300
You had Irish and German Timberman who were mixing with runaway slaves and

72
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.780
native Americans who were running from the trail of tears.

73
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.490
All these different cultures were,

74
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.750
were blending and intermarrying and having these kids and then grandkids who

75
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:44.850
were racially very, very mixed.

76
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.160
But to the folks back in Waverly, all those people in East Jackson,

77
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.083
they were just all black.

78
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.290
<v 0>No matter what they looked like, didn't matter what they looked like,</v>

79
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.070
they were the other. And for people in Waverley, the other was black.

80
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.220
And so if you lived in East Jackson, you are black. Huh?

81
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.360
So imagine you're clerisy my dad's mother was a full blood of white woman.

82
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.560
And my dad's dad was a German. She's a mixture of all of these things.

83
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.210
And if you look at our family tree, you could say she's only one 16th black.

84
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.770
But when you are raised from a child up and you're told you're black,

85
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.600
that's all you are, you're a n****r.

86
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.680
Well she says at a certain point that just becomes who you are.

87
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.040
And I'm not ashamed. One bit. I'm proud to be a negro.

88
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.750
Very proud.

89
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.470
<v 1>So you had these kind of twin communities right next door to each other.</v>

90
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.290
Largely separate. They both had their own schools.

91
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.290
Waverley's of course was bigger and multiple schools.

92
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.970
And in East Jackson we used to have a school in our area and it was called East

93
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.370
Jackson School, little one room, school house.

94
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.710
And then in the late sixties early seventies the school board voted to close

95
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:58.230
that school and all of a sudden all of kids had to go to wave.

96
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 2>Like were pretty much everyone was white.</v>

97
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.900
When we went to Waverly schools on Martin Luther King's Day, the kids,

98
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.440
the white kids at that school would hang up signs and go home n*****s.

99
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.640
And this was in the 80s was as, so that's when they decided,

100
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:18.320
well Martin Luther King's Day, we won't have school in the 80s. Yeah,

101
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.390
I heard that story from clerisy,

102
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.940
our sister Lanita from the neighbors across the road.

103
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.030
<v 0>And I, and even more surprising,</v>

104
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.110
and Allie told me when she and her sister got to school in the late nineties,

105
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.670
things hadn't changed that much. I got made fun of all the time. It was really,

106
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:39.560
really bad. I would have kids, you know, come up to me in class and say,

107
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.470
you know, well she's, you know, she's dirty, you know,

108
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.190
cause she's from East Jackson and they're all dirty out there. And you know,

109
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.700
when they would do the little check in your head at school thing,

110
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.200
they'd be like, Oh, you know,

111
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.170
she gonna have it cause she's black because I was black,

112
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:56.240
I'm going to have headlights. I, I, you know,

113
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.090
I'd come home and cry mom and be like, oh don't even worry about what they say.

114
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.090
They're, you know, you gotta be better than them, blah blah blah.

115
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.360
But she says she couldn't ignore it, so she started to fight back.

116
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.730
I would punch him, you know, just punch him.

117
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.150
Mom was constantly in the office because I was fighting.

118
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.370
But at some point during the eighth grade,

119
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.640
the principal with Ellie says something shifted. We were sitting in class,

120
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.730
<v 2>two white girls were sitting behind her and I didn't even know these girls and I</v>

121
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:24.470
was just thinking their mind in my own business.

122
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.890
And they came up from behind me and just threw this deodorant at me literally.

123
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.530
And they said, here, we thought you might need this.

124
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.380
Don't black people need deodorant. And keep in mind,

125
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.020
this is in the middle of class. Everybody is in there.

126
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.320
And the teachers there doesn't say anything, just tells them to calm it down.

127
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.230
And I was just like, you know, I tried to ignore him,

128
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.600
but they just kept poking me. Hey, hey.

129
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.070
They just kept, you know, poking me and telling me I was dirty.

130
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.120
Black people are dirty, you're dirty, you know, we know where you come from.

131
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:03.000
You're dirty, everyone's dirty out there, you're all dirty.

132
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.180
And she said at that moment, she just kind of gave up.

133
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.860
I didn't like having to fight.

134
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.280
I didn't like feeling like everybody was out to get me.

135
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.520
I wanted to be part of the group.

136
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.433
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

137
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.800
<v 0>not the outsider. It sucked being the outsider. I got sick of it.</v>

138
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.850
Shortly after that class she decided I don't want to be black and I'll have to,

139
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.710
when I went into high school, I had a break, you know,

140
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:39.390
the summer break and over the summer I decided that I was going to transform

141
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:43.170
myself, my life. It was going to be a new start for me. That summer,

142
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.810
Allie dropped a bunch of weight, grew her hair long.

143
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.450
I started wearing makeup when school started up again.

144
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:53.451
That fall I didn't even look like I did when I was in grade school,

145
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.770
you know, or middle school. Um, did you do

146
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.400
well I started hanging out with the older crowd

147
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.783
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

148
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.310
<v 2>the, you know, juniors and seniors. So they didn't even know who I was.</v>

149
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.690
People would ask what color I was. I was white. What color are your parents?

150
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.470
They're white, you know, and if anyone asks, well, can we meet your parents?

151
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.850
Well, she's gone on business. Oh my dad. Uh, he works a lot, you know,

152
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.043
great.

153
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.080
I have two hardworking white parents and you're never going to meet them.

154
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.770
She came home at night and she said, I had a wonderful day at school.

155
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.190
And I said, you did. That's nice to hear somebody that's black. Tell me that.

156
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:36.590
And she said, I told you I wasn't going as black.

157
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.260
I didn't talk to my sister very much either,

158
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.920
just because every time I would talk to her, I'd have to explain who she was.

159
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.590
Carlotta would be telling her friends and pointing at ally saying,

160
00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:49.970
that's my sister and ally be telling her friends, that's not my sister.

161
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.790
This girl's crazy, you know, don't believe nothing she's saying.

162
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.810
Whenever Alley's new friends did run into her sister, they picked on her,

163
00:09:56.811 --> 00:10:00.740
they tormented her teased and it throws the exact you,

164
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.910
same way they once picked on Allie or you know, calling her the n word.

165
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.750
Nobody likes you. Black people are dirty, you're dirty.

166
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.040
But did I dare say anything about it? No Way.

167
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.050
<v 0>Actually Ali would lead a lot of the in. Yes. She would help him out. Right.</v>

168
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.720
Mocker to make it fun of me can make her popular. Then she would do it.

169
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.330
But she would make you cry at school. Well, sure she was.

170
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.880
I saw her cry so many times

171
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.390
and I stood and did nothing and she wonders why we're not close now.

172
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.400
And you know, you don't forget things like that.

173
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:39.760
You don't forget who made your life miserable. She hated high school.

174
00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:41.890
She would never go back if you paid her

175
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.470
and then you have me.

176
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.660
<v 5>Mm.</v>

177
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.753
<v 0>I loved it.</v>

178
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.610
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.570
<v 2>I had all these friends and I really felt like everybody loved me. Granted,</v>

180
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.930
I don't know how good of friends they were because you know,

181
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.700
in a different situation they probably wouldn't have, but I didn't care.

182
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.040
I didn't care how they liked me. I just carried it

183
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.830
<v 0>that they liked me. And still this day Ellie is that rotten little child,</v>

184
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.960
its height and I love her to death. I do, but still inside.

185
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:20.700
She's still that little insecure child that wants be friends with the popular

186
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:25.120
crowd. After high school, Allie moved across town.

187
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.030
She lives in Piketon. It's on the other side away. Yeah.

188
00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:30.970
It's another side of Waverly into a predominantly white neighborhood.

189
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.560
Carlotta stayed in east Jackson and she stayed black. To be honest,

190
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.490
the way I feel about that,

191
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:40.480
it really doesn't bother me one way or the other bothers my mom more than at

192
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.200
ball versus me. Oh yes.

193
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.260
Allie says it comes up whenever she brings a friend over to her mom's house.

194
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.260
As soon as they walk in the door, the very first question out of her mouth,

195
00:11:50.261 --> 00:11:53.530
is it Allie tell you she was black? If she brings a guy or friend,

196
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.920
I tell him we're Negros. I want him to know what we are. I do.

197
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.600
I'll call her to the site or whatever, and I'm like,

198
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.330
do you have to do this every time? Well, what year? Shamed of us.

199
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:05.910
Now I am not ashamed of anybody, but I am not black. You know,

200
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.290
I am white. Stop doing that. As much as Allie and clerisy argue,

201
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.400
they're actually pretty close. Mommy's on the phone. Kids come here.

202
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.590
Nancy clerisy takes care of alleys, kids, a lot. Camaro. Mommy's on the phone.

203
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.650
They speak on the phone every day. David wants to talk. Come here, Kayla,

204
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.510
come here baby. This is the Nesa here, take this. Talk to mommy,

205
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.550
and that's Kayla. These are alleys, two children

206
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.970
now alleys two children.

207
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.990
They'll cry if you tell them that they're in their growth.

208
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.390
Caleb believes that he's white. He's got blonde hair, blonde hair,

209
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.640
and you know he's really Pale like me. And when you say, excuse me,

210
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:56.590
you know you're black, he will cry and say, no, I'm not. Either I'm white.

211
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.570
And she's like, you just ruined those kids.

212
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.480
Why don't you want them to be proud of where they came from? I said,

213
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:05.140
I told him he has black in his family, but he is not lying.

214
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.920
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

215
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.970
<v 0>when I got married,</v>

216
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.230
my husband knew beforehand what he was getting into.

217
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.860
He lived in Waverly and he knew she lived in East Jackson,

218
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.420
that I came from a black community.

219
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.500
He'd met my family and said that that was fine with him.

220
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.080
And the further we got into her marriage,

221
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.770
the more I could see him becoming more and more racist.

222
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.370
So they split up, but he still had the right to see his kids.

223
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.370
And during one of the visits I overheard a conversation that he was having with

224
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.700
Caleb and daddy joined a new group and he wanted kill up to join it.

225
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.860
He said, you can't right now,

226
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:50.790
but when you get bigger daddy's going to introduce you to him. And he said,

227
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:55.770
we'd get aware white hats and sheets and we get to beat people up.

228
00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:58.290
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.850
<v 0>and I walk in the room and I'm like, what are you talking about? And he goes,</v>

230
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:03.780
oh, I didn't tell you about that.

231
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.280
<v 4>No.</v>

232
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.080
<v 0>And there was nothing I could do about it. You know,</v>

233
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:11.250
he had visitations on the weekend. Caleb would come back and he would say,

234
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:14.700
the God awfullest things. He would tell my mom, you're a n****r,

235
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.650
you're a n****r, grandma.

236
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.450
We were just sitting there one day and I don't remember exactly,

237
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:22.610
it was a black show on TV that we were watching.

238
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:26.330
I'm thinking it was a Tyler Perry movie, but anyway,

239
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.260
Caleb came up to me and he said, grumble, you're a n****r. I said, no honey,

240
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:34.700
I'm not a n****r. I'm a Negro. And he said, no,

241
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.270
you're a n****r. I said, who told you to say that, Caleb? He said, well,

242
00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:41.450
my dad said he's going to get the KKK and come up here and what he's going to

243
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:45.590
do. And I said, my son saying that in a community where people are all block,

244
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.590
that doesn't give him much of a fighting chance.

245
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.093
Finally

246
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.870
<v 2>he stopped saying it that God, he was young enough to where it could be stopped.</v>

247
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.000
But Caleb is definitely a mini me of Allie, Allie, sister,

248
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.910
Carlotta, you know what I mean? Honestly he,

249
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.630
he acts just like her and Lenexa and even though she's only two years old,

250
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:13.760
she'll go around telling y'all, tell him on black on black.

251
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.620
So I think that will be another Allie Carlotta situation.

252
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.100
As they're growing up, they kind of want more for my family.

253
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.130
I'm not going to say mine, let them be treated the way my sister was treated.

254
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.793
<v 0>They don't deserve that.</v>

255
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.580
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

256
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.720
<v 2>So as long as I can pass for White, I go by white</v>

257
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.040
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

258
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.760
<v 0>sometimes I thought about leaving away, but I love my mom so much and</v>

259
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.060
I could never leave her. But in the event that something ever happens to my mom,

260
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.460
me and my kids will pack up and we will leave the state and we will come back

261
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.150
and I will no longer be associated with this area with East Jackson.

262
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.190
It'll all be just a blur. I mean I want out now,

263
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.800
but I can't leave her

264
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.620
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

265
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.670
<v 0>she knows that. I told her when you're gone, I'm gone.</v>

266
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.493
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

267
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.193
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

268
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.540
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.170
<v 2>but he's her Lou oh cal scheme.</v>

270
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.380
That story was sponsored by Ohio's hill country heritage area and made possible

271
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:01.480
with funding from the Ohio humanities council.

272
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.960
Also want to give a huge thanks to the radio show,

273

275
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.560
They're an amazing show. We should definitely check them out.

276
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.330
State of the reunion.com I'm Jad Abumrad.
