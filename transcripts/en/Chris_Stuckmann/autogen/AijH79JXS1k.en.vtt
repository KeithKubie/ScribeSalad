so<00:30:20.110><c> now</c><00:30:20.260><c> we're</c><00:30:20.440><c> getting</c><00:30:20.620><c> close</c><00:30:20.860><c> to</c><00:30:20.890><c> like</c><00:30:21.190><c> the</c>

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:21.370 align:start position:0%
so now we're getting close to like the
 

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.070 align:start position:0%
so now we're getting close to like the

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:33.990 align:start position:0%
and this is where we learned this thing
 

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.900 align:start position:0%
and this is where we learned this thing
is<00:30:34.170><c> most</c><00:30:34.320><c> certainly</c><00:30:34.740><c> a</c><00:30:34.860><c> creature</c><00:30:35.430><c> it's</c><00:30:35.760><c> an</c>

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:41.550 align:start position:0%
a it drools a lot like the xenomorph and
 

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
a it drools a lot like the xenomorph and
you<00:30:41.850><c> can</c><00:30:42.000><c> clearly</c><00:30:42.390><c> tell</c><00:30:42.480><c> where</c><00:30:42.990><c> I</c><00:30:43.020><c> was</c>

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
you can clearly tell where I was

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:44.670 align:start position:0%
inspired to do that and we just had like
 

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.210 align:start position:0%
inspired to do that and we just had like
a<00:30:44.730><c> really</c><00:30:45.180><c> shitty</c><00:30:45.570><c> mask</c><00:30:45.990><c> that's</c><00:30:46.740><c> all</c><00:30:46.890><c> we</c><00:30:47.040><c> had</c>

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
a really shitty mask that's all we had
 

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
a really shitty mask that's all we had
we<00:30:47.340><c> didn't</c><00:30:47.580><c> have</c><00:30:47.700><c> any</c><00:30:47.970><c> moving</c><00:30:48.330><c> parts</c><00:30:48.510><c> or</c><00:30:48.960><c> jaws</c>

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any moving parts or jaws
 

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.380 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any moving parts or jaws
or<00:30:49.410><c> anything</c><00:30:49.650><c> so</c><00:30:50.040><c> I</c><00:30:50.250><c> could</c><00:30:50.670><c> really</c><00:30:50.850><c> only</c><00:30:51.180><c> show</c>

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.390 align:start position:0%
or anything so I could really only show
 

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.970 align:start position:0%
or anything so I could really only show
it<00:30:51.450><c> a</c><00:30:51.570><c> couple</c><00:30:51.780><c> times</c><00:30:52.050><c> because</c><00:30:52.290><c> if</c><00:30:52.560><c> I</c><00:30:52.620><c> showed</c><00:30:52.860><c> it</c>

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
it a couple times because if I showed it
 

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.830 align:start position:0%
it a couple times because if I showed it
too<00:30:53.160><c> much</c><00:30:53.340><c> it</c><00:30:53.580><c> would</c><00:30:53.640><c> become</c><00:30:53.940><c> really</c><00:30:54.240><c> obvious</c>

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
too much it would become really obvious
 

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.970 align:start position:0%
too much it would become really obvious
that<00:30:54.870><c> it</c><00:30:55.170><c> was</c><00:30:55.380><c> fake</c><00:30:55.830><c> and</c><00:30:57.320><c> we</c><00:30:58.320><c> did</c><00:30:58.470><c> our</c><00:30:58.500><c> best</c><00:30:58.620><c> to</c>

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
that it was fake and we did our best to
 

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.530 align:start position:0%
that it was fake and we did our best to
kind<00:30:59.160><c> of</c><00:30:59.280><c> make</c><00:30:59.400><c> it</c><00:30:59.430><c> seem</c><00:30:59.550><c> like</c><00:30:59.910><c> it</c><00:31:00.090><c> was</c><00:31:00.120><c> cool</c>

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
kind of make it seem like it was cool
 

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
kind of make it seem like it was cool
but<00:31:00.900><c> in</c><00:31:01.230><c> the</c><00:31:01.860><c> end</c><00:31:02.040><c> we</c><00:31:02.460><c> could</c><00:31:02.610><c> only</c><00:31:02.760><c> show</c><00:31:03.090><c> it</c><00:31:03.240><c> in</c>

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:03.330 align:start position:0%
but in the end we could only show it in
 

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
but in the end we could only show it in
certain<00:31:03.540><c> angles</c><00:31:04.050><c> and</c><00:31:04.230><c> share</c><00:31:04.380><c> certain</c><00:31:04.740><c> ways</c><00:31:04.950><c> it</c>
