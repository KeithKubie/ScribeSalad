00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
&gt;&gt; Greg Sanders: Thanks for coming out. My
name is Greg Sanders. I'm a tech writer here

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.870
at Google and I'm also a fiction writer. And
it's my privilege to introduce Jennifer Egan.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.360
She is the author of "The Invisible Circus,"
which was released as a feature film by Fine

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.900
Line in 2001 and is now in my queue, by the
way. "Emerald City and Other Stories," "Look

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.179
at Me," which was nominated for the National
Book Award in 2001, and the bestselling "The

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.300
Keep."

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.199
Her new book, which we'll be discussing today,
is "A Visit From the Goon Squad." It's a national

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.200
bestseller; won the 2007 National Book Critics
Circle Award for fiction and the Pulitzer

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
Prize. Also a journalist, she writes frequently
in the New York Times magazine. Thank you.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.920
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Thank you.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.600
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: For coming out. Do you wanna
briefly describe "Goon Squad" if you haven't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.910
had to do it a hundred times already?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.850
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Actually, I've gotten slightly
better at it because of that. It's actually

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.460
a very hard book to describe, which is one
thing that I really worried about as I was

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.430
working on it. It always helps if something
is just easily characterizable in a sentence

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.430
or two.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.829
But this, in fact, consists of 13 chapters
that are very different from each other in

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.259
mood and tone and feel. And in fact, each
one has a different protagonist and yet, they

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.359
all combine into one story. And some of the
issues braided through it are time and the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.509
music industry.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.350
Basically follows two main characters, a music
producer named Bennie Salazar and his one-time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.659
assistant named Sasha. And it goes backward
and forward through their lives and actually

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.069
also visiting peripheral character's lives
over a span of about 50 years.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.939
I feel like the thing that I can say that
seems to bring it most into focus for people

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.159
is that structurally, my model really was
like the '70s concept album, something like

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.710
Tommy or Quadrophenia, where each piece sounds
different and the fun of it having all of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.170
these different sounding pieces collide together
into one story. That's what I was going for.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.420
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: I think it works really well.
And there are stylistic differences also.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.819
I mean, there's one chapter where there are
no quotation marks, if I remember correctly.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.132
There are these little tweaks. But one thing
I notice is that you use--. There are two

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:07.969
very solid anchors.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.570
You anchor each chapter either with music
and/or technology and time. And I think, I'm

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.041
just wondering if you came upon this method
organically or if you thought like--. I mean,

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:23.470
even the future sections, you're not quite
sure where you are and then you're like, "OK,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.950
this is definitely not now, but it sounds
like a continuation of Twitter, of Facebook,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
of whatnot."

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.530
And then the past sections, there's this,
there's even--. One of the characters says,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.850
"Just wait until the future. We'll be able
to find all of our lost friends." I found

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.280
it really interesting. I'm just wondering
if you consciously did that.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.060
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: its yes and no. My writing
process is extremely organic. I write by hand

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.690
on yellow legal pads. I have handwriting that
cannot be read often even by me, much less

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.790
anyone else, which results in my basically
not knowing what I'm writing as I write it.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.200
And I like that. As a journalist, I write
on a computer and I'm looking at what I'm

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.260
writing and revising it as I go. But as a
fiction writer, I'm looking for the unconscious

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.941
to do what I'm not able to do,

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:14.941
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:15.941
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: not smart enough to do.

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:21.110
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: So, I basically, I follow
the story and wait for it to unfold in this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.840
handwritten way. And then when I have a draft,
I type it up and then I'm very systematic

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.410
and analytical in trying to figure out what
needs to be done with it, what it seems like

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.990
it could be and how to make it be more of
that.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.840
And so in that phase, yes. I do a lot of thinking
about thematic threads and how they're moving

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.490
through and locating people in time and space.
But the basic impulse is really a gut impulse.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.380
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: So, that's the second editorial
layer is putting the rivets in a sense.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.630
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It's a counterpoint because
then, when I execute those changes, I'm again

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.680
doing it by hand on hard copies. So, I write
in my changes, which often involves lots of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.920
strange arabesques and symbols and arrows
leading on to other pages.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.569
And then I have type all that in. So at that
point, I've again veered very much back into

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.160
impulse and instinct. But then ultimately,
when I have another big draft, I read it through

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.780
and make another very systematic outline.
So it seems like a very left brain/right brain--.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.150
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That might be good, that battle.
That battle between the two is probably what

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.150
brings it [inaudible].

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.990
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I don't see it as a battle.
Sometimes, it is a battle.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.990
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Conversational. Conversational.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.150
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Like, why can't you get that
done? But yes. It is more of--. It feels like

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.820
two sides of a process that both must be done
well for it to work.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.520
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right. And the handwritten
early drafts, does that slow down process

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.790
help you creatively?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.600
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Well, it definitely slows
me down. I keep thinking, "Isn't there a way

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.060
to speed this up?" I think it does help me.
I think it helps me in a number of ways. One

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.960
is, as I said, I'm trying to access the unconscious
and I can't seem to do that when I'm looking

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.620
at what I write in a typeface.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.620
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.500
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Now, people have pointed
out that I could always cover the screen of

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.600
the computer and write by hand, but I actually
can't--. I have to admit I haven't tried that.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.150
But I don't really think it would work. I
think there is something about the actual

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.900
physical connection to the language that helps
me and leads to surprises that I can't consciously

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.370
think of and I'm trying to enable that process.
I also have wrestled with the fact that I

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.320
feel like it takes me too long to write books.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.610
And I've often thought, "But if I could do
it on a computer it would be faster&gt;" But

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.300
I've actually started to feel that I think
I want time to pass as I'm writing a book.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.950
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. I think it's a good
thing, actually. I mean, for example, I use

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.870
a manual typewriter. I type a lot of these
up and I find that there's a more forceful

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.150
relationship with the language on the page
when you're physically doing it as opposed

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.150
to--.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.230
I mean, you can type really quickly, obviously,
on a computer, but I wonder rhetorically how

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.860
does it change my relationship with the content
that I'm writing?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.919
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It's interesting, though.
Gabriel Garcia Marquez got on a word processer

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.240
and never looked back.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.560
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: So, it's interesting how
it works differently for each writer. And

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.620
so much of the challenge for me, and I think
really for everyone, is just finding out what

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.130
works for you. And you do that by trial and
error.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.790
I do occasionally edit on a screen if I'm
really stuck and I feel like I don't know

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.650
what I'm trying to do and I wanna move it
forward a step. And I don't want to sit there

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.790
not knowing what to do and doing it slowly.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.790
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.100
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I figure if I don't know
what I'm doing and I'm just gonna flail, let's

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.170
do it faster. That's the only time. But generally,
I find as I'm typing in changes, I'm thinking

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.449
of this right now 'cause I'm doing it today.
I have a manuscript. I've made a bunch of

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.210
edits. I'm bringing it to my writing group
tonight and so, I have to type in all these

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.210
edits.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.790
And as I'm doing it, I find myself thinking,
"Wait a minute. Wouldn't it be better this

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.060
way?" I'm wanting to edit on the screen. But
I really try to resist that temptation because

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.720
generally, those changes are wrong. And once
I see it on the page again, I have to change

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.720
them back.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.479
And I think, "Why did I do that?" But as we
move into a world of reading more on screens,

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.750
it leads to the question of how much it matters
how it looks on the page. So I don't know.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.729
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Well, I was actually gonna
ask that. That was one of my questions is,

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:19.449
how do you think is, we've become so enmeshed
in our relationship with our devices and technology

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:24.660
and paperless books. How do you think that
affects, that's going to affect narrative

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.750
forms like the novel?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.520
And should it affect the way a writer thinks
about his or her readers?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.979
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: The answer is I truly don't
know. I mean, it's clearly affected me to

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.930
some degree. I mean, I've written a chapter
in a form that's really meant to be viewed

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.821
digitally. So obviously, I've been impacted
by the notion of digital reading.

00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:44.821
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right. We'll get to that.

00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:49.440
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But I've never used an e-reader.
And in fact, I only have had a smartphone

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.570
for two days. So I'm pretty behind.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.590
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: We won't ask what kind.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.740
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Don't ask how well I'm texting
on it. That's what's really sad, speaking

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.580
of taking a long time. So, I don't know. I
mean, I have a complicated relationship to

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.480
technology as I think we all do. I'm afraid
of it. I mean, in a simple way, like, "Oh

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.220
my God. Maybe I won't know how to use it."

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.300
Afraid of the implications of it in a bigger
way. I think there's always the fear that

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.669
it will somehow make the world worse. And
if you look at early reactions to the telephone,

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:25.180
it was exactly the same. And you guys probably
know more about all this than I do. But I

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.580
think we still feel it.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.000
It's the sense of hurdling forward. Where
will that lead us? Things change so fast.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.719
I had this sense, I taught at NYU the spring
before this last spring and I taught undergrads.

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:43.899
And one reason I wanted to do it was I thought
I wanna know what "young people" are doing

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:47.880
and thinking about right now. Often, my journalism
keeps me up to date with that, but I felt

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.510
a little confused about it in terms of technology.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:56.460
But the thing that was so funny was these
20- and 21-year olds felt old because they

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.260
felt like, oh, teenagers now have really grown
up with Facebook, but we didn't. So, we're

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.130
the dinosaurs. And I thought, "Wow. I wonder
if technology is moving so fast that everyone

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.130
feels old."

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.310
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: You can't keep up.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.010
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I find myself commiserating
with 21-year olds about how 14-year olds were

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.930
way ahead of all of us. And I thought maybe
the 14-year olds are looking at the two-year

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.560
olds thinking, "Well, they know how to use
iPhones. They've grown up with them and I

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.270
didn't have that experience." So, who knows?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.390
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. I mean, speaking about
two-year olds and technology, there's the

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.610
latter part of your novel projects us forward,
I don't know, ten, fifteen years later. I'm

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.610
not sure.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.610
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah, something like that.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.270
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: And there is a foreboding
relationship with technology. I mean, there's

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:44.201
two threads, or two elements. One is there's
this kind of, people act as ads. I mean, they're

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:52.050
paid to do the equivalent of tweet and update
their posts or whatnot to create excitement

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.640
an event that's going to happen.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.640
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Right.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.310
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: And I found that really, really
interesting. So, you're saying you have a

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.290
troubled relationship, but you also seem to
use that.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.290
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But I'm fascinated.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.070
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. And then there's also
a section where there's this young couple

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.880
that we meet earlier, much earlier in the
novel. And then we see them in the future

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.050
and they have a two-year old daughter. Maybe
she's a little younger. And there's this sort

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.050
of--. Everyone's got this--.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.290
There's this ubiquitous communications texting
device that everyone has and they're like,

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.830
they don't want her to touch it.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.350
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Right. There's also been
one invented for kids.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.460
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right, exactly.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.610
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Called a Starfish. But when
I imagined that, it was pre-iPhone. And in

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.640
a way, I feel like that fantasy's already
obsolete because the iPhone is kind of what

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640
I imagined.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.900
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Something bright and candy-like
that would be really easy. It would have a

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.651
touch screen and would be really fun and easy
for kids to use and buy stuff on. I mean,

00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:46.620
I am a two-day smartphone user and my children
have already bought apps on it.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.890
I mean, they're not two, but--. In a way I
feel like that's already been superseded.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:58.350
So, yeah, I think in that chapter one feels
some anxiety about technology. At the same

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.441
time, creatively it is so exciting to me.

00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:02.441
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah.

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:06.140
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I mean it's just thrilling
to think about new forms and genres that become

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.000
possible through technology. And to me, the
novel, while many people feel that it's imperiled

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.430
by all of this, I don't actually feel that
way because to me the novel has always been

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:26.400
a very flexible, elastic, open form. If you
look at the earliest fiction, Cervantes and

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.820
Laurence Sterne, that stuff is out there.
It's meta--

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.529
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: I'm reading Don Quixote now.
Unbelievable.

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:34.420
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Tristram Shandy has crazy
graphics in there. I mean, if PowerPoint existed

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:39.252
he would've been using it. So, I feel like
they're all kinds of things that are possible.

00:11:39.252 --> 00:11:46.390
And that is really exciting to me, even as
I, myself, am clearly not an early adapter.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.250
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Well, I think in some ways
you are. I mean, you're pushing the envelope.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.350
I mean, especially--. Can we talk about one
of the chapters that I really love?

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.550
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Sure.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:01.420
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: For those of you that have
the book. Well, it starts on 230-something.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.800
But it's basically, I guess, also a projection
of the future and if this--. It's an entire

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.089
chapter. The entire narrative is done, you
said with PowerPoint?

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:10.110
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah, I did it with PowerPoint.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.110
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: And--.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.110
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It could've been any slide.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.130
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: It could've been, right, exactly.
And narrated basically by a young woman.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.811
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: A twelve-year old.

00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:23.560
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: A twelve-year old and she's
writing about her autistic brother, or--?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:30.970
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: He's an Asperger. He clearly
has trouble with socialization. He has Asperger’s

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.990
obsession with the pauses in rock and roll
songs.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.500
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Pauses in rock and roll. It's
called "Great Rock and Roll Pauses." And I

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.490
thought it was really great. And the thing
is there's a narrative momentum in it. And

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:45.430
it's not standard, obviously words on page.
I was just wondering. I actually saw an interview

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.450
with you on PBS and you mention that you handed
this chapter and after, to the publisher,

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.050
and after the initial manuscript?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:57.320
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah, the book was sold and
this chapter wasn't in it. I had been obsessed

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:03.071
with working in PowerPoint. And in a way,
that obsession I think epitomizes my odd relationship

00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:07.760
to technology because I really wanted to write
a chapter in PowerPoint, but I had never used

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760
PowerPoint.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.370
I wasn't even totally sure what it was. And
I didn't have it. I said to some friends in

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:21.180
the corporate world, "I wanna learn more about
what you do. Send me a few PowerPoints." And

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.250
I discovered I couldn't open them because
I actually didn't own PowerPoint.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.250
[laughter]

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.250
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.290
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And then, when I looked into
it further, I determined that I actually didn't

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:33.000
have enough memory in my laptop to hold it.
And it was expensive. So, I thought, "You

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.680
know what? To hell with it. I write by hand,
so I'm gonna do PowerPoint by hand."

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.550
So I sat down and drew rectangles on my yellow
legal pad and thought, "All right. Let's get

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.160
some PowerPoint happening here." Of course,
it went nowhere. I mean, if you're gonna work

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.720
in a genre, you have to be in the genre. So
ultimately, I bit the bullet and bought the

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.029
program and did all this.

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:59.910
But even when I had done that and I was struggling
to figure out not so much how to use it because

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:05.100
it's easy, but what it meant to work in it.
Because initially I thought, "OK. It's just

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.110
bullet points." But in fact, that's not a
very sophisticated use of PowerPoint at all.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.170
But my biggest problem, and the biggest hindrance,
and the reason I hadn't gotten far with it

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.490
and sold the book without it was that I didn't
like the corporate feeling of it. There was

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.450
just this corporate smell to it

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.450
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah, the feeling.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.740
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: that seemed really unappealing
and antithetical to the feeling I look for

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.190
in fiction.
And so, I couldn't figure out a way around

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.850
that so I thought, "OK. You know what? I can't
make this work." So, I sold the book and then

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:40.570
after that, there were a couple of things
that were really nagging at me. The main one

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:46.320
was that Sasha, one of the major characters,
I was not able to find a way to visit her

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.740
in her future life, whereas Bennie, the other
one, appears in the chapter we were just talking

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.740
about.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:58.272
And that seemed really asymmetrical and wrong.
And so, that was nagging at me. And then there

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:02.170
was the fact that I hadn't found a way to
use the PowerPoint. And a third obsession

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.779
that I hadn't found a way to work in, which
was an obsession with the pauses in rock and

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.100
roll songs.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.670
And then all of a sudden, I had this brain
wave that if a kid was the PowerPoint narrator,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.540
it would undermine the corporate feeling.
It just couldn't be there really in a kid's

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.660
voice, and that if it was one of Sasha's kids,
I would've found a way to visit her in her

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.950
future. And then as it turned out, I even
managed to get the rock and roll pauses in

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.950
there.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.950
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.740
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Because she's writing mostly
about the tension in her family life resulting

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:39.700
from her brother's obsession with these pauses
and her father's absolute, not rage, but deep

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.820
frustration at being lectured at about pauses
in rock and roll songs endlessly by his son,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:50.959
thus being reminded of his son's trouble and
difficulty socializing with other kids.

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:57.510
And so there's all this--. I mean, it's a
loving family, but a family with issues and

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:03.779
struggles like every family. And this twelve-year
old is its chronicler. And she uses PowerPoint.

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:09.519
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. She's taking a course
in making slides and I think she quotes something

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:13.090
from the class, "Add a graphic, get more traffic."
Right? I mean, that sounds like something

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.090
you'd hear here.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.140
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Word wall is a long haul.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.170
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah, exactly. Word wall is
a long haul.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.300
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I should've gone into advertising.
It's clear that she's learned this at school.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.389
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: So these kids are gonna be
basically in this version of the future. These

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:30.830
kids are just completely conversant in graphical
representations of information. That was really

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.830
interesting.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.170
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Well, I think that's somewhat
true already. In fact, it was funny 'cause

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:39.389
I thought, "This is a crazy idea that a twelve-year
old is using PowerPoint." People are gonna

00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:41.070
just die at the thought of that.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.130
And so I mentioned it to a friend of mine
and she said, "Jenny, my twelve-year old just

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.670
did a presentation in school in PowerPoint
last week." I mean, this has already happened.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:57.470
And I said "Oh, OK. I won't get credit for
futurism on that one." But yes. She keeps

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:03.149
her journal in slides and this makes her mother
very uncomfortable so Sasha, my main character,

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:07.299
because she keeps saying, "Why aren't you
writing? What's all that white space? Where

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:08.459
does the writing come in?"

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.100
So, it becomes an object of mother/daughter
tension, too.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.630
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah, there's a lot going
on in that chapter. I thought it was really

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.819
great. And I understand, tying into that,
I've also heard you say you don't write about

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:26.520
your own life, but it sounds like you write
about maybe little overlaps. You allow characters

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.320
to carry around your interests or obsessions.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.770
I mean, the rock and roll pauses, you said,
was actually yours. That's actually something

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.100
that's been on your mind. Is that right?

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.830
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. I think I do that a
lot, actually. I think I have ideas that are

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.760
interesting, but not all that interesting.
Not interesting enough to do much with on

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.150
their own. And instead of pursuing them myself,
thank God, I just give them to characters.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.520
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That makes sense.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.350
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I hope that becomes slightly
more interesting. There's another one that

00:17:53.350 --> 00:18:00.549
sneaked in there. There's an art historian
who wants to write a book about representations

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:07.470
of sound in Cezanne's paintings, whether his
brushstrokes of his outdoor, green and orange

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:13.440
landscapes are actually trying to suggest
the sound of locusts at that time of year.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.100
I had this thought myself and I thought, "That's
an amazing idea. Maybe I should pursue it."

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.300
And then I thought, I don't know, it immediately
translated into "wouldn't it be interesting

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.890
if someone else was interested in that?"

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.320
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right. It provides that character
with a quirky richness.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.840
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: So thank God I didn't take
a two-year detour trying to somehow turn this

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.919
into an art historical thesis.

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:35.919
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: It's not too late, though.

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:40.980
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I think it's too late. But
yes. I do that all the time. I have ideas

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.799
that I--. I flirt with ideas that I think
are interesting and then I give them to characters.

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:47.690
I think that's the right home for most of
them.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.910
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. I think it works. And
one other one I noticed that also was a segue

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:57.400
into one of the other threads is the technology
that's the anchor, and then there's the music

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.690
anchor of mostly punk. I mean, Bennie Salazar
is an ex-punk rocker and we meet some of his

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.100
friends along the timeline, past and the future.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.880
And he's got this great internal monologue.
I think he's driving down the West Side Highway

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.640
listening to the Dead Kennedy's. And he's
basically saying like, "I know why punk died.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.650
I know why music dies, 'cause it's digital
music production." There's no longer hiss.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:26.240
There's no longer imperfections or pops. And
I was wondering if that was something, if

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:33.270
that was--. I mean, I think there's something
about digital processing that removes the

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.270
edges.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.290
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That actually was not my
idea. I read a piece by Neil Young in Harpers

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:45.400
years ago. It had to have been--. It was actually
just as CDs were becoming ubiquitous. And

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:53.130
he decrying this digital sound and saying
that he thought it would basically kill music.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:58.380
And his point was, we'll somehow recover from
this, but it's gonna be really hard. And that

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.080
always really struck me because I thought
it was fantastic. Everyone was so excited

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.450
about the clarity of the sound.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.450
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.890
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And that was exactly the
thing that he abhorred and thought was, in

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:15.790
a way, unmusical and inhuman. And so, that
idea stayed with me and I think I gave that

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.790
idea to Bennie.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.210
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: You gave that to Bennie. Yeah.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.210
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:27.120
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Do you think that there is
a punk sensibility to the novel? I mean, it's

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.690
nonlinear. It's slightly disruptive as far
as a narrative form goes. And I interpreted

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:37.169
that, it might just be me, but I interpreted
that. I was like, "It's just a punk, punk-ish--."

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:41.350
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I didn't think so. I mean,
I certainly thought of it as an album, as

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:47.520
I said. And it's been pointed out to me since
that my PowerPoint chapter, which is the second

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.240
to last, basically functions as a kind of
musical pause in the book because it happens

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.559
right at that point that I think pauses are
best used when you're close to the end of

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:58.559
the song.

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:01.380
The pause makes you think the song will end
and then it doesn't. So, there's this rush

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.870
of relief followed by sadness because then
the song does end. It heightens awareness

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:13.580
of the song passing, or of time passing. So,
I think there was a musical idea behind the

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580
construction.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.960
Punk rock sensibility, I don't know. I mean,
I think one thing that I didn't understand

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:28.530
actually, was how permeated the book is by
music. In a way, I was interested in it and

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.390
certainly did research on it and I knew that
my characters were in that industry. But for

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.710
example, when the book first came out, we
didn't really reach out to the music world

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.919
at all in terms of publicity, which I think
was odd in retrospect.

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:46.970
Eventually, that world found it on its own,
but months later. So I think I didn't think

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:52.251
of it as a "rock and roll" novel. And I think
that helped me because in a way, there are

00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:55.860
a lot of interesting books in that genre,
and High Fidelity and others.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.910
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.559
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And I think I might have
been intimidated just as I didn't think in

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:05.100
the last chapter, or the two last chapters,
leaping into the future, I am writing science

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.820
fiction, another genre I'm not that familiar
with and would be in a way tentative about

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:17.090
venturing into. So, I didn't focus on that
too much. I guess the answer is I don't know.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.090
I don't know.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.000
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah. I also thinks it's maybe
not a completely fair question because readers

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.460
are gonna bring their own nostalgia into it.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That's it.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.600
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: And I was, I saw The Ramones
in '81 at The Palladium. I saw them a couple

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.789
of times and it was exciting. It was terrifying
and I was--. I can identify even though your

00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:37.270
early punk scenes, I guess late '70s, early
'80s, took place in San Francisco and I was

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.580
in New York, I was like, there. But of course,
I was bringing all of my own material into

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.059
it. So then I was like, "Oh, yeah. It's kind
of a punk novel."

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:48.710
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: You know what I think? I
think there's a desire out there for a punk

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.710
novel.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.710
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.650
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And I think people have been
willing to consider this, that, for me to

00:22:53.650 --> 00:23:01.530
fulfill that desire. And I feel lucky to have
somehow tapped into a collective musical wish.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:07.230
I didn't think it myself, but I was very excited
to write about that moment in the late '70s,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.480
that punk rock moment which I witnessed very
much on the sidelines.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.270
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: I was gonna ask, were you
there? Oh, from the sidelines. But you still

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.270
witnessed it.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.090
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. I was definitely there,
but I didn't have green hair.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.090
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:23.410
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I looked like me, but I think
I just felt the strangeness and the newness

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.251
of it. And I think it was especially vivid
because this was all happening in San Francisco

00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:32.450
where I and all of my friends had grown up
in the '70s, basically feeling like we had

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.390
the worst timing in the world to have missed
the '60s.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:42.150
Like, how lame to have had all of that happen
and be too young to have any part in it? And

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.600
my parents weren't hippies at all. I mean,
we got there in '69 and they were very straight-laced.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.881
And I feel like I saw hippies out the window
of the car. So, there was such a sense of

00:23:51.881 --> 00:23:53.559
nostalgia.

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:58.070
We were all trying to recreate that moment.
I mean, I would walk around barefoot all day

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.000
in a city. Like, it seems crazy now.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.970
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: I thought that's what you're
supposed to do in San Francisco.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.799
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: They haven't been doing that
for a while. I mean, my mother didn't love

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:13.260
that. But it wasn't like, I mean, she didn't
threaten to institutionalize me. It felt OK

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:20.381
to be doing that. And then punk rock was such
an overt repudiation of all of what, of everything

00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:22.760
about the '60s counter-culture.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:31.610
It's music. It's mood. It's optimism. It's
sense of coherence. Basically, it was just

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:37.549
a big fuck you to all that, which in one way
you would think maybe that could've been disappointing

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:44.909
or shocking. But I felt that it was exciting.
I still love the '60s stuff, but I love the

00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:46.860
idea that something new is on its way in.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:54.090
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah, I think it was a very
exciting time. I was happy to see the mention

00:24:54.090 --> 00:25:00.320
of The Dead Kennedys and Jello Biafra. And
I was like, "Oh." My brother used to come

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.370
home with the vinyl and I would look at it.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.370
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: He's a legendary San Francisco
figure.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.370
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:09.070
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: He ran for mayor while I
was living there. And he's still out and about.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.390
In fact, there's someone writing a book about
him. He was an interesting character.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.390
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Yeah.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:20.000
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: In a way, he was a host figure.
He would welcome bands from other cities and

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.540
these scenes were so local. He was really
an eminence, ultimately, of the scene there.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:33.171
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That's interesting. You mentioned
a little bit your internal process, or I guess

00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:37.960
your external process of working with a manuscript.
What about, and this is an abstract question,

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.210
but is there a way of describing the process
of your imagination, like how you come up

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.210
with ideas?

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.330
How you manage that and how you get them out
on paper.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.500
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. Basically, in a way,
it's fairly simple because it is so unconscious

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:58.570
and intuitive, but what I really begin with
is a time and a place. Ideally, I don't have

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:04.480
too much more than that. I just need to know
when and where. So, for "Goon Squad" it was

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.669
very specific.

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:10.750
I was actually trying to work on a different
book, a historical novel that I'm really hoping

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:18.381
to start very soon. But I was having trouble
getting back into the research that I had

00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:23.740
done. And I was in a hotel bathroom. I look
down. I saw a wallet under the sink 'cause

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.780
I was washing my hands and I thought, "Oh,
my God. How could someone leave her bag with

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.370
a wallet right there?"

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.640
I immediately, I mean, I guess this is about
as close as I get to my own experience. It

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.860
connected instantly with experiences in own
of being robbed, which I have been a ridiculous

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.659
number of times and ways, not including physical
violence.

00:26:44.659 --> 00:26:51.570
But there was one particular time that was
really tough when my wallet was stolen and

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.790
then I got a call from a Citibank employee
who was very lovely and professional and said,

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.480
"We have this service that will help you get
your new cards set up and pull yourself out

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480
of this."

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.840
And I was very upset. This was probably 18
years ago and I cried on the phone and I said,

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.850
"I'm going out of town and don't have an ID.
What am I gonna do?" I poured my story out

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.540
to her and she said, "It'll all be fine. It
happens all the time." Then it came time to

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.820
choose a new pin number for my cash card and
somehow in the course of doing that, I somehow

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.330
mentioned my old pin number.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:30.620
And the conversation ended rather quickly
at that point because she was the thief. So,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.750
she rushed to the nearest cash machine and
overdrew my checking account and I was just--.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.500
I mean, I was just flipping out before that.
You can imagine the state I was in after.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:47.980
I was in orbit of misery. And I kept thinking,
"I talked to her. I talked to her on the phone."

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.700
But what I was left with when everything calmed
down and of course the bank reimbursed me

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.210
'cause they're insured for that. I kept thinking,
"What was it like from her side?"

00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:03.549
Like, who was she? I became fascinated. I
wish that I could find her. And so I think

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:07.410
in this moment of looking at the wallet, I
thought, "Someone's gonna take that." And

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:13.730
then I thought, "Well, I'm the only one here."
And then my mind leapt into the--. I guess

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.779
somehow touched on that old experience and
my curiosity about the point of view opposing

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:19.779
mine.

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:22.919
I know my own point of view. I know what it's
like to have a wallet stolen. There's nothing

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:27.880
interesting about that to me. But stealing
it, that's interesting. So I thought, "OK.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.169
I'm gonna just for a break tomorrow, I'm gonna
start there. A woman sees a wallet and she

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.169
takes it."

00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:38.010
And that's really all I knew. I didn't know
who she was. I didn't know why she would take

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.620
it, what the context was. I just started there
and started writing. And in the course of

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.980
doing it, I learned that she was actually,
she was taking the wallet, but also she was

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.990
in her shrink's office later describing the
experience of taking the wallet and what happened.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.440
I learned that she was on a date. All of these
things happened in the writing itself. But

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.640
the doorway in was a time and a place. And
that's pretty typical for me.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.690
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That's interesting. And you
just managed to, in your mind, you just managed

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.620
those threads. I mean, you had some, I think
all this stuff had been--. You had some existing

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.341
narratives out there, right? There was a piece
in the New Yorker.

00:29:13.341 --> 00:29:16.631
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Some. Four of the pieces
were older. Well, the New Yorker, they were

00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:19.760
all published as free-standing stories as
I worked. But, yeah.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.660
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Oh, I see. OK. That was gonna
be my question. Basically, they weren't published

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.510
ahead of time and then you--. Did you have
the novel in mind? The entire arc of the novel

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.510
when you published them?

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.960
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: No. In fact, I never even
really thought of it as a novel, honestly.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.611
I had four chapters that were older that had
been published in the '90s. And then I had

00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:41.520
this new stuff that seemed exciting. I didn't
really know how it would fit together.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.510
I think the other element that's important
is there's a time and a place and then often

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.020
there is some abstract questions floating
around in my mind. Like, with my novel "Look

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:58.590
At Me," I had been thinking for a while how
is mass media and image culture changing our

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.230
inner lives, our sense of who we are to ourselves,
or has it?

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:08.610
So, that's pretty abstract. You wouldn't necessarily
think that would lead to any kind of fun fiction,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:15.010
but that coupled with some times and places
evolved into a book. With "The Keep," I was

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:24.419
interested in--. I was basically interested
in if or how our ubiquitous disembodied communication

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:28.770
because we're now in constant disembodied
communication with each other, might mimic

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:33.470
the gothic experience in which people are
remote places and there's this possibility

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.220
of the supernatural all the time.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.640
Is there something supernatural about remote
communication? I guess that was my question,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.340
but then the time and the place, where a guy
arrives at a castle in an unspecified European

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.140
country, in roughly the present day.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.860
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: It might be the Czech Republic.
It might be Germany.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.090
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. They're not even sure.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.090
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: They're not sure.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.500
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: So, with this one, I would
say the abstract questions were, really it

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.159
was just one, which is what would a contemporary
novel about time look like? And the reason

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:08.929
I was asking that question was that I had
finally read all of Proust's novels. It took

00:31:08.929 --> 00:31:13.210
me a while. I mean, I had read a couple of
volumes in my early 20s.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:19.450
Loved all the obsessive love stuff. Very bored
by the time and the nostalgia.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.450
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.780
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: 'Cause in a way, in the early
20s, who cares? But revisited it with a book

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:31.950
group around my late 30s when it all read
a little differently. And so, we read the

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.080
novel over about five years, 'cause we were
all doing other things. And actually, I think

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.290
we had five children among us in those years.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:46.770
So, we had unfold in real time our lives passed
as the book unfolded. And I thought, I mean,

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:54.070
it's a book that's explicitly about time,
mimics the effect of time passing. It's just

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:59.450
exquisite in its execution. And yet, of course
it's thousands of pages. And I thought how

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.710
could you do that and capture the feeling
of time passing now in a more economical fashion,

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.750
which feels more contemporary.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:13.230
That was the abstract question. The other
thing is music plays a huge part in Proust's

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:18.480
novel, both as a plot element and as an organizational
principle. I had wanted to write about the

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.160
music industries with journalists and begged
and pleaded for an assignment for years because

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.350
I just wanted to learn about the industry.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:35.490
The closest I got was an assignment to write
about a pair of identical twin rappers, female,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:42.370
called Dyme. D-Y-M-E. In the late '90s. And
their album was just about to some out, supposedly.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:50.360
So, this led to my most embarrassing journalistic
moment when at a party for a Biggie album

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.580
release, I actually asked someone where Biggie
was.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:02.240
Thus leading to the reply, "He's dead." Which
was a low point for me, journalistically.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.559
But anyway, I love these, these were lovely
women and very talented, but what I began

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:12.159
to realize as I was following them was their
album actually wasn't going to be released.

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:14.929
I could just feel that it wasn't happening.

00:33:14.929 --> 00:33:19.880
And of course, the industry was in trouble
by then and I think they were a casualty of

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.500
that. As soon as I told my editor I don't
think the album is gonna be released, of course

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.760
he said, "Well, you're off the story, so stop
following them." And that was it. But a little

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.570
of their DNA I think did end up in "Goon Squad"
because I have a sister group called Stop/Go.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.790
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Exactly.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:38.809
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: These women had an orange--.
They lived with their parents and they had

00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:42.820
an orange shag carpeted recording studio.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.700
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Basement studio, right?

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:50.409
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I guess I finally wanted--.
They were actually very talented, unlike the

00:33:50.409 --> 00:33:58.059
Stop /Go sisters. But anyway, so time and
music as abstract interests converged with

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:04.060
this time and place, which was the present
day. I think that one--. At the beginning

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.910
I did not think I was writing a book, I should
say that. I just thought I was writing some

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:14.679
stories to kill time, or not really that,
amuse myself while I waited begin this other

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:21.579
book. And what kept happening was that I wrote
the first one. And in the course of that,

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:26.480
there's a brief mention of Sasha's boss, a
record producer who sprinkles gold flakes

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.679
in his coffee and sprays pesticide to his
armpits.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:34.960
And I thought at the time, "Decadent music
producer. They have such crazy habits." But

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.750
then after I finished it I thought, "Yeah,
but why does he do that stuff?" That's just

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.219
a stereotype, but there's always a logic to
it.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:43.759
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: You find out he has his reasons.

00:34:43.759 --> 00:34:47.779
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. So I thought, "I think
I might write a chapter about him and just

00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:52.399
find out why he does that stuff." So, I wrote
what became chapter two. And what was fun

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:57.660
about it was that Sasha, the thief; it takes
place earlier in time. She's still his assistant

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.160
and she's this opaque, secondary character.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.819
And so, I thought I liked that movement from
she had been so central and now she's peripheral.

00:35:07.819 --> 00:35:13.299
It's at an earlier moment. And then, there
was a brief mention in that chapter of Bennie's

00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:19.650
ex-wife who's now an avid doubles player at
a country club. And I thought, "Yeah, but

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.650
what is she like?"

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.749
I mean, she marries this music producer and
then ends up a doubles player. What's that

00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:29.339
about? So I thought, "OK, one more and that
is it." So, I wrote a chapter about her, which

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:34.880
comes later in the book. And in a way, once
I had written that one, I realized I was hooked.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:41.019
But in terms of having an overall vision,
I didn't except to say, and this was the analytical

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:47.229
side of me, what is interesting or fun about
this for me? And it seemed to me that there

00:35:47.229 --> 00:35:52.440
were three things that I wanted to keep doing
as I moved through the material.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.430
One was that each chapter would be about a
different person. Two was that each would

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:01.869
be technically different from all of the others,
so that they would not feel like one book.

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:05.859
The voice, if you will, of each would be different,
which is another way of saying that technically

00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:06.859
they would need to be different.

00:36:06.859 --> 00:36:07.859
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:10.920
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: And then three was that each
would stand on its own. And so, those were

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.729
my criteria. And I didn't meet them every
time. I mean, there was stuff I couldn't use.

00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:18.890
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: The third one is the toughest
I think. It's almost like a program. I mean

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.029
to have each entity stand on its own. I mean,
I think it works, but that seems--

00:36:23.029 --> 00:36:24.029
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It was hard.

00:36:24.029 --> 00:36:25.029
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: very, very difficult.

00:36:25.029 --> 00:36:28.729
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But you know what I found?
I didn't have any close calls. The material

00:36:28.729 --> 00:36:34.599
either fit all of them or wildly missed on
every count. So when they were bad, they were

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:39.660
really, really bad. It wasn't like two out
of three, one out of three. It was always

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.029
zero out of three or three out of three.

00:36:42.029 --> 00:36:43.029
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:36:43.029 --> 00:36:45.859
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: With a lot of work. But there
were some things that I really slogged away

00:36:45.859 --> 00:36:52.441
on hoping that I could make work and could
not. And I never knew why. But it seemed like

00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:56.479
it just had to do with not being able to find
a fresh angle or approach.

00:36:56.479 --> 00:37:01.880
Not being able to find an interesting enough
story about these people that would require

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.510
telling in a different way. And so, it had
to go.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.319
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Did you have to re-tool any
of the previously published stuff, or what

00:37:10.319 --> 00:37:11.319
that pretty much--

00:37:11.319 --> 00:37:14.729
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Very little in fact, because
it wasn't just a matter of trying to work

00:37:14.729 --> 00:37:19.920
that stuff in. That stuff led the way with
various plot elements--

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.920
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: OK. That makes sense.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.829
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: in the book. So, once I realized
that those four, which had no connection to

00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:30.759
each other at all, were all gonna be part
of this, it helped me form the landscape.

00:37:30.759 --> 00:37:41.009
So, yeah, that was an odd, organic hole that
seemed to have been existing in pieces without

00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:42.640
my knowing it.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.349
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Very interesting. I wanted
to--. We should probably do Q&amp;A in a couple

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:49.950
of minutes. I just have one last question.
'Cause you're talking about Proust and you

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:57.559
have two chunks as the epigraph and one of
them is, to quote Proust, "The unknown element

00:37:57.559 --> 00:38:02.170
in the lives of other people is like that
of nature, which each fresh scientific discovery

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.249
merely reduces, but not abolish."

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:11.019
And I thought that was and this is my interpretation
we're now talking about technology, no matter

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:16.039
how connected we might seem to be, there's
still that mystery of trying to understand

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:19.890
how people work, how to get inside their minds.
Am I way off?

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.339
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It's so interesting. Well,
no, of course not because it's out of my hands

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:27.729
if that's what you saw there. I wasn't thinking
of that consciously, although I am very interested

00:38:27.729 --> 00:38:28.729
in that.

00:38:28.729 --> 00:38:32.529
For example, with "Look At Me," as I said
before, I was interested in whether our inner

00:38:32.529 --> 00:38:39.309
lives, whether the kind of disappearance of
privacy or the will towards self-revelation

00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:44.450
had changed the way we are in our deepest
parts. And the very fact that I was asking

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:48.079
the question I think gives away the fact that
I believe the answer was yes.

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:52.569
Like, we're not the same anymore. We're different
humans than we used to be. But what I felt

00:38:52.569 --> 00:38:56.229
in the course of writing the book, I actually
came to exactly the opposite conclusion. There's

00:38:56.229 --> 00:38:59.039
just something in us that cannot be revealed.

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:00.039
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:05.930
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: What's clear is there's,
on the part of many people as a broader sensibility,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:11.000
a desire to reveal more. And maybe even a
desire to reveal everything. But it can't

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.690
be done, I ended up feeling.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:19.260
There's just something about us that can't
be known. In that, what I was thinking of

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:25.319
more, was what I hoped would be a fun aspect
of the book, which was there are these people

00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:33.390
that you see from a distance and then suddenly,
you're inside their own minds.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.890
Having a different protagonist in each chapter,
I was hoping I think, to mimic that experience

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.709
of seeing someone out of the corner of your
eye walking down the street and thinking,

00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:47.249
"Huh, where are they going? Who are they?"
Of course, you rarely find out. But I love

00:39:47.249 --> 00:39:50.079
the idea of having that payoff 13 times.

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:54.369
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That's exactly right. As the
writer, of course, you can go in there and

00:39:54.369 --> 00:40:02.140
create those. That was interesting. I guess
we should do Q&amp;A. If there are questions out

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:07.079
there you should come up to the microphones.
Are there any? Yes.

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:15.366
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Hi. I was wondering,
since the process is so organic and took place

00:40:15.366 --> 00:40:16.366
over so much time, how do you know when it's
done?

00:40:16.366 --> 00:40:19.259
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That's a good question. I
mean, in a certain sense it never is. There's

00:40:19.259 --> 00:40:23.469
a chapter I read aloud a lot where I have
made a few improvements, I will confess. The

00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:28.140
text has deviated from the one that's printed.
So, there's a way in which it's never done.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:35.759
I think that I'm always trying to reach various
milestones that allow me to move on in various

00:40:35.759 --> 00:40:39.710
ways. So, there's the point where I'm just
writing it on my own. And then I have this

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.819
writing group, which is a very important part
of my process. I often will just bring things

00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:48.809
in to them and say, "Is it alive? Is there
even a pulse?"

00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:54.089
Which is an important thing to find out. I
spent my very first attempt at writing a novel,

00:40:54.089 --> 00:41:01.150
I was in a vacuum for two years and I wrote
just a completely dead object, which without

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:08.529
a glimmer of interest or tension or anything.
And I would prefer not to make that mistake

00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:09.529
again.

00:41:09.529 --> 00:41:14.339
So, I try to get a sense of whether anything's
happening at all. And then as I work more

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:20.369
on it, I'll show the whole thing to various
readers, and each time revising. So, with

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:26.220
every one of those iterations, I'm moving
through a process. Then there's the point

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.859
where the book is sold.

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:32.449
And then you do revisions. And then there
are two or three sets of page proofs and each

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:37.839
time I'm making changes. Ideally, the changes
are getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:43.549
But there does come that last point where
I know I'm basically signing off.

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:49.290
And often, I'll have a weird vertiginous sense
of, "Wait, that's all wrong. It should all

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:56.270
be changed." But I can't. So, I guess one
moves closer and closer to a point when it's

00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:01.750
not possible to change it. And yet, it actually
is still possible because then you have further

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.259
editions and there are mistakes to be corrected.

00:42:04.259 --> 00:42:08.950
So, the way I sometimes think of it is, it's
two points that get closer and closer together.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.849
And of course, the space between them can
be subdivided infinitely, but they get close

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:16.479
enough that they're practically touching.
And then you have to stop.

00:42:16.479 --> 00:42:17.479
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Thank you.

00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:20.470
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: I think that's an asymptote.
You have a line approaching one and getting

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.470
closer.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:22.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, at first I
think there's an interesting observation that

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:28.559
you made about writing, which applies to a
lot of software engineers here which is you're

00:42:28.559 --> 00:42:37.049
either getting it completely wrong or completely
right. And there's no in-between. You can't

00:42:37.049 --> 00:42:38.390
really do it.

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:39.420
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That's interesting.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.190
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: And also, a lot
of people here write the--. They use paper

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:56.750
and white boards to do ideas. You're at a
computer all day and that's how you actually

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.440
push it out, but most of the thinking actually
happens on notepads and stuff like that.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Is that right?

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Well, some people.
But I think that's a big observation.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.440
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: That's fascinating. So maybe
that's the organic connection.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: You see white boards covered
with all kinds of things.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Look around.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Huh, interesting.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.209
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: The question I
have is, so this book has 50 characters or

00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:13.709
something like that. So, when you're writing,
do you have some sort of notepad where you

00:43:13.709 --> 00:43:16.900
keep track of all that you've said about them
and what their relationships are and when

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.289
they were introduced, that kind of thing?

00:43:18.289 --> 00:43:28.910
Or, are you familiar enough with them all
that they're all in your head like real people?

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:29.910
I mean, how do you keep track of your characters?

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.289
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It's a good question. I mean,
I didn't, I had less backup than you would

00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:38.209
think for this. I didn't find it that hard
to keep track of them. And I had much more

00:43:38.209 --> 00:43:43.239
trouble with my novel "Look At Me," which
believe it or not is actually more complicated,

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:49.709
or somehow felt bigger, harder to hold in
my brain than this one did.

00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:54.609
The only thing that was challenging that I
really needed to hammer out were--. In other

00:43:54.609 --> 00:43:59.450
words, I knew all the things, but what I had
to keep track of was when the reader knew

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:08.209
them. And so, and especially, well, the ages
of people was very tricky because I don't

00:44:08.209 --> 00:44:12.890
really nail down years overtly in the book,
but I actually, there is a specific year when

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.180
all of this stuff is happening.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.359
I just, especially with the technological
element, I didn't want to get too hyper-detailed

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:25.619
about what was invented and used at what time.
It can get a little fussy. But just what age’s

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:32.119
people were in relationship to each other,
and in relationship to the reader at various

00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:33.829
points.

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:37.910
The order of the chapters was something I
struggled with enormously, which I think it's

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.089
worth mentioning here, because in terms of
when readers know things, the order of the

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:46.940
chapters is paramount. When I was working
on it, I thought that the book would just

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.140
go backwards.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.880
Because as I was writing the chapters, that's
how they were emerging and it seemed really

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.489
fun. And I thought, "OK." It's not like no
one has done this before. But I thought, "Yeah,

00:44:56.489 --> 00:45:01.859
it's a reverse chronology." Rather soon, I
had problems with that because I knew I was

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:02.910
going into the future.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.630
So then I thought, "Well, I can't start with
that." So, I thought, "OK, it goes backwards

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:13.369
and then it leaps forward." And I liked the
shape of that. But one of the biggest disappointments

00:45:13.369 --> 00:45:19.529
actually, happened when I read the book in
that order, expecting a combustion that I

00:45:19.529 --> 00:45:21.960
had hoped would take place all the way through.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:30.589
And it was very flat. It just wasn't there.
And that was really disappointing. And I thought,

00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:34.989
"OK, so maybe this is just not gonna work
in the way I hoped." I mean, writing books

00:45:34.989 --> 00:45:39.819
is always like a chemistry experiment. In
the end, people tell you whether anything's

00:45:39.819 --> 00:45:41.099
happening or not.

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:45.270
And you can feel it, too. So maybe it just
won't. But then I also thought, "You know?

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:51.859
This backwards chronology is really costing
me a lot of opportunities for surprise, and

00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:58.750
payoff for the reader." As one clear example,
you mentioned that Bennie is in the car in

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.739
chapter two, reminiscing about his punk rock
past.

00:46:01.739 --> 00:46:09.739
It's just a paragraph, but it raises a question
of what was that like? Well, in my backwards

00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:14.769
chronology, we of course, don't get to 1979
until eight chapters later, because I'm going

00:46:14.769 --> 00:46:19.239
backwards. So, by that time, when we hit the
punk rock scene in San Francisco, the reader

00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:22.059
has forgotten about that moment of Bennie
reminiscing.

00:46:22.059 --> 00:46:27.839
So, there's no immediacy to the payoff. And
I realized that that was totally wrong and

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:33.200
that I needed to structure it much more intuitively.
And in a way, a backwards chronology is just

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:40.319
as much of a strait jacket as a forward chronology.
So, that was when I understood that I was

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:47.459
gonna be moving around and that my only criteria,
really, were gonna be things like, what would

00:46:47.459 --> 00:46:50.359
be the most fun to encounter now?

00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:55.579
At that point, I started to be pretty systematic
about what we already knew about people and

00:46:55.579 --> 00:47:01.940
what the ages they were when we last saw them,
because I didn't have that ramrod of a chronology

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:07.880
to orient me. But even then, it was like a
two-page document with a list of chapters

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.749
and a few notes about each person.

00:47:09.749 --> 00:47:14.720
It wasn't like a spreadsheet or anything,
probably 'cause I don't know how to use spreadsheets.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720
Maybe that would've helped actually.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.859
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: That's next.

00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:20.279
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Actually, that was the one
thing in PowerPoint I had to get my sister,

00:47:20.279 --> 00:47:25.180
who's a consultant, to do the charts because
I actually could not figure out how to use

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.180
them.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.549
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Well, I was gonna ask you.
Some of them require some data. There's some

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:29.549
actual graphs in there.

00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:31.519
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: I provided the data and I
said, "Make it beautiful."

00:47:31.519 --> 00:47:32.789
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Right.

00:47:32.789 --> 00:47:36.619
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: But I could not--. That was
just--. The learning curve appeared to be

00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:38.339
too steep on that one.

00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:40.720
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Any other--?

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:48.219
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So, you said that
you wonder how a thief feels like and then

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:54.549
you also said that how does, why does a music
producer do all the weird things. And then

00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:58.859
what fascinates me is what you said after
that. You said that "so I decided to write

00:47:58.859 --> 00:48:01.079
about them" or "write a story on them."

00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:06.950
So, what is the process that goes on within
your mind? Like, when you're trying to understand

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:11.220
people who you're not connected to. Like,
it's very hard to understand people outside

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:17.759
my domain. Like, I can't understand people
who are in a different place or a different

00:48:17.759 --> 00:48:18.759
profession. It's very hard.

00:48:18.759 --> 00:48:25.151
So, what is the process? Is it just an unconscious
process that happens when you write? Or do

00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:30.079
you go through a systematic process like of
reading about them and trying to understand

00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:35.549
them? Or, what is the process that you have
in your mind or in your habits? Like, how

00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:38.630
do you do that? It's very hard to do it.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:45.880
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Yeah. For me, the hard thing
is exactly the opposite. What I am worst at

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:52.550
as a writer is writing about myself. I hate
it. I find it dull and also I freeze up. I

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:56.799
don't want to give anything away. And that's
no good as a fiction writer. So for me, it's

00:48:56.799 --> 00:48:58.029
totally intuitive.

00:48:58.029 --> 00:49:04.900
I just let it roll and see what happens. I
guess I just make it up. Although, that sounds,

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:11.150
I don't know. Somehow that sounds presumptuous,
but I guess in a way, writing fiction is pretty

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:16.510
presumptuous. I find it easiest with people
who are farthest from my own life. So for

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:22.859
example, I love, I find it comfortable I should
say to write about men because there's an

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:25.609
easy way to separate myself from them.

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:31.739
Now, it's not that I'm some great expert on
men. I mean, I really am not. Like, I didn't

00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:38.579
grow up in a family with a lot of brothers.
I have no particular insight into men, but

00:49:38.579 --> 00:49:45.789
I just--. I don't know. It's funny. It's hard
for me to come up with an articulate answer

00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:49.319
except to say I start writing and I see what
happens.

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:55.789
And if it feels interesting, then I roll with
it. And maybe that means we're just all more

00:49:55.789 --> 00:50:02.490
alike than we think, but I don't even know.
I'm not sure. One important component of feeling

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.509
that a character is working is a sense that
I can hear them. Like, just having a sense

00:50:07.509 --> 00:50:12.160
of how people talk which again, I experience
rather passively.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.799
I feel as if I'm taking dictation. Now, obviously
on some level I'm also inventing it, but my

00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:25.339
experience of it is one of being entertained
by a conversation that seems to be just falling

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:30.339
out organically. It's not that I--. I mean,
I've had characters that I really struggled

00:50:30.339 --> 00:50:31.339
with.

00:50:31.339 --> 00:50:36.059
One in "Goon Squad" that I probably struggled
with the most, two of them. There's a guy

00:50:36.059 --> 00:50:41.749
named Lou who does a lot of really bad things.
And I didn't feel like I was struggling with

00:50:41.749 --> 00:50:49.609
him, but I struggled to find, I had to work
to make the logic of his inner life available

00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:51.799
to readers so they weren't just horrified
by him.

00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:57.680
Although, some still are. But there was a
character named Rob in a chapter called "Out

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:04.150
of Body" and he's telling his story in second
person. He was someone I really struggled

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:12.130
with. I was just finding it hard to feel the
totality of this guy: his voice, the way he

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.369
looked, his experience.

00:51:14.369 --> 00:51:20.680
It wasn't coming together. And yet, I really
felt convinced that it could and had to. This

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:25.390
was, I think, the last chapter I wrote. Very
hard. I had so many options that weren't open

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:31.499
to me anymore having written 12, 11 other
chapters. The PowerPoint I wrote after this.

00:51:31.499 --> 00:51:40.819
But anyway, a crucial moment in the crystallization
of Rob in my mind, happened on the subway.

00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:45.619
When I was sitting there on a crowded subway
and I heard this guy talking. I think he was

00:51:45.619 --> 00:51:50.969
talking about going skiing. And just his voice
reminded me a lot of guys I'd grown up with

00:51:50.969 --> 00:51:59.209
in San Francisco in the '70s. He just, I don't
know, in a deep voice. And I stood up to look

00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:02.390
at him and see what he looked like. And he
had a reddish stubble.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:10.599
He was a big, strong guy. And my Rob had been
very slender and feminine. But the minute

00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:17.749
I saw this guy I thought, "That's him," the
face, the voice, the stubble. I was done.

00:52:17.749 --> 00:52:25.559
I knew that I had him. And so, at that point,
after that, I started writing with that image

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:29.709
in mind of Rob and in fact, his physicality
is really an important part of who he is.

00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:37.729
It turns out he's a former football player.
His bigness is a part of him in every moment

00:52:37.729 --> 00:52:43.799
of that chapter. And without that bigness,
I couldn't make him work. But again, the closest

00:52:43.799 --> 00:52:48.459
I could seem to come to actually using anyone
from my life is literally grabbing images

00:52:48.459 --> 00:52:50.020
of strangers on the subway.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:55.709
So, it's an odd process. Where I have the
most trouble, it won't surprise you to hear

00:52:55.709 --> 00:53:00.369
after all that I've said is writing about
someone who really reminds me of someone that

00:53:00.369 --> 00:53:08.369
I know. Which I did in "Look At Me." A very
problematic character because there's a connection

00:53:08.369 --> 00:53:10.229
to someone I know and love.

00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:14.170
And the result was that I gave this person
way too much air time and people were just

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:21.719
numb with boredom because they thought like,
"He never shuts up. Are you not seeing or

00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:25.869
hearing how dull this is?" And I was not.
I felt he was fascinating.

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:31.430
So that's an example of how my judgment seems
to really be impaired by actual connections

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.440
to my real life.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.739
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: The distance helps.

00:53:33.739 --> 00:53:39.109
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: It really helps. And clear
boundaries seem to really help me. That being

00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:44.239
said, actually the narrator of the PowerPoint
I think is a lot like me, the twelve-year

00:53:44.239 --> 00:53:45.239
old.

00:53:45.239 --> 00:53:48.859
I missed it because I was under so much pressure
to write that chapter quickly and I was so

00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:53.689
thrilled to have found a way to do it at all,
but I think I sneaked in there without even

00:53:53.689 --> 00:54:01.890
realizing it. But the peace-making, pre-teen
who's a storyteller and a witness, I think

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.640
there's a connection there, but I didn't know
it.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.799
And that was what was important. I need to
not know it until it's already done.

00:54:08.799 --> 00:54:15.570
&gt;&gt;Greg Sanders: Great. Thank you. I think
we're probably out of time. So, thank you

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:16.570
very much.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:17.570
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Egan: Thanks so much. Happy to
sign books.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:17.619
