00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.490
The great scientist J-Kwon once hypothesized
“errybody in the club getting tipsy” but

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.859
he failed to mention the effect it had on
their sperm.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.480
Welcome to DNews, I’m Ross Everett and alcohol
might be messing with your swimmers.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.590
A study conducted on 1,200 Danish men, stop
me if you’ve heard this one, showed that

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.660
drinking as much as one alcoholic beverage
a week can lower the quality of your boys.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.460
I’m talking about sperm, which might indeed
one day yield you actual boys if used properly.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.530
Not just quantity, sperm killing is for the
birds, the study found that a lifestyle lending

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.569
itself to one simple drink a week could affect
sperm concentration, count, and percentage

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.190
of healthy and normal sperm.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.229
Essentially taking your Michael Phelps’
and leaving you with Michael Welps.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.969
The study was conducted during the men’s
physical examination before joining the army,

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.319
as was mandatory in Denmark between 2008 and
2012.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.820
They asked the men how much alcohol they drank
the week before the assessment and whether

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.269
or not that was the typical amount they drank
to rule out binge drinking or special occasions.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.449
And while alcohol consumption led to testosterone
levels rising, it caused the sex hormone binding

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.310
globulin to fall, which makes sense because
the glycoprotein is produced mostly by the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.369
liver, which is also the part of the body
people apologize to on Facebook after a night

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.369
of heavy drinking.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.869
Of course, the heavier drinkers who consumed
more than five drinks a week saw the greatest

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.350
change in their little Olympians lowering
their sperm count by 33% and their normal-looking

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.270
sperm by 51%, but even those who only slurped
down one drink a week showed a slight decrease.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.229
Keep in mind this was just an observational
study so other possible factors, including

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.330
lifestyle choices of those who tend to drink
more, weren’t taken into account, but similar

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.430
animal studies suggest that alcohol does have
a direct impact on sperm quality.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.870
What do you guys think, is this a public health
concern or could this just be a nice way to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.689
control the population with a buzz?

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.329
Let me know in the comments down below.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.859
And speaking of drinking if you’re wondering
why the RedBull part of those Vodka RedBulls

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.760
hasn’t been actually give you wings, you
can check out this video about a guy who is

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:10.060
suing them for false advertisement and winning.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360
