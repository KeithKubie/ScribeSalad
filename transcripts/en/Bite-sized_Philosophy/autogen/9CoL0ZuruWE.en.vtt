00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.510
well that's a very bad idea this is the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
well that's a very bad idea this is the
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580
well that's a very bad idea this is the
thing that this this idea is what

don't be too attached to things and what
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.870
don't be too attached to things and what
does that mean it doesn't mean deny the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880
does that mean it doesn't mean deny the
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609
does that mean it doesn't mean deny the
world it might mean deny the world if

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
world it might mean deny the world if

you're too in love with the material

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350
you're too in love with the material
 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.679
you're too in love with the material
like with material well-being let's say

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
like with material well-being let's say
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.499
like with material well-being let's say
then your pathway to transcendence and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
then your pathway to transcendence and
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450
then your pathway to transcendence and
meaning might be to abandon that because

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
meaning might be to abandon that because
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730
meaning might be to abandon that because
it's it's constraining you it's making

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
it's it's constraining you it's making
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950
it's it's constraining you it's making
you less than you could be but the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
you less than you could be but the
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080
you less than you could be but the
fundamental lesson the more fundamental

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
fundamental lesson the more fundamental
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120
fundamental lesson the more fundamental
lesson that's underneath that is don't

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
lesson that's underneath that is don't
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.980
lesson that's underneath that is don't
let what you are stop you from being

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
let what you are stop you from being
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.609
let what you are stop you from being
what you could be right and so then the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
what you could be right and so then the
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109
what you could be right and so then the
question is well what do you identify

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
question is well what do you identify
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.640
question is well what do you identify
with do you identify with what you are

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650
with do you identify with what you are
 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.190
with do you identify with what you are
then you're tyrant do you identify with

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
then you're tyrant do you identify with
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.889
then you're tyrant do you identify with
with chaos because that's the opposite

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
with chaos because that's the opposite
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.330
with chaos because that's the opposite
of order say then you're nihilistic well

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
of order say then you're nihilistic well
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160
of order say then you're nihilistic well
you don't identify with either of those

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
you don't identify with either of those
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170
you don't identify with either of those
you know that they're both necessary you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
you know that they're both necessary you
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.609
you know that they're both necessary you
know that you have to live with both of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
know that you have to live with both of
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.030
know that you have to live with both of
them but you would you identify with the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
them but you would you identify with the
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370
them but you would you identify with the
capacity to continually transcend what

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
capacity to continually transcend what
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.789
capacity to continually transcend what
you are and then you seek out error

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
you are and then you seek out error
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.920
you are and then you seek out error
that's what humility is like I'm error

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
that's what humility is like I'm error
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.399
that's what humility is like I'm error
ridden it's like so I want to see I want

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
ridden it's like so I want to see I want
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109
ridden it's like so I want to see I want
to put myself in the situation where I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
to put myself in the situation where I
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180
to put myself in the situation where I
can discover one of my errors hopefully

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
can discover one of my errors hopefully
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100
can discover one of my errors hopefully
not in a way that's going to knock me

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
not in a way that's going to knock me
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650
not in a way that's going to knock me
completely out of the game right I want

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
completely out of the game right I want
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.870

to find out where my limits are I want
to find out where there's not enough of

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850
to find out where there's not enough of
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.560
to find out where there's not enough of
me yet

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
me yet
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.300
me yet
and I want to do it that in a way that's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
and I want to do it that in a way that's
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190
and I want to do it that in a way that's
engaging because you know you can wear

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
engaging because you know you can wear
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.350
engaging because you know you can wear
yourself out fighting dragons obviously

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
yourself out fighting dragons obviously
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240
yourself out fighting dragons obviously
you can exhaust yourself completely and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250
you can exhaust yourself completely and
 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.700
you can exhaust yourself completely and
that's not helpful you know what one of

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710
that's not helpful you know what one of
 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.200
that's not helpful you know what one of
the things I learned for example when I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
the things I learned for example when I
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.110
the things I learned for example when I
was coaching when I was coaching lawyers

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
was coaching when I was coaching lawyers
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.790
was coaching when I was coaching lawyers
who these were people who had very

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
who these were people who had very
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.560
who these were people who had very
high-end careers and so they had an

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
high-end careers and so they had an
 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.970
high-end careers and so they had an
infinite workload no matter how much

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
infinite workload no matter how much
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.680
infinite workload no matter how much
they worked flat-out there was always

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
they worked flat-out there was always
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.120
they worked flat-out there was always
way more work that they should do it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
way more work that they should do it's
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.500
way more work that they should do it's
very difficult thing to learn to manage

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
very difficult thing to learn to manage
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.230
very difficult thing to learn to manage
and so they were exhausting themselves

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240
and so they were exhausting themselves
 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.390
and so they were exhausting themselves
and I said well you know you have to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
and I said well you know you have to
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340
and I said well you know you have to
work less per day it's like well no

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
work less per day it's like well no
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.650
work less per day it's like well no
that's not happening I can't do that and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
that's not happening I can't do that and
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.650
that's not happening I can't do that and
so with what I learned over time was

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
so with what I learned over time was
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.000
so with what I learned over time was
okay so this is what you have to do

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
okay so this is what you have to do
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.949
okay so this is what you have to do
every three months you have to block off

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
every three months you have to block off
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.470
every three months you have to block off
four days and go have a vacation you

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
four days and go have a vacation you
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.970
four days and go have a vacation you
have to plan that in advance so it's in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
have to plan that in advance so it's in
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.229
have to plan that in advance so it's in
your calendar so that your secretary

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
your calendar so that your secretary
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.350
your calendar so that your secretary
doesn't book your time and then you need

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
doesn't book your time and then you need
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.760
doesn't book your time and then you need
that because you have to recuperate

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770
that because you have to recuperate
 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.440
that because you have to recuperate
enough so that you can work as hard as

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
enough so that you can work as hard as
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090
enough so that you can work as hard as
you're going to work and of course they

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
you're going to work and of course they
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.380
you're going to work and of course they
were nervous about that and I said well

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
were nervous about that and I said well
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.960
were nervous about that and I said well
look we can we can calibrate this let's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
look we can we can calibrate this let's
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.640
look we can we can calibrate this let's
keep track of your billable hours over

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
keep track of your billable hours over
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.470
keep track of your billable hours over
the next year and see if they increase

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480
the next year and see if they increase
 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000
the next year and see if they increase
or decrease because I bet you if you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
or decrease because I bet you if you
 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250
or decrease because I bet you if you
take more time off you'll actually have

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
take more time off you'll actually have
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.870
take more time off you'll actually have
more billable hours you'll actually have

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880
more billable hours you'll actually have
 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.340
more billable hours you'll actually have
your cake and eat it too you'll get to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350
your cake and eat it too you'll get to
 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.350
your cake and eat it too you'll get to
have a vacation and you'll be more

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
have a vacation and you'll be more
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.199
have a vacation and you'll be more
productive and that inevitably that was

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
productive and that inevitably that was
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.210
productive and that inevitably that was
what happened and so that's a matter of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
what happened and so that's a matter of
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.370
what happened and so that's a matter of
calibrating the game properly right you

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
calibrating the game properly right you
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.600
calibrating the game properly right you
want to play a game that you can play

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610
want to play a game that you can play
 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.070
want to play a game that you can play
the day but also one that you can play

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
the day but also one that you can play
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.660
the day but also one that you can play
next week and next month we're not

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
next week and next month we're not
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.630
next week and next month we're not
talking about you know your your career

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
talking about you know your your career
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.160
talking about you know your your career
this week we're talking about you having

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
this week we're talking about you having
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.530
this week we're talking about you having
a career that lasts 30 years that

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
a career that lasts 30 years that
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.970
a career that lasts 30 years that
doesn't kill you that doesn't make you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
doesn't kill you that doesn't make you
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.100
doesn't kill you that doesn't make you
hate yourself or the job that doesn't

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
hate yourself or the job that doesn't
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.780
hate yourself or the job that doesn't
make you better that doesn't wear you to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
make you better that doesn't wear you to
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.240
make you better that doesn't wear you to
a frazzle so we it has to be optimized

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250
a frazzle so we it has to be optimized
 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.250
a frazzle so we it has to be optimized
and so I think that you can in fact

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260
and so I think that you can in fact
 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.949
and so I think that you can in fact
decide to take on the load that's

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
decide to take on the load that's
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.740
decide to take on the load that's
optimally meaningful if you want and

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
optimally meaningful if you want and
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.910
optimally meaningful if you want and
then you get to have your cake and eat

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
then you get to have your cake and eat
 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.009
then you get to have your cake and eat
it too you're on the pathway to

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019
it too you're on the pathway to
 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.870
it too you're on the pathway to
continual incremental improvement you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880
continual incremental improvement you
 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.460
continual incremental improvement you
only have to burn off a feather at a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
only have to burn off a feather at a
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.229
only have to burn off a feather at a
time instead of having the whole bloody

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
time instead of having the whole bloody
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.630
time instead of having the whole bloody
thing burst into flames but it's a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640
thing burst into flames but it's a
 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.670
thing burst into flames but it's a
constant it's a constant source of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
constant it's a constant source of
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.830
constant it's a constant source of
renewal and there's an idea that to be

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
renewal and there's an idea that to be
 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.479
renewal and there's an idea that to be
renewed you have to drink the water of

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
renewed you have to drink the water of
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.700
renewed you have to drink the water of
life right that's that's an old

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
life right that's that's an old
 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.010
life right that's that's an old
mythological idea and what's the water

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
mythological idea and what's the water
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.760
mythological idea and what's the water
the water of

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
the water of
 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.640
the water of
like chaos is water water water is chaos

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
like chaos is water water water is chaos
 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.189
like chaos is water water water is chaos
water is what washes away too much order

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199
water is what washes away too much order
 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.290
water is what washes away too much order
and to stay continually let's say

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
and to stay continually let's say
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.640
and to stay continually let's say
refreshed by the water of life is to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650
refreshed by the water of life is to
 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.740
refreshed by the water of life is to
take on exactly the right amount of

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750
take on exactly the right amount of
 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.290
take on exactly the right amount of
chaos to make sure that your garden is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300
chaos to make sure that your garden is
 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.140
chaos to make sure that your garden is
properly nourished and I think meaning

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150
properly nourished and I think meaning
 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.809
properly nourished and I think meaning
is actually the marker of that and and

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819
is actually the marker of that and and
 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.730
is actually the marker of that and and
as I said you know that I'm not I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740
as I said you know that I'm not I
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.710
as I said you know that I'm not I
wouldn't consider myself either naive or

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
wouldn't consider myself either naive or
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.930
wouldn't consider myself either naive or
a particularly optimistic person I don't

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940
a particularly optimistic person I don't
 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.430
a particularly optimistic person I don't
think I'm neither of those but this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440
think I'm neither of those but this
 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920
think I'm neither of those but this
isn't actually an idea this is one of

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930
isn't actually an idea this is one of
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.749
isn't actually an idea this is one of
the only ideas that I've ever found that

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759
the only ideas that I've ever found that
 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.879
the only ideas that I've ever found that
I really believed to be rock-solid I

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889
I really believed to be rock-solid I
 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.249
I really believed to be rock-solid I
actually think that it's true and it's

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259
actually think that it's true and it's
 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.800
actually think that it's true and it's
very optimistic because it says you can

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810
very optimistic because it says you can
 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.240
very optimistic because it says you can
use your sense of meaning to calibrate

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250
use your sense of meaning to calibrate
 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.700
use your sense of meaning to calibrate
your progress through life it but

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710
your progress through life it but
 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.230
your progress through life it but
there's rules you have to aim at the

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240
there's rules you have to aim at the
 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640
there's rules you have to aim at the
highest possible good that you can

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650
highest possible good that you can
 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.070
highest possible good that you can
conceive now in that subject update

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
conceive now in that subject update
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.570
conceive now in that subject update
because what the hell you know but you

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580
because what the hell you know but you
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.850
because what the hell you know but you
start by aiming at the star you can see

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860
start by aiming at the star you can see
 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.379
start by aiming at the star you can see
rather than the dimmer one that you

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389
rather than the dimmer one that you
 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.930
rather than the dimmer one that you
can't yet perceive and then you decide

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
can't yet perceive and then you decide
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.070
can't yet perceive and then you decide
that you're going to do that honestly

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080
that you're going to do that honestly
 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.350
that you're going to do that honestly
right there's that that's a big decision

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360
right there's that that's a big decision
 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.899
right there's that that's a big decision
so the first decision I think in some

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909
so the first decision I think in some
 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.969
so the first decision I think in some
sense is the decision of love you're

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979
sense is the decision of love you're
 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.620
sense is the decision of love you're
going to decide that being is worthwhile

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630
going to decide that being is worthwhile
 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.300
going to decide that being is worthwhile
and that you're going to work for its

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310
and that you're going to work for its
 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.399
and that you're going to work for its
betterment and that's a decision that's

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409
betterment and that's a decision that's
 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.230
betterment and that's a decision that's
based on love and the second decision is

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240
based on love and the second decision is
 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.820
based on love and the second decision is
based on truth having made that decision

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830
based on truth having made that decision
 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.950
based on truth having made that decision
you're going to play a straight game

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960
you're going to play a straight game
 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.930
you're going to play a straight game
having made those two decisions I think

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940
having made those two decisions I think
 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.580
having made those two decisions I think
that you can allow your sense of meaning

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
that you can allow your sense of meaning
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.499
that you can allow your sense of meaning
to calibrate your pathway and then

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509
to calibrate your pathway and then
 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.839
to calibrate your pathway and then
what's so interesting is that you hit a

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849
what's so interesting is that you hit a
 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.089
what's so interesting is that you hit a
state that's as close to paradise as

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099
state that's as close to paradise as
 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.219
state that's as close to paradise as
you're going to hit right away because

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229
you're going to hit right away because
 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.769
you're going to hit right away because
being engaged like that is better to be

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779
being engaged like that is better to be
 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.499
being engaged like that is better to be
engaged in the solution of a complex

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509
engaged in the solution of a complex
 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.149
engaged in the solution of a complex
problem than not to have a problem at

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159
problem than not to have a problem at
 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.540
problem than not to have a problem at
all and that's that's no different than

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550
all and that's that's no different than
 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.730
all and that's that's no different than
saying it's better for there to be being

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740
saying it's better for there to be being
 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.370
saying it's better for there to be being
the non-being because being is a problem

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380
the non-being because being is a problem
 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.939
the non-being because being is a problem
and so if you want to have no problems

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949
and so if you want to have no problems
 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.490
and so if you want to have no problems
then you have no being and you could say

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500
then you have no being and you could say
 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.140
then you have no being and you could say
well-being is so miserable that maybe

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150
well-being is so miserable that maybe
 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.029
well-being is so miserable that maybe
that's the route we should take and fair

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039
that's the route we should take and fair
 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.529
that's the route we should take and fair
enough but maybe you can have your cake

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539
enough but maybe you can have your cake
 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.180
enough but maybe you can have your cake
and eat it too you can have the damn

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190
and eat it too you can have the damn
 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.730
and eat it too you can have the damn
problem it could be a problem worth

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740
problem it could be a problem worth
 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.920
problem it could be a problem worth
solving and you can be so engaged in

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930
solving and you can be so engaged in
 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.659
solving and you can be so engaged in
solving the problem that it justifies

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669
solving the problem that it justifies
 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.580
solving the problem that it justifies
the fact that the problem exists and

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590
the fact that the problem exists and
 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.579
the fact that the problem exists and
then you get then you get to have you

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589
then you get then you get to have you
 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.260
then you get then you get to have you
get to have the problem and the solution

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270
get to have the problem and the solution
 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.029
get to have the problem and the solution
at the same time and maybe that's better

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039
at the same time and maybe that's better
 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.170
at the same time and maybe that's better
than not having the problem

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
than not having the problem
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.640
than not having the problem
at all and I believe that because one of

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650
at all and I believe that because one of
 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.140

that game maximally and paradoxically
 

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.159
that game maximally and paradoxically
it's in the willingness to do that that

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.169
it's in the willingness to do that that
 

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.099
it's in the willingness to do that that
the solution emerges
