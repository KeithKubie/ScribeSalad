00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.730
Who Gets the Royalties for Hitler's Book?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.410
Mein Kampf, the autobiographical, anti-Semitic
hate-manifesto written by Adolf Hitler in

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.990
the 1920s is one of the most controversial
and infamous books of all time.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.650
As you might imagine, this has resulted in
millions of copies of the book being sold

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.510
since Hitler did the world a major favour
and heroically (and with no regard for his

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.460
own personal safety) managed to infiltrate
the Führerbunker and take out one of the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.340
most hated individuals of all time- himself-
in 1945.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.550
So, ever since Hitler fired a Walther PPK
at his own head, who’s been collecting the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.089
royalties from sales of the book, how much
did Hitler make off it before that, and why’d

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.719
he write it in the first place?

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.359
Hitler initially began dictating and drafting
the outline to Mein Kampf while imprisoned

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.250
in 1923 after a failed attempt to seize power
in Bavaria in a coup d’état which eventually

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.010
became known as the “Beer Hall Putsch“.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.880
Conceived by Hitler as a way of simultaneously
spreading Nazi ideals and paying off the massive

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.610
debts he had racked up, the future-Fuhrer
realistically expected that his book would

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.680
only primarily appeal to those who were either
in or sympathetic to the National Socialist

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Party.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
For the most part, Hitler was right (a sentence
this author sincerely hopes is never taken

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.119
out of context in the future) and upon its
release in 1925, it sold a modest 9000 copies,

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.340
nevertheless earning him a nice little income.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.549
Mein_Kampf Over the next few years, as Hitler’s
star rose in German politics, sales of his

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.040
book similarly increased.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.840
Legitimate sales of the book peaked in 1933
(the year Hitler became Chancellor of Germany)

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.909
with a reported 850,000 copies being sold
that year.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.190
(In total, it’s estimated that around 10
million copies of the book were sold during

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.259
Hitler’s lifetime.)

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.060
Padding these totals significantly, when Hitler
became Führer (“leader/guide”), millions

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.219
of copies of the book were purchased by the
German government and were distributed for

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.390
“free” to German soldiers and newly married
couples.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
In doing this, Hitler ensured that he earned
royalties for every one of the “free”

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.770
books handed out by the government by declaring
that local authorities had to pay to cover

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.910
the book’s cost before giving them away.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.459
It’s difficult to determine exactly how
much Hitler earned from all these sales, but

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.790
according to the documentary, Hitler’s Money,
the total rang in at just under eight million

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.790
Reichsmarks.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.550
Equally difficult, for a variety of reasons,
is converting that amount to modern day dollars

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.550
or pounds.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.920
But, as an extremely rough estimate, eight
million Reichsmarks in the early 1940s would

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.440
be equivalent to around $30 million at that
time or about $430 million (£279 million)

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440
today.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.700
Whatever the case, given Hitler’s fairly
lavish lifestyle in the immediate years leading

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.709
up to (and then later including) his time
as leader of Germany, and with most of his

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.760
personal income coming from the book sales
in the early going, it would seem his bank

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.269
account was doing alright.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.349
Of course, we should note that this doesn’t
take into account all of the money Hitler

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.989
later acquired through various other means
such as a licensing his image to the German

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.680
government (earning him money every time they
sold a stamp or other item with his face on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
it).

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.980
Hitler also maximized his personal income
by simply not bothering to pay his taxes.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.340
This created something of a problem for him
initially, but he managed to string along

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.290
the German tax office for years, at one point
brashly claiming that he only owned “one

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.610
desk and two bookshelves“, while simultaneously
driving around in a brand new Mercedes.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.180
At other times he kept the tax officials at
bay by insisting he’d pay off his tax bill

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.290
in installments over time.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.140
This all culminated in Hitler receiving a
tax bill of 405,500 Reichsmarks shortly after

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.590
he became Chancellor in 1933.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.000
(For reference, the average annual teacher’s
salary in Germany at the time was a little

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.159
under 5,000 Riechsmarks.)

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.250
Still not wanting to pay his taxes and now
being in charge, he promptly had a representative

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.129
of the ministry of finance declare that the
Führer was “free of tax obligations”

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.800
and the massive tax debt he’d accumulated
was waived, along with future taxes he’d

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.660
have otherwise owed.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.390
While sales of Mein Kampf internationally
were decidedly more modest, Hitler still made

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.430
considerable amounts of money from them before
the start of WW2, with it being noted that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.580
he made somewhere in the region of “$500,000
inflation adjusted dollars” from sales of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.430
the book in the UK alone.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
As Hitler was officially a resident of Munich
upon his death, the Bavarian government seized

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.610
all of his property, including the rights
to the book and immediately outlawed its publication

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.610
in Germany.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.889
Despite this, the book is still published
and sold with some success in other European

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.050
countries and beyond today where it is not
banned.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.750
As the legal copyright holder, Bavaria is
entitled to any royalties from such sales

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.930
and they do accept them, albeit begrudgingly
before giving them to charity.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.770
That said, when Hitler died his will instructed
that any objects of “sentimental value or

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.510
necessary for the maintenance of a modest
simple life” be split amongst his living

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.569
relatives and friends, while his art collection
and remaining assets be split between an art

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.860
gallery in his hometown of Linz and the National
Socialist German Workers Party respectively.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.050
However, the Bavarian government decided to
ignore this will as part of what we like to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.600
dub their commendable “screw Hitler initiative”,
taking full ownership of his entire estate.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.950
While legally some of Hitler’s distant heirs
could lay claim to what remains of Hitler’s

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.550
estate (which is still estimated to be worth
millions), none of them are willing to do

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.550
so.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.520
(In fact, apart from not wanting anything
to do with Hitler’s estate, the sons of

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.850
Hitler’s nephew have even gone so far as
to agree to never have children to end his

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.850
bloodline.)

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.131
While rights to Mein Kampf belong to the Bavarian
government throughout most of the world, in

00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:48.330
the UK and the US, things are a little different.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.250
In the UK, rights to the book belonged to
Hurst &amp; Blackett, who purchased rights to

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.539
publish a translated version of the book from
Hitler’s publisher in 1933.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.139
When Hitler died, Hurst &amp; Blackett retained
the rights and continue to sell copies of

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.840
it to this day, though now under the name
Random House (a publisher which bought them

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.240
out in 1998).

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.250
However, the company, unwilling to profit
from a work of Hitler’s, has for some time

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.389
gifted all royalties made from the book to
an anonymous charity.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.980
In 2001, it was revealed that the charity
in question was The German Welfare Council.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.260
That council then stated that they were planning
to return £250,000 of the £500,000 they’d

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.020
received over the years via book royalty donations.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.080
This came as a response to the controversy
that erupted to their ever having accepted

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.960
such funds and being confronted by various
prominent individuals, including the chairman

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.440
of the Holocaust Educational Trust, who felt
that profiting in any way from such book was

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.820
inherently wrong, even if the money was being
used for good.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.520
The £250,000 they’d already used from the
sales of the book had been given to aid Holocaust

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.580
survivors.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.080
The Welfare Council stated of all this,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.000
When we agreed [in 1976] to the arrangement
the generally accepted view was that there

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.639
was a moral obligation to pass the money to
Holocaust victims – but no Jewish charity

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.639
would take it.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.539
The current board of trustees, however, has
decided the funding is no longer appropriate

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.319
– not least because we no longer deal exclusively
with Holocaust victims.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.569
This charity was chosen because of its work
with Jewish refugees from Germany, but their

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.870
number has diminished greatly over the years;
most have died of old age.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.180
The problem now is that no one wants anything
to do with the money.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.150
Upon learning that the Welfare Council would
be returning the money, Random House decided

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.960
that they would distribute the unwanted funds
and any subsequent royalties to “another

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.400
appropriate charity“.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.080
As to why the German Welfare Council had so
much remaining from the donated book royalties,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.389
it was explained that, “We kept it in a
separate bank account from other donations

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.870
and used it only in emergencies.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.310
Holocaust victims who were helped by the charity
may not have known about the donation and

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.530
I fear that some might be offended.”

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.860
In America, royalties to Mein Kampf are collected
by Houghton Mifflin, who bought the rights

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.080
to the book from Hitler’s publisher in 1933.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.490
Interestingly, at least two other publishers
(Stackpole and Reynal &amp; Hitchcock) are known

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.840
to have published unlicensed translations
of the book in the 1930s by arguing that because

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.620
Hitler self-identified as a “Stateless German”
his book wasn’t copyrightable.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.030
Neither of these publishers paid any royalties
to Hitler; in fact, Stackpole advertised the

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.610
book by explicitly stating Hitler wasn’t
getting anything from the sales of their version.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.020
At the start of WW2, the American government
seized all profits and rights to the book

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.030
within the country.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.280
The government then held the rights to Mein
Kampf until 1979.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.370
During this span, they made about $139,000
in royalties, with this money placed into

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.100
the War Claims Fund before being paid out
to victims of the war.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.250
In 1979, Houghton Mifflin paid the US government
$37,254 to quietly buy back the rights earning

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.150
them an estimated $700,000 in royalties over
the next two decades.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.720
However, when it emerged that the company
had been making hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.430
from sales of the book, they issued a statement
stating that the royalties the book earned

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.950
would be distributed to charities that promoted
“diversity and cross-cultural understanding”

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.643
and a host of other things Hitler would have
hated.

00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:11.643
The Red Cross (founded by Henry Dunant with
the intent to prevent and alleviate human

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:12.643
suffering, without discrimination, see: A
Memory of Solferino – The Fascinating Life

00:09:12.643 --> 00:09:13.643
of Henry Dunant) was one candidate for receiving
royalties from the U.S. sales, but, like so

00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:14.643
many more before them, the organization reportedly
declined the money.

00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:15.643
Thanks to German Copyright law, Mein Kampf
is scheduled to enter the public domain on

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:21.140
the 1st of January, 2016 meaning there will
likely be even more arguments and controversy

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:41.200
about who, if anyone, should profit from Hitler’s
hymnal of hate.
