00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hi.

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.110
In this problem, Romeo and
Juliet are back and they're

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.470
still looking to meet
up for a date.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.944
Remember, the last time we met
up with them, it was back in

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:09.613
the beginning of the course and
they were trying to meet

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.510
up for a date but they weren't
always punctual.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.570
So we modeled their delay as
uniformly distributed between

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.060
0 and 1 hour.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.770
So now in this problem,
we're actually

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.610
going to look at variation.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.020
And we're going to ask the
question, how do we actually

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.970
know that the distribution is
uniformly distributed between

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.190
0 and 1 hour?

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.900
Or it could also be the case
that it is uniformly

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.190
distributed between 0
and half an hour, or

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.600
zero and two hours.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.150
How do we actually know what
this parameter of the uniform

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.844
distribution is?

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:44.030
OK, so let's put ourselves in
the shoes of Romeo who's tired

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.690
of being stood up by Juliet
on all these dates.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.870
And fortunately, he's learned
some probability since the

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.590
beginning of course,
and so have we.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.470
And in particular we've learned
Bayesian inference.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.120
And so in this problem, we're
actually going to use

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.830
basically all the concepts and
tools of Bayesian inference

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.720
that we learned chapter
eight and apply them.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.269
So it's a nice review problem,
and so let's get started.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.530
The set of the problem is
similar to the first Romeo and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.810
Juliet problem that
we dealt with.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.480
They are meeting up for a date,
and they're not always

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.190
punctual and they
have a delay.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.680
But instead of the delay being
uniformly distributed between

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
0 and 1 hour, now we have an
extra layer of uncertainty.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.780
So if we know sum theta, then we
know that the delay, which

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.770
we'll call x is uniformly
distributed

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.520
between 0 and the theta.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.670
So here's one possible
theta, theta 1.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.740
But we don't actually know
what this theta is.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.120
So in the original problem
we knew that theta

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.820
was exactly one hour.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.320
But in this problem we don't
know what theta is.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.150
So theta could also be like
this, some other theta 2.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.530
And we don't know what
this theta is.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.590
And we choose to model it as
being uniformly distributed

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.950
between 0 and 1.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.330
So like I said, we have
two layers now.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.419
We have uncertainty about theta,
which is the parameters

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.730
of the uniform distribution.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.510
And then we have uncertainty
in regards to the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.342
actual delay, x.

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:23.030
OK, so let's actually
write out what these

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.720
distributions are.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.360
So theta, the unknown parameter,
we're told in the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.500
problem that we're going to
assume that is uniformly

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.930
distributed between 0 and 1.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.960
And so the PDF is just 1, when
theta is between 0 and 1, and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.870
0 otherwise.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.530
And we're told that, given what
theta is, given what this

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.090
parameter is, the delay is
uniformly distributed between

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.330
0 and this theta.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.670
So what that means is that we
know this conditional PDF, the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.410
conditional PDF of x given theta
is going to be 1 over

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:10.620
theta if x is between 0 and
theta, and 0 otherwise.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.120
All right, because we know
that given a theta, x is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.810
uniformly distributed
between 0 and theta.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.520
So in order to make this uniform
distribution, it's the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.900
normalization or the heights,
you can think of it, has to be

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.520
exactly 1 over theta.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.300
So just imagine for a concrete
case, if theta were 1, 1 hour

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.330
in the original problem, then
this would just be a PDF of 1

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.350
or a standard uniform
distribution between 0 and 1.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.160
OK, so now this is, we have the
necessary fundamentals for

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.110
this problem.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.790
And what do we do
in inference?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.760
Well the objective is
to try to infer

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.350
some unknown parameter.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:56.780
And what we have is we have a
prior which is our initial

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.280
belief for what this
parameter might be.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.940
And then we have some data.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.370
So in this case, the data that
we collect is the actual

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.700
observed delayed
for Juliet, x.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.420
And this model tells
us how this data

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.540
is essentially generated.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.740
And now what we do is, we want
to use the data and our prior

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.560
belief, combined them somehow,
and use it to update our

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.180
belief into what we call
our posterior.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.050
In order to do that, we use
Bayes' rule, which is why this

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.340
is called Bayesian inference.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.750
So when we use Bayes' rule,
remember the Bayes' rule is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.870
just, we want to now find the
posterior which is the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.360
conditional PDF of theta, the
unknown parameter, given x.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.710
So essentially just flip
this condition.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.560
And remember Bayes' rule is
given as the following.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.210
It's just the prior times this
conditional PDF of x given

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.290
theta divided by the PDF of x.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.660
All right, and we know what
most of these things are.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.050
The prior or just the
PDF of theta is 1.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.180
The condition PDF of x given
theta is 1 over theta.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.370
And then of course we
have this PDF of x.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.950
But we always have to be careful
because these two

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.520
values are only valid for
certain ranges of theta and x.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.620
So in order for this to be
valid we need theta to be

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.560
between 0 and 1 because
otherwise it would be 0.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.890
So we need theta to be
between 0 and 1.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.640
And we need x to be between
0 and theta.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.580
 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.330
And otherwise this would be 0.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.400
 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.920
So now we're almost done.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.200
One last thing we need to do
is just calculate what this

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.210
denominator is, f x of x.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.360
Well the denominator,
remember, is just a

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.490
normalization.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.400
And it's actually relatively
less important because what

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.760
we'll find out is that this has
no dependence on theta.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.670
It will only depend on x.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.440
So the importance, the
dependence on theta, will be

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.390
captured just by
the numerator.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.810
But for completeness let's
calculate out what this is.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.350
So it's just a normalization.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:41.230
So it's actually just the
integral of the numerator.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.720
You can think of it as an
application of kind of total

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.970
probability.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.400
 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.700
So we have this that we
integrate over and what do we

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.460
integrate this over?

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.020
Well we know that we're
integrating over theta.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.220
And we know that theta
has to be between x--

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.060
has to be greater than x and
it has to be less than 1.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.750
So we integrate from theta
equals x to 1.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.850
And this is just the integral
from x to 1 of

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.210
the numerator, right?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.830
This is just 1 and this
is 1 over theta.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.370
So it's the integral of 1 over
theta, d theta from x to 1.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.450
Which when you do it out,
this is the integral,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.560
this is log of theta.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.520
So it's log of 1
minus log of x.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.750
Log of 1 is 0.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.800
X, remember x is between
0 and theta.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.560
Theta is less than 1.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.960
So x has to be between
0 and 1.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.310
The log of something between
0 and 1 is negative.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.690
So this is a negative number.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.030
This is 0.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.490
And then we have a
negative sign.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:58.910
So really what we can write this
as is the absolute value

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.260
of log of x.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.590
This is just so that it would
actually be negative log of x.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.300
But because log of x is
negative we can just--

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.210
we know that this is actually
going to be a positive number.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.550
So this is just to make it
look more intuitive.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.810
OK so now to complete this we
can just plug that back in and

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.470
the final answer is--

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:31.480
this is going to be the absolute
value log of x or you

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.380
could also rewrite this as 1
over theta times absolute

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.880
value log of x.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.780
And of course, remember that
the actual limits for where

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.690
this is valid are
very important.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.430
OK, so what does this
actually mean?

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:02.170
Let's try to interpret
what this answer is.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.900
So what we have is this is the
posterior distribution.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.710
And now what have we done?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.650
Well we started out with the
prior, which was that theta is

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:21.500
uniform between 0 and
between 0 and 1.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.120
This is our prior belief.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.900
Now we observed some data.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.200
And this allows us to
update our belief.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.870
And this is the update
that we get.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.700
So let's just assume that we
observe that Juliet is late by

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.430
half an hour.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.660
Well if she's late by half an
hour, what does that tell us

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.540
about what theta can be?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.750
Well what we know from that at
least is that theta cannot be

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.460
anything less than half an hour
because if theta were

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.040
less than half an hour there's
no way that her delay--

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.740
remember her delay we know
has to be distributed

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.150
between 0 and theta.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.090
There's no way that her delay
could be half an hour if theta

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.860
were less than half an hour.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:10.960
So automatically we know that
now theta has to be somewhere

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.900
between x and one which is where
this limit comes in.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.530
So we know that theta have to be
between x and 1 now instead

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.820
of just 0 and 1.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.910
So by observing an x that cuts
down and eliminates part of

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.320
the range of theta, the range
that theta can take on.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.000
Now what else do we know?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.665
Well this, we can actually
plot this.

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.030
This is a function of theta.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.930
The log x, we can just
think of it as some

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.500
sort of scaling factor.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.030
So it's something like
1 over theta scaled.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.015
And so that's going to look
something like this.

00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:46.080
 

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.270
And so what we've done is we've
transformed the prior,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.850
which looks like flat and
uniform into something that

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.660
looks like this,
the posterior.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.050
So we've eliminated small values
of x because we know

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.650
that those can't be possible.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.600
And now what's left is
everything between x and 1.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.830
So now why is it also that
it becomes not uniform

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.520
between x and 1?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.630
Well it's because, if you think
about it, when theta is

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.010
close to x, so say x
is half an hour.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.520
If theta is half an hour, that
means that there's higher

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.320
probability that you will
actually observe something, a

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.570
delay of half an hour because
there's only a range between 0

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.640
and half an hour that
x can be drawn from.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.120
Now if theta was actually 1 then
x could be drawn anywhere

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.330
from 0 to 1 which is
a wider range.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.730
And so it's less likely that
you'll get a value of x equal

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.780
to half an hour.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.070
And so because of that values
of theta closer

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.540
to x are more likely.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.320
That's why you get this
decreasing function.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:09.690
OK, so now let's continue and
now what we have is this is

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.350
the case for if you observe
one data point.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.440
So you arrange a date with
Juliet, you observe how late

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.800
she is, and you get
one value of x.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.690
And now suppose you want to get
collect more data so you

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.110
arrange say 10 dates
with Juliet.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.420
And for each one you observe
how late she was.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.720
So now we can collect multiple
samples, say

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.290
n samples of delays.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.080
So x1 is her delay on
the first date.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.950
Xn is her delay on
the nth date.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.100
And x we can now just call a
variable that's a collection

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.730
of all of these.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.180
And now the question is, how do
you incorporate in all this

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.330
information into updating
your belief about theta?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.360
And it's actually pretty
analogous to

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.730
what we've done here.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.030
The important assumption that
we make in this problem is

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:04.590
that conditional on theta, all
of these delays are in fact

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.730
conditionally independent.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.210
And that's going to help
us solve this problem.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.900
So the set up is essentially
the same.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.740
What we still need is a--

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.980
we still need the prior.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.230
And the prior hasn't changed.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.980
 

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.225
The prior is still uniform
between 0 and 1.

00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:35.460
 

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.140
The way the actual delays are
generated is we still assume

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.420
to be the same given conditional
on theta, each one

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.230
of these is conditionally
independent, and each one is

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.000
uniformly distributed
between 0 and theta.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.790
And so what we get is that this
is going to be equal to--

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:04.420
you can also imagine this as
a big joint PDF, joint

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:12.250
conditional PDF of
all the x's.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.800
And because we said that they
are conditionally independent

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.450
given theta, then we can
actually split this joint PDF

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.330
into the product of a lot of
individual conditional PDFs.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.240
So this we can actually rewrite
as PDF of x1 given

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.720
theta times all the way through
the condition PDF of

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.640
xn given theta.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.870
And because we assume that
each one of these is--

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.060
for each one of these it's
uniformly distributed between

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.680
0 and theta, they're
all the same.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.600
So in fact what we get
is 1 over theta

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.810
for each one of these.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.090
And there's n of them.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.490
So it's 1 over theta to the n.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.700
 

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.010
But what values of x
is this valid for?

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.590
What values of x and theta?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.290
Well what we need is that for
each one of these, we need

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:14.940
that theta has to be at least
equal to whatever x you get.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.820
Whatever x you observe, theta
has to at least that.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:28.730
So we know that theta has to at
least equal to x1 and all

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:29.490
the way through xn.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.650
And so theta has to be at least
greater than or equal to

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:39.370
all these x's and otherwise
this would be 0.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.110
So let's define something
that's going to help us.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:50.620
Let's define x bar to be
the maximum of all

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.680
the observed x's.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:03.600
And so what we can do is rewrite
this condition as

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.590
theta has to be at least
equal to the

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.050
maximum, equal to x bar.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.740
All right, and now we can
again apply Bayes' rule.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.560
Bayes' rule will tell us
what this posterior

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.270
distribution is.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:27.490
So again the numerator will
be the prior times this

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:34.645
conditional PDF over PDF of x.

00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:41.100
OK, so the numerator again,
the prior is just one.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.850
This distribution we calculated
over here.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.240
It's 1 over theta to the n.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.630
And then we have this
denominator.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.660
 

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.320
And again, we need to be careful
to write down when

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.650
this is actually valid.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:08.599
So it's actually valid when x
bar is greater than theta--

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.069
I'm sorry, x bar is less than
or equal to theta, and

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.480
otherwise it's zero.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.390
So this is actually more
or less complete.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.109
Again we need to calculate out
what exactly this denominator

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:26.660
is but just like before it's
actually just a scaling factor

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.800
which is independent
of what theta is.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.530
So if we wanted to, we could
actually calculate this out.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.150
It would be just like before.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.200
It would be the integral of the
numerator, which is 1 over

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.340
theta to the n d theta.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.050
And we integrate theta from
before, it was from x to 1.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.970
But now we need to integrate
from x bar to 1.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.100
And if we wanted to, we can
actually do others.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.230
It's fairly simple calculus
to calculate what this

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.840
normalization factor would be.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.600
But the main point is that the
shape of it will be dictated

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.100
by this 1 over theta
to the n term.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.820
And so now we know that with n
pieces of data, it's actually

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.530
going to be 1--

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.190
the shape will be 1 over theta
to the n, where theta has to

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.700
be at least greater than
or equal to x bar.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.890
Before it was actually just
1 over theta and has to be

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.920
between x and 1.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.920
So you can kind of see how the
problem generalizes when you

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.140
collect more data.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.920
So now imagine that
this is the new--

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.460
when you collect n pieces of
data, the maximum of all the

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.140
x's is here.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.000
Well, it turns out that it's the
posterior now is going to

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.020
look something like this.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.960
 

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.460
So it becomes steeper because
it's 1 over theta to the n as

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.740
opposed to 1 over theta.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.560
And it's limited to be
between x bar and 1.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.020
And so with more data you're
more sure of the range that

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:08.260
theta can take on because each
data points eliminates parts

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.260
of theta, the range of theta
that theta can't be.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.720
And so you're left with
just x bar to 1.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.320
And you're also more certain.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.350
So you have this kind
of distribution.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:26.590
OK, so this is kind of the
posterior distribution which

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.170
tells you the entire
distribution of what the

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.000
unknown parameter--

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.220
the entire distribution of the
unknown parameter given all

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.750
the data that you have
plus the prior

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.800
distribution that you have.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.250
But if someone were to come to
ask you, your manager asks

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.090
you, well what is your best
guess of what theta is?

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.130
It's less informative or less
clear when you tell them,

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.560
here's the distribution.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.000
Because you still have a big
range of what theta could be,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.760
it could be anything between
x and 1 or x bar and 1.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.420
So if you wanted to actually
come up with a point estimate

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.190
which is just one single value,
there's different ways

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.100
you can do it.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.380
The first way that we'll talk
about is the map rule.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.130
What the map rule does is
it takes the posterior

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:25.700
distribution and just finds
the value of the parameter

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.050
that gives the maximum posterior
distribution, the

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.360
maximum point in the posterior
distribution.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:39.560
So if you look at this posture
distribution, the map will

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.870
just take the highest value.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.320
And in this case, because the
posterior looks like this, the

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.060
highest value is in fact x.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:21:00.260
And so theta hat map
is actually just x.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.360
And if you think about it, this
kind of an optimistic

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.310
estimate because you always
assume that it's whatever, if

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.800
Juliet were 30 minutes late then
you assume that her delay

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.300
is uniformly distributed between
0 and 30 minutes.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.710
Well in fact, even though she
arrived 30 minutes late, that

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.340
could have been because she's
actually distributed between 0

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.450
and 1 hour and you just happened
to get 30 minutes.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.590
But what you do is you always
take kind of the optimistic,

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.690
and just give her the benefit of
the doubt, and say that was

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.210
actually kind of the worst
case scenario given her

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.320
distribution.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.490
So another way to take this
entire posterior distribution

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.440
and come up with just a single
number, a point estimate, is

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.560
to take the conditional
expectation.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.750
So you have an entire
distribution.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.020
So there's two obvious ways of
getting a number out of this.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.500
One is to take the maximum and
the other is to take the

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.170
expectation.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.130
So take everything in the
distribution, combine it and

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.740
come up with a estimate.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.240
So if you think about it, it
will probably be something

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.610
like here, would be the
conditional distribution.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.890
So this is called the
LMS estimator.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.590
And the way to calculate it is
just like we said, you take

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.840
the conditional expectation.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.190
 

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.710
So how do we take the
conditional expectation?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:29.810
Remember it is just the value
and you weight it by the

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.260
correct distribution, in this
case it's the conditional PDF

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.580
of theta given x which is the
posterior distribution.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.770
And what do we integrate
theta from?

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:45.840
Well we integrate
it from x to 1.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.780
Now if we plug this in, we
integrate from x to 1, theta

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:56.370
times the posterior.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:02.710
The posterior we calculated
earlier, it was 1 over theta

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.840
times the absolute
value of log x.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.090
So the thetas just cancel out,
and you just have 1 over

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.110
absolute value of log x.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.970
Well that doesn't
depend on theta.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:20.150
So what you get is just 1
minus x over absolute

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.810
value of log x.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.870
All right, so we can actually
plot this, so we have two

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.570
estimates now.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.280
One is that the estimate
is just theta--

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.830
the estimate is just x.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.710
The other one is that it's
1 minus x over absolute

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.840
value of log x.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.630
So we can plot this and
compare the two.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.250
 

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:53.320
So here's x, and here is theta
hat, theta hat of x for the

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.490
two different estimates.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:02.690
So here's you the estimate from
the map rule which is

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.190
whatever x is, we estimate
that theta is equal to x.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.130
So it just looks like this.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.520
Now if we plot this, turns
out that it looks

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.770
something like this.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.980
 

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.550
And so whatever x is, this
will tell you what the

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.480
estimate, the LMS estimate
of theta would be.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.740
And it turns out that
it's always higher

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.850
than the map estimate.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.330
So it's less optimistic.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.485
And it kind of factors in
the entire distribution.

00:24:36.485 --> 00:24:41.380
 

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.980
So because there are several
parts to this problem, we're

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.470
going to take a pause for a
quick break and we'll come

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.500
back and finish the problem
in a little bit.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.034
