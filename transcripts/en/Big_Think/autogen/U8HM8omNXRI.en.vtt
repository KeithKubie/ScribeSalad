we generally think we understand reality

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050
we generally think we understand reality
 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.129
we generally think we understand reality
but when you see something like that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
but when you see something like that
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410
but when you see something like that
it can make you question that it can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
it can make you question that it can
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.109
it can make you question that it can
make you suspend your ideas and I think

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
make you suspend your ideas and I think
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790
make you suspend your ideas and I think
that's why it's really interesting to me

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
that's why it's really interesting to me
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.190
that's why it's really interesting to me
it's not because you know some people

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200
it's not because you know some people
 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.340
it's not because you know some people
look at it as oh you know it expands

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350
look at it as oh you know it expands
 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.040
look at it as oh you know it expands
what's possible but it's morph to me

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
what's possible but it's morph to me
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.439
what's possible but it's morph to me
what's interesting is it gets people to

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449
what's interesting is it gets people to
 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.630
what's interesting is it gets people to
suspend their ideas about reality and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
suspend their ideas about reality and
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299
suspend their ideas about reality and
not to be so sure that we know because I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
not to be so sure that we know because I
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950
not to be so sure that we know because I
think we often think that we already

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
think we often think that we already
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.320
think we often think that we already
understand reality we think that our

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330
understand reality we think that our
 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.200
understand reality we think that our
worldview is more or less complete that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
worldview is more or less complete that
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.149
worldview is more or less complete that
maybe there are some things that we

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159
maybe there are some things that we
 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.560
maybe there are some things that we
don't know and some things that we don't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
don't know and some things that we don't
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.689
don't know and some things that we don't
understand but more or less we've got a

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699
understand but more or less we've got a
 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.320
understand but more or less we've got a
handle on reality and I like I like to

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330
handle on reality and I like I like to
 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.920
handle on reality and I like I like to
do what I do because it it brings that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
do what I do because it it brings that
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.399
do what I do because it it brings that
into question and in that creates space

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409
into question and in that creates space
 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.610
into question and in that creates space
for us to discover a lot more depth

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620
for us to discover a lot more depth
 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.790
for us to discover a lot more depth
about who we are and why are we here

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800
 
 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 
no I never explain what I do and that's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
no I never explain what I do and that's
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.430
no I never explain what I do and that's
unique to my style because I like to I

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440
unique to my style because I like to I
 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.050
unique to my style because I like to I
like to I don't tell people whether what

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060
like to I don't tell people whether what
 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.340
like to I don't tell people whether what
I do is real or not real I like to leave

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350
I do is real or not real I like to leave
 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.050
I do is real or not real I like to leave
them guessing and that's part of what

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060
them guessing and that's part of what
 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.840
them guessing and that's part of what
creates this sense of suspension of the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850
creates this sense of suspension of the
 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.400
creates this sense of suspension of the
ideas because if I told them that it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410
ideas because if I told them that it
 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.440
ideas because if I told them that it
wasn't real they'd have some ideas about

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450
wasn't real they'd have some ideas about
 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.420
wasn't real they'd have some ideas about
it and if I told him that it was real

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430
it and if I told him that it was real
 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.190
it and if I told him that it was real
they would just form some other ideas

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
they would just form some other ideas
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.860
they would just form some other ideas
about it as well and I like to keep

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870
about it as well and I like to keep
 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.170
about it as well and I like to keep
people perfectly in the middle where

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180
people perfectly in the middle where
 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.630
people perfectly in the middle where
they're not sure and it's much more

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
they're not sure and it's much more
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.260
they're not sure and it's much more
interesting

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
 
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.169
 
I don't think they're over focused I

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179
I don't think they're over focused I
 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.959
I don't think they're over focused I
mean I think we have certain belief

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969
mean I think we have certain belief
 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.410
mean I think we have certain belief
systems that but I find that people are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
systems that but I find that people are
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410
systems that but I find that people are
remarkably open I've performed for

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
remarkably open I've performed for
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.109
remarkably open I've performed for
scientists and I'm always doctors and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
scientists and I'm always doctors and
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.510
scientists and I'm always doctors and
I'm always amazed at how open they are I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
I'm always amazed at how open they are I
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.990
I'm always amazed at how open they are I
think it's not that we tend to be

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
think it's not that we tend to be
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.380
think it's not that we tend to be
skeptical is we've been given a very

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
skeptical is we've been given a very
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.589
skeptical is we've been given a very
materialistic framework for existence

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
materialistic framework for existence
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.789
materialistic framework for existence
and we don't yet have a way even when we

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799
and we don't yet have a way even when we
 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.440
and we don't yet have a way even when we
experience something non materialistic

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
experience something non materialistic
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.229
experience something non materialistic
whether it's psychic or spiritual which

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
whether it's psychic or spiritual which
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.059
whether it's psychic or spiritual which
are two different things if we

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069
are two different things if we
 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.339
are two different things if we
experience either of those we don't

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349
experience either of those we don't
 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.680
experience either of those we don't
necessarily have a conceptual framework

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
necessarily have a conceptual framework
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.740
necessarily have a conceptual framework
or understanding to to make meaning from

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
or understanding to to make meaning from
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.080
or understanding to to make meaning from
it and therefore it's easier to kind of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
it and therefore it's easier to kind of
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.670
it and therefore it's easier to kind of
dismiss it but I don't think it's that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
dismiss it but I don't think it's that
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280
dismiss it but I don't think it's that
people necessarily overly skeptical I'm

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
people necessarily overly skeptical I'm
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.680
people necessarily overly skeptical I'm
always amazed at how open-minded people

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
always amazed at how open-minded people
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.019
always amazed at how open-minded people
are
