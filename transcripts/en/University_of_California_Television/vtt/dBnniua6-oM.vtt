00:00:01.364 --> 00:00:02.624
- [Announcer] This program is presented

00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:05.306
by University of California Television.

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:06.707

with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.676
(upbeat techno music)

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:10.513
- I'm going to tell you, tonight, a story.

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:13.930
And this story dates back about 30 years.

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.314
This story has a little bit
of something for everybody.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:21.736
It has a little bit of biochemistry,

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.737
a little bit of clinical research,

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:25.507
a little bit of public health,

00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:29.548
a little bit of politics, a
little bit of racial innuendo.

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.592
The only thing it's missing is sex.

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:32.547
(audience laughs)

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:37.038
But, well, we can see what
we can do about that, too.

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:39.365
By the end of the story I hope I will

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.580
have debunked the last 30 years

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.047
of nutrition information in America.

00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:45.408
And I would very much appreciate it

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:47.849
if at the end of the
talk, you would tell me

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.275
whether or not I was successful or not.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:51.323
Okay?

00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:54.095
So, in order to get you in the mood,

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:57.622
as it were, let's start
with a little quiz.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:58.597
What do the Atkins Diet

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:01.680
and the Japanese Diet have in common?

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.173
Anybody?

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:06.814
Hm?

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:10.728
Oh, you have the answers
right, never mind.

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:13.987
That's right, you have
the answer right there.

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:16.907
So the Atkins diet, of
course, is all fat no carb.

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:18.846
The Japanese diet's all carb, not fat.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:20.679
They both work, right?

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:24.038
So what do they share in common?

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:27.371
They both eliminate the sugar, fructose.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.932
So, with that, think about
what it means to be on a diet,

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.195
and what macro-nutrients you're eating

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:38.475
and which ones your not.

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.121
And then we'll go from there, and I'll try

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:42.579
to explain how this all works.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.871
So, you've all heard about
the obesity epidemic.

00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:47.760
Here are the numbers.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.131
These are the NHANES
database Body Mass Index.

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:53.908
Everybody knows what that is now.

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:58.586
Histograms marching ever
rightward as time has gone on.

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:01.548
This was what was
projected for 2008 in blue.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.621
We had so far exceeded and surpassed,

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:04.704
this is not even funny.

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:05.815
This was from 2003.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:08.378
The reason I show this is not just to show

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:10.816
that the obese are getting obeser,

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.522
of course, that's true, but in fact

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.338
the entire curve has shifted.

00:03:14.338 --> 00:03:17.033
We all weigh 25 pounds more today

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.886
than we did 25 years ago, all of us.

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:22.954
Now, it is often said that obesity

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:24.834
is the ultimate interaction between

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.530
genetics and environment.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.779
And Doctor Christian Vaisse, who's sitting

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.253
in the back of the room, will be talking

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:31.691
to you next week about
the genetic component,

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.641
which I am also very interested in.

00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.892
But, having said that, our genetic pool

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:38.773
did not change in the last 30 years,

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:42.160
but, boy oh boy, has our
environment sure changed.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.701
So, tonight, we're gonna talk about

00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:46.607
the environment rather than genes.

00:03:46.607 --> 00:03:48.955
Now, in order to talk
about the environment,

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.710
we need to talk about what is obesity.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.274
And, of course, you're all familiar with

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.424
the basic concept with the
first law of thermodynamics,

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:56.838
which states that the total energy

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:59.540
inside a closed system remains constant.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.831
Now, in human terms, the
standard interpretation

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.441
of this law is the following.

00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.608
If you eat it, you better burn
it, or you're gonna store it.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.280
Now, who here believes that?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.422
Oh, come on, you all do.

00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:16.686
(audience laughs)

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:18.528
I used to believe that.

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:19.562
I don't anymore.

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:21.006
I think that's a mistake.

00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:22.960
I think that is the biggest mistake.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.488
And that is the phenomenon
I'm going to try to debunk

00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:30.184
over the course over the next hour.

00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:33.261
Because I think there's
another way to state the law

00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:36.300
which is much more relevant,
and much more to the point.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.487
Before I get there, of
course, if you believe that,

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.677
these are the two problems,
calories in, calories out.

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:45.930
Two behaviors, gluttony and sloth.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.971
After all, you see anybody on the street,

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.415
"Oh, he's a gluttonous sloth,
that's all there is to it."

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.179
Tommy Thompson said it on the TV show.

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.973
"We just eat too damn much."

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:57.491
Well, you know, if that were the case,

00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.206
how did the Japanese do this?

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:00.905
Why are they doing bariatric surgery

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:04.237
on children at Tokyo
Children's Hospital today?

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.756
Why are the Chinese, why are the Koreans,

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:08.155
why are the Australians?

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:12.108
I mean, all these countries
who've adopted our diet

00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:14.863
all suffer now from the same problem.

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:17.310
And we're gonna get even
further in a minute.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.604
There's another way to
state this first law.

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:22.839
And that is, if you're gonna store it,

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.358
that is biochemical forces
that drive energy storage,

00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:29.857
and we'll talk about what
they are in a few minutes,

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:33.002
and you expect to burn it, that is normal

00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:36.903
energy expenditure for
normal quality of life.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.720
Because energy expenditure
and quality of life

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.296
are the same thing.

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:43.080
Things that make your
energy expenditure go up,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.389
make you feel good.

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.480
Like ephedrine, it's off the market,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.264
coffee for two yours, then
you need another hit, like me.

00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:53.278
Things that make your
energy expenditure go down,

00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:57.445
like starvation, hypothyroidism,
make you feel lousy.

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.085
And how many calories you burn

00:06:00.085 --> 00:06:02.471
and how good you feel are synonymous.

00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:04.158
So, if you're gonna store it,

00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:05.356
that is an obligate weight gain

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.612
set up by a biochemical process,

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.775
and you expect to burn it, that is normal

00:06:09.775 --> 00:06:12.163
energy expenditure for
normal quality of life,

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.273
then you're gonna have to eat it.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:18.389
And now, all of the sudden,
these two behaviors,

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.301
the gluttony and the sloth,
are actually secondary

00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:24.231
to a biochemical process,
which is primary.

00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.193
And it's a different way
to think about the process.

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:29.087
And it also alleviates the obese person

00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:33.282
from being the perpetrator,
but rather the victim.

00:06:33.282 --> 00:06:36.309
Which is how obese people really feel.

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.648
'Cause no one chooses to be obese.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.953
Certainly, no child chooses to be obese.

00:06:40.953 --> 00:06:42.284
Oh, you say, "Oh, yeah, sure,

00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:43.612
"I know some adults who don't care."

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:46.163
You know, Rossini, the famous composer,

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:48.722
you know La gazza ladra,
Figaro, and all that.

00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:50.180
He retired at age 37

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.853
to a lifetime of gastronomic debauchery.

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:55.590
Maybe he chose to be obese.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.249
But the kids I take care
of in obesity clinic

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.721
do not choose to be obese.

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:04.888
In fact, this is the exception
that proves the rule.

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:10.535
We have an epidemic of
obese six month olds.

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:12.737
Now, if you wanna say that it's all about

00:07:12.737 --> 00:07:16.618
diet and exercise, then you
have to explain this to me.

00:07:16.618 --> 00:07:20.226
So, any hypothesis that you wanna proffer

00:07:20.226 --> 00:07:22.470
that explains the obesity epidemic,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.538
you've got to explain this one too.

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:27.317
And this is not just in America,

00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:28.800
these six month old obese kids,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.717
but these are around the world now.

00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:35.905
So, open your minds?, and let's go

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:39.072
and figure out what the real story is.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:42.154
Let's talk about calorie intake,

00:07:42.154 --> 00:07:43.251
because that's what today is about.

00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.084
We're gonna talk about the

00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:47.535
energy intake side of the equation.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:50.578
Sure enough, we are all eating more now

00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:52.578
than we did 20 year ago.

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.641
Teen boys are eating 275 calories more.

00:07:56.641 --> 00:08:01.639
American adult males are eating
187 calories more per day.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:06.190
American adult females are
eating 335 calories more per day.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.538
No question, we're all eating more.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:11.432
Question is why, how come?

00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:12.590
'Cause it's all there?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.221
You know what, it was there before.

00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:18.352
We're all eating more, there's a system

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:19.725
in our body, which you've heard about

00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:22.375
over the last couple
of weeks called leptin.

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:23.980
Everybody heard of leptin?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.779
It's this hormone that
comes from your fat cell,

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:27.668
tells your brain, "You
know what, I've had enough.

00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:29.029
"I don't need to eat anymore.

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:32.687
"I'm done, and I can
burn energy properly."

00:08:32.687 --> 00:08:33.763
Well, you know what?

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.841
If you're eating 187 or
335 calories more today

00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:39.902
than you were 20 years ago,
your leptin ain't working.

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:41.710
'Cause if it were, you
wouldn't be doing it.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.925
Whether the food was there or not.

00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:46.709
So, there's something wrong with our

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:49.248
biochemical negative feedback system

00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:52.662
that normally controls energy balance.

00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:55.160
And we have to figure out what caused it,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.487
and how to reverse it.

00:08:56.487 --> 00:08:58.298
And that's what tonight is about.

00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:00.919
But, nonetheless, there are 275 calories

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.190
we have to account for.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.619
So where are they?

00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:05.633
Are they in the fat?

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:08.081
No, they're not in the fat.

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:11.505
Five grams, 45 calories
out of the 275, nothing.

00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:15.321
In fact, it's all in the carbohydrates.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.873
57 grams 228 calories.

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:19.835
We're all eating more carbohydrate.

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:22.813
Now, you all know, back int 1982,

00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:24.711
The American Heart Association,

00:09:24.711 --> 00:09:26.476
The American Medical Association,

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:28.347
and the US Department of Agriculture

00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:31.346
admonished us to reduce our total

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:34.919
fat consumption from 40% to 30%.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.887
Everybody remember that?

00:09:36.887 --> 00:09:41.015
That how Entenmann's fat
free cakes came into being.

00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:42.538
Remember that?

00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:44.134
So what happened?

00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:46.805
We did it, we've done it.

00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:49.632
40% down to 30%, and look what's happened

00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:52.006
to the obesity, metabolic syndrome,

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:54.699
non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, cardiovascular disease,

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:58.612
stroke prevalence, all jacked way up,

00:09:58.612 --> 00:10:03.558
as our total fat consumption
as a percent has gone down.

00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:06.597
It ain't the fat,
people, it ain't the fat.

00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:07.430
So what is it?

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.403
Well, it's the carbohydrate.

00:10:08.403 --> 00:10:10.315
Specifically, which carbohydrate?

00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:12.732
Well, beverage intake, right?

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:18.137
41% increase in soft drinks,
35% increase in fruit drinks,

00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:22.175
fruitades, whatever you wanna call them.

00:10:22.175 --> 00:10:23.602
Just remember, down here,

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:26.852
one can of soda a day, is 150 calories.

00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:30.205
Multiply that by 365 days a year,

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:32.493
and then divide that by the magic number

00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:34.786
of 3500 calories per pound,

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:36.940
if you eat or drink 3500 calories

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.556
more than you burn, you
will gain one pound of fat.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.263
That's the first law of
thermodynamics, no argument there.

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:45.702
That's worth 15 1/2
pounds of fat per year.

00:10:45.702 --> 00:10:47.875
One soda a day is 15 1/2 pounds per year.

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.724
Now, you've all heard that before.

00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:51.059
That's not news to you.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:54.559
The question is how come we don't respond?

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:57.956
How come leptin doesn't work?

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:00.344
How come we can't stay energy stable.

00:11:00.344 --> 00:11:02.324
That's what we're gonna get to.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:05.473
So, I call this slide, very specifically,

00:11:05.473 --> 00:11:07.605
the Coca Cola Conspiracy.

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:10.438
Anybody here work for Coke, Pepsi?

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:12.248
Okay, good.

00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:15.248
All right, so, this over here, 1915,

00:11:16.102 --> 00:11:19.387
the first standardized bottle
of Coca Cola out of Atlanta.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.529
Anybody remember this bottle?

00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:23.143
Sure, a lot of you do.

00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:25.725
I remember this bottle,
because my grandfather

00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:28.997
in Brooklyn, took me on Saturday afternoon

00:11:28.997 --> 00:11:32.399
down to the local soda shop
on Avenue M and Ocean Avenue,

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.557
and every Saturday afternoon
I had one of these.

00:11:35.557 --> 00:11:37.591
I remember it very well.

00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:39.318
Now, if you drank one of those every day,

00:11:39.318 --> 00:11:42.041
assuming of course that
the recipe hasn't changed,

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.759
'cause after all, only
two people in the word

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:45.140
know the recipe, and they're not allowed

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.114
to fly on the plane at the same time.

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:48.279
You know that, okay.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.037
Assuming the recipe hasn't changed,

00:11:50.037 --> 00:11:51.793
if you drank one of those
every day for a year,

00:11:51.793 --> 00:11:53.279
6 1/2 ounces, that would be worth

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.245
eight pounds of fat per year.

00:11:56.245 --> 00:11:59.233
Now, in 1955, after World War II,

00:11:59.233 --> 00:12:01.091
when sugar became plentiful again,

00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.423
and wasn't being rationed,

00:12:02.423 --> 00:12:04.768
we have the appearance
of the 10 ounce bottle,

00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:07.571
the first one that was
found in vending machines.

00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.705
You probably remember that one, as well.

00:12:09.705 --> 00:12:11.931
Then in 1960, the ever ubiquitous,

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.081
12 ounce can, worth 16
pounds of fat per year.

00:12:15.081 --> 00:12:17.397
And, of course, today, this, over here

00:12:17.397 --> 00:12:20.828
is the single unit of measure, 20 ounces.

00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:23.726
Anybody know how many
servings are in that bottle?

00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:24.907
- [Audience Member] 2.5.

00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:27.200
- 2.5 eight ounce servings, that's right.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.070
Anybody know, anybody gets 2.5 eight ounce

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.794
servings out of that bottle?

00:12:31.794 --> 00:12:34.334
That's a single serving, right?

00:12:34.334 --> 00:12:36.589
So that would be worth
26 pounds of fat per year

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.442
if you did that every day.

00:12:37.442 --> 00:12:38.539
And then, of course, over here,

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:40.612
we have the 7/11 Big K, Thirst Buster,

00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:42.339
Big Gulp, whatever you wanna call it,

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:45.273
44 ounces, worth 57
pounds of fat per year.

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:47.325
And if that wasn't bad
enough, my colleague,

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:50.436
Dr. Dan Hale, at the University
of Texas San Antonio,

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:54.822
tells me that down there they
got a Texas size Big Gulp.

00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:57.181
60 ounces of Coca Cola, a Snickers bar,

00:12:57.181 --> 00:12:59.741
and a bag of Doritos, all for 99 cents.

00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:01.810
- [Audience] Oh.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.235
- So if you did that every day for a year

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:06.916
that would be worth 112
pounds of fat per year.

00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:11.188
So why do I call it the
Coca Cola conspiracy?

00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:12.938
Well, what's in Coke?

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:16.258
Caffeine, good, good, so what's caffeine?

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.208
It's a mild stimulant, right?

00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:19.922
It's also a diuretic, right?

00:13:19.922 --> 00:13:21.752
It makes you pee free water.

00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:24.160
What else is in Coke?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.311
We'll get to the sugar
in a minute, what else?

00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.228
Salt, salt.

00:13:29.287 --> 00:13:31.563
55 milligrams of sodium per can.

00:13:31.563 --> 00:13:33.877
It's like drinking a pizza.

00:13:33.877 --> 00:13:36.012
So what happens if you take on sodium

00:13:36.012 --> 00:13:38.022
and lose free water, you get...

00:13:38.022 --> 00:13:38.980
- [Audience] Thirsty.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.427
- Thirstier, right.

00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:43.686
So, why's there so much sugar in Coke?

00:13:43.686 --> 00:13:45.331
To hide the salt.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:46.929
When was the last time you
went to a Chinese restaurant,

00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:48.795
had sweet and sour pork?

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:50.585
That's half soy sauce,
you wouldn't eat that.

00:13:50.585 --> 00:13:52.087
Except the sugar plays
a trick on your tongue,

00:13:52.087 --> 00:13:54.684
you can't even tell it's there.

00:13:54.684 --> 00:13:57.517
Everybody remember New Coke, 1985?

00:13:58.573 --> 00:14:00.248
More salt, more caffeine.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:02.466
They knew what they were doing.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.753
That's the smoking gun.

00:14:04.753 --> 00:14:07.249
They know, they know.

00:14:07.249 --> 00:14:10.989
All right, so, that's why
it's the Coca Cola conspiracy.

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:13.183
So, are soft drinks the cause of obesity?

00:14:13.183 --> 00:14:14.978
Well, depends on who you ask.

00:14:14.978 --> 00:14:16.388
If you ask the scientists for the

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:17.642
National Soft Drink Association,

00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:18.576
they'll tell you there's absolutely

00:14:18.576 --> 00:14:22.189
no association between sugar
consumption and obesity.

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:24.314
If you ask my colleague,
Doctor David Ludwig,

00:14:24.314 --> 00:14:26.367
remember, I'm Lustig he's Ludwig,

00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:28.880
he does what I do at
Boston Children's Hospital.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.013
Some day we're gonna open up a law firm.

00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:31.846
(audience laughs)

00:14:31.846 --> 00:14:34.073
Each additional sugar
sweetened drink increase

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.364
over a 19 month follow up period in kids

00:14:36.364 --> 00:14:37.869
increased their BMI by this much

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:42.281
in their odds risk ratio
for obesity by 60%.

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.673
That's a prospective study
on soft drinks and obesity.

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:48.332
The real deal.

00:14:48.332 --> 00:14:49.752
If you look at meta-analysis,

00:14:49.752 --> 00:14:51.787
everybody know what a meta-analysis is?

00:14:51.787 --> 00:14:53.635
It's a conglomeration of numerous studies

00:14:53.635 --> 00:14:57.647
subjected to rigorous
statistical analysis.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.913
88 cross sectional and
longitudinal studies

00:14:59.913 --> 00:15:01.782
regressing soft drink consumption against

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:03.976
energy intake, body weight,
milk and calcium intake,

00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:08.487
adequate nutrition, all showing
significant associations.

00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:09.724
And some of these being longitudinal,

00:15:09.724 --> 00:15:13.172
this came from Kelly
Brownell's group at Yale.

00:15:13.172 --> 00:15:15.912
I should comment, a
disclaimer, those studies

00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.377
that were funded by the beverage industry

00:15:17.377 --> 00:15:19.379
showed consistently smaller effects

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:21.594
than those that were independent.

00:15:21.594 --> 00:15:23.139
Wonder why.

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:24.836
Now, how 'bout the converse?

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:27.396
What if you take the soft drinks away?

00:15:27.396 --> 00:15:28.805
So this was the fizzy drink study

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:30.991
from Christ Church England James et al,

00:15:30.991 --> 00:15:33.008
British Medical Journal, where they went

00:15:33.008 --> 00:15:35.794
into schools and they took
the soda machines out.

00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:38.177
Just like we did here in California.

00:15:38.177 --> 00:15:39.117
We haven't seen the data yet,

00:15:39.117 --> 00:15:41.636
but they went and did it for a year.

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:43.260
So the prevalence of obesity in

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.704
the intervention schools stayed

00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:46.544
absolutely constant, no change.

00:15:46.544 --> 00:15:47.845
Whereas the prevalence of obesity

00:15:47.845 --> 00:15:50.344
in the control schools
where nothing changed

00:15:50.344 --> 00:15:53.633
continued to rise over the year.

00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:55.741
So that's pretty good.

00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:57.896
So, how 'bout type two diabetes?

00:15:57.896 --> 00:16:00.569
Are soft drinks the cause
of type two diabetes?

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:03.178
Well, this study from JAMA in 2004

00:16:03.178 --> 00:16:05.250
looked at the relative risk ratio

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.117
of all soft drinks, cola, fruit punch,

00:16:07.117 --> 00:16:09.630
and found a very statistically significant

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.470
trend of sugared soft drinks, fruitades,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.685
et cetera, causing type two diabetes.

00:16:15.685 --> 00:16:17.573
And you know we've got
just as big a problem

00:16:17.573 --> 00:16:18.966
with type two diabetes as we do

00:16:18.966 --> 00:16:21.495
with obesity for the same reasons.

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:23.327
And this was a sugared
sweetened beverage against

00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:25.886
risk for type two diabetes
in African American women.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:27.683
Looking here at sugar
sweetened soft drinks,

00:16:27.683 --> 00:16:30.160
just the downward arrow shows that

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.153
there was a significant rise

00:16:32.153 --> 00:16:34.600
as the number of drinks went up.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.638
You can see that here.

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:39.962
Whereas orange and grapefruit
juice, interestingly, did not.

00:16:39.962 --> 00:16:43.095
So, two different studies,
two different increases

00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:47.829
in type two diabetes, relative
to soft drink consumption.

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:49.820
So, what's in soft drinks?

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.074
Well, in America, it's this stuff, right?

00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:54.077
High fructose corn syrup.

00:16:54.077 --> 00:16:55.609
Everybody's heard of it, right?

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:57.693
It's been demonized something awful.

00:16:57.693 --> 00:17:00.245
So much so that the corn refiners industry

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:03.028
has launched a mega-campaign to try

00:17:03.028 --> 00:17:06.909
to absolve high fructose
corn syrup of any problems,

00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:08.401
which we'll talk about in a moment.

00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:10.313
But the bottom line is, this is something

00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:14.006
we were never exposed to before 1975.

00:17:14.006 --> 00:17:15.428
And currently we are consuming

00:17:15.428 --> 00:17:19.941
63 pounds per person per
year, every one of us,

00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:21.935
63 pounds of high fructose corn syrup.

00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:22.768
- [Audience Member] That's America?

00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:25.155
- That's America, yes.

00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:27.148
Now, what is high fructose corn syrup?

00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:28.306
Well, you'll see in a minute.

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:30.297
It's one glucose, one fructose,

00:17:30.297 --> 00:17:32.848
we'll talk about those at great length.

00:17:32.848 --> 00:17:34.558
One of the reasons we use
high fructose corn syrup

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:35.989
is because it's sweeter.

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.569
So here's sucrose, this
is cane or beet sugar,

00:17:38.569 --> 00:17:41.260
standard table sugar, you
know, the white stuff,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.310
and we give that an index
in sweetness of 100.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.480
So here's high fructose corn syrup,

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.642
it's actually sweeter, it's about 120.

00:17:47.642 --> 00:17:51.543
So, you should be able to use less, right?

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:56.010
Wrong, we use just as
much, in fact, we use more.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.930
So, here's lab fructose over
here, crystalline fructose.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.868
And they're starting to
put crystalline fructose

00:18:00.868 --> 00:18:03.405
into some of the soft drinks.

00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:06.253
They're actually advertising
it as a good thing.

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:07.760
Phew.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.910
And that's got a sweetness of 173,

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.480
so you should be able to
cut that way back, right?

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.820
They're not.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.403
Lactose, down here, milk
sugar, it's not sweet at all.

00:18:16.403 --> 00:18:19.428
And glucose, I should
point out over here, 74.

00:18:19.428 --> 00:18:20.907
It's not particularly
sweet, and we're gonna

00:18:20.907 --> 00:18:24.439
get to that at the end, and
what goes on with glucose.

00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:27.679
But anyway, there's why
we use it, it's sweeter,

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:30.230
it's also cheaper as I'll show you.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.242
So, here's high fructose corn syrup.

00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:35.167
One glucose, one fructose.

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:37.524
Notice the glucose is a six membered ring,

00:18:37.524 --> 00:18:39.981
the fructose is a five membered ring.

00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:41.413
They are not the same.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.567
Believe me, they're not the same.

00:18:43.567 --> 00:18:45.355
That's what this whole talk is about

00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:47.803
is how their not the same.

00:18:47.803 --> 00:18:49.246
And here's sucrose, and they're just

00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:51.128
bound together by this ether linkage.

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:53.940
We have this enzyme in
our gut called sucrose,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.886
it kills that bond in two seconds flat,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:00.117
and you absorb it and, basically,
high fructose corn syrup,

00:19:00.117 --> 00:19:03.400
sucrose, it's a non issue, it's a wash.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.226
They're the same.

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:08.226
And they know that they're the same,

00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:11.907
the soft drink companies
and the corn refiners.

00:19:11.907 --> 00:19:14.354
Because here are their missives.

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:16.278
This comes from the Corn
Refiners Association.

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:18.826
Obesity research shows
high fructose corn syrup

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:22.649
metabolizes and impacts
satiety similar to sugar.

00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:24.649
Indeed it does, I agree.

00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:31.498
Decent meetings, academic
meetings around the country.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.900
Hunger and satiety profiles energy intakes

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.120
following ingestion of soft drinks,

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.774
bottom line, research supported by

00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:39.106
the American Beverage Institute

00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:41.594
and the Corn Refiner's Association.

00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:43.685
They are correct, there is absolutely

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:47.648
no difference between high
fructose corn syrup and sucrose.

00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:49.609
So much so that the Corn
Refiner's Association,

00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:51.966
in attempt to capture market share,

00:19:51.966 --> 00:19:55.775
came out with this entire ad campaign.

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:57.238
You probably saw it on the back page

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:00.479
of the New York Times, it
was on TV, it's everywhere.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.705
"My hairdresser says
that sugar's healthier

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:03.933
"than high fructose corn syrup.

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:06.139
"Wow, you get your hair done by a doctor?"

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:08.531
I didn't know I could cut hair.

00:20:08.531 --> 00:20:10.050
If you all wanna see all of them,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.038
there are a whole bunch of them.

00:20:11.038 --> 00:20:14.318
You can go to www.sweetsurprise.com

00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:16.666
and see how you're being hoodwinked.

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.924
But indeed, this is true.

00:20:18.924 --> 00:20:22.782
High fructose corn syrup and
sucrose are exactly the same.

00:20:22.782 --> 00:20:24.865
They're both equally bad.

00:20:26.317 --> 00:20:30.811
They're both dangerous,
they're both poison.

00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:33.271
Okay, I said it, poison.

00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:35.751
My charge before the end of tonight

00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:39.001
is to demonstrate fructose is a poison,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.685
and I will do it, and you will tell me

00:20:41.685 --> 00:20:44.002
if I was successful.

00:20:44.002 --> 00:20:46.684
None the less, here's
Center for the Science

00:20:46.684 --> 00:20:49.650
and Public Interest and the
Corn Refiners Association.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.978
Everybody remember last
year, when Gavin Newsom

00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:55.745
floated his soda tax, last February?

00:20:55.745 --> 00:20:58.407
Governor Patterson of New
York has since floated one.

00:20:58.407 --> 00:21:00.439
And other people are
starting to talk about it.

00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:01.719
So, why are they saying this?

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:03.660
Well, they're saying obesity's a problem,

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.715
kids are drinking soda, let's tax it.

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:10.323
So they're talking about soda
like it's empty calories.

00:21:10.323 --> 00:21:14.591
I'm here to tell you that it
goes way beyond empty calories.

00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:17.375
The reason why this is
a problem is because

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:21.542
fructose is a poison, it's
not about the calories.

00:21:22.584 --> 00:21:25.287
It has nothing to do with the calories.

00:21:25.287 --> 00:21:28.761
It's a poison by itself,
and I'm gonna show you that.

00:21:28.761 --> 00:21:30.689
Nonetheless, I just wanna read you

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:33.292
this paragraph here in yellow.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.978
"We respectfully urge that the proposal

00:21:34.978 --> 00:21:37.010
"be revised as soon as possible to reflect

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.728
"the scientific evidence that demonstrates

00:21:38.728 --> 00:21:40.909
"no material differences
in the health effects

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:43.448
"of high fructose corn syrup and sugar."

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:44.844
I agree.

00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:46.519
Here's the important sentence.

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:48.582
"The real issue is that
excessive consumption

00:21:48.582 --> 00:21:51.923
"of any sugars may lead
to health problems."

00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:54.197
I agree, that's exactly right.

00:21:54.197 --> 00:21:55.864
Not may, does, does.

00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:00.355
So, here's the secular trend in

00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:03.524
fructose consumption
over the past 100 years.

00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:06.288
Before we had food processing, we used to

00:22:06.288 --> 00:22:08.917
get our fructose from
fruits and vegetables,

00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:11.619
and if we did that today, we would consume

00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:15.065
about 15 grams per day of fructose.

00:22:15.065 --> 00:22:16.739
Not sugar, fructose.

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:19.433
So sugar would be 30
grams, it'd be double.

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:22.184
We're just talking about fructose, today.

00:22:22.184 --> 00:22:26.881
Prior to World War II,
before it got rationed again,

00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:29.749
we were up to about 16
to 24, about 20 grams.

00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:32.678
So, a small increase from the beginning

00:22:32.678 --> 00:22:35.097
of the century to World War II.

00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:38.908
Then, in 1977, just as
high fructose corn syrup

00:22:38.908 --> 00:22:41.088
was hitting the market,
we had increased that,

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:44.933
we had, basically, doubled
up to 37 grams per day,

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:47.209
or 8% of total caloric intake.

00:22:47.209 --> 00:22:51.372
By 1994 we were up to 55
grams of the stuff per day.

00:22:51.372 --> 00:22:54.907
Remember, if you wanna do
sugar, then double the number.

00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:58.140
So, that's 10.2, so you
can see that more and more

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.526
of our caloric intake, a higher percentage

00:23:00.526 --> 00:23:04.174
is being accounted for by
sugar every single year.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:07.030
So, it's not just that we're eating more.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.030
We're eating more sugar.

00:23:10.444 --> 00:23:14.109
And for adolescents today,
up to almost 75 grams,

00:23:14.109 --> 00:23:16.852
12% of total caloric intake.

00:23:16.852 --> 00:23:20.269
25% of the adolescents today consume

00:23:21.342 --> 00:23:25.384
at least 15% of their
calories from fructose alone.

00:23:25.384 --> 00:23:29.937
This is a disaster, an
absolute unmitigated disaster.

00:23:29.937 --> 00:23:33.118
The fat's going down,
the sugar's going up,

00:23:33.118 --> 00:23:35.319
and we're all getting sick.

00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:37.319
Now let me show you why.

00:23:39.872 --> 00:23:41.295
How'd this happen?

00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.771
Why'd it happen?

00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:45.188
So, this is where the politics comes in.

00:23:45.188 --> 00:23:47.026
This is the perfect storm,

00:23:47.026 --> 00:23:49.182
and it was created from
three political winds

00:23:49.182 --> 00:23:51.862
that swirled around all at the same time

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:54.302
to create this perfect storm.

00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:57.207
So, the first political wind,

00:23:57.207 --> 00:23:59.128
everything bad that ever happened

00:23:59.128 --> 00:24:01.239
in this country started with one man.

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:04.072
(audience laughs)

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:08.377
And it's still being felt today.

00:24:08.377 --> 00:24:12.377
So, Richard Nixon, in his
paranoia back in 1972,

00:24:13.648 --> 00:24:16.009
food prices were going up
and down, and up and down.

00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:17.910
I'm gonna show you that on the next slide.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.260
And he was worried that this was

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.978
actually gonna cost him the election.

00:24:20.978 --> 00:24:24.827
So, he admonished his
Secretary of Agriculture,

00:24:24.827 --> 00:24:27.660
Earl Rusty Butz, I love that name,

00:24:28.543 --> 00:24:32.460
to basically take food
off the political table,

00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:37.293
to make food a non-issue
in presidential elections.

00:24:37.293 --> 00:24:41.194
Well, the only way to do
that was to make food cheap.

00:24:41.194 --> 00:24:44.344
So, he was out to find all methods

00:24:44.344 --> 00:24:46.517
to be able to decrease the price of food.

00:24:46.517 --> 00:24:49.545
Remember Nixon's war on poverty?

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:51.862
We're suffering from it today.

00:24:51.862 --> 00:24:53.529
That's what this is.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:56.068
Second political wind, the advent

00:24:56.068 --> 00:24:57.828
of high fructose corn syrup.

00:24:57.828 --> 00:25:01.740
So, this was invented in
1966 at Saga Medical School

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.445
in Japan, by a guy named
Takasaki, who's still alive.

00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:06.109
As far as I'm concerned, this stuff

00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:09.195
is Japan's revenge for World War II,

00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:10.833
except, of course, that they're suffering

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.038
from it now, themselves.

00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:16.014
Like everything, it always
comes back to haunt you.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:19.489
And it was introduced to
the American Market in 1975.

00:25:19.489 --> 00:25:20.638
So, what do you think happened

00:25:20.638 --> 00:25:24.954
to the price of sugar when
this thing hit the market?

00:25:24.954 --> 00:25:26.173
Here's what happened.

00:25:26.173 --> 00:25:29.027
So, here's the US producer
price index of sugar

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.587
going up and down, and up and down.

00:25:31.587 --> 00:25:33.004
This is not good.

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:37.583
Stability is at 100%, if
it stays nice and stable

00:25:37.583 --> 00:25:41.890
at 100%, that's what you
want if you're a politician.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.166
Up and down, here's where corn sweeteners

00:25:44.166 --> 00:25:47.286
entered the market, 1975, 1980.

00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:48.859
And you can see that since then the price

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:51.906
of sugar has remained remarkably constant.

00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:53.746
And it did so, not just in the US,

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:55.889
but also on the international stage.

00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.919
Here's the London price
doing the same thing.

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:59.973
And when you look at
the difference in price

00:25:59.973 --> 00:26:03.336
between sugar and high
fructose corn syrup,

00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:05.247
you can see that high
fructose corn syrup's

00:26:05.247 --> 00:26:07.366
about half the price.

00:26:07.366 --> 00:26:09.352
So, in other words, it's cheap.

00:26:09.352 --> 00:26:11.332
So, high fructose corn syrup is evil.

00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:14.200
But it's not evil because
it's metabolically evil.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.509
It's evil because it's economically evil.

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:19.530
Because it's so cheap that it's

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.221
found it's way into everything.

00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:25.280
It's found it's way into hamburger buns,

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.447
pretzels, barbecue sauce, and
ketchup, almost everything.

00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.839
Somebody emailed me the other day

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:34.982
and told me they went into
their local grocery store

00:26:34.982 --> 00:26:37.899
and went through every
single loaf of bread

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:42.205
on the shelf, and out of 32 types of bread

00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:44.226
on the shelf, only one of them did not

00:26:44.226 --> 00:26:47.843
have high fructose corn syrup in it.

00:26:47.843 --> 00:26:50.342
So, we are being poisoned by this stuff,

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.526
and it's been added surreptitiously

00:26:52.526 --> 00:26:55.865
to all of our food, every processed food.

00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:57.972
The question is why?

00:26:57.972 --> 00:27:00.746
Well, you'll see why in a minute.

00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:02.973
So, the corn refiners like to point out,

00:27:02.973 --> 00:27:06.524
"Well, you know, it's
just been a substitution.

00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:07.983
"As the high fructose
corn syrup's gone up,

00:27:07.983 --> 00:27:09.346
:the sugar's gone down.

00:27:09.346 --> 00:27:13.288
"You know, we're just
replacing, like gram for gram."

00:27:13.288 --> 00:27:15.625
Well, not exactly, because here's

00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:18.115
73 pounds of sugar per year.

00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:20.083
This is from the Economic Research Service

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.496
of the US Department of Agriculture.

00:27:22.496 --> 00:27:23.886
So disappearance data.

00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:26.803
73 pounds, up to 95 pounds by 2000.

00:27:29.283 --> 00:27:32.026
And there's something
missing from this slide.

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:33.762
Anybody wanna tell me what it is?

00:27:33.762 --> 00:27:35.012
What's missing?

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.069
Juice, juice is missing.

00:27:38.069 --> 00:27:41.098
'Cause juice is sucrose, right, sugar.

00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:43.181
And juice causes obesity.

00:27:44.113 --> 00:27:46.014
So this is a study done by Myles Faith,

00:27:46.014 --> 00:27:49.832
a prospective study in
inner city Harlem toddlers.

00:27:49.832 --> 00:27:53.085
And the number of juice servings per day

00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:56.434
predicts the change in BMI score per month

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:58.356
in these inner city Harlem toddlers.

00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:00.492
Now, where do these inner city

00:28:00.492 --> 00:28:03.812
Harlem toddlers get their juice?

00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:06.562
From what, from where, from whom?

00:28:08.809 --> 00:28:09.642
From WIC.

00:28:11.158 --> 00:28:12.539
Anybody heard of WIC?

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:13.588
You know what WIC is?

00:28:13.588 --> 00:28:15.628
Women Infants Children, right?

00:28:15.628 --> 00:28:20.179
A government entitlement
program set up under who?

00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:23.886
Nixon, to prevent failure to thrive.

00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:24.719
They did.

00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:31.171
This is the equal and opposite reaction.

00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:33.580
So, let's add juice in, here it is.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.458
So, most fructose items
when you put it together,

00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:38.314
now we're up to 113 pounds on this graph,

00:28:38.314 --> 00:28:39.980
and I just heard from Brian Williams,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.063
of NBC News, after the
most recent study came out,

00:28:44.063 --> 00:28:46.188
that was in the Journal
of Clinical Investigation,

00:28:46.188 --> 00:28:50.098
that we are actually up to
141 pounds of sugar per year.

00:28:50.098 --> 00:28:51.133
Each of us.

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:51.966
That's what we're up to.

00:28:51.966 --> 00:28:54.808
141 pounds of sugar per year.

00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:58.070
Now, do you think that this might

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.153
have some detrimental effects on you?

00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:06.647
Hasn't stopped you, has it?

00:29:06.647 --> 00:29:08.739
That's the point, it hasn't stopped you.

00:29:08.739 --> 00:29:11.778
That's why we need to talk about this.

00:29:11.778 --> 00:29:13.647
So, juice consumption increases

00:29:13.647 --> 00:29:15.555
the risk for Type 2 diabetes.

00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:17.366
So this is the relative risk ratio

00:29:17.366 --> 00:29:20.530
as juice intake goes up, and
this is in the Nurse's Study.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.470
Showing again, juice consumption,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.204
sucrose, obesity, diabetes.

00:29:26.204 --> 00:29:30.499
Okay, the third political
storm, that's swirling around

00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:34.082
to create this disaster,
this mega-typhoon,

00:29:35.061 --> 00:29:38.431
that thing that happened in 1982,

00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:40.464
the USDA, the American Hearth Association,

00:29:40.464 --> 00:29:41.816
the American Medical Association,

00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:46.152
all telling us we had to
reduce our consumption of fat.

00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:48.735
Now, why did they tell us that?

00:29:49.882 --> 00:29:50.965
To stop what?

00:29:51.882 --> 00:29:52.918
To stop hear disease.

00:29:52.918 --> 00:29:53.751
Did we?

00:29:54.808 --> 00:29:56.831
No, we didn't, did we?

00:29:56.831 --> 00:29:58.802
In fact, it's worked the exact opposite.

00:29:58.802 --> 00:30:01.232
We've only created more.

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:03.393
So, now how did this come to be?

00:30:03.393 --> 00:30:06.868
Why did they tell us to stop eating fat?

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:09.103
Well, in the early 1970s we discovered

00:30:09.103 --> 00:30:12.008
something in our blood called LDL,

00:30:12.008 --> 00:30:13.966
low-density lipoproteins.

00:30:13.966 --> 00:30:15.592
You've heard of that, right?

00:30:15.592 --> 00:30:16.670
Is it good or bad?

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.535
- [Audience Member] Bad.

00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:19.498
- Not so bad, we'll talk about it.

00:30:19.498 --> 00:30:21.834
In the mid 1970s we learned that

00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:24.565
dietary fat raised your LDL.

00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:27.816
So, if dietary fat is A, and LDL is B,

00:30:27.816 --> 00:30:29.706
we learned that A lead to B.

00:30:29.706 --> 00:30:32.338
Dietary fat definitely increases your LDL,

00:30:32.338 --> 00:30:34.724
no argument, it's true.

00:30:34.724 --> 00:30:37.203
And then, finally, in
the late 1970s we learned

00:30:37.203 --> 00:30:41.551
that LDL correlated with
cardiovascular disease.

00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:44.761
So let's call cardiovascular disease C.

00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:47.666
So we learned that B lead to C.

00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:50.703
So, the thought process by some

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:53.750
very smart nutritionists, et cetera,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.205
the USDA et cetera, said,

00:30:55.205 --> 00:30:57.178
"Well if A leads to B, and B leads to C

00:30:57.178 --> 00:31:01.311
"then A must lead to C,
therefore, no A, no C."

00:31:01.311 --> 00:31:02.419
This was the logic.

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:05.760
Now, any logicians in the room?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.177
Anybody see any problems with that logic?

00:31:10.968 --> 00:31:11.801
Go ahead.

00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:13.774
(speaking away from microphone)

00:31:13.774 --> 00:31:15.369
- That's right, the premise is incorrect.

00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:17.237
And I'll tell you why
the premise is incorrect.

00:31:17.237 --> 00:31:21.943
Because this suggests that
this is all transitive.

00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:24.380
But, in fact, only the
contrapositive is transitive.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.797
So, it's not no A, no C, it's no C, no A.

00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:30.053
So, the logic isn't even right.

00:31:30.053 --> 00:31:32.053
There's faulty logic here.

00:31:32.053 --> 00:31:35.112
So, this doesn't work on any level.

00:31:35.112 --> 00:31:39.120
So, I'm gonna show you
why this doesn't work.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.609
But, before I how you why it doesn't work,

00:31:40.609 --> 00:31:42.397
I'm gonna show you that this was

00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:45.839
a battle royal back in the 1970s.

00:31:45.839 --> 00:31:47.680
This was not a simple thing.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.540
There were people lined up
on both sides of this story.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.405
So, this, over here, is
a book, 1972 it came out,

00:31:56.405 --> 00:31:59.260
and it was called Pure White and Deadly.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.906
It's all about sugar.

00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:02.613
Written by a British physiologist,

00:32:02.613 --> 00:32:03.940
nutritionist, endocrinologist,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.841
by the name of John Yudkin.

00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:08.993
Now, I never knew John
Yudkin he's passed away.

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:12.081
But, I read this book about a year ago.

00:32:12.081 --> 00:32:16.072
And without even knowing
it, I was a Yudkin acolyte.

00:32:16.072 --> 00:32:17.780
I was a Yudkin disciple.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.637
Every single thing that this man said

00:32:20.637 --> 00:32:23.470
in 1972 is the God's honest truth.

00:32:25.072 --> 00:32:29.667
And if you wanna read a true
prophecy, you find this book.

00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:31.963
It's not easy to find,
but you go find this book.

00:32:31.963 --> 00:32:34.027
And I'm telling you, every single thing

00:32:34.027 --> 00:32:36.920
this guy said has come to pass.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.975
It's astounding, I am in awe of this guy.

00:32:40.975 --> 00:32:43.657
But on the other side we
had this guy over here.

00:32:43.657 --> 00:32:45.686
His name was Ancel Keys.

00:32:45.686 --> 00:32:47.393
Anybody heard of him?

00:32:47.393 --> 00:32:51.131
So, Ancel Keys was a
Minnesota epidemiologist,

00:32:51.131 --> 00:32:53.801
very interested in the cause
of cardiovascular disease.

00:32:53.801 --> 00:32:57.186
And he performed the first multivariate

00:32:57.186 --> 00:33:00.782
regression analysis without computers.

00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:02.639
Now, anybody know what that means?

00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:04.538
Multivariate regression analysis?

00:33:04.538 --> 00:33:06.918
So, this is where you
take a whole lot of data,

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:09.744
and normally you would just
run a few computer programs,

00:33:09.744 --> 00:33:11.275
but basically, the object is to try

00:33:11.275 --> 00:33:13.350
to figure out what causes what,

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.220
and to try to factor out other things

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.077
and determine what the contribution

00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:19.362
of various things all at once are

00:33:19.362 --> 00:33:21.659
to an outcome that you're looking for.

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:24.331
So, he was interested in
cardiovascular disease.

00:33:24.331 --> 00:33:27.297
So, what he did was he did this study,

00:33:27.297 --> 00:33:28.975
along with other people around the world,

00:33:28.975 --> 00:33:31.320
called the Seven Countries Study.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:36.211
Very famous, front page
of Time Magazine in 1980.

00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:39.844
So, here's the data on
the Seven Country Study.

00:33:39.844 --> 00:33:42.262
So, we have the US, Canada, Australia,

00:33:42.262 --> 00:33:44.811
England and Wales, Italy, Japan.

00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:48.163
And here's percent calories
from fat on the x axis,

00:33:48.163 --> 00:33:51.768
and here we have coronary
disease death rate on the y axis.

00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.141
And so you'd say, "Oh, look at that."

00:33:53.141 --> 00:33:55.507
I mean, it's very obvious, isn't it.

00:33:55.507 --> 00:33:57.252
Sure, percent calories from fat

00:33:57.252 --> 00:34:00.923
correlates very nicely with
coronary disease, right?

00:34:00.923 --> 00:34:02.760
Except for one little problem.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.010
Anybody see it?

00:34:06.754 --> 00:34:08.489
Japan and Italy?

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.806
So, how much sugar do they eat?

00:34:10.806 --> 00:34:13.488
Didn't I tell you the Japanese
diet eliminates fructose?

00:34:13.488 --> 00:34:14.718
They never even had it 'til

00:34:14.718 --> 00:34:17.766
we brought it to them after World War II.

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:21.933
Italy, aside from gelato,
I mean what else they got?

00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:24.247
They got a lot of pasta,

00:34:24.247 --> 00:34:26.819
there's a lot of glucose, but no fructose.

00:34:26.819 --> 00:34:29.359
There's no sugar in the Italian diet

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:32.841
other than the occasional
sweet, which they moderate.

00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:35.655
They're very careful about
moderating, and they cost a lot.

00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:38.237
But, here we got England,
Wales, Canada, Australia, US,

00:34:38.237 --> 00:34:40.603
you know, we are sugarholics, aren't we?

00:34:40.603 --> 00:34:42.077
We're also fataholics.

00:34:42.077 --> 00:34:44.759
So, in fact, the fat
migrated with the sugar.

00:34:44.759 --> 00:34:48.628
So, here's, this is from Keys's own work.

00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:52.297
Page 262, if you wanna pick
up the 500 page volume.

00:34:52.297 --> 00:34:53.342
And I'm just gonna read you the

00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:56.694
one paragraph that talks about this.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.270
The fact that the incidence rate

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.392
of coronary heart disease
was significantly correlated

00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:02.301
with the average percentage of calories

00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:04.862
from sucrose in the diet, is explained by

00:35:04.862 --> 00:35:09.492
the intercorrelation of
sucrose with saturated fat.

00:35:09.492 --> 00:35:11.409
In other words, donuts.

00:35:13.822 --> 00:35:16.709
Where ever there was the
fat, there was sucrose too.

00:35:16.709 --> 00:35:19.626
Because these guys here eat donuts.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:22.729
(audience laughs)

00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:24.226
Partial correlation analysis show

00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:25.546
that with saturated fat constant,

00:35:25.546 --> 00:35:27.121
there was no significant correlation

00:35:27.121 --> 00:35:28.827
between dietary sucrose and the incidence

00:35:28.827 --> 00:35:31.062
of coronary heart disease.

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:34.919
Okay, when you do a multivariate
linear regression analysis,

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:37.102
you have to do it both ways.

00:35:37.102 --> 00:35:40.019
You have to do holding fat constant

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.443
showing the sucrose doesn't work,

00:35:42.443 --> 00:35:44.732
and then you have to hold sucrose constant

00:35:44.732 --> 00:35:46.925
and who that fat still works.

00:35:46.925 --> 00:35:48.668
You see that anywhere?

00:35:48.668 --> 00:35:51.418
He didn't do it, he didn't do it.

00:35:52.337 --> 00:35:55.087
He didn't do the thing that you need to do

00:35:55.087 --> 00:35:57.994
to do a multivariate
linear regression analysis.

00:35:57.994 --> 00:36:00.412
Now, this was done before computers.

00:36:00.412 --> 00:36:02.638
We can't check the work.

00:36:02.638 --> 00:36:04.888
He's dead, he died in 2004.

00:36:05.918 --> 00:36:08.713
So, we're left with a conundrum.

00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:10.164
Do we believe this?

00:36:10.164 --> 00:36:13.508
Do we believe this study, because we based

00:36:13.508 --> 00:36:17.696
30 years of nutrition
education, and information,

00:36:17.696 --> 00:36:21.113
and policy in this country on this study.

00:36:22.137 --> 00:36:24.992
And, as far as I'm
concerned, it has a hole

00:36:24.992 --> 00:36:27.825
as big as the one in the USS Cole,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.019
all right, you got it?

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:33.936
Everybody, am I debunking, yes, no?

00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:37.387
Let's keep going.

00:36:37.387 --> 00:36:40.304
Remember, I told you
LDL may be not so bad?

00:36:40.304 --> 00:36:41.987
Well, here's why.

00:36:41.987 --> 00:36:46.125
Because there really isn't
one LDL, there are two.

00:36:46.125 --> 00:36:47.616
There are two LDLs.

00:36:47.616 --> 00:36:49.619
Here's one over here, it's called

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:52.202
pattern A or large buoyant LDL.

00:36:53.215 --> 00:36:55.134
So, everybody knows that LDL correlates

00:36:55.134 --> 00:36:57.624
with cardiovascular
disease, and that's true.

00:36:57.624 --> 00:36:59.470
I'm not gonna argue that, that is true.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.191
But, it's not this one, pattern A LDL.

00:37:03.191 --> 00:37:08.096
These guys are so light,
they are buoyant, they float.

00:37:08.096 --> 00:37:09.984
So, they get carried
through the bloodstream,

00:37:09.984 --> 00:37:11.379
and they don't even have a chance,

00:37:11.379 --> 00:37:13.025
because they're so big
and they're so buoyant,

00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:15.430
they don't even get underneath the edge

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.175
of the endothelial
cells in the vasculature

00:37:18.175 --> 00:37:21.206
to start the plaque formation process.

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:22.791
But, over here we have
this other guy, over here,

00:37:22.791 --> 00:37:25.493
called pattern B or small dense LDL.

00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:26.712
You see the difference?

00:37:26.712 --> 00:37:28.751
These guys are dense.

00:37:28.751 --> 00:37:30.216
These guys don't float.

00:37:30.216 --> 00:37:32.950
These guys are small, they get underneath

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.067
the edge of the surface of the surface

00:37:34.067 --> 00:37:35.161
of the endothelial cells,

00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:36.981
and they start the plaque formation.

00:37:36.981 --> 00:37:39.366
And it's been shown by
numerous investigators now,

00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:42.577
the dense LDL is the bad guy.

00:37:42.577 --> 00:37:44.547
Okay, now, when we measure
LDL in the bloodstream,

00:37:44.547 --> 00:37:46.449
when you do a lipid profile,

00:37:46.449 --> 00:37:48.257
you measure both of them together,

00:37:48.257 --> 00:37:51.081
because it's too hard
to distinguish the two.

00:37:51.081 --> 00:37:55.070
So, when you get an LDL,
you're getting both LDLs.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.273
The neutral one and the bad one.

00:37:58.273 --> 00:38:01.423
Now, how can you tell whether your LDL

00:38:01.423 --> 00:38:04.906
is the neutral one or the bad one.

00:38:04.906 --> 00:38:07.031
What you do is you look at
your triglycerides level

00:38:07.031 --> 00:38:09.671
in association with it,
'cause your triglycerides

00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:11.134
tell you which one it is.

00:38:11.134 --> 00:38:13.186
So here, here's pattern A over here,

00:38:13.186 --> 00:38:16.603
big large buoyant LDLs, and you'll notice

00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:22.227
that the triglycerides are
low, and your HDL is high.

00:38:22.227 --> 00:38:23.859
That's what you want, you
want a low triglyceride,

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:26.137
high HDL, 'cause that's
the good cholesterol.

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.038
You want high good cholesterol.

00:38:28.038 --> 00:38:29.632
Over here, you have pattern B.

00:38:29.632 --> 00:38:32.670
And here you have high
triglyceride, low HDL.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.926
That's the bad guy, that's
the guy you don't wanna be.

00:38:34.926 --> 00:38:37.100
'Cause you're gonna die of a heart attack.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.307
No question about it.

00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:40.838
Triglyceride to HDL
ratio actually predicts

00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:45.642
cardiovascular disease way
better than LDL ever did.

00:38:45.642 --> 00:38:49.961
Point is, when you measure
LDL, you measure both.

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:53.461
So, dietary fat raises your large buoyant.

00:38:54.449 --> 00:38:57.949
What do you think raises your small dense?

00:38:59.095 --> 00:39:00.465
Carbohydrate.

00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:02.163
Okay, so here's percent carbohydrate,

00:39:02.163 --> 00:39:04.569
and here's your pattern B going up.

00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:05.800
Everybody got it?

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.860
So what did we do?

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.831
What did we do in 1982?

00:39:09.831 --> 00:39:12.341
(speaking away from microphone)

00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:13.909
What did we do?

00:39:13.909 --> 00:39:16.069
We went on a high carb diet, which was

00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:19.514
supposed to be a low fat diet, right?

00:39:19.514 --> 00:39:22.622
So, here's the low fat craze.

00:39:22.622 --> 00:39:25.222
Took America and the world by storm.

00:39:25.222 --> 00:39:27.248
Because the content of low fat

00:39:27.248 --> 00:39:29.645
home cooked food, that
you cook by yourself,

00:39:29.645 --> 00:39:33.932
in your house, you can
control the content of fat.

00:39:33.932 --> 00:39:38.382
But when you process it,
low fat processed food,

00:39:38.382 --> 00:39:40.451
it tastes like cardboard.

00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:44.005
It tastes like (bleep).

00:39:44.005 --> 00:39:47.432
So the food companies knew
that, so what'd they do?

00:39:47.432 --> 00:39:49.022
They had to make it palatable?

00:39:49.022 --> 00:39:49.929
So, how do you make something

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.392
palatable that has no fat in it?

00:39:51.392 --> 00:39:52.975
You add the, sugar.

00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:57.330
So, everybody remember Snackwells?

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.636
Two grams of fat down, 13
grams of carbohydrate up,

00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:05.234
four of them being sugar,
so that it was palatable.

00:40:05.234 --> 00:40:06.575
Well, we've just shown you that

00:40:06.575 --> 00:40:09.875
that's the worst thing you could do.

00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:10.972
And that's what we've done.

00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:12.699
And we're still doing it, today.

00:40:12.699 --> 00:40:16.282
So when you find a
mistake, what do you do?

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.374
You admit the mistake
and you right the ship.

00:40:21.374 --> 00:40:23.052
We haven't admitted the mistake,

00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:26.425
and we haven't righted the ship.

00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:29.115
So, we've our food supply adulterated,

00:40:29.115 --> 00:40:31.782
contaminated, poisoned, tainted.

00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:37.098
On purpose, and we've
allowed it, and we've let it,

00:40:37.098 --> 00:40:38.441
thought the addition of fructose

00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:40.932
for palatability, especially
because of the decreased fat,

00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:44.638
and also as a ostensibly browning agent,

00:40:44.638 --> 00:40:46.446
which actually has it's own issues.

00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:48.243
Because why it browns so well

00:40:48.243 --> 00:40:49.973
with the sugar in it, actually is

00:40:49.973 --> 00:40:51.627
what's going on in your arteries.

00:40:51.627 --> 00:40:53.556
Because that's causing what we call

00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:55.041
protein glycation and cross linking,

00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:57.815
which is actually contribution
to atherosclerosis.

00:40:57.815 --> 00:41:01.267
So it works on your steak on the grill,

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:04.569
it works in your arteries the same way.

00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:06.918
And removal of fiber also.

00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:09.640
Now, why did we remove
fiber from our diet?

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.276
We, as human beings walking
the earth 50,000 years ago,

00:41:14.276 --> 00:41:18.406
used to consume 100 to 300
grams of fiber per day.

00:41:18.406 --> 00:41:19.906
We now consume 12.

00:41:21.848 --> 00:41:23.515
Why? What did we do?

00:41:24.935 --> 00:41:26.602
We took the fiber out.

00:41:26.602 --> 00:41:29.417
So, why'd we take the fiber out?

00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:30.555
It takes too long to cook,

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:33.593
takes too long to eat, and shelf life.

00:41:33.593 --> 00:41:36.784
So, people ask me, "What's
the definition of fast food."

00:41:36.784 --> 00:41:38.276
Fiberless food.

00:41:38.276 --> 00:41:40.584
I dare you, other than a salad, I dare you

00:41:40.584 --> 00:41:42.473
to go to any fast food restaurant

00:41:42.473 --> 00:41:43.812
and find anything on their menu

00:41:43.812 --> 00:41:44.899
that they actually have to cook,

00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.337
that has more than one
gram of fiber in it.

00:41:47.337 --> 00:41:49.684
'Cause there isn't any,
and that's on purpose.

00:41:49.684 --> 00:41:50.982
Because they take the fiber out,

00:41:50.982 --> 00:41:52.525
'cause that way they can freeze it,

00:41:52.525 --> 00:41:55.432
ship it around the world,
and cook it up fast,

00:41:55.432 --> 00:41:56.773
and not only is is fast cooking,

00:41:56.773 --> 00:41:58.378
but it's fast eating, which also

00:41:58.378 --> 00:41:59.986
causes it's own satiety issues.

00:41:59.986 --> 00:42:03.763
Bottom line, we have a
typhoon on our hands.

00:42:03.763 --> 00:42:05.138
And then, finally, the last issue

00:42:05.138 --> 00:42:07.109
was the substitution of transfats,

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:08.693
which are clearly a disaster,

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:10.124
but those have been going down,

00:42:10.124 --> 00:42:11.883
because we know that those are a problem.

00:42:11.883 --> 00:42:14.440
So we've actually gotten
rid of most transfats,

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.992
not completely, but most.

00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:18.405
So this is it, this is what we've done

00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:20.322
over the last 30 years.

00:42:21.689 --> 00:42:23.780
Now, to the biochemistry.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.947
Now, how many of you here
have taken biochemistry?

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.370
About 25%.

00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:35.792
I am going to show you a lot of reactions

00:42:36.795 --> 00:42:39.396
in excruciating detail.

00:42:39.396 --> 00:42:41.355
(audience laughs)

00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:43.053
If you've studied biochemistry,

00:42:43.053 --> 00:42:45.845
you will have an anaphylactic reaction.

00:42:45.845 --> 00:42:46.760
(audience laughs)

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.609
If you haven't studied biochemistry,

00:42:48.609 --> 00:42:50.782
you will fall asleep.

00:42:50.782 --> 00:42:53.267
So, what I'm gonna suggest that you all do

00:42:53.267 --> 00:42:55.583
is just let me do my
thing, to show you that,

00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:59.097
at least it works, and
just count the arrows.

00:42:59.097 --> 00:42:59.930
Okay?

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.835
You can do that, right?

00:43:00.835 --> 00:43:03.345
Can you count the arrows,
it's not like counting sheep.

00:43:03.345 --> 00:43:05.695
Okay, you can count the
arrows, and just stick with me.

00:43:05.695 --> 00:43:07.358
Just let me do my thing,

00:43:07.358 --> 00:43:11.186
and let me show you why
fructose is not glucose.

00:43:11.186 --> 00:43:12.792
'Cause what the liver does to fructose

00:43:12.792 --> 00:43:14.906
is really unique, and you've gotta

00:43:14.906 --> 00:43:18.856
understand it to understand
everything I've just told you.

00:43:18.856 --> 00:43:21.234
So, number one, fructose is seven times

00:43:21.234 --> 00:43:24.671
more likely than glucose to
do that browning reaction.

00:43:24.671 --> 00:43:26.566
The advanced glycation end-products.

00:43:26.566 --> 00:43:28.254
The thing that happens on your grill,

00:43:28.254 --> 00:43:30.429
happens in your arteries
for the same reason.

00:43:30.429 --> 00:43:32.034
You can actually see the color too,

00:43:32.034 --> 00:43:33.619
the color change too.

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:35.886
Fructose does not suppress
the hunger hormone.

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:37.561
There's a hormone that
comes form your stomach

00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:40.049
called ghrelin you've
heard about, already.

00:43:40.049 --> 00:43:43.716
So, if you preload a
kid with a can of soda,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.463
and then you let him loose
at the fast food restaurant,

00:43:47.463 --> 00:43:51.350
do they eat more, or do they eat less?

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.956
They eat more.

00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:56.696
They just took on 150
calories, yet they eat more.

00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:57.529
Reason?

00:43:57.529 --> 00:43:58.780
'Cause fructose doesn't suppress

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.066
the hunger hormone
ghrelin, so they eat more.

00:44:03.066 --> 00:44:06.824
Acute fructose ingestion
does not stimulate insulin,

00:44:06.824 --> 00:44:09.679
because there's no receptor for fructose,

00:44:09.679 --> 00:44:12.070
no transport for fructose on the beta cell

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.392
that makes insulin, so
the insulin doesn't go up.

00:44:14.392 --> 00:44:15.382
Well, if the insulin doesn't go up,

00:44:15.382 --> 00:44:17.196
then leptin doesn't go up, and if leptin

00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.734
doesn't go up, you're brain doesn't

00:44:18.734 --> 00:44:20.420
see that you ate something.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.044
Therefor, you eat more.

00:44:23.044 --> 00:44:24.414
And finally, I'm gonna show you

00:44:24.414 --> 00:44:26.498
liver hepatic fructose metabolism

00:44:26.498 --> 00:44:28.884
is completely different between

00:44:28.884 --> 00:44:32.033
fructose and glucose,
completely different.

00:44:32.033 --> 00:44:35.742
And I'm going to show you,
before the evening is out,

00:44:35.742 --> 00:44:38.323
that chronic fructose exposure alone,

00:44:38.323 --> 00:44:40.129
nothing else, causes this thing

00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:41.867
we call the metabolic syndrome.

00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:44.325
Everybody knows what the
metabolic syndrome is?

00:44:44.325 --> 00:44:46.093
So, this is the conglomerate

00:44:46.093 --> 00:44:49.770
of the following different phenomena,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.187
obesity, Type 2 diabetes, lipid problems,

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.978
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

00:44:57.978 --> 00:45:02.135
Those all cluster together,
called metabolic syndrome.

00:45:02.135 --> 00:45:06.286
I'm gonna show you how fructose
does every one of those.

00:45:06.286 --> 00:45:07.790
I wanna show you the difference between

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.108
glucose and fructose in a way that

00:45:10.108 --> 00:45:12.361
will be glaringly apparent.

00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:15.861
So, let's consume 120 calories in glucose.

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.736
Two slices of white bread.

00:45:19.736 --> 00:45:22.636
What happens to that 120 calories?

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:26.056
You eat the 120 calories, 96 or 80%

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:30.885
of the total will be used by
all the organs in the body.

00:45:30.885 --> 00:45:32.870
80% off the table.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:33.703
Why?

00:45:33.703 --> 00:45:37.219
Because every cell in
the body can use glucose.

00:45:37.219 --> 00:45:38.784
Every bacteria can use glucose,

00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:41.295
every living thing on
the face of the earth

00:45:41.295 --> 00:45:45.358
can use glucose, because
glucose is the energy of life.

00:45:45.358 --> 00:45:48.537
That's what we were supposed to eat.

00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:52.531
24 of those calories, or
20% will hit the liver.

00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:55.355
So let's watch what happens
to those 24 calories.

00:45:55.355 --> 00:45:56.438
Here they go.

00:45:56.438 --> 00:45:58.431
So, the glucose comes in
through this transporter

00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:00.524
called Glut2, out here, the glucose

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.636
is gonna stimulate the
pancreas to make insulin,

00:46:02.636 --> 00:46:04.984
the insulin's gonna bind to it's receptor,

00:46:04.984 --> 00:46:07.217
and it's gonna take
this substrate over here

00:46:07.217 --> 00:46:10.004
called IRS-1, insulin
receptor substrate 1.

00:46:10.004 --> 00:46:11.802
That's not important
right now, don't worry.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:14.532
And it's gonna tyrosine phosphorylate it.

00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:16.201
And it's going to be tyrosine IRS-1,

00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:18.081
which is now active, that's active.

00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:19.006
And it's gonna stimulate the second

00:46:19.006 --> 00:46:21.334
messenger here called AKT.

00:46:21.334 --> 00:46:24.808
Now what AKT does is, it
stimulates this guy down here.

00:46:24.808 --> 00:46:29.186
SRABP1, sterol receptor
binding protein number 1.

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:30.315
Don't worry about it.

00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:31.981
But this is the thing that, ultimately,

00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:34.064
gets fat mechanics going.

00:46:34.906 --> 00:46:36.459
So, you 'll see in a minute.

00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:38.523
So, one of the things that SRABP1 does,

00:46:38.523 --> 00:46:40.830
is it activates this enzyme
here called glucokinase,

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.369
which takes glucose to
glucose 6 phosphate.

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:46.060
Now, glucose 6-phosphate
can't get out of the liver.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.566
The only way to get glucose 6-phosphate

00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:49.566
out of the liver is with hormones.

00:46:49.566 --> 00:46:52.178
Glucagon or epinephrine, that's
the way it can get it out.

00:46:52.178 --> 00:46:54.157
So now, the glucose is fixed in the cell,

00:46:54.157 --> 00:46:55.986
but it's only 24 calories worth,

00:46:55.986 --> 00:46:58.486
so it's not a big bolus of it.

00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:01.056
Now, the glucose 6-phosphate

00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:02.479
almost all of it, is gonna end up

00:47:02.479 --> 00:47:05.884
going over here to
something called glycagen.

00:47:05.884 --> 00:47:10.109
Now, glycagen is the storage
form of glucose in the liver.

00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:12.588
Because glycagen's easy
to fish the glucose out

00:47:12.588 --> 00:47:14.885
with glucagon and epinephrine.

00:47:14.885 --> 00:47:16.835
So, my question to you, and granted,

00:47:16.835 --> 00:47:18.602
this is a physiology question,

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:20.989
is how much glycogen can your liver store

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:22.656
before it gets sick?

00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:26.962
The answer's any amount.

00:47:26.962 --> 00:47:28.283
It's unlimited.

00:47:28.283 --> 00:47:32.116
We have carb loaders who
run marathons, right?

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.486
Does it hurt them at all?

00:47:35.486 --> 00:47:37.709
We have kids with a
disease where they can't

00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:39.904
get the glucose out of the glycagen,

00:47:39.904 --> 00:47:41.959
called glycagen storage disease type 1A,

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.363
or von Gierke disease.

00:47:43.363 --> 00:47:45.831
They got livers down to
their knees their so big.

00:47:45.831 --> 00:47:47.354
They're hypoglycemic like all get out

00:47:47.354 --> 00:47:49.894
'cause they can't lift the
glucose out of their liver.

00:47:49.894 --> 00:47:52.773
But, they don't go into liver failure.

00:47:52.773 --> 00:47:55.130
Because glycagen is a non-toxic storage

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.242
form of glucose in the liver.

00:47:57.242 --> 00:47:59.527
So, the whole goal of glucose

00:47:59.527 --> 00:48:01.945
is to replete your glycagen.

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:04.666
So, this is good, this
is not bad, this is good.

00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:08.444
Now, a little of that glucose
is gonna fall down here,

00:48:08.444 --> 00:48:09.613
it's gonna get metabolized down

00:48:09.613 --> 00:48:11.372
to this stuff here, called pyruvate.

00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:12.205
And the pyruvate is gonna

00:48:12.205 --> 00:48:14.436
enter your mitochondria, over here.

00:48:14.436 --> 00:48:15.800
Remember, your mitochondria are

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.563
the parts of your cell that
actually burn the energy.

00:48:18.563 --> 00:48:19.761
They're your little factories.

00:48:19.761 --> 00:48:23.022
They make the stuff that lets you live.

00:48:23.022 --> 00:48:25.593
Called ATP, ATP, adenosine triphosphate,

00:48:25.593 --> 00:48:27.889
that's the energy of life, right there.

00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:29.494
So, the pyruvate comes in, gets converted

00:48:29.494 --> 00:48:31.080
to something called acetyl-CoA,

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.013
gets metabolized by this thing called

00:48:33.013 --> 00:48:35.623
the Krebs cycle, TCA
cycle, and you throw off

00:48:35.623 --> 00:48:37.907
ATP and carbon dioxide
which you breath off.

00:48:37.907 --> 00:48:39.339
So far, so good?

00:48:39.339 --> 00:48:41.889
Have I snowed anybody yet?

00:48:41.889 --> 00:48:43.048
You're with me?

00:48:43.048 --> 00:48:44.705
I snowed one guy back there.

00:48:44.705 --> 00:48:45.538
(audience laughs)

00:48:45.538 --> 00:48:46.664
I'm doin' my best, I swear to God,

00:48:46.664 --> 00:48:47.497
I'm doing my best.

00:48:47.497 --> 00:48:48.960
Anyway, so this stuff over here,

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.238
this acetyl-CoA, gets
burned off in the TCA cycle.

00:48:53.238 --> 00:48:55.252
Maybe you won't burn all of it off,

00:48:55.252 --> 00:48:58.328
and so, some of it may exit as citrate.

00:48:58.328 --> 00:49:00.361
And the citrate then
leaves the mitochondria

00:49:00.361 --> 00:49:02.869
through a process known
as the citrate shuttle.

00:49:02.869 --> 00:49:05.155
And then that citrate
can then be broken down

00:49:05.155 --> 00:49:06.711
by these three enzymes, which are all

00:49:06.711 --> 00:49:09.090
subservient into this SRABP1.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.294
This is ATP citrate lyase acetyl-CoA

00:49:11.294 --> 00:49:13.133
carboxylase fatty acid synthase.

00:49:13.133 --> 00:49:14.129
They're not important.

00:49:14.129 --> 00:49:15.613
The only thing to know is these three

00:49:15.613 --> 00:49:18.696
enzymes together turn sugar into fat.

00:49:19.554 --> 00:49:22.616
This is called denovo, meaning new,

00:49:22.616 --> 00:49:25.428
lipogenesis, fat making.

00:49:25.428 --> 00:49:27.532
This is denovo lipogenesis.

00:49:27.532 --> 00:49:30.002
So you take the citrate
which came form the glucose,

00:49:30.002 --> 00:49:32.735
and you end up with
something called acetyl-CoA,

00:49:32.735 --> 00:49:34.869
which then gets packaged
with this protein here,

00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:38.720
and you end up with something called VLDL,

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.449
very low density lipoprotein.

00:49:41.449 --> 00:49:44.273
Now, anybody heard of that before?

00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:46.244
Is it good or bad?

00:49:46.244 --> 00:49:47.994
It's bad, that's bad.

00:49:48.998 --> 00:49:50.694
VLDL is bad because that's one of

00:49:50.694 --> 00:49:52.428
the things that causes heart disease.

00:49:52.428 --> 00:49:54.746
It's also a substrate for obesity.

00:49:54.746 --> 00:49:58.157
So, you don't wanna make much of this.

00:49:58.157 --> 00:50:01.422
But the point is, you
started with 24 calories,

00:50:01.422 --> 00:50:05.730
maybe a half a calorie
will end up as VLDL.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.128
So, that little Japanese
guy with the little hat,

00:50:08.128 --> 00:50:09.864
you know, working out in the field,

00:50:09.864 --> 00:50:12.505
eating rice for the next 90 years,

00:50:12.505 --> 00:50:15.288
can he die of a heart attack at age 90?

00:50:15.288 --> 00:50:16.620
Sure.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.408
But that's not so bad.

00:50:18.408 --> 00:50:20.553
If you make it to 90,
you're doing alright.

00:50:20.553 --> 00:50:23.528
Because that VLDL coming from glucose.

00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:26.161
Glucose made a little bitty VLDL.

00:50:26.161 --> 00:50:29.119
And that serves as a substrate
for adipose deposition

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:31.603
into your fat cell, here triglyceride.

00:50:31.603 --> 00:50:33.370
In addition, because of the insulin

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:34.800
went up in response to the glucose,

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.133
your brain sees that signal.

00:50:38.093 --> 00:50:39.851
And it knows that that is supposed

00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:42.101
to shut off further eating.

00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:47.448
In other words, hey, I'm busy
metabolizing my breakfast.

00:50:47.448 --> 00:50:49.031
I don't need lunch.

00:50:50.397 --> 00:50:53.258
And so, you have a nice
negative feedback loop

00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.614
between glucose consumption, the liver,

00:50:55.614 --> 00:50:57.788
the pancreas, and the brain, to keep you

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:01.455
in normal negative, yin
yang energy balance.

00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:05.155
This is good, this is not dangerous.

00:51:05.155 --> 00:51:07.245
This is what's supposed to happen.

00:51:07.245 --> 00:51:11.027
So now, let's talk about
a different carbohydrate.

00:51:11.027 --> 00:51:15.194
Let's talk about my favorite
carbohydrate, maybe yours too.

00:51:16.966 --> 00:51:18.902
(crowd murmuring)

00:51:18.902 --> 00:51:19.735
Ethanol.

00:51:19.735 --> 00:51:21.890
Ethanol is a carbohydrate, isn't it?

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.753
Here's the structure,
carbon hydrogen oxygen,

00:51:24.753 --> 00:51:26.022
it' a carbohydrate.

00:51:26.022 --> 00:51:29.912
But, we all know that
ethanol is a toxin, right?

00:51:29.912 --> 00:51:31.904
A poison, right.

00:51:31.904 --> 00:51:34.696
You can wrap your
Lamborghini around a tree,

00:51:34.696 --> 00:51:37.879
or you can fry your liver, your choice.

00:51:37.879 --> 00:51:40.511
Depends on how much you
drink and how often.

00:51:40.511 --> 00:51:41.511
Right? Okay.

00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:45.895
So, we know that ethanol
is not good for you,

00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:48.299
except, of course, a
little bit is good for you.

00:51:48.299 --> 00:51:50.570
So, we can talk about that
too, later, if you want.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.452
But, let's talk about
how it's bad for you.

00:51:53.452 --> 00:51:56.285
So, here's acute ethanol exposure.

00:51:57.182 --> 00:51:59.622
CNS depression,
vasodilatation, hypothermia,

00:51:59.622 --> 00:52:01.782
tachycardia, myocardial depression,

00:52:01.782 --> 00:52:03.752
pupillary responses,
respiratory depression,

00:52:03.752 --> 00:52:06.285
diuresis, hypoglycemia,
loss of fine motor control,

00:52:06.285 --> 00:52:08.128
you all went to college.

00:52:08.128 --> 00:52:10.799
(audience laughs)

00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:13.106
Here's fructose, nothing.

00:52:13.106 --> 00:52:13.968
It doesn't do any of those.

00:52:13.968 --> 00:52:17.653
Because the brain doesn't
metabolize fructose.

00:52:17.653 --> 00:52:19.565
Alcohol gets metabolized in the brain,

00:52:19.565 --> 00:52:22.294
to cause all of those
things, but fructose doesn't.

00:52:22.294 --> 00:52:26.867
So, fructose is not an
acute toxin, ethanol is.

00:52:26.867 --> 00:52:29.275
We control ethanol, don't we?

00:52:29.275 --> 00:52:30.373
We have something called

00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:33.166
the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms.

00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:35.603
We have all sorts of
things, we tax ethanol.

00:52:35.603 --> 00:52:39.171
We do all sorts of things to
limit consumption of ethanol.

00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:43.791
The Nordic countries, all the
liquor stores are state run

00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:47.857
in attempt to try to set the
price of ethanol high enough

00:52:47.857 --> 00:52:51.117
so as to discourage consumption
for public health reasons.

00:52:51.117 --> 00:52:55.863
We have 1500 years of alcohol
control policy in this world

00:52:55.863 --> 00:53:00.443
to draw on, in terms of
how to limit consumption.

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:01.683
Got it?

00:53:01.683 --> 00:53:05.839
Because ethanol is a
toxin, and we know it.

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:09.339
So, let's consume 120 calories in ethanol.

00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:11.976
Shot of Makers Mark.

00:53:13.162 --> 00:53:14.625
Anybody taste it?

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:15.843
Yeah, good, okay.

00:53:15.843 --> 00:53:18.676
So, 24 calories right off the top.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.727
The stomach and the
intestine have something

00:53:21.727 --> 00:53:24.714
called the first pass
effect, so 10% off the top,

00:53:24.714 --> 00:53:28.098
and kidney, muscle, brain
will consume the other 10%.

00:53:28.098 --> 00:53:31.357
So there goes 20% or 24
calories right off the top.

00:53:31.357 --> 00:53:35.006
96 calories of the 120
are gonna hit the liver.

00:53:35.006 --> 00:53:37.952
Now, how many was it for glucose?

00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:39.252
It was 24.

00:53:39.252 --> 00:53:43.153
So, four times the substrate
is gonna hit the liver,

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:44.872
and there's the rub.

00:53:44.872 --> 00:53:46.862
This is a volume issue.

00:53:46.862 --> 00:53:48.579
We're gonna show you how.

00:53:48.579 --> 00:53:51.933
So, the ethanol comes
in, passive diffusion,

00:53:51.933 --> 00:53:54.351
there's not receptor
for it, not transporter.

00:53:54.351 --> 00:53:55.640
First thing that happens is ethanol

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.000
gets converted to this guy,
over here, called acetaldehyde.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.390
Anybody know anything about aldehydes?

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.473
Like formaldehyde? Right?

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.963
Are aldehydes good for you or bad for you?

00:54:07.963 --> 00:54:09.150
They're bad, right?

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.161
'Cause what do they do?

00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:13.062
They can cause cancer, they cross link

00:54:13.062 --> 00:54:14.762
proteins is what they do.

00:54:14.762 --> 00:54:17.607
So, if you cross link enough
proteins in your liver,

00:54:17.607 --> 00:54:19.556
what do you think happens to it?

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.425
You get something called...

00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:23.642
Cirrhosis, right exactly.

00:54:23.642 --> 00:54:25.599
So this guy, over here, is bad.

00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:28.810
And it generates something
called reactive oxygen species.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.500
Reactive oxygen species
damage proteins in the liver.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.809
And the more alcohol you drink,

00:54:33.809 --> 00:54:36.096
the more of this stuff you get.

00:54:36.096 --> 00:54:37.652
So far, so good?

00:54:37.652 --> 00:54:40.908
So, this is one of the
reasons why alcohol's bad.

00:54:40.908 --> 00:54:42.615
Now the acetaldehyde will come down here

00:54:42.615 --> 00:54:44.470
to something called acetate.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.251
The acetate will enter the mitochondria,

00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:48.353
just like the pyruvate did before.

00:54:48.353 --> 00:54:49.618
Will get converted to acetyl-CoA

00:54:49.618 --> 00:54:50.908
and participate in the TCA cycle,

00:54:50.908 --> 00:54:54.224
just like before, to generate energy.

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:58.063
So that alcoholics don't
die form lack of energy,

00:54:58.063 --> 00:55:00.525
they got energy, it's
everything else they don't have.

00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:03.779
They're gonna have a whole lot of citrate.

00:55:03.779 --> 00:55:06.087
Because they have 96 calories that

00:55:06.087 --> 00:55:07.885
have to get metabolized.

00:55:07.885 --> 00:55:12.052
How many calories made it to
the mitochondria with glucose?

00:55:13.402 --> 00:55:15.453
About half, right?

00:55:15.453 --> 00:55:17.698
Because most of it went to glycogen.

00:55:17.698 --> 00:55:20.332
So, we've got a big
citrate, so it's in big font

00:55:20.332 --> 00:55:23.145
to show you that we're
talking about big citrate now.

00:55:23.145 --> 00:55:25.411
And so, the big citrate
is gonna get metabolized

00:55:25.411 --> 00:55:28.049
all the way to VLDL by the CRABP1.

00:55:28.049 --> 00:55:29.835
And so you're gonna get a lot of the LDL.

00:55:29.835 --> 00:55:34.061
And this is the dyslipodemia
of alcoholism, right here.

00:55:34.061 --> 00:55:35.686
Everybody see that?

00:55:35.686 --> 00:55:37.394
So, the liver's gonna try to export

00:55:37.394 --> 00:55:40.454
this VLDL out so that it doesn't get sick,

00:55:40.454 --> 00:55:42.677
because when fat builds up in the liver,

00:55:42.677 --> 00:55:45.116
that's not good for it.

00:55:45.116 --> 00:55:47.258
Some of it's gonna exit
as free fatty acids,

00:55:47.258 --> 00:55:49.068
and those free fatty acids,
will take up residence

00:55:49.068 --> 00:55:50.592
in the muscle, and you get something

00:55:50.592 --> 00:55:52.612
called muscle insulin resistance.

00:55:52.612 --> 00:55:54.696
So insulin resistance, that's a bad thing.

00:55:54.696 --> 00:55:58.171
That makes your muscles and
your liver now work so well.

00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:01.633
And can cause all sorts of
other problems like diabetes.

00:56:01.633 --> 00:56:03.400
Some of the acetyl-CoA
won't even make it out,

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.790
and will precipitate as a lipid droplet,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.290
so there's your alcoholic steatohepatitis.

00:56:11.751 --> 00:56:13.475
This acetyl-CoA, and this ethanol,

00:56:13.475 --> 00:56:14.845
and these reactive oxygen species

00:56:14.845 --> 00:56:18.303
can start this enzyme activated.

00:56:18.303 --> 00:56:21.087
It's called c-jun n-terminal kinase 1,

00:56:21.087 --> 00:56:23.801
or JNK1, and it really is JNK1

00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:26.523
because it is the bridge between

00:56:26.523 --> 00:56:28.912
metabolism and inflammation.

00:56:28.912 --> 00:56:32.793
So, when you generate JNK1, you
do bad things to your liver,

00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:35.109
which I will show you when
we talk about fructose.

00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:37.364
So let's talk about fructose.

00:56:37.364 --> 00:56:39.933
Fructose is sweet, we like it a lot.

00:56:39.933 --> 00:56:41.578
We like it in everything,
we like it in our bread,

00:56:41.578 --> 00:56:45.304
we like it in our pretzels,
we like it everywhere we look.

00:56:45.304 --> 00:56:48.804
So, let's consume 120 calories in sucrose.

00:56:50.257 --> 00:56:52.431
A glass of orange juice.

00:56:52.431 --> 00:56:53.953
Everybody got it?

00:56:53.953 --> 00:56:56.677
So, two slices of white
bread, a shot of makers mark,

00:56:56.677 --> 00:57:01.533
a glass of orange juice,
all the same 120 calories.

00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:04.200
But, three different substrates.

00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:07.190
Let's see what happens to the fructose.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:10.418
So, number one, the glucose, remember,

00:57:10.418 --> 00:57:12.807
'cause sucrose is half
glucose half fructose,

00:57:12.807 --> 00:57:16.089
so 60 of the calories
of the 120 are glucose.

00:57:16.089 --> 00:57:18.376
12 are gonna make it into the liver,

00:57:18.376 --> 00:57:20.806
48 out here for the rest of the body.

00:57:20.806 --> 00:57:24.068
The same 20/80 split we
had before with glucose.

00:57:24.068 --> 00:57:25.328
So far, so good.

00:57:25.328 --> 00:57:27.358
But all 60 calories of fructose are

00:57:27.358 --> 00:57:28.668
gonna be metabolized by the liver.

00:57:28.668 --> 00:57:29.501
Why?

00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:33.077
Because only the liver
can metabolize fructose.

00:57:33.077 --> 00:57:35.373
So, what do we call it, where when you

00:57:35.373 --> 00:57:38.411
take in a compound that's
foreign to your body,

00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:40.594
and only the liver can metabolize it,

00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:44.511
and in the process,
generates various problems?

00:57:45.592 --> 00:57:46.425
What do we call that?

00:57:46.425 --> 00:57:47.842
We call that a...

00:57:49.248 --> 00:57:50.895
Poison.

00:57:50.895 --> 00:57:53.344
So, let me show you how it's a poison.

00:57:53.344 --> 00:57:55.161
So, let's watch the fructose.

00:57:55.161 --> 00:57:57.571
So, the fructose comes in
through this transporter, now.

00:57:57.571 --> 00:58:00.715
Before it was Glut2, now it's Glut5

00:58:00.715 --> 00:58:02.697
No insulin, remember, 'cause fructose

00:58:02.697 --> 00:58:04.621
does not stimulate insulin.

00:58:04.621 --> 00:58:07.221
Fructose, then, gets metabolized
by this guy, over here,

00:58:07.221 --> 00:58:09.668
called fructokinase, to form something

00:58:09.668 --> 00:58:11.212
called fructose 1-phosphate.

00:58:11.212 --> 00:58:14.129
In the process, ATP has to give up

00:58:14.129 --> 00:58:16.081
one phosphate to ADP 'cause the phosphate

00:58:16.081 --> 00:58:18.601
had to come from somewhere,
so it comes from here.

00:58:18.601 --> 00:58:21.844
Now, before we had 24 calories

00:58:21.844 --> 00:58:23.717
that had to be phosphorylated.

00:58:23.717 --> 00:58:27.631
Now we have 72 calories that
have to be phosphorylated.

00:58:27.631 --> 00:58:29.542
So, we have three times the substrate,

00:58:29.542 --> 00:58:31.093
and there's the rub.

00:58:31.093 --> 00:58:33.124
It's a volume issue, for right now.

00:58:33.124 --> 00:58:35.791
So, we're gonna lose a lot
of phosphate, aren't we?

00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:37.965
So there's a scavenger
enzyme in your liver

00:58:37.965 --> 00:58:40.646
called AMP deaminase 1 to rescue

00:58:40.646 --> 00:58:44.080
the phosphates off the
rest of the ATP molecule,

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.694
and it takes ADP down to
AMP, adenosine monophosphate,

00:58:47.694 --> 00:58:50.367
down to IMP, Inositol monophosphatase,

00:58:50.367 --> 00:58:53.780
and finally, to the
waste product uric acid.

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.137
Anybody every heard of uric acid?

00:58:56.137 --> 00:58:57.054
What is it?

00:58:59.043 --> 00:59:00.555
It's a waste product.

00:59:00.555 --> 00:59:01.835
Goes out in your urine.

00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:03.784
'Causes what disease?

00:59:03.784 --> 00:59:04.784
Gout, right.

00:59:06.017 --> 00:59:10.017
Also causes another disease
called hypertension.

00:59:11.892 --> 00:59:13.031
Let me show you how.

00:59:13.031 --> 00:59:15.734
Because uric acid, turns out, blocks

00:59:15.734 --> 00:59:17.208
the enzyme in your blood vessels

00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:20.043
called endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

00:59:20.043 --> 00:59:21.465
And that's the enzyme that makes

00:59:21.465 --> 00:59:23.843
the stuff called nitric oxide, NO.

00:59:23.843 --> 00:59:27.663
And that is your endogenous
blood pressure lowerer.

00:59:27.663 --> 00:59:30.580
That keeps your blood pressure low.

00:59:31.485 --> 00:59:35.683
So, when you can't make it,
your blood pressure goes up.

00:59:35.683 --> 00:59:37.612
So, this just shows that
fructose consumption

00:59:37.612 --> 00:59:39.266
increases gout in adults.

00:59:39.266 --> 00:59:41.420
So, this is a study
that came out last year

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.723
showing that fructose consumption

00:59:43.723 --> 00:59:46.023
increases the risk for gout,

00:59:46.023 --> 00:59:48.258
showing that uric acid's going up.

00:59:48.258 --> 00:59:50.949
And this is a study done
by pediatric renal fellow,

00:59:50.949 --> 00:59:52.545
Stephanie Winn, just published in

00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:53.744
Journal of Pediatrics,

00:59:53.744 --> 00:59:56.522
it's not submitted any
more, it's long in press,

00:59:56.522 --> 00:59:59.424
showing that this is
in the NHANES database

00:59:59.424 --> 01:00:02.783
in the adolescents, showing
that sugar sweetened beverages,

01:00:02.783 --> 01:00:06.565
as it goes up, your uric acid goes up.

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:09.075
And, not only does your uric acid go up,

01:00:09.075 --> 01:00:10.219
but here's your sugar sweetened beverages,

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:14.387
and here's your systolic
blood pressure going up.

01:00:14.387 --> 01:00:16.295
And here's a study done by Dan Fige,

01:00:16.295 --> 01:00:18.165
at the University of Texas San Antonio,

01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:21.529
where he took obese
adolescents with hypertension,

01:00:21.529 --> 01:00:24.339
and he gave them the drug Allopurinol.

01:00:24.339 --> 01:00:27.441
And Allopurinol is the drug
that you treat gout with,

01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.974
to lower the uric acid.

01:00:28.974 --> 01:00:30.529
And look what happened
to the blood pressure.

01:00:30.529 --> 01:00:33.729
Systolic, diastolic, went down.

01:00:33.729 --> 01:00:36.411
Showing that, in fact, uric acid

01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:40.050
is an important part of hypertension.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:44.593
We have a hypertension
epidemic in this country.

01:00:44.593 --> 01:00:45.510
Here it is.

01:00:47.092 --> 01:00:48.342
It's the sugar.

01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:53.213
Okay, so, so far we have
high blood pressure.

01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:55.024
Let's keep going.

01:00:55.024 --> 01:00:56.316
The fructose will get metabolized

01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:58.476
down to pyruvate, the pyruvate

01:00:58.476 --> 01:01:01.233
will enter the mitochondria
just like before,

01:01:01.233 --> 01:01:03.041
throwing off a lot of citrate.

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:04.817
And here's a little trick that fructose

01:01:04.817 --> 01:01:06.564
does that glucose doesn't.

01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.637
'Cause these to can reform this stuff

01:01:08.637 --> 01:01:11.777
over here called fructose
1 6 bisphosphatase,

01:01:11.777 --> 01:01:14.035
which can then reform with glyceraldehyde

01:01:14.035 --> 01:01:17.071
to form this guy, over here,
called xylulose-5-phosphate.

01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:19.773
And I get to
xylulose-5-phosphate in a moment.

01:01:19.773 --> 01:01:21.692
But I wanna point out this asterisk.

01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:24.699
That's there to remind
me to tell you something.

01:01:24.699 --> 01:01:26.730
That's there to remind me to tell you

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.851
that this is why the
sports drink companies

01:01:29.851 --> 01:01:33.961
put high fructose corn
syrup in the sports drinks.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:37.632
Because if you are glycogen depleted,

01:01:37.632 --> 01:01:39.960
in other words, if you just ran a marthon,

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.838
and you have no glycogen
left in your liver

01:01:41.838 --> 01:01:43.991
because you burned it all, and you take in

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.669
a sports drink with high
fructose corn syrup,

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:49.030
you can replete your glycogen faster

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.647
than with glucose alone.

01:01:50.647 --> 01:01:52.157
That's true.

01:01:52.157 --> 01:01:56.121
So, for elite athletes, a
high fructose corn syrup

01:01:56.121 --> 01:02:00.263
containing sports drink
actually makes sense.

01:02:00.263 --> 01:02:01.907
And so, indeed, sports drinks

01:02:01.907 --> 01:02:04.049
have high fructose corn syrup.

01:02:04.049 --> 01:02:08.571
The question is who
drinking the sports drinks?

01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:11.140
Any elite athletes you know?

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.820
Who's drinking the sports drinks?

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.154
The kids, right?

01:02:15.154 --> 01:02:17.237
Why are they drinking it?

01:02:18.088 --> 01:02:20.171
Because it's cool, right?

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.501
'Cause it's cool and it tastes good.

01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:26.632
So, before we go on, I just wanna,

01:02:26.632 --> 01:02:28.799
now, digress for a moment.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:33.663
1967, University of
Florida patents Gatorade.

01:02:36.497 --> 01:02:38.730
Everybody remember Gatorade?

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.861
Okay, 1970, the Florida Gators win

01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:44.697
the NCAA Championship in football.

01:02:44.697 --> 01:02:47.216
Gatorade makes a big splash.

01:02:47.216 --> 01:02:48.545
Okay, big deal.

01:02:48.545 --> 01:02:52.519
Anybody ever taste the original Gatorade?

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.352
Yeah?

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.453
What'd it taste like?

01:02:55.453 --> 01:02:56.786
Tasted horrible.

01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:01.569
It tasted like something
that you might find

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.819
coming out of you instead
of going into you.

01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:07.723
(audience laughs)

01:03:07.723 --> 01:03:09.056
It tasted awful.

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:14.247
1992, Pepsi buys Gatorade, and they say,

01:03:15.831 --> 01:03:19.529
"How are we gonna market this swill?"

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.813
So, what did they do?

01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:24.655
They added the high fructose corn syrup.

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:26.488
So, now who drinks it?

01:03:27.877 --> 01:03:29.444
Fat kids, right?

01:03:29.444 --> 01:03:32.349
Not even skinny kids, fat kids drink it.

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:34.044
Okay, so there's a problem here.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.283
Okay, and we're gonna
show you how that works.

01:03:35.283 --> 01:03:38.539
Okay, so xylulose-5-phosphate,
just to show you,

01:03:38.539 --> 01:03:40.545
if you take a rat, and
you glycogen deplete him

01:03:40.545 --> 01:03:43.228
by making him run on an exercise wheel,

01:03:43.228 --> 01:03:45.755
and then you re-feed them with starch

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.574
or with sucrose, the xylulose-5-phosphate

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.302
goes way up with the sucrose.

01:03:49.302 --> 01:03:51.169
So you get more xylulose-5-phosphate

01:03:51.169 --> 01:03:53.984
through this pathway
here, going over here.

01:03:53.984 --> 01:03:55.926
So why do we care about
xylulose-5-phosphate?

01:03:55.926 --> 01:03:56.808
Well, here's why.

01:03:56.808 --> 01:03:58.666
Because it stimulates this guy, over here,

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.334
called PP2A, which then activates

01:04:00.334 --> 01:04:01.959
this transcription factor here,

01:04:01.959 --> 01:04:04.822
carbohydrate response
element binding protein,

01:04:04.822 --> 01:04:08.155
which then activates what three enzymes?

01:04:09.343 --> 01:04:12.748
New fat making right,
the novo lipogenesis.

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.592
So here's the citrate,
we got lot's of that.

01:04:15.592 --> 01:04:19.759
And here we've got acetyl-CoA,
which is the way into fat,

01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:23.754
which then gets packaged to the VLDL,

01:04:25.315 --> 01:04:27.927
and now you've got the dyslipidemia

01:04:27.927 --> 01:04:30.386
of obesity of fructose consumption,

01:04:30.386 --> 01:04:32.810
which has, been known for many years.

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:36.492
So, here's normal medical students,

01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:38.825
if you can call them normal,

01:04:39.897 --> 01:04:41.764
taking in a glucose load.

01:04:41.764 --> 01:04:45.351
Notice, almost none of it ends up as fat.

01:04:45.351 --> 01:04:48.054
Taking in a fructose load,
same number of calories,

01:04:48.054 --> 01:04:50.554
30% of it ends up as fat.

01:04:51.415 --> 01:04:53.487
So when you consume fructose,

01:04:53.487 --> 01:04:57.654
you're not consuming a
carbohydrate, you're consuming fat.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.743
So everybody talks about a high fat diet.

01:05:02.743 --> 01:05:05.506
Well, high sugar diet is a high fat diet.

01:05:05.506 --> 01:05:07.599
That's the point.

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.682
That's exactly the point.

01:05:11.746 --> 01:05:13.398
This is a study where they gave

01:05:13.398 --> 01:05:14.861
acute administration of fructose,

01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:16.469
and you can see the triglycerides

01:05:16.469 --> 01:05:18.936
going up compared to the control.

01:05:18.936 --> 01:05:20.552
Serum triglyceride, right there.

01:05:20.552 --> 01:05:22.259
Here's normal medical students, again,

01:05:22.259 --> 01:05:25.144
six days of high fructose feeding.

01:05:25.144 --> 01:05:28.743
Triglycerides doubled, de novo lipogenesis

01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:32.348
went up five times higher,
and here's free fatty acids,

01:05:32.348 --> 01:05:35.619
which then cause insulin
resistance, doubled.

01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:36.452
Six days.

01:05:38.077 --> 01:05:42.355
So, here's the dyslipidemia
of fructose consumption.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.242
We're not done.

01:05:44.242 --> 01:05:45.990
Some of the fat won't
make it out of the liver,

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.281
just like with ethanol.

01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:48.563
And now you've got a lipid droplet,

01:05:48.563 --> 01:05:52.371
so now you've got this
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:54.902
So, this is work that we did in our clinic

01:05:54.902 --> 01:05:57.958
looking at sugar sweetened
beverage consumption

01:05:57.958 --> 01:06:01.323
against the liver enzyme marker ALT,

01:06:01.323 --> 01:06:05.174
alanine aminotransferase, which
tells you about fatty liver.

01:06:05.174 --> 01:06:07.122
And sure enough, here's
sugar sweetened beverages

01:06:07.122 --> 01:06:10.190
against ALT, and you can see a nice

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:12.511
linear relationship in Caucasians.

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:15.132
African Americans, it's
a different relationship,

01:06:15.132 --> 01:06:18.229
and that' a' whole 'nother
story all by itself.

01:06:18.229 --> 01:06:19.976
So, there's the lipid droplet

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.580
of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.368
Some of it will come
out as free fatty acids

01:06:24.368 --> 01:06:26.844
and populate the muscle, will also tell

01:06:26.844 --> 01:06:29.346
the insulin to go up higher.

01:06:29.346 --> 01:06:30.725
Remember that JNK1?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:31.914
So, here's what JNK1 does.

01:06:31.914 --> 01:06:35.287
So, the acetyl-CoA and the
fructose can all activate JNK1.

01:06:35.287 --> 01:06:38.182
And what JNK1 does is, remember when we

01:06:38.182 --> 01:06:41.727
used glucose, this IRS
became tyrosine IRS-1

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:42.998
and that was good?

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:43.861
Remember that?

01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:45.353
Well, JNK1, what it does, is it's

01:06:45.353 --> 01:06:47.710
serine phosphorylated IRS-1.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.335
And serine IRS-1 is inactive.

01:06:50.335 --> 01:06:54.155
So now, the insulin can't
even do it's job in the liver.

01:06:54.155 --> 01:06:57.760
So, now you have liver
insulin resistance as well.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.198
That's gonna make the
pancreas work that much harder

01:07:00.198 --> 01:07:01.934
generating higher insulin levels,

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.680
which raise your blood
pressure even further,

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:08.955
cause further fat
making, cause more energy

01:07:08.955 --> 01:07:11.169
to go into your fat cell.

01:07:11.169 --> 01:07:13.725
There's your obesity.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:16.760
And finally, our research has shown

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.008
that the higher the insulin goes,

01:07:18.008 --> 01:07:21.250
the less well your brain
can see it's leptin.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.331
And so there you've got
continued consumption

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.923
because your brain thinks it's starving.

01:07:25.923 --> 01:07:28.582
And it's been shown in many different ways

01:07:28.582 --> 01:07:30.575
that fructose consumption changes

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:33.318
the way your brain recognizes energy.

01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:35.512
All in a negative fashion, so that you,

01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:37.733
basically, think you're starving.

01:07:37.733 --> 01:07:40.418
Your brain gets the signal
that you're starving

01:07:40.418 --> 01:07:43.465
even though your fat cells are generating

01:07:43.465 --> 01:07:47.632
a signal that says, "Hey,
I'm full like all get out."

01:07:48.548 --> 01:07:50.333
So, this just shows you how it goes.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.538
So, the high insulin generates the obesity

01:07:52.538 --> 01:07:54.681
because this is that, remember the first

01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:57.667
law of thermodynamics,
the biochemical force

01:07:57.667 --> 01:08:00.084
generating the energy storage

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:03.072
as the primary phenomenon, remember,

01:08:03.072 --> 01:08:06.285
if you're gonna store it,
and you expect to burn it

01:08:06.285 --> 01:08:07.604
then you're gonna have to eat it.

01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:09.335
So, here's the store it.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.827
Normally, that would make leptin,

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:12.117
and the leptin should feed back

01:08:12.117 --> 01:08:14.130
and turn everything off, but it doesn't,

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:16.405
because the insulin gets in the way,

01:08:16.405 --> 01:08:18.331
and the high fat diet gets in the way.

01:08:18.331 --> 01:08:20.965
Also, the hyperinsulinemia
stops the leptin

01:08:20.965 --> 01:08:23.702
from acting on that nucleus accumbens,

01:08:23.702 --> 01:08:25.571
and so you get an increased reward signal.

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:27.337
So that continues your appetite,

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:30.375
continues more fructose,
more carbohydrate,

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.894
generating more insulin
resistance than you can see.

01:08:32.894 --> 01:08:35.994
You generate a vicious
cycle of consumption

01:08:35.994 --> 01:08:38.411
and disease, and no stopping.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.849
So, here we are,
hypertension, inflammation,

01:08:42.849 --> 01:08:44.780
hepatic insulin resistance,
hyperinsulinemia,

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:46.672
dyslipidemia, muscle insulin resistance,

01:08:46.672 --> 01:08:50.239
obesity, and continued consumption.

01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:53.239
Looks like metabolic syndrome to me.

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:58.090
So, here are the phenomena associated

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.610
with chronic ethanol exposure.

01:09:00.610 --> 01:09:02.615
Hematologic disorders,
electrolyte abnormalities,

01:09:02.615 --> 01:09:04.353
hypertension, cardiac
dilation, cardiomyopathy,

01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:06.829
dyslipidemia, pancreatitis, malnutrition,

01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:08.444
obesity, hepatic dysfunction,

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.214
that's alcoholic steatohepatitis,

01:09:10.214 --> 01:09:13.381
fetal alcohol syndrome, and addiction.

01:09:14.919 --> 01:09:16.878
Here's fructose.

01:09:16.878 --> 01:09:18.545
Eight out of twelve.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:20.689
Why?

01:09:22.039 --> 01:09:23.534
'Cause they do the same thing.

01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:25.249
'Cause they metabolize the same way.

01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:26.399
Because they are the same.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.622
They come from the same place, right.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.767
How do you make ethanol?

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:31.600
Naturally.

01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:35.205
Right, you ferment sugar.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.244
Hasn't changed, 'cause it
has all the same properties.

01:09:38.244 --> 01:09:40.763
Because it's basically
taken care of by the liver

01:09:40.763 --> 01:09:43.810
in exactly the same way,
and for the same reason.

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.402
Because sugar and ethanol are the same,

01:09:46.402 --> 01:09:48.485
every which way you turn.

01:09:49.946 --> 01:09:52.108
So, here's our clinic intervention.

01:09:52.108 --> 01:09:53.928
This is what we do in our clinic.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:55.816
It's as simple as you can imagine.

01:09:55.816 --> 01:09:58.119
We write this on the back of a matchbook.

01:09:58.119 --> 01:10:00.817
It's just as simple as you can make it.

01:10:00.817 --> 01:10:01.964
We have four things we teach

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.569
the kids to do, and the parents.

01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:06.953
Get rid of every sugared
liquid in the house, bar none.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.216
Only water and milk, there is no

01:10:09.216 --> 01:10:12.296
such thing as a good
sugar beverage, period.

01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:14.116
Eat your carbohydrate with fiber.

01:10:14.116 --> 01:10:14.949
Why?

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.299
Because fiber is good.

01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:18.778
Fiber is supposed to be
an essential nutrient.

01:10:18.778 --> 01:10:20.200
And we can talk later, if you want,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.101
after the cameras turn off,

01:10:22.101 --> 01:10:25.453
as to why fiber is not
an essential nutrient.

01:10:25.453 --> 01:10:28.205
Because the government
doesn't want it to be.

01:10:28.205 --> 01:10:31.689
'Cause then they couldn't
sell food abroad.

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:34.279
Wait 20 minutes for second portions,

01:10:34.279 --> 01:10:35.978
to get that satiety signal.

01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:37.857
And finally, buy your screen time

01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:39.758
minute-for-minute with physical activity.

01:10:39.758 --> 01:10:41.393
That's the hardest one to do.

01:10:41.393 --> 01:10:43.356
So, if you play for half an hour,

01:10:43.356 --> 01:10:45.001
you can watch TV for half an hour.

01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:47.265
You wanna watch TV for an
hour, play for an hour.

01:10:47.265 --> 01:10:48.473
That one's a hard one, but anyway.

01:10:48.473 --> 01:10:50.620
We follow our patients every three months.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.900
So, here's my question.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.404
Does it work?

01:10:53.404 --> 01:10:55.395
What do you think?

01:10:55.395 --> 01:10:56.645
Yeah, it works.

01:10:57.916 --> 01:11:01.448
So, this is BMI z-score
time from initial visit.

01:11:01.448 --> 01:11:02.404
It works.

01:11:02.404 --> 01:11:04.047
But, we were interested
in what made it work,

01:11:04.047 --> 01:11:05.331
and made it didn't work, so we did

01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:08.832
a multivariate linear regression analysis.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:11.042
The thing that made it not work,

01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:13.045
sugared beverage consumption.

01:11:13.045 --> 01:11:16.448
The more sugar beverages the
patient drank at baseline,

01:11:16.448 --> 01:11:20.115
the less well lifestyle
intervention worked

01:11:20.115 --> 01:11:23.282
for all the reasons I just showed you.

01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:27.609
So, why is exercise important in obesity.

01:11:28.913 --> 01:11:31.043
Because it burns calories?

01:11:31.043 --> 01:11:31.876
Come on.

01:11:32.885 --> 01:11:35.150
20 minutes of jogging's
one chocolate chip cookie.

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:36.573
You can't do it.
(audience laughs)

01:11:36.573 --> 01:11:38.374
Are you joking me?

01:11:38.374 --> 01:11:40.874
So, why is exercise important?

01:11:42.352 --> 01:11:43.896
I'll tell you why, here's why.

01:11:43.896 --> 01:11:46.377
Number one, it improves
that skeletal muscle

01:11:46.377 --> 01:11:48.894
insulin sensitivity because you're insulin

01:11:48.894 --> 01:11:50.765
actually works better at your muscle,

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.472
which then brings your
insulin levels down.

01:11:52.472 --> 01:11:53.772
Which is good for you.

01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:57.043
Number two, it's your
indigenous stress reducer.

01:11:57.043 --> 01:12:01.067
It's the single thing that
actually stress reduces.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.399
And if you stress reduce,

01:12:02.399 --> 01:12:04.844
what do you think your appetite does?

01:12:04.844 --> 01:12:08.900
Goes down, because stress
and obesity go hand in hand,

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.485
for all sorts of reasons which are beyond

01:12:10.485 --> 01:12:12.678
the scope of this lecture today.

01:12:12.678 --> 01:12:13.778
But, we can talk about it in

01:12:13.778 --> 01:12:15.274
the question period, if you want.

01:12:15.274 --> 01:12:18.727
And then finally, remember
that de novo lipogenesis?

01:12:18.727 --> 01:12:21.552
Remember those three nasty enzymes?

01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:25.719
What if you burned the stuff
off before you made the fat?

01:12:27.789 --> 01:12:29.525
That's what exercise does, 'cause it makes

01:12:29.525 --> 01:12:31.547
that TCA cycle run
faster, so you don't get

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.458
the citrate leaving the mitochondria,

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.164
so it doesn't get turned into fat,

01:12:35.164 --> 01:12:36.790
so it doesn't precipitate and cause

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:39.980
all the problems you just saw.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.442
(speaking away from microphone)

01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:45.037
That's what they mean by
a higher metabolism, yes.

01:12:45.037 --> 01:12:47.883
But it has nothing to do
with burning of calories.

01:12:47.883 --> 01:12:49.994
That is the stupidest reason

01:12:49.994 --> 01:12:52.229
that I've every heard of for exercise.

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.271
You gotta be joking me.

01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:55.879
You can't do it.

01:12:55.879 --> 01:12:58.138
I mean one Big Mac and you gotta

01:12:58.138 --> 01:12:59.992
mountain bike for ten hours.

01:12:59.992 --> 01:13:01.485
(audience laughs)

01:13:01.485 --> 01:13:03.139
Are you joking?

01:13:03.139 --> 01:13:06.412
So, why is fiber important in obesity?

01:13:06.412 --> 01:13:08.137
So, this is my motto in clinic.

01:13:08.137 --> 01:13:12.746
When God made the poison, he
packaged it with the antidote.

01:13:12.746 --> 01:13:14.710
'Cause fructose is a poison.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.673
I think I've, hopefully, shown you that.

01:13:16.673 --> 01:13:19.587
But, wherever there's fructose in nature,

01:13:19.587 --> 01:13:21.723
there's way more fiber.

01:13:21.723 --> 01:13:23.957
You ever see a piece of sugar cane?

01:13:23.957 --> 01:13:25.002
It's a stick, right?

01:13:25.002 --> 01:13:27.079
(audience laughs)

01:13:27.079 --> 01:13:29.499
You can't even chew the damn thing, right?

01:13:29.499 --> 01:13:30.590
You gotta suck the stuff out.

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:31.423
(sucking)

01:13:31.423 --> 01:13:32.256
Like that, right?

01:13:32.256 --> 01:13:33.321
I mean, how many calories you think you're

01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:36.104
gonna get out of a piece of sugar cane?

01:13:36.104 --> 01:13:38.696
They actually did studies
on the sugar plantations

01:13:38.696 --> 01:13:40.696
back in the early 1900s.

01:13:42.049 --> 01:13:44.539
All of the workers were healthy

01:13:44.539 --> 01:13:47.363
and lived longer than the sugar executives

01:13:47.363 --> 01:13:49.963
who got the processed product.

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:52.480
How 'bout that, wonder why.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.754
So, eat your carbohydrate with fiber,

01:13:55.754 --> 01:13:57.025
that's why we say that.

01:13:57.025 --> 01:14:00.235
That includes sugar,
that's why fruit's okay.

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:01.483
Because number one, it limits

01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:03.048
how much fructose you're gonna take in,

01:14:03.048 --> 01:14:05.141
and number two, it gives
you an essential nutrient

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.859
which you needed in the first place.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.990
And you get some
micronutrients along with it

01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:12.534
so that you actually, your
liver works healthier.

01:14:12.534 --> 01:14:14.214
So, here's what fiber does.

01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:15.360
Number one, it reduces the rate

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.371
of intestinal carbohydrate absorption.

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.049
Now, sometimes that's bad.

01:14:21.049 --> 01:14:23.690
I'll tell you when that's bad.

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:25.185
Now when that's bad?

01:14:25.185 --> 01:14:28.852
That's bad when you're
at a formal function.

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.398
'Cause what happens if you reduce

01:14:34.398 --> 01:14:38.624
the rate of carbohydrate
absorption in your gut?

01:14:38.624 --> 01:14:40.430
The bacteria get to it.

01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:42.230
So, as far as I'm concerned,

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:45.064
in life you've got two choices.

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:47.270
It's either fat or fart.

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:50.614
(audience laughs)

01:14:50.614 --> 01:14:52.850
It increases the speed of transit

01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.211
of the intestinal contents to the ilium,

01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:57.205
and that raises this hormone over here

01:14:57.205 --> 01:14:58.587
called PYY, which goes to your brain

01:14:58.587 --> 01:15:00.191
and tells you the meal's over.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:01.777
That's your satiety signal.

01:15:01.777 --> 01:15:03.951
So when you add fiber to your diet,

01:15:03.951 --> 01:15:05.953
you actually get your
satiety signal sooner,

01:15:05.953 --> 01:15:07.912
because the food moves through faster.

01:15:07.912 --> 01:15:09.863
And then, finally, it also inhibits

01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:11.480
the absorption of some free fatty acids

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.572
all the way to the colon, and then those

01:15:13.572 --> 01:15:16.069
get chopped up into little
itty bitty fragments

01:15:16.069 --> 01:15:17.717
called short chain fatty acids,

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:19.432
and those actually suppress insulin,

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.854
as apposed to long chain fatty acids

01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:22.245
which stimulate insulin.

01:15:22.245 --> 01:15:25.060
So there are a whole bunch
of reasons why fiber is good.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.051
Anybody ever heard of
the Paleolithic Diet?

01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:32.090
Go home and read up on it on the internet.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:33.530
The Paleolithic Diet.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.353
Basically, if you east everything as it

01:15:35.353 --> 01:15:39.020
came out of the ground
raw, with no cooking,

01:15:40.651 --> 01:15:44.214
you would cure diabetes on a dime.

01:15:44.214 --> 01:15:45.828
Takes about a week.

01:15:45.828 --> 01:15:47.465
Because you're getting that 100

01:15:47.465 --> 01:15:50.301
to 300 grams of fiber I mentioned before.

01:15:50.301 --> 01:15:53.053
That's why, 'cause fiber is good for you.

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:54.761
And the more, the better.

01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:56.055
- [Audience Member] Type 2.

01:15:56.055 --> 01:15:58.193
Type 2, right, Type 2, not Type 1.

01:15:58.193 --> 01:16:00.360
I stand corrected, Type 2.

01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:03.580
Now, for some fun.

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.231
That's the end of the biochemistry.

01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:06.478
Phew, how'd I do?

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:09.478
(audience applauds)

01:16:11.008 --> 01:16:13.469
I told you I'd get you through it.

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:15.121
So, now comes the fun part.

01:16:15.121 --> 01:16:18.898
The racial innuendos, and
all the political stuff.

01:16:18.898 --> 01:16:21.236
The fructosification of America,

01:16:21.236 --> 01:16:22.395
and, of course, the world.

01:16:22.395 --> 01:16:23.228
Ready?

01:16:24.325 --> 01:16:26.185
Another quiz.

01:16:26.185 --> 01:16:28.002
Can you name the seven foodstuffs

01:16:28.002 --> 01:16:29.349
at McDonald's that don't have

01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:31.704
high fructose corn syrup or sucrose?

01:16:31.704 --> 01:16:33.135
- [Audience Member] Mustard?

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:34.859
- (laughs) No, mustard has it.

01:16:34.859 --> 01:16:37.015
(audience chatter)

01:16:37.015 --> 01:16:39.526
Oh, come on, come one, the big one.

01:16:39.526 --> 01:16:42.643
French fries, but they
have salt, starch, and fat.

01:16:42.643 --> 01:16:44.106
So, they're not so good either.

01:16:44.106 --> 01:16:45.439
Okay, what else?

01:16:46.304 --> 01:16:47.229
We'll get to coffee.

01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:49.078
Hash browns, for the same reason,

01:16:49.078 --> 01:16:51.303
salt starch and fat.

01:16:51.303 --> 01:16:55.449
What else, chicken
McNuggets, I was shocked.

01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:56.282
I was shocked.

01:16:56.282 --> 01:16:59.358
No sucrose or high fructose
corn syrup in chicken McNuggets.

01:16:59.358 --> 01:17:02.404
But, as the Circuit
Court Judge in New York

01:17:02.404 --> 01:17:05.648
called them, they are still
a McFrankenstein creation.

01:17:05.648 --> 01:17:07.404
(audience laughs)

01:17:07.404 --> 01:17:10.655
But, nonetheless, no sucrose,
I was really shocked.

01:17:10.655 --> 01:17:12.230
Sausage.

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:13.935
Oh, they're terrible,
they're just disastrous.

01:17:13.935 --> 01:17:15.592
But, I mean, there's
nothing good in them at all,

01:17:15.592 --> 01:17:18.172
but there's not fructose.

01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:22.339
Sausage, Diet Coke, Coffee,
if you don't add the sugar,

01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:28.221
and ice tea, if you don't add the sugar.

01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:29.846
By the way, the chicken McNuggets,

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:31.889
we have a disclaimer, because no one

01:17:31.889 --> 01:17:35.777
eats the chicken McNuggets
without a dipping sauce.

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:38.073
And there's a whole bunch
of high fructose corn syrup

01:17:38.073 --> 01:17:40.036
in the dipping sauce, right?

01:17:40.036 --> 01:17:41.630
Okay, good, all right.

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:43.477
So, who's really drinking this?

01:17:43.477 --> 01:17:45.156
We talked about this before.

01:17:45.156 --> 01:17:46.156
Gatorade AM.

01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:50.520
So, this is an attempt by Pepsi

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.033
to capture market share
on the juice market.

01:17:54.033 --> 01:17:56.047
Do you think there are any elite athletes

01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:59.216
who actually drink this stuff?

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:00.313
You gotta be kidding me.

01:18:00.313 --> 01:18:02.813
Okay, this is for kids, right?

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.772
So, this really blew my socks off.

01:18:07.772 --> 01:18:09.732
This was my daughter, when she

01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:11.418
was in second grade, two years ago,

01:18:11.418 --> 01:18:13.855
Miriam Lustig, brought these two

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.258
cartons of milk home for me, and said,

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.350
"Dad, you're not gonna believe this."

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:18.244
Second grade.

01:18:18.244 --> 01:18:20.256
So, here's the calories in Berkeley Farms

01:18:20.256 --> 01:18:23.927
1% low fat milk, 130 calories,
15 of them are sugars,

01:18:23.927 --> 01:18:26.699
'cause it's lactose, which is okay.

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:29.665
And here's Berkeley
Farms 1% chocolate milk,

01:18:29.665 --> 01:18:33.067
190 calories, 29 grams of sugar,

01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:36.251
all high fructose corn syrup.

01:18:36.251 --> 01:18:38.554
It's like a glass of milk plus

01:18:38.554 --> 01:18:41.622
a half a glass of orange juice.

01:18:41.622 --> 01:18:43.408
And that's what we're giving to our kids.

01:18:43.408 --> 01:18:45.408
And do you know what the

01:18:46.324 --> 01:18:48.682
nutrition department at the SFUSD says?

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:52.838
"Well, we have to get our
kids to drink milk some how."

01:18:52.838 --> 01:18:54.800
Is that brilliant, or what?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.944
I don't know.

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.611
Now, what about WIC.

01:18:58.585 --> 01:19:00.692
So, we talked about the 112 pounds

01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:03.662
of orange juice that the kid
down in Salinas was drinking.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:05.560
What bout WIC?

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.521
Remember what we started with?

01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:11.717
We have an epidemic of
obese six month olds.

01:19:11.717 --> 01:19:12.550
Remember?

01:19:14.268 --> 01:19:16.451
So, could this be the reason?

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.784
So, here's a can of formula.

01:19:21.347 --> 01:19:25.264
43.2% corn syrup solids, 10.3% sugar.

01:19:29.068 --> 01:19:30.901
It's a baby milkshake.

01:19:33.732 --> 01:19:36.982
Soda, Coca Cola, is 10.5% sucrose.

01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:41.369
Formula is 10.3% sucrose.

01:19:42.256 --> 01:19:44.311
Any difference?

01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:45.861
And there's a huge literature that's

01:19:45.861 --> 01:19:47.832
now coming of age that shows that

01:19:47.832 --> 01:19:50.641
the earlier you expose kids to sweet,

01:19:50.641 --> 01:19:53.877
the more they're gonna crave it later.

01:19:53.877 --> 01:19:56.066
Plus, there's a new literature that shows

01:19:56.066 --> 01:19:59.853
the more sugar the pregnant
woman drinks or eats

01:19:59.853 --> 01:20:01.817
during the pregnancy, the more that gets

01:20:01.817 --> 01:20:05.748
across the placenta, and actually causes

01:20:05.748 --> 01:20:07.841
what we call developmental programming,

01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:12.759
changing the kids adiposity
even before the kid is born,

01:20:12.759 --> 01:20:15.408
and driving this whole
epidemic even further.

01:20:15.408 --> 01:20:18.747
So, we'll close in a few minutes.

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:22.329
But, I just wanna point
out what's the difference.

01:20:22.329 --> 01:20:24.350
Here, we got a can of Coke.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:25.853
Here we got a can of beer.

01:20:25.853 --> 01:20:27.560
And I'm not picking on
Schlitz, or anything.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.862
It's any beer you want, okay.

01:20:29.862 --> 01:20:32.201
So, 150 calories each, no difference

01:20:32.201 --> 01:20:33.926
in terms of total calories.

01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:37.199
Percent carbohydrate, so
10.5% from sucrose here,

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.669
except it's high fructose
corn syrup, but who cares.

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:42.534
3.6% alcohol, here's the breakdown.

01:20:42.534 --> 01:20:45.927
75 fructose, 75 glucose for the Coke.

01:20:45.927 --> 01:20:49.648
90 alcohol 60 maltose for the beer.

01:20:49.648 --> 01:20:51.771
Remember, the first pass GI metabolism

01:20:51.771 --> 01:20:54.669
takes 10% of the alcohol off the table.

01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:56.603
So, when you actually compute

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:58.472
the number of calories hitting the liver,

01:20:58.472 --> 01:21:01.020
which remember was the big difference

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.418
between glucose and fructose, remember?

01:21:03.418 --> 01:21:07.034
72 versus 24 and started
the whole thing into motion

01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:09.992
as term of what happens that's bad.

01:21:09.992 --> 01:21:12.242
Bottom line, no difference.

01:21:13.245 --> 01:21:17.276
So, we have something called beer belly.

01:21:17.276 --> 01:21:19.609
Well, welcome to soda belly.

01:21:20.925 --> 01:21:23.514
'Cause that's what
America's suffering from.

01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:24.957
No ifs ands or buts.

01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:26.064
That's what it is.

01:21:26.064 --> 01:21:29.560
Now, you wouldn't think twice about

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.227
not giving your kid a Budweiser.

01:21:33.632 --> 01:21:35.563
But, you don't think twice about

01:21:35.563 --> 01:21:38.063
giving your kid a can of Coke.

01:21:39.231 --> 01:21:41.272
But, they're the same,

01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:44.238
in the same dosing, for the same reason,

01:21:44.238 --> 01:21:45.550
through the same mechanism.

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:48.633
Fructose is ethanol without the buzz.

01:21:51.951 --> 01:21:53.613
Fructose is a carbohydrate.

01:21:53.613 --> 01:21:55.006
Yes, it is.

01:21:55.006 --> 01:21:57.230
But fructose is metabolized like a fat.

01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:58.609
And I've just shown you that 30%

01:21:58.609 --> 01:22:02.800
of any ingested fructose
load ends up as fat.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.844
So when people talk about high
fat diets doing bad things,

01:22:05.844 --> 01:22:06.907
no, what they're really talking

01:22:06.907 --> 01:22:08.892
about is high fructose diets,

01:22:08.892 --> 01:22:12.392
and that's what Ancel Keys was looking at.

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:18.228
So, the corollary to that
is, in America at least,

01:22:18.228 --> 01:22:20.391
and around the world too, a low fat diet

01:22:20.391 --> 01:22:22.475
isn't really a low fat diet.

01:22:22.475 --> 01:22:24.690
Because the fructose or
sucrose doubles as fat,

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.832
it's really a high fat diet.

01:22:26.832 --> 01:22:29.499
That's why our diets don't work.

01:22:30.895 --> 01:22:33.922
And fructose, just like ethanol,

01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:35.649
for the same reason,
through the same mechanism,

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:39.066
and in the same dosing, is also as toxin.

01:22:40.526 --> 01:22:43.443
Now, last, what can we do about it?

01:22:44.702 --> 01:22:46.966
Can we do anything about it?

01:22:46.966 --> 01:22:48.466
How 'bout the FDA?

01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:51.427
You think they can do something about it.

01:22:51.427 --> 01:22:54.138
After all, aren't they
supposed to regulate our food?

01:22:54.138 --> 01:22:55.904
Aren't they supposed to regulate

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:58.731
what they can put in food?

01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:02.244
Weren't they supposed to regulate tobacco?

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:03.374
Now they are, actually.

01:23:03.374 --> 01:23:05.995
So, you know, weird things.

01:23:05.995 --> 01:23:07.783
So, I wanna just show you what

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:11.041
the tobacco company thinks of all this.

01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:14.212
This is actually from the UCSF Legacy

01:23:14.212 --> 01:23:15.897
Tobacco Documents Library that

01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:17.869
Stan Glantz runs right across the street.

01:23:17.869 --> 01:23:21.012
Stan's a good guy, like Stan a lot.

01:23:21.012 --> 01:23:23.166
And he showed me this.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.166
"Under the regulations
governing food additives,"

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:29.139
so this came from an Altria
or Phillip Morris executive,

01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:31.650
"it is required that additives be safe,

01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:33.295
"defined as a reasonable certainty

01:23:33.295 --> 01:23:35.356
"by competent scientists that no harm

01:23:35.356 --> 01:23:38.666
"will result form the
intended use of the additive."

01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:41.833
Now, does fructose meet that standard?

01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:45.324
Well, the FDA says that fructose,

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:48.554
high fructose corn syrup,
has what's knows as GRAS,

01:23:48.554 --> 01:23:52.137
G R A S status, generally
regarded as safe.

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:56.405
Now, where'd that come from?

01:23:56.405 --> 01:23:57.238
No where.

01:23:58.416 --> 01:24:00.602
It came from no where.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.876
It came from the notion
that, "Well, fructose

01:24:02.876 --> 01:24:07.356
"is natural, it's in
fruit, it must be okay."

01:24:07.356 --> 01:24:09.923
Well, tobacco's natural too.

01:24:09.923 --> 01:24:10.756
But it's not.

01:24:10.756 --> 01:24:12.880
Ethanol's natural, but it's not.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.051
A whole bunch of, you know,

01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:16.438
Jamaican ackee fruit's
natural, but it's not either.

01:24:16.438 --> 01:24:17.521
It kills you.

01:24:20.418 --> 01:24:21.485
Keeping on going.

01:24:21.485 --> 01:24:23.568
"A food shall be deemed to be adulterated

01:24:23.568 --> 01:24:25.519
"if it bears or contains any poisonous

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:26.881
"or deleterious substance which may

01:24:26.881 --> 01:24:30.212
"render it injurious to health."

01:24:30.212 --> 01:24:33.632
Fructose fits that description, right?

01:24:33.632 --> 01:24:35.870
Uh-uh, but now with the prevention

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.647
of chronic diseases, even though

01:24:37.647 --> 01:24:39.017
it's own regulations explicitly

01:24:39.017 --> 01:24:40.575
postulate the connection between

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.920
such products and such diseases.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.175
In other words, the FDA will only regulate

01:24:45.175 --> 01:24:48.792
acute toxins, not a chronic toxin.

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.652
Fructose is a chronic toxin.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.232
Acute fructose exposure
did nothing, remember.

01:24:53.232 --> 01:24:55.273
'Cause the brain doesn't
metabolize fructose.

01:24:55.273 --> 01:24:56.199
The liver does.

01:24:56.199 --> 01:24:59.407
And the liver doesn't get
sick after one fructose meal.

01:24:59.407 --> 01:25:02.748
It get's sick after 1000 fructose meals.

01:25:02.748 --> 01:25:05.157
But, that's how many we eat.

01:25:05.157 --> 01:25:07.747
So, the FDA isn't touching this.

01:25:07.747 --> 01:25:09.426
The USDA isn't touching this.

01:25:09.426 --> 01:25:12.424
Because if the USDA touched
this, what would that mean?

01:25:12.424 --> 01:25:14.427
That would mean an admission to the world

01:25:14.427 --> 01:25:16.677
that our food is a problem.

01:25:18.063 --> 01:25:20.001
So, what to you think that would do?

01:25:20.001 --> 01:25:22.786
There are three things in this country

01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:25.418
that we can still sell overseas.

01:25:25.418 --> 01:25:28.168
Weapons, entertainment, and food.

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:33.301
Cars? (laughs) Computers?

01:25:33.301 --> 01:25:35.384
I don't thinks so.

01:25:35.384 --> 01:25:36.906
Can anybody think of anything else

01:25:36.906 --> 01:25:39.800
that another country wants of ours?

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.008
What?

01:25:41.008 --> 01:25:43.001
Tobacco, right, tobacco. (laughs)

01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:44.484
All right, you get the picture.

01:25:44.484 --> 01:25:47.686
So, the USDA doesn't
wanna know about this.

01:25:47.686 --> 01:25:49.747
'Cause this is bad news.

01:25:49.747 --> 01:25:53.395
And so, who runs the food pyramid?

01:25:53.395 --> 01:25:54.939
The USDA.

01:25:54.939 --> 01:25:58.439
It's the fox in charge of the hen house.

01:25:58.439 --> 01:26:00.349
Because their job is to sell food.

01:26:00.349 --> 01:26:01.916
And who's eating it?

01:26:01.916 --> 01:26:02.749
We are.

01:26:04.305 --> 01:26:07.884
So, in summary, fructose, and I don't care

01:26:07.884 --> 01:26:10.058
what the vehicle is, it's irrelevant,

01:26:10.058 --> 01:26:11.338
sucrose or high fructose corn syrup,

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:13.929
I don't care, fructose
consumption's increased

01:26:13.929 --> 01:26:17.148
in the past 30 years, coinciding
with the obesity epidemic.

01:26:17.148 --> 01:26:20.025
A calorie is not a calorie.

01:26:20.025 --> 01:26:21.415
And the dietitians in the country

01:26:21.415 --> 01:26:24.982
are actually perpetrating this on us.

01:26:24.982 --> 01:26:26.921
Because the more you think
a calorie's a calorie,

01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:28.497
the more you think, well than if you

01:26:28.497 --> 01:26:30.630
ate less and exercise more, it would work.

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:32.224
It doesn't.

01:26:32.224 --> 01:26:35.058
All of the studies show it doesn't work.

01:26:35.058 --> 01:26:36.996
Here's why it doesn't work,

01:26:36.996 --> 01:26:39.426
because a calorie is not a calorie.

01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:41.791
Fructose is not glucose.

01:26:41.791 --> 01:26:43.268
We know a calorie is not a calorie.

01:26:43.268 --> 01:26:45.036
'Cause there are good fats and bad fats.

01:26:45.036 --> 01:26:47.413
There's good protein and bad protein.

01:26:47.413 --> 01:26:50.237
Okay, there's good carbohydrate
and bad carbohydrate.

01:26:50.237 --> 01:26:52.560
And glucose is good carbohydrate.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.469
Glucose is the energy of life.

01:26:54.469 --> 01:26:56.052
Fructose is poison.

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.246
You are not what you eat.

01:26:59.246 --> 01:27:01.188
You are what you do with what you eat.

01:27:01.188 --> 01:27:02.295
And what you do with fructose

01:27:02.295 --> 01:27:05.820
is particularly egregious and dangerous.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.537
Hepatic fructose metabolism leads to all

01:27:07.537 --> 01:27:09.834
the manifestations of
the metabolic syndrome.

01:27:09.834 --> 01:27:12.265
Hypertension through
that uric acid pathway,

01:27:12.265 --> 01:27:13.893
de novo lipogenesis, dyslipidemia,

01:27:13.893 --> 01:27:17.375
hepatic steatosis
through that DNL pathway,

01:27:17.375 --> 01:27:19.724
those three enzymes, the
new fat making pathway,

01:27:19.724 --> 01:27:22.780
inflammation through JNK1,
hepatic insulin resistance

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.385
because of the serine phosphorylation

01:27:24.385 --> 01:27:27.566
of IRS-1, obesity because
of the VLDL transport

01:27:27.566 --> 01:27:29.639
to the adiposite, and leptin resistance

01:27:29.639 --> 01:27:31.833
promoting continuous consumption,

01:27:31.833 --> 01:27:34.818
basically starving your brain,

01:27:34.818 --> 01:27:37.063
making you think you need more.

01:27:37.063 --> 01:27:39.899
Fructose ingestion interferes
with obesity intervention,

01:27:39.899 --> 01:27:41.493
as we showed in our clinic.

01:27:41.493 --> 01:27:43.046
The more soft drinks, the less well

01:27:43.046 --> 01:27:45.402
diet and exercise actually worked.

01:27:45.402 --> 01:27:48.340
Fructose is a chronic hepatotoxin

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.441
for the same reason that alcohol is.

01:27:50.441 --> 01:27:51.399
The only difference is alcohol is

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:55.198
metabolized by the brain,
so you get alcohol effects.

01:27:55.198 --> 01:27:57.352
Fructose is not metabolized by the brain

01:27:57.352 --> 01:27:58.591
so you don't get those effects.

01:27:58.591 --> 01:28:01.485
But everything else it does is the same.

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:04.247
But the FDA can't and won't regulate it.

01:28:04.247 --> 01:28:05.955
It's up to us.

01:28:05.955 --> 01:28:09.359
I'm standing here today to recruit you.

01:28:09.359 --> 01:28:13.350
That's a famous saying here
in San Francisco, right?

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:16.154
"I'm Harvey Milk, and
I'm here to recruit you."

01:28:16.154 --> 01:28:18.514
I'm Robert Lustig, and
I'm here to recruit you

01:28:18.514 --> 01:28:20.847
in the war against bad food.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:24.620
And this is what's bad.

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.047
With that, I wanna thank my colleagues

01:28:27.047 --> 01:28:28.774
at the UCSF Department of Pediatrics

01:28:28.774 --> 01:28:31.732
in our Weight Assessment for
Teen and Child Health Clinic,

01:28:31.732 --> 01:28:34.413
UCSF Department of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics,

01:28:34.413 --> 01:28:36.779
and also Department of
Nutritional Sciences

01:28:36.779 --> 01:28:40.182
at UC Berkeley, in particular
Doctor Jean-Marc Schwarz,

01:28:40.182 --> 01:28:42.732
who is a card carrying
fructose biochemist,

01:28:42.732 --> 01:28:45.039
PhD biochemist, who vetted all of these

01:28:45.039 --> 01:28:47.202
pathways that I've shown you today,

01:28:47.202 --> 01:28:50.616
and looked at this and said,
"Oh my God, it is a toxin."

01:28:50.616 --> 01:28:52.754
He worked in the stuff for 15 years,

01:28:52.754 --> 01:28:56.501
and he didn't even realize it
was a toxin until he saw this.

01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:57.627
So, with that, I'll close.

01:28:57.627 --> 01:28:58.460
Thanks you.

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.775
(audience applauds)

01:29:01.775 --> 01:29:04.942
(upbeat techno music)
