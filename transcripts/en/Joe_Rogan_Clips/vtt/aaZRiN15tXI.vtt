1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.490
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>did many people have a concern that someone else is going to do what we're not</v>

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.970
willing to do first?
Yes.
Right.
They're worried.
China and Russia,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
those are the big ones.
China and Russia,
especially China.
Yeah.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.410
They're very technologically advanced.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.370
And their innovations off the chain when it comes to like walk away,

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.210
just recently surpassed apples,

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
the number to a cell phone manufacturer in the world five years ago,

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.290
they had some like a single digit share of the marketplace.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.590
Now they're number two on the planet earth.
I mean they,

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.630
they hustle and if they just decide to make super people and they,

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.200
they do it before we do.

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.410
That's what people were worried about right there where they're worried about

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.040
there's trivial things were seemingly trivial like athletics.

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510
And then there's things that are really like,
what,
who,

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.070
what's to stop people from just becoming the hulk?

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.510
What's to stop people from becoming a mortal?
What's the style?
What is,

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.360
<v 0>well,
two questions.
First is,
is um,
China is,</v>

19
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.670
I think it's a really big issue.
The 21st,
the story of the 21st century.

20
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.230
One of the biggest stories of the 21st century will be how the US China rivalry

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.060
plays out.
And the playing field will be with these revolutionary technologies.

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
And China has a national plan to lead the world and these technologies,
by 2050,

23
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:23.160
they're putting huge resources.
They have really smart people.

24
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.960
They are really focused on that.
And it's a big deal in genetic technologies.

25
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
Um,
uh,
when last year of the new book hacking dorm was already in production in

26
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.880
November when it was announced at these first genetically engineered babies had

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.590
been born in China.
And so I called the publisher and say,

28
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.160
we need to pull this back out of production because I need to reference this,

29
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.000
but it didn't require much of a chain because I had already written this is

30
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.700
happening.
We're going to see the world's first gene edited humans.

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.510
It's going to happen first in China.
And here's why.
So I just had a,
had a,

32
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:56.430
had to add a few sentences saying,
and it just happened in October of,
uh,
of 2018.

33
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:01.431
So China is on that path and we need to recognize that on one hand the United

34
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.540
States needs to be competitive.
On the other hand,

35
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:10.320
we don't want a runaway arms race of the human race.

36
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.070
And that's why we need to find this balance between national ambition,
uh,

37
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.460
and some kind of of global rules.
But it's really hard to do.

38
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.730
<v 1>Yeah.
And the other thing is that we're competing with them.
Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.510
And so if they decide to do at first were almost compelled to do it second or

40
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.250
compelled to try to keep up.
Yeah.

41
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.080
How far away do you think we are from physically manipulating living human

42
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:37.220
beings versus fetuses versus,
yeah,

43
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.540
<v 0>so physically manipulating living human beings,
we are there.
So yeah.
Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.000
So that's may often it's called gene therapy.
So for example,

45
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.590
there's a whole class of,
of treatments for,
uh,

46
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.420
for treating cancer called car t therapy.
So you have a cancer.

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.020
When you're younger,
your body is better able to fight cancers.
Um,

48
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.300
what you can do some of that cancer,
you take their cells,
you give there,

49
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.420
you manipulate their cells to give them cancer fighting superpowers.

50
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.070
And you put them back into the person's body and now the person's body behaves

51
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.620
like you're a younger person.
You have the ability to fight back.

52
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.300
So gene therapies are already happening,

53
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.990
or relatively small number of them have already been approved,

54
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.560
but there is a list of thousands of them with the regulators in applications to

55
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:23.620
regulators around the world.

56
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:28.621
So that the era of Jim making genetic changes to living humans that's already

57
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.140
here.
Like what can they do with it?
So far?
So,
so far,

58
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.280
most of it is focused on treating diseases.
Um,

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.960
but a lot more is a,
is coming because when people think about the,
the human,

60
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.870
the genome,
our genome isn't a disease genome.

61
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.450
It's not a healthcare gene and genome.
It's a human genome.

62
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.680
And so we are going to be able to do things that feel like cr crazy things like

63
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.910
changing people's eye color,
changing people's skin color to funky things.
I mean,

64
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.660
there's a lot of stuff that we're not doing now that we will be,
uh,

65
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.600
be able to do it.

66
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.010
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
