00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.740
 It may be a good feeling to lie down without bothering to do any work ... sometimes it is more than good! Whether 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.360
 This relaxation to avoid work or evade physical activity, we all passed these days. But why some 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.410
 People more lazy than others? Is there a "couch potato" gene? 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.850
 Evolution is the shape of our brain and body so that we respond positively to the stimuli of nature, such as 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 Food, sex, and even exercise. Wait - exercises ?? Yes, the fun we feel is coming a lot 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.390
 Of the dopamine system in our brain, which transmits this message through our body 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.680
 And in turn helps to ensure that our sex remains. For many, the fun resulting from 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.080
 Exercise can be as addictive as food and sex. But while we want more 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.110
 Food and sex, many struggle for physical exercise, though 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.710
 It is an important part of human vitality 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 Scientists studying mice have found an interesting gene to do with this. After dividing the mice 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.130
 For two groups - a group chose to run on the wheel more, and the group that chose to run for less - 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.170
 The difference was evident in their descendants. After 10 generations, 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.899
 The number of races that preferred jogging continued to run by 75% more than the second group 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.749
 16 generation was running 7 miles per day compared to 4 miles the rate of other rats ran 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.060
 Their motivation for physical activity seems to come from genes. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 We all inherit our genes from our parents and play an important role in the development of our brain 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.880
 These genes may make some people literally yearn for activity. In fact the brain 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.689
 Of the mice running had a larger dopamine system and areas that treated the stimulus 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.869
 And awards. They need exercise and only their brain will behave in a way similar to the symptoms of drug addiction 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.799
 Which appears in mice that have been cocaine addicts and have been deprived of cocaine. Yes they are genetically addicted to jogging 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 We also inherit genes responsible for our other traits - from impulsiveness, to procrastination 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.789
 And work ethics down to laziness. It turns out that our physical laziness has 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.889
 It is due to the gene of "couch potatoes" - or any deformation in a natural gene that regulates the level of our activity. 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.630
 This gene is responsible for the type of dopamine receptor - and without it 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.279
 You will probably prefer to sit pixels, and do less activity than these 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.139
 Who work their gene well 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:00.099
 If, in fact, your desire for activity and exercise may not be yours. But for many environmental factors 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.119
 Which means you are not doomed to lazy, but the change may be harder on some of others 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.929
 Knowledge is strong, if you think you're a lazy genie 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.670
 Stand up on the couch and fight the DNA that hinders you from activity and will reward you for that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.319

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.920
 Which may help you improve your motivation and fight laziness 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.159
 And if you want to learn more about the science of outstanding athletes 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.220
 One of our favorite books is "Jane the Sport" by David Epstein 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.480
 Which was one of our sources in this episode 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.840
