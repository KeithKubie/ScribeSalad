00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.540
The moon has a side it never shows us.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.129
Humans have flown by it to take pictures and
crashed a couple of probes into it, but we’ve

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.110
never landed a spacecraft on its surface to
get up close and personal with our satellite’s

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.210
hidden half.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.639
Until now.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.500
First though, some clarification.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.690
Sometimes this side of the moon is referred
to as “the Dark Side of the Moon.”

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.870
That’s inaccurate.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.790
The moon is tidally locked with the Earth,
meaning one side is always facing us, but

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.690
the side facing away from us still gets sunshine.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.960
So the more correct term is the far side of
the moon, and Dark Side of the Moon is just

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.970
a killer Pink Floyd album.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.860
China’s Chang’e-4 probe will be the first
spacecraft to poke and prod and study this

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.650
hidden side of the moon.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.240
But why go there at all?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.850
A big reason for this mission is, well, because
we can.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.470
As the name implies, Chang’e-4 is not the
first of its kind.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.530
The first Chang’e mission, named after the
goddess of the moon from Chinese mythology,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.360
was an orbiter that launched in late 2007,
orbiting the moon for a year and four months

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.350
before it’s planned impact in march of 2009.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.830
Chang’e-2 was built as a backup to Chang’e-1,
and launched in 2010.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.030
It orbited the moon before setting off for
the Earth and Sun’s second Lagrange point,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.310
and then continued on to fly by an asteroid
in 2012.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.970
Busy little craft.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.409
Chang’e-3 was China’s first lunar lander,
and it touched down in 2013.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.600
Along with the stationary probe was a little
rover about three quarters the mass of the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.850
Opportunity rover on Mars.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.840
The rover was named Yutu, meaning “Jade
Rabbit.”

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.510
Going back to Chinese myth, a rabbit was the
goddess Chang’e’s only company out there.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.520
Yutu set a record as the longest lived rover
on the moon.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.680
It even discovered a new type of moon rock
that helped scientists better understand the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.310
moon’s history of volcanism.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.320
Which brings us to the present day.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.250
Like Chang’e-2, Chang’e-4 was built as
a backup in case the Chang’e-3 mission failed.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.770
But it didn’t, so why not go bigger and
bolder with the spare?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.610
With an upgraded suite of instruments and
experiments, Chang’e-4’s mission became

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.869
to explore the far side of the moon.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.889
The exact destination is near the south pole
inside an enormous crater, the largest crater

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.889
on the moon in fact.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.189
The mineral composition there is different
than other parts of the moon, and may be from

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.319
the inside of the moon that were brought up
by an impact.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.529
To study their makeup.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.909
Chang’e-4 has spectrometers, along with
ground penetrating radar and cameras.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.379
The craft will also study the effects of solar
wind on the lunar surface, and it’s brought

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.790
along plant seeds and silkworm eggs to see
if they can grow in the moon’s low gravity.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.480
Finally, its place on the far side of the
moon makes for an ideal spot to test the feasibility

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.019
of radio astronomy from there, since the moon
blocks out noise and interference coming from

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.019
earth.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.099
Of course if the moon is blocking radio signals,
that makes getting data back from the lander

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.099
and driving an expensive RC moon car a little
more challenging.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.779
To solve that, the Chinese launched a satellite
in May of 2018 that is currently orbiting

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.670
Earth-Moon Lagrange point 2.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.090
With the relay in place and Chang’e-4 touching
down, we can finally learn more about the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.730
hidden side of our nearest celestial neighbor.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.010
Like science in your day?

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.680
Well you should subscribe!

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.989
And although we’re sending a rover to the
moon, we actually have a complete map of the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.989
surface.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.599
Which is a lot more than we can say about
mapping our oceans.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.349
But how close are we to a complete ocean map?

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.579
Check out our video here and make sure to
keep coming back to seeker.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.010
Thanks for watching
