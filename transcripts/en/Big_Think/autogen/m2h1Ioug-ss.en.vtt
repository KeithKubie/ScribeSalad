children and the way in which we
 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.840
children and the way in which we

comparison across with others from a
 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.529
comparison across with others from a
very very early age we have kind of

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539
very very early age we have kind of
 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.270
very very early age we have kind of
internalized a certain kind of way of

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280
internalized a certain kind of way of
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.819
internalized a certain kind of way of
being in the world and perceiving our

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829
being in the world and perceiving our
 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.109
being in the world and perceiving our
relationship with others and that

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119
relationship with others and that
 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.420
relationship with others and that
dynamic has created a certain kind of

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430
dynamic has created a certain kind of
 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.600
dynamic has created a certain kind of
you know inhibitions against our natural

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610
you know inhibitions against our natural
 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.149
you know inhibitions against our natural
compassionate instinct so and these

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
compassionate instinct so and these
 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.520
compassionate instinct so and these
inhibitions really take primarily in the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530
inhibitions really take primarily in the
 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.850
inhibitions really take primarily in the
form of fear so for example many people

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
form of fear so for example many people
 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.279
form of fear so for example many people
worry and are afraid that if they are

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289
worry and are afraid that if they are
 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.010
worry and are afraid that if they are
too kind in too compassionate that other

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
too kind in too compassionate that other
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.649
too kind in too compassionate that other
people will take advantage of them they

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659
people will take advantage of them they
 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.859
people will take advantage of them they
will see them as pushover or weak or

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869
will see them as pushover or weak or
 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.980
will see them as pushover or weak or
losers so that's one type of fear that

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
losers so that's one type of fear that
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.770
losers so that's one type of fear that
we bring another type of fear that we

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780
we bring another type of fear that we
 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.830
we bring another type of fear that we
bring is that you know because in

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840
bring is that you know because in
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.039
bring is that you know because in
popular understanding of compassion it's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049
popular understanding of compassion it's
 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.380
popular understanding of compassion it's
so dominated by compassion as an emotion

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390
so dominated by compassion as an emotion
 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.630
so dominated by compassion as an emotion
kind of a soft heart and tender heart

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640
kind of a soft heart and tender heart
 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.510
kind of a soft heart and tender heart
and so on so people worry that if they

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520
and so on so people worry that if they
 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.969
and so on so people worry that if they
allow their compassionate and kinder

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979
allow their compassionate and kinder
 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.520
allow their compassionate and kinder
instinct to become more dominant in

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530
instinct to become more dominant in
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.529
instinct to become more dominant in
their way of interacting with the world

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539
their way of interacting with the world
 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.529
their way of interacting with the world
and others you know somehow it might

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539
and others you know somehow it might
 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.260
and others you know somehow it might
undermine their more rational tougher

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270
undermine their more rational tougher
 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.389
undermine their more rational tougher
side so that they may not be able to

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399
side so that they may not be able to
 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.790
side so that they may not be able to
succeed in the life and compete that's

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
succeed in the life and compete that's
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460
succeed in the life and compete that's
another type of fear and then sometimes

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
another type of fear and then sometimes
 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.670
another type of fear and then sometimes
in intimate relations particularly you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
in intimate relations particularly you
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.160
in intimate relations particularly you
know between

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
know between
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.750
know between
parents and children on the part of the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
parents and children on the part of the
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.960
parents and children on the part of the
parents sometimes we also worry that if

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
parents sometimes we also worry that if
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.330
parents sometimes we also worry that if
we are too kind to our children you know

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
we are too kind to our children you know
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.860
we are too kind to our children you know
we might be spoiling them

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
we might be spoiling them
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.780
we might be spoiling them
you know we they might become over

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
you know we they might become over
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.210
you know we they might become over
dependent upon us and then somehow we

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
dependent upon us and then somehow we
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100
dependent upon us and then somehow we
will end up having to do everything for

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
will end up having to do everything for
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.040
will end up having to do everything for
them so these are various types of fear

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
them so these are various types of fear
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.220
them so these are various types of fear
that we bring into our expression of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
that we bring into our expression of
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860
that we bring into our expression of
natural compassion of the instinct and a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
natural compassion of the instinct and a
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.440
natural compassion of the instinct and a
lot of these are subconscious biases

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
lot of these are subconscious biases
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.030
lot of these are subconscious biases
that we bring you know people may not

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
that we bring you know people may not
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.250
that we bring you know people may not
necessarily sit down and think that's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
necessarily sit down and think that's
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.140
necessarily sit down and think that's
what I'm going to do but these are

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
what I'm going to do but these are
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.210
what I'm going to do but these are
culturally acquired sensibilities and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
culturally acquired sensibilities and
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.600
culturally acquired sensibilities and
biases which also makes us suspicious

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610
biases which also makes us suspicious
 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.640
biases which also makes us suspicious
when someone is being kind to us

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
when someone is being kind to us
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.789
when someone is being kind to us
compassionate towards us we start

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799
compassionate towards us we start
 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.199
compassionate towards us we start
wondering there must be hidden agenda

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
wondering there must be hidden agenda
 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.030
wondering there must be hidden agenda
you know that that person must want

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
you know that that person must want
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.170
you know that that person must want
something from me

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
something from me
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.039
something from me
so it's unvaried these are various forms

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049
so it's unvaried these are various forms
 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.370
so it's unvaried these are various forms
of culturally acquired fear that really

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
of culturally acquired fear that really
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.340
of culturally acquired fear that really
undermines the expression what is really

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
undermines the expression what is really
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.380
undermines the expression what is really
natural to our you know human being

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
natural to our you know human being
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.630
natural to our you know human being
