00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:09.840
- Welcome everybody.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.430
I'm Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.310
I am one of the two
science faculty advisers

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.410
for the Radcliffe program.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.520
John is the other.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
I cover the life sciences.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.700
And I'm an epidemiologist.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.760
So for me to be able to have
this day is really a thrill.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.060
It also marks the
beginning of sort

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.880
of a year of epidemiology
and epidemics

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.229
work that we're going
to be focusing on.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.120
So epidemiology
we usually define

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.360
as the study of the incidence,
prevalence, distribution,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.830
and control of disease
in a population.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.610
Now you contrast
that with medicine

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.500
which is about detection,
prevention, and cure of disease

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.490
in individuals.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.340
And so we consider
epidemiology to be

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.350
the science, the investigative
branch of population health.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.960
And when we think about various
levels of biomedical research,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.870
you think of--

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.260
generally, we talk about
three, maybe four levels.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.020
You talk about your basic
or pre-clinical science,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.390
which you think of as bench
research, usually experiments,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.927
usually with animals
or cells or cell lines.

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:26.510
Then you think about
the level that we

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
call clinical research,
which very often involves

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.940
recruiting patients to a study.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.190
That study might be
observational in nature,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.070
watching the course of disease
in a group of patients,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.810
or it might be
experimental, think

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.760
of randomized clinical trials
for drugs as clinical research.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.700
Then we get to the level
of population research,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.070
or epidemiology.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.180
And here we're usually talking
about very large collections

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.710
of data about individuals
within a population.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.780
Sometimes we go out
and collect these data

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.617
by forming what we call cohorts,
an observational cohort.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:06.200
So you may have heard of, say,
the Nurses' Health Study, which

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.130
has been following 121,000
nurses with questionnaires

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.280
every two years since 1976.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.544
Or you might be talking about
secondary data analysis.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:17.960
You might be
analyzing data that's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.600
collected for other purposes,
say vital statistics

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.740
registries.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.510
You might, for
example, go to Norway

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.310
where they've got fantastic
ability to link all the records

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.760
through sort of a citizen ID.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.620
And you might be
able to, say, link

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.370
a woman's records of her
births to the records

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.500
of her hospitalization
or even mortality

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.620
and make connections
statistically by using

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.450
these secondary data sources.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.390
And there are many different
methods of epidemiology

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.360
and you'll hear about
many of them today.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.240
One of the tricks
about epidemiology

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.330
and the fact that it's
largely observational

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.200
is that we very rarely
can perform experiments.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.900
And when you think about
what is the gold standard

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.820
of biomedical
proof, you're really

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.290
thinking about experiments or
randomized clinical trials,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.540
usually placebo
controlled, usually blinded

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.410
to the investigator
and the participant

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.170
and the clinicians involved.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.900
Epidemiology can rarely have
that kind of experiment.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.110
And so we're challenged
to take questions--

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.430
to distinguish cause
from correlation.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.900
And to give you a
really basic paradigm--

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.880
you know, if you think about--

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.080
you could do a study looking
at causes of lung cancer.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240
And you could go
out in a population

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.610
and survey them about their
cigarette smoking habits

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.550
and ask them about the matches,
whether they carry matches

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.690
or not.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.890
And if you aren't really
careful about your inference,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.280
you might conclude that carrying
matches in your pocket causes

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.110
lung cancer, right?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.480
Now, we all know
that's a correlation.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.990
Carrying matches is correlated
with smoking cigarettes, which

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.600
is the actual cause
of lung cancer.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.470
That seems so patently obvious,
painfully obvious, if you will.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.700
But in epidemiology we're often
dealing with very closely woven

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.589
together potential
causes of disease that

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.850
will also be correlated
with non-causes of disease.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.420
And our challenge as scientists
is to tease this apart.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.880
Because where we
would all like to go

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.950
is to translation where you
take the science of epidemiology

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.490
and you translate that into
effective public policy,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.850
effective new possibly
clinical protocols.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.030
But you want it to be based on
a pretty reasonable inference

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.440
of cause.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.902
And one of the reasons we chose
the four scientists you'll

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:52.610
hear about today is
because a lot of them

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.620
focus on how can we get
better at distinguishing cause

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.600
from correlation.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.016
So I think you'll be hearing
quite a bit about that today.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.220
So the four young
scientists we have here

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.440
I'm really thrilled about.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.190
And each of them will talk
for about a half an hour

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.130
and we're going to
group them into two.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.100
The first two are
going to be more,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.550
what you might be familiar with,
focused on infectious disease

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.030
epidemiology.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.940
Our roots as a field, when
you think the word epidemics,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.440
you think of
infectious disease, you

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.670
think of cholera outbreaks in
London in the 19th century.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.140
We have since evolved.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.860
And epidemics has
now writ much larger.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.740
So we have, consider, we have
epidemics of heart disease.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.370
We certainly have
epidemics of obesity.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.870
We have epidemics
of mental health.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.990
And so the second
half of the day

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.860
is focused on some of these
other noninfectious disease

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.430
epidemics, and particularly
epidemics in mental health

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.710
issues and how
they're distributed

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.830
throughout the population in
terms of health disparities.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.380
So to kick you off--
so what we'll do

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.740
is we'll have two speakers
speak back-to-back

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.379
and then we'll do 20 minutes
of questions after that.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.170
And then give you guys
break and then we'll

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.060
go to the second
half of the program.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.090
So I will introduce to you
our first two speakers.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.880
So Neal Goldstein is
an infectious disease

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.440
epidemiologist at Christiana
Health Care in Newark,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.930
Delaware, and also hold
a faculty appointment

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.910
at Drexel University.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.360
His specialty is using secondary
data sources, particularly

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.310
medical records.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.150
And his research spans
several disciplines,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.230
including vaccine preventable
diseases, sexual minority

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.170
health, pediatric infectious
disease, and women's health

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.150
around pregnancy.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.130
Most recently, he's
focused on this issue

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.210
of translational epidemiology.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.660
So how do we move from
knowledge generation

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.190
to application and advocacy.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.230
And his talk today is
going to be about infection

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.670
in hospitals, whether we can
be moving from a model that's

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.930
based on the
likelihood of disease

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.360
being a function of the
patient, the characteristics

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.300
of the patient, to really
change that and look

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.860
at functions of the system.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.070
Our second talk will
be Alana Brennan

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.560
who is an instructor in the
Department of Global Health

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.860
and in epidemiology
at Boston University.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.350
Her main focus is
to apply bio stats

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.620
and epidemiological
observation to cohorts

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.770
in sub-Saharan Africa,
particularly around HIV

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.670
and antiretroviral therapies.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.670
In particular, her work has
been related to changing South

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.370
African National
treatment guidelines,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.250
early versus deferred
pediatric anti--

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.040
it's so hard to say--
antiretroviral treatment,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.390
and as well as the economic
outcomes of patients

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.030
receiving that
kind of treatment.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.490
She also focuses on when a
clinical trial is not feasible,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.000
right?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.360
Often for logistical or
often for ethical reasons.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.579
How can we do
quasi-experiments which

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:10.370
are research designs
in which investigators

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.720
study quasi-random variation
exposures that occur naturally.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.890
And she'll talk
a bit about that.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.640
So with that introduction,
Neal and Alana, actually,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.260
why don't you both come on up.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.328
And Neal, you can take it away.

00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:26.136
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.170
- Thank you for that
very nice introduction.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.570
It's really an honor
to be here today.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.770
So I want to--

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.809
before I get into
the talk itself,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.909
I just want to give a
little bit of background

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.169
as to why I chose
this particular area.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.450
As was stated, I did my
training in infectious disease

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.980
epidemiology.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.460
And when I got to doing my
post-doc at this hospital,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.995
it was a community hospital.

00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:55.620
It's a large community hospital,
but it still very much focused

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.150
on patient care.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.100
So the research that
was ongoing there

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.430
was all about what are the
characteristics of the patients

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.850
and what leads them to become
infected with some disease.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.090
So I wanted to bring more
of my traditional training

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.120
as an infectious
disease epidemiologist

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.370
into the hospital environment.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.980
And specifically, I worked in
the neonatal intensive care

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.730
unit.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.200
So I'm going to
tell you everything

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.720
I know about neonatology.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.100
It's only in two slides, though.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.450
And to start we need to focus
on why do the patients get sick

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.280
in the environment.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.650
Well, one way is we can just
look at the characteristics

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.920
during pregnancy.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.420
So did the mother have some
kind of markers of inflammation

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.090
like chorioamnionitis?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.120
Was she group b strep carrier?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.640
And then these can lead
to vertical transmission,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.772
so from mom to the baby.

00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:51.480
There's also, though,
the characteristics

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.910
of the babies themselves,
in that maybe they

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.734
were born pre-term.

00:09:55.734 --> 00:09:57.150
So this would mean
they would have

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.090
an underdeveloped immune system,
underdeveloped skin system.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.150
So these are what I would
call these intrinsic factors.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.420
And these are
definitely correlates

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.060
of infection, in that
if you are pre-term,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.700
if you had a mom
that had chorio you

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.709
are likely to become
colonized and infected.

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:17.250
So the questions I
wanted to ask were

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.550
all about what are other factors
that can lead to infections.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.160
So you can-- certainly, it can
be caused by your care team,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.940
your health care workers.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.330
If they are colonized or
infected with some organism,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.424
they can very easily
pass it to you.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.840
It also may be a
function, though,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.390
of the environment
itself, or even

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.870
what we call fomites, which are
just kind of inanimate objects

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.540
that harbor organisms so this
could be a medical device

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.590
or it could even be as
simple as your cell phone.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.420
So when you deal
with when you go

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.630
through an epidemiology
program, especially when you're

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.910
in a communicable
disease mode, you

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.240
will talk about this notion
of the epidemiologic triad.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.780
The idea is that if you can
block one of these pathways,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.260
you can potentially stop
transmission of some organism.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.100
So it's funny that cholera
was mentioned already,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.470
because I'm going to use
cholera as the example here.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.900
The host would be
people, it would be us.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.390
The agent would be
the cholera bacteria.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.910
And then the environment could
be where the cholera resides.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.870
So the idea is that if we
can block these pathways,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.420
we can stop cholera
transmission.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.770
For example, between the cholera
bacteria itself and the host

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.160
you can make the host immune by,
say, giving them vaccinations.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.200
You've blocked that
pathway you can also

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.810
block the pathway between the
agent and the environment,

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.330
say, by coordinating
the water supply.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.930
And lastly, you can block
the environment host

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.170
pathway by, say, making
sure that people have access

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.091
to clean, potable water.

00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:51.340
So we're blocking these
pathways and we're potentially

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.120
stopping cholera from
infecting the host.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.380
There's also this notion of a
vector that kind of operates in

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.580
between these three areas.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.080
The easiest example of that
would be Zika virus or malaria.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.721
The vector in this
case is a mosquito.

00:12:06.721 --> 00:12:08.470
And that it functions,
it operates kind of

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.810
between all these pathways here.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.804
So as we then switch
from this classical,

00:12:13.804 --> 00:12:15.220
you know, you're
in school, you're

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.590
getting trained in
epidemiology to now

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.180
how can we apply
this at the hospital,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.060
we can start substituting
things on here.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.870
So the host where I worked
it became the neonate.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.990
The agent that I'll
talk about are really

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.050
health-- mainly associated
with health care acquired

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.720
infections.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.400
So I'm going to talk about
methicillin-resistant staph

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.680
aureus, M-R-S-A or MRSA.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.500
Going to talk about
something called

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.400
sepsis, which is a
bacteria in the blood.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.124
We'll talk about a
variety of organisms

00:12:47.124 --> 00:12:48.040
that can lead to that.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.380
But I'm also going to
talk about colonization

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.100
of a few other organisms,
pseudomonas and klebsiella.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.600
So those are our pathogens.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.320
The environment now becomes the
neonatal intensive care unit.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.900
The intermediary or the
vector is the health care

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.240
worker or visitor in that they
are within this environment

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.120
and they will interact
with the babies

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.710
as well as potentially
the pathogenic organisms.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.990
Three research
questions that we were

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.350
looking at for this
particular group of analyzes.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.027
The first is looking outside of
what are the intrinsic factors,

00:13:23.027 --> 00:13:24.860
so what are the
characteristics of the baby,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.500
we wanted to start incorporating
these extrinsic factors.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.440
Like, how does occupancy
lead to a greater

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.350
risk for becoming septic?

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.610
And I'll get into what
that means in a few slides.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.880
But also, how does the
patient care network

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.030
or who the providers
are interacting with,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.450
how does that influence
possible spread of MRSA.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.970
And lastly, if we
can identify maybe

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.890
some of these
other factors, what

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.840
is it about the
environment itself,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.450
what is it about the
NICU, the bed space,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.790
the location of
the patient, that

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.320
may have some correlation to
becoming colonised or infected.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.980
And I just want to--

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.040
I have one slide here that's
kind of my methods-y slide.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.280
Because I want to just give
you a sense for how we're

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.530
able to do this type of study.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.690
It's not as if we
are prospectively

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.040
recruiting parents to recruit
their children into this study.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.380
These data already
exist, which is really--

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.940
that's kind of one
of my wheelhouses

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.820
is I like doing secondary
analysis of data

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.100
that's already in the
electronic medical record.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.870
I feel like we have
so much information

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.610
that already exists
that was delivered

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.330
during routine patient care, we
can mine that and then ask some

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.290
of these interesting questions.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.990
So what we have in the
electronic medical record,

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.670
it can be thought of as a
cohort of neonates in that they

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.670
are admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.820
and while they're in the NICU
we know what happens to them.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.480
We can follow them through
time and see did they

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.700
develop one of these
outcomes of interest

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.740
or did they have some other--

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.150
did they not have the outcome.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.754
And that would be were they
discharged from the unit,

00:14:59.754 --> 00:15:01.170
were they transfer
somewhere else,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.550
or did they expire while
they were in the unit.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.440
So these three research
questions, now, we'll

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.820
go through them one at a time.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.910
I'm putting the epidemiologic
triad back up here on the slide

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.690
so you can get a sense for
which are the pathways--

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.520
and I'm not sure if
it shows up that well,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.440
but they're highlighted in red.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.500
So the intrinsic factors that
we would traditionally focus on

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500
are really what's happening
between the pathogen

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.490
and the neonate.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.580
But this talk is all about
these extrinsic factors.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.410
So that's these other
pathways that we're

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.090
beginning to look at.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.070
So the first question
that we're tackling

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.650
is this notion of occupancy.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.630
And the reason that
this question came about

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.990
is because it's
almost in some way

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.100
an easy way to explain if
there's an outbreak of, say,

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.930
MRSA in the unit we
could just be like,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.590
oh, it was really
crowded at that time.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.130
You know, maybe that's
why there's some breakdown

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.030
in hygiene going on.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.750
Maybe that's what's
going on here.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.280
So we wanted to say, all
right, is it really related

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.170
to occupancy and what
does one actually

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.850
mean by occupancy,
because it can be

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.140
defined a whole host of ways.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.500
For example, it could
just be the number

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.840
of babies in the
unit at any one time,

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.850
and this is what we
would call this census.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.520
Or could be something
to do with the demands

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.380
on the staff in the unit.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.310
And a proxy for this would be
what's the overall acuity, say,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.390
what is the proportion of
pre-term babies in the NICU

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.650
or what's the proportion
of very low birth weight

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.120
babies in NICU.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.730
Or it could be a function of,
say, just staffing levels.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.670
What's the nurse
to patient ratio.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.500
And one thing I want
to emphasize with this

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.980
is that it's not
occupancy itself

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.070
that leads to these outcomes
of being infected or colonized,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.480
it's this notion of being
a proxy for something else.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.890
Because maybe it's a breakdown
in sterile technique to access

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.890
lines that's happening
as a result of increased

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.230
demands on the unit.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.410
Well, getting right into
the results for this one.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.810
We looked at two measures, here.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.560
We looked at the notion
of just the number

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.369
of occupied beds or the census,
we looked at the acuity.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.970
And what we saw was that
there was a modest risk

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.410
increase in late onset
sepsis that was statistically

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.619
associated with acuity,
not so much for census.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.400
And although this is,
again, a very modest effect,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.170
the way that I initially
did this analysis

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.890
was it's kind of like for
each percentage point increase

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.390
in acuity in the unit--

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.100
so what I would
stress for this one is

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.130
that if we're looking at,
say, the proportion of very

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.830
low birth weight babies and
we were comparing a unit that

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.620
had like 10% very low birth
weight babies to a unit

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.830
that had 40% very low birth
weight babies, now all

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.680
of a sudden we're talking about
a 60% association of late onset

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.180
sepsis.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.130
So it becomes a little bit
more important of a predictor.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.410
Conclusions from this question--

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.710
we saw that in times
of high unit acuity,

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.610
we may need some additional
infection control precautions.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.470
As well as if you're
doing this type of work

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.886
where you're looking at health
care associated infections,

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:10.590
it's probably a good idea to
have some measure of occupancy

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.870
in your analysis.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.850
All right, so switching
to what I think

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.590
are the more
interesting ones, here.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.060
The second research
question is how

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.090
does the patient care
network of a NICU influence

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.320
transmission of a MRSA.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.610
Again, the triad's up there.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.010
You can see highlighted
in red which

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.210
pathways we're operating on.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.310
And the outcome I'm interested
for this study is MRSA.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.210
And MRSA is a not uncommon
health care associated

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.700
infection and the
consequences are particularly

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.270
dire in neonates
because about a third

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.000
of the ones that become
colonized with MRSA

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.590
will go on to develop
invasive infection.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.050
So it's important
pathogen for us

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.880
to target in the
hospital environment.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.400
And what we know is that about
20% to 40% of a patient's flora

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.410
are the result of
cross-contamination

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.980
via the health worker.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.130
They're this vector,
they're this intermediary

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.860
that's going between patients.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.680
And one of the main correlates
of this transmission

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.420
is proper hand hygiene.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.700
In fact, hand
hygiene is in itself

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.100
composed of a couple
of different things.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.480
There could be the
notion of compliance.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.470
So that just how
many of your staff

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.650
are doing hand hygiene, whether
it's the gel hand sanitizer,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.810
whether it's using sinks.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.900
But then you also have this idea
that you could be compliant,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.500
but are you doing it correctly.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.260
And that's this
notion of efficacy.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.680
Because it's comprised
of these two things

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.250
I don't think you could
ever get 100% effectiveness.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.910
Because even if everyone
in your unit is doing it,

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.310
we don't know that they
are doing it correctly.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.450
So to do this kind
of work we wanted

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.860
to know how's the notion of
which providers that interact

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.710
with a baby connect
infants together

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.080
and then how could
this, perhaps,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.549
influence the spread of MRSA.

00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:10.090
So we needed to ascertain what
I was calling the patient care

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.960
network.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.250
The idea is that I can go into
the electronic health record

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.990
and I can see which providers
interacted with which babies.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.350
And then I can begin to link
providers and babies together

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.444
by saying they took
care of this baby

00:20:25.444 --> 00:20:26.860
and then they went
on to take care

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.510
of this baby and this baby.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.730
So you can develop these
grafts and we'll see one

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.590
in a few minutes.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.547
But you have this
network that forms.

00:20:36.547 --> 00:20:39.130
And it's akin to something you
may have heard something called

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.230
a social network
analysis and it's

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.000
all about your
social networks are

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.690
and how that can spread ideas.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.820
It's a similar
sort of idea, here.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.130
To give you a sense,
though, for what

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.710
the type of interactions
we're looking at in the health

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.250
record, as you can imagine, when
you're in an ICU environment,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.200
that's the most
intensive care that you

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.820
would have in the hospital.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.740
So there's all sorts
of interactions

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.090
that are happening.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.950
Some of those
interactions are kind of

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.320
meaningless for our work
here in that they're just

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.370
patient documentation
sort of things,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.960
those really don't contain any
risk of spreading a disease.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.180
Other ones, though,
they are more meaningful

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.860
in that they have the
propensity to spread MRSA here.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.860
So we ranked the ones
in the medical record

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.960
and I thought that
it would really

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.440
be the more invasive
procedures are the ones that we

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.100
would see here.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.070
It would be the chest tube
placement, central line,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.010
that kind of stuff.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.100
But in fact, the
majority of interactions

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.980
that we see in our NICU are
just really routine things

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.490
like taking vital signs, since
this is a population of babies,

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.200
doing like a stool assessment.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.210
Nevertheless, this
still has a propensity

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:51.050
to spread an organism
from one baby to another.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.310
And so this picture up here
that looks like a bird's nest,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.790
this is actually our
NICU on a given day.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.710
So what you have is
each red dot is a baby.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.190
And then the black lines are
connections between babies

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.520
by health care
providers in common.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.260
When I first saw
this, you know, it

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.590
suggests that, man, there
really is a lot going

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.600
on a given day in the unit.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.470
But each one of these lines is
a potential for hand hygiene

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.200
to break down, whether
it's not being compliant

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.290
or it's not efficacious because
it wasn't done correctly.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.890
So we conducted this
simulation study here

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.660
to model what this NICU network
looks like over a typical nine

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.600
day admission.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.890
That that's the median
length of stay in our NICU.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.160
So I'm going to switch over,
see if I can play a video.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.630
All right, so what
we're looking at here

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.740
is each dot represents
a baby in the NICU.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.770
The blue dots are babies
that are susceptible to MRSA

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.250
colonization, the red dots
are babies that are already

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.860
colonized with MRSA.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.800
The lines that you're seeing
drawing and as they update,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.160
these are interactions
that providers are having

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.260
that link babies together.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.620
It's updated every hour.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.230
So the idea is that you have
these one hour care bundles.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.710
I look at everything that's
happened with a given

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.750
provider for one hour
and all the babies

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.800
they've interacted with.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.480
And then I begin to connect
these babies together.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.780
So now we can do
this simulation model

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.080
where we follow over
time these interactions.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.990
And what I do here
is I allow for there

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.900
to be the possibility
of MRSA transmission

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.260
that's considered on, say,
hand hygiene effectiveness

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.360
or some characteristic
of the baby.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.030
I don't know if you noticed,
but we started with two red dots

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.760
up there.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.420
That meant there were two
MRSA-colonized babies.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.570
And here we are 80 hours
or so into this NICU

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:56.390
and we're already at four
colonized babies here.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.140
So if I let this go
through the whole way,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.140
you end up with about five
MRSA-colonized infants.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.740
So it clearly demonstrates that
there is a lot of opportunity

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.000
for MRSA transmission to occur.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.510
So this suggests to us that
there's a lot of opportunities

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.090
for MRSA transmission to occur.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.530
And now that we've had the
environment constructed

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.420
where we can
mathematically model it,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.510
we can begin asking questions
such as when we vary

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.700
the amount of MRSA that's in
the unit at any given time,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.520
how does that affect
the spread of it,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.500
we can vary the hand
hygiene compliance,

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.490
we can very care
attributes of the baby.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.550
So we know that infants that are
born pre-term or infants whose

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.000
trachea is intubated
require additional care.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.100
And on the basis
of this, we came up

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.950
with these graphs
here the y-axis

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.230
we're looking at
the post-simulation,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.650
so that means after nine
days in our simulated NICU,

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.980
we're looking at the prevalence
of MRSA colonization.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.480
And then the group
along the bottom,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.720
these four groups that I have
here, one two three four,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.260
this is just kind of seeding our
NICU with starting prevalence

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.460
of MRSA, so this would be one
baby out of the total amount,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.300
or about 2% of the babies
have MRSA, and so on.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.450
The gray bars then
represent the varying amount

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.730
of hand hygiene effectiveness.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.070
The two extremes, the
white bar and then

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.620
the black bar, white bar would
be no hand hygiene at all.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.850
So this is just assuming
that no one follows any hand

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.550
hygiene at all, it gives
us a usable comparison.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.700
The black bar represents 100%
where everyone's doing it

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.600
and everyone's
doing it correctly.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.870
So we acknowledge
that reality exists

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.060
somewhere in between here.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.250
When I first started
with this analysis

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.810
I had a bet going
with our ID physician.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.907
I thought there would
be a plateauing effect.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:44.490
I really thought there would be
this point of no return, where

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.350
we just didn't see
any improvement.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.240
And he said that,
no, I think you are

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.560
going to see a linear trend.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.900
You're going to keep
getting bang for the buck.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.780
I think in some way, the
jury's still out on that one.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.530
I kind of see that--

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.767
I agree with him that
there is this linear,

00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:00.600
you keep getting return
for your money here.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.550
But there does seem
to be a little bit

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.490
of plateauing that occurs, in
my opinion, towards the bottom

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.180
here.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.580
But if we focus just
on this one over here,

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.330
on the one that has 2%
starting prevalence,

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.370
I don't have the
numbers in front of me.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.150
I just wanted to talk about
the overall picture here.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.210
But the number-- after
you follow this NICU,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.500
at 2% prevalence, even
with 88% hand hygiene

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.830
effectiveness, which I think
is kind of a theoretic maximum,

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.080
that still suggests
that post simulation

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.930
you have about two, and
in fact, a little bit more

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.360
than two babies
colonized with MRSA.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.240
In my opinion, then, that really
suggests that hand hygiene

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.200
alone is not enough.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.180
There's never a
good enough level

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.940
of hand hygiene in the
hospital environment.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.870
So that's one of our conclusions
from this work is that there's

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.400
no good enough level.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.520
And the conclusion
number two in some sense

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.647
that may be a bit
obvious or intuitive.

00:26:56.647 --> 00:26:58.230
The greatest risk
of MRSA colonization

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.210
was for those who have
the most contacts.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.210
The neat thing about this
work is we're actually

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.976
able to quantify what that is.

00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:06.600
And then to point
number three on here,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.950
in times of a high number of
initially colonized babies

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.520
with MRSA, it really
warrants other interventions

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.450
in then NICU.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.420
And these would
be things like we

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.380
have isolation
rooms in our NICU,

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.330
so placing the babies
in the isolation rooms.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.240
This is also something
known as cohorting.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.420
Or when you have
multiple babies with MRSA

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.740
we like to group them together
in a certain area of the NICU.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.280
It could also just
be things like,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.920
should we consider
decolonizing them,

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.170
should we do universal gloving
in addition to hand hygiene.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.310
It's all food for thought
for our infection control

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.380
department.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.350
So the final research
question here

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:53.180
is, what are the characteristics
of the NICU itself?

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.520
We know that occupancy
seems to matter,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.370
we know that hand
hygiene is important.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.740
But what is it about the
environment of the NICU that

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.250
may lead babies to becoming
colonized and infected

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.090
with various organisms?

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.020
All right, so a brief
recap of where we've been.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.990
We saw-- and I just mentioned
this-- that acuity of the unit

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.730
seemed to be an
important predictor.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.380
The amount of care
required seemed

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.970
to be an important predictor.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.090
And that's a picture
of our NICU up there.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:23.370
So we want to know, what is
it about the NICU itself?

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.080
In fact, this is nothing new.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.060
And I'm returning to
cholera because it's

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.130
such an instructional example.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.610
How many people have
heard of John Snow?

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.159
And not the Game of
Thrones Jon Snow, but the--

00:28:39.159 --> 00:28:41.200
All right, so it's about
half, maybe a little bit

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.560
more than half.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.100
In some sense, he's
one of the originators

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.134
of this field of epidemiology.

00:28:48.134 --> 00:28:49.550
And you have to
put yourself-- now

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.260
for this picture
to make sense, you

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.160
have to put yourself back
into mid 1800s London,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.900
there's a cholera outbreak.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.990
And what John Snow did that
was so innovative at the time,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.480
and, again, may seem kind
of obvious to us today,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.110
was he just put the
cases on a map of London.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.080
And those are these
dark rectangles up

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.370
here, the black rectangles.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:14.060
So he's putting these
places on a map and notices

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.310
that they really
appear to be centered

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.180
around one of these wells
in London on Broad Street.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.000
And lo and behold, when
they turned off access,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.030
when they locked the well
so people can no longer draw

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.420
their water from it, this
particular outbreak subsided.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.510
This is what we would call
today in the field spatial

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.770
epidemiology.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.750
And also is something we
often say in the field,

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.080
in public health in
particular, that place matters.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.550
So I wanted to know, does
place matter in our NICU?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.470
We're looking at a
bunch of outcomes now,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.060
we're looking at
MRSA but we're also

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.450
looking at sepsis again,
as well as being colonized

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.270
among those babies that
are being ventilated,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.310
are they colonized
with certain organisms

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.802
that have the potential to
cause invasive infection.

00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:04.260
And we're going to consider a
few different characteristics

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.830
of our unit.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.250
Our NICU is what's known
as an open pod design.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.120
So you have these pods
and within a given pod

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.280
you can have up to three
babies, occasionally

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.200
four babies that
share this space

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.530
depending on the
demands of the baby.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.930
But some of the areas in
the NICU you can only fit--

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.660
some of the pods you can
only get a single incubator

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.094
in there, single bed.

00:30:26.094 --> 00:30:27.510
Other ones you can
get up to four.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.860
So does that seem to matter?

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.050
If you're in an area with
there only being a single bed,

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.240
are you less likely,
say, to become colonized?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.820
As well as-- we're
looking at historic data

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.980
here from our electronic
medical record.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.730
So at one point in our unit
we had a leaking ceiling tile

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.870
and it turned out that the
water supply was contaminated

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:53.040
with pseudomonas and it was
leaking near one of the pods.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.410
So we said, well, can
we use this as a marker,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.960
then, to see did more
kids that were in the pod

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.230
during this period of
time get pseudomonas.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.140
Also at one point, and this
was really bizarre to me,

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.330
but this predated when
I was at Christiana.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.725
In one of the rooms--

00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:10.710
the NICU is divided up
in these three rooms.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.940
One of the rooms had carpet.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.170
It's like, why would you
guys have carpet in an ICU?

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.660
Because you have environmental
services that comes through,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.380
right, and they're
vacuuming it and it's

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.970
kicking up all sorts of dust
and particles and organisms,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.809
as well, into the environment.

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:27.600
But we're able to look
at that back in time

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.224
and say, all right, if you were
in the room when it had carpet,

00:31:30.224 --> 00:31:33.870
did that cause an increased risk
of colonization or infection?

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.730
And, as well, we threw in a
couple of markers of fomites.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:39.750
There is equipment--
there's spaces

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.770
in the NICU where you can
fit more equipment for babies

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.940
that require more care.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.340
There's also refrigerators that
store breast milk and medicine

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.687
sprinkled throughout the unit.

00:31:51.687 --> 00:31:53.520
And one of the
neonatologists was asking me,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.560
you know, that
she thought it was

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.800
related to the refrigerators.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.790
She thought, I think
those refrigerators

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.520
have a contaminated--

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.110
some part of them
is contaminated.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.410
Can we somehow model to see
if being near a refrigerator

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.470
leads to an increased
risk for infection?

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.810
And one final thing I
wanted to consider here

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.840
is that, since we're doing
this spatial analysis,

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:24.450
say I'm in a pod and a baby in a
neighboring pod becomes septic.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.120
They have some
kind of bacteremia.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.830
Does that then
influence my risk?

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:34.020
Does proximity to other babies
influence a given baby's risk?

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.140
So to do this work
first thing we needed

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.230
was a spatial
representation of our NICU.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.350
Now it's not like if I
was doing work in Boston,

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.030
it's pretty easy to find
a map of Boston to them

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.790
plot cases of whatever.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.807
But there wasn't
this map of the NICU

00:32:52.807 --> 00:32:54.390
so we had to create
a map of the NICU.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.515
This is what it looks like.

00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:57.030
It's a u-shaped NICU.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.880
And one of the easiest
things I can do

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.177
is create what's known
as a choropleth map.

00:33:02.177 --> 00:33:03.760
And you see these
all the time, right?

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.690
If you look at like diabetes,
obesity, heart disease

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.940
in the US, you see
these colored maps.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.910
And so it's very nice to
get a quick qualitative

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.110
sense as to what's going on.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.201
So I picked one of
our outcomes here.

00:33:16.201 --> 00:33:17.700
The way that you
would read this map

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.850
is the darker the shade
of red, the more numbers

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.840
of these outcomes that occurred
within one of these pods.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.597
So I want to do--

00:33:25.597 --> 00:33:27.180
this is the point
in the talk where it

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.590
becomes a little interactive.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.880
I want to do a quick survey.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.900
There's two options here.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.510
One is that you think,
just by looking at this,

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.420
it looks like it's
just randomness.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.340
The other option
is that you think

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.530
there are patterns to
what's going on here.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:45.330
In other words, there's some
spatial correlation going on.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.220
All right, so show
of hands, then.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.800
Who thinks this is
just randomness?

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.930
This is random noise, what
we're looking at up here.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:54.430
One take?

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.054
All right, I've got
a couple of takers.

00:33:56.054 --> 00:33:57.160
Looks like two or three.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.960
And then raise your
hand if you think

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.190
that there's clear spatial--

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.790
like, there's patterns,
here, there's hot spots.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.430
So the majority think
there are patterns.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.770
I fell into the camp where
I, when I first saw this,

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.909
was like, there's clearly
patterns going on.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.098
If you look at the
bottom area here,

00:34:14.098 --> 00:34:15.889
there's definitely
something going on here.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.840
There's definitely
something going on here.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.244
So we're going to return to
that question in a minute.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.070
For this final
research question,

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:30.020
we had three sub questions
that we wanted to investigate.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.270
First, was it random
or are there patterns,

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.710
are there hot spots?

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.860
Second, what about the
environment itself?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.989
Does this explain our
infections and colonizations?

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.210
As well as does, you know, if a
neighboring baby becomes sick,

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:49.130
does that influence
my particular risk?

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:53.199
So to the first question,
was the distribution random?

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.659
We do some fancy
statistics and what

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.050
we end up with is that for
two of our outcomes, MRSA

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:03.070
and sepsis, there
were patterns to it.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.980
It wasn't just randomness.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.450
For the other two
of our outcomes,

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.330
though, it statistically
appeared to be random.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.800
So I got bad news in that the
outcome we were looking at,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.490
which was klebsiella, in fact
was statistically random.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.160
So that just goes to
show you can't always--

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.680
a qualitative
interpretation sometimes

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.920
doesn't lead you down the road
to the correct conclusion.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.510
All right, now to the
environment itself.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.930
On an earlier slide I brought
up the list of factors

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:36.680
that we looked at.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.490
So this was things like does
being in a refrigerator matter?

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:44.470
Does being in what we call
the carpeted quiet room,

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.642
did that matter?

00:35:45.642 --> 00:35:47.350
So we looked at all
these factors, right?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.120
And what we found
was that none of them

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.200
really mattered all that
much, except for pseudomonas.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.780
So now we're dealing
with being colonized

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.660
with this bacteria in
your endotracheal tube,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.440
this is among things
that were intubated.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.230
And we saw that for them,
being in an area that

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:10.990
required more medical equipment
seemed to suggest like a nearly

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.250
two-fold or two and a 1/2
forward increase odds of being

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.170
colonized with this organism.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.910
So that was of interest.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.570
And these models that
we're doing right here,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.010
they're controlled for all
of these characteristics

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.700
of the babies themselves.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.720
So we're accounting for the
fact that some of these babies

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.710
are going to have been born very
pre-term, have very low birth

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.130
weight, may have had a
central line present.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.470
As well as how long that
they're intubated for, right?

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.011
Because it stands to reason that
the longer you're intubated,

00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:43.870
the more likely your
endotracheal tube will pick up

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:47.770
some kind of bug, acknowledging
that all the tubes start out

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.050
sterile.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.660
And finally this notion of, does
a neighbor influence your risk?

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.970
Here, again, doing
some fancy statistics.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:03.520
But what we ultimately find
is that MRSA colonization

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.180
appear to be the only one where
if there was a neighbor that

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.170
was MRSA-colonized, that
I was at increased risk

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.570
for perhaps being
MRSA-colonized.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.520
When I first saw this result
I got very excited by it.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.176
But then I thought that--

00:37:18.176 --> 00:37:20.800
well, this is actually probably
just returning something that's

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.530
already existing in our unit.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.150
In that MRSA-colonized
babies are already

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.484
being placed in
the isolation rooms

00:37:27.484 --> 00:37:28.900
and they're already
being cohorted

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.570
to certain areas in the NICU,
so it's probably actually

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.710
just returning that.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.420
It's just telling me
that, yeah, there's

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.919
this spatial auto-correlation
but you're the one causing it.

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:39.580
It's not that MRSA
is more communicable

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.850
than other organisms.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.440
So something I thought was going
to be more interesting, maybe

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.300
not.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.730
We still have to talk about that
with the infection prevention

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:49.960
group.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.210
The conclusions, though,
from this final research

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.570
question here.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.890
What we saw was that the
intrinsic baby-specific

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:57.391
factors--

00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.181
so, again, these are
things like your birth

00:37:59.181 --> 00:38:01.450
weight, your gestation, did
you have a central line--

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:05.470
those appear to explain
most of the outcomes.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.650
But we still see
statistical evidence

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.500
that there's extrinsic
factors at play here.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.440
We identified maybe
a few of them.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.950
I still think there's
more to be done here,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:21.460
that there's more factors
we just haven't uncovered.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.140
Because with this
type of study, where

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.210
you're working with data
that's already existing

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.220
in the medical
record, you kind of

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.610
can only test for
what you have data on.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.980
So if we were designing a
prospective study from this,

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.290
we could really
investigate a lot more.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.940
Maybe there's other
factors out there

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.550
we just haven't uncovered.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.740
But definitely with MRSA
colonization, you know,

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.900
it warrants isolation
and cohorting given

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.530
the potential for transmission.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:51.000
When I give this
talk at our hospital

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.570
I like to conclude with, so
what should we do as the NICU?

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.350
Like, what should our
infection prevention group do?

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.720
But I'm guessing
that none of you

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.265
are with the Christiana
Care NICU and if you are,

00:39:04.265 --> 00:39:06.640
see me in advance because
that's a tremendous coincidence

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.060
that you're here right now.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.240
So I thought that
would be nice to end it

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.290
with what can we do as potential
patients in the health care

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.760
system?

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.010
Really one of the
easiest things to do

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.670
is the notion of
hand hygiene, right?

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.990
It's making sure
that your providers

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.450
have done hand hygiene when
you're seeing with them.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.024
You're not going to insult
them by they come into the room

00:39:28.024 --> 00:39:29.440
and you don't see
them scrub down,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.760
you're not going to
insult them by saying,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.050
can you please use a gel
sanitizer while you're here.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.910
As well as you should
do that yourself

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.020
when you're in a
hospital environment.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.570
They're gross places to be
because there's organisms

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:42.070
all over.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.520
No matter how vigilant
environmental services

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.890
can be in the hospital,
there's still more organisms

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.570
there than you
would just encounter

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.761
walking around elsewhere.

00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:53.260
But that's another thing that
you can do in addition to hand

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.340
hygiene, ensuring that your
staff have hand hygiene,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.680
they follow those
practices, making

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.970
sure the environment is clean.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.650
Like, you should be
able to look around

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.650
and it should be clean
where you are in there.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.570
If it's not clean,
talk to someone

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.780
to get environmental
services in there to go ahead

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.567
and clean the area.

00:40:12.567 --> 00:40:14.650
Well, there's other things
that we can do as well.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:18.700
Like ensuring that we prescribe
antibiotics correctly.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.430
Because kind of what are the
implications behind this work

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.540
is that if you are
over-prescribing an antibiotic,

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.240
you can develop what's
known as resistance to it.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.580
And particularly with
MRSA, right, that's

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.350
already resistant
to the methicillin

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.560
class of antibiotics.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.380
So we see that by
being more vigilant

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.530
with antibiotic prescribing,
you can potentially

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.770
reduce the burden
that's caused by these.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.830
So that would just
be, you know, if you

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.330
feel like you have
the cold, there's

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:47.740
no need for an
antibiotic, right?

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.210
I think most people know that.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:53.610
But if you're a senior
provider and they give you

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.840
prescription for an
antibiotic, know the reason

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.970
why they're giving
that antibiotic,

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.230
make sure that it's the
appropriate class for what

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.730
you have.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.120
These are all good
questions that they would

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.490
be happy to talk to you with.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.510
So in closing, clearly,
work of this magnitude,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.022
I couldn't do without
a whole host of people

00:41:14.022 --> 00:41:15.980
that are much smarter
than myself, many of them

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.780
are listed on this
slide over here.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.300
And I also want to acknowledge
the Society for Epidemiologic

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.070
Research because
they were kind enough

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:30.080
to select a portion of this
work for one of their awards.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.875
Thank you for listening.

00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:33.125
Here's my contact information.

00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:34.850
I'm happy to chat
about any of this

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.650
with you now or after the fact.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.638
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.600
- All right so I'm very
excited to be here today.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.350
My name, again, is
Alana Brennan and I'll

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.900
be talking about the use of
quasi-experimental designs

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.640
for evaluating HIV care and
treatment in sub-Saharan Africa

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.970
and observational work.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.800
Specifically about
two analyses I've

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.170
done over the last four years.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.050
I'll give you a brief context
of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.020
and then also South Africa.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.390
Talk about observational
versus experimental studies.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.210
And then talk about the two
specific quasi-experimental

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.120
studies that we did using
propensity score matching

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.850
and regression discontinuity
to evaluate HIV care

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.770
and treatment.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.220
And this is all
secondary data analyses.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.570
So the HIV epidemic--
many people are probably

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.460
very familiar of what's
going on worldwide--

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.500
but in case you're not, there's
roughly 37 million people

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.350
who are HIV positive worldwide.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.530
And the vast majority of them
are in sub-Saharan Africa

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.290
where there's 26 million
who are HIV positive.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.160
And just to give you an idea
of how treatment has rolled out

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.110
in this setting,
treatment wasn't

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.134
available in resource-limited
settings until about 2004.

00:42:48.134 --> 00:42:50.300
And this is based on a
directive by the World Health

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.400
Organization and
guidelines that we're

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.960
bringing antiretroviral therapy
into government sector clinics.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.841
And so in 2004 treatment
became available.

00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:02.090
And it was based on certain
eligibility and guidelines

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.220
because of resource and
financial constraints.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:09.910
Over time, in 2010, as
better drugs became available

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.800
and the eligibility
criteria changed,

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.650
more people became
eligible for treatment.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.860
2013 there was another increase
in eligibility or expansion

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.870
of eligibility criteria.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.730
And then currently we're at
what we call universal test

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.070
and treat or treat all.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.560
And that means that
anybody who is HIV positive

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.300
and comes into a
clinic, they are

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.070
eligible for treatment that day.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.830
And this, even though the
policy was started in 2015,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.470
most countries didn't
roll it out until 2016.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.270
September of this last year.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.860
And universal test
and treat is what

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:42.550
it is, as far as I understand,
what is protocol in high income

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.002
countries since roughly 2004.

00:43:46.002 --> 00:43:48.210
And then what has happened
also over this time period

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.390
is we've gone from this
huge pill burden of patients

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.030
having to take two to
three handfuls of drugs

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.780
twice a day, two,
three times a day,

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.840
to what one is a fixed
dose combination.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.640
So it's one drug, twice a day.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.870
So it's actually improved
patient care substantially.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.130
And patients are--
this is easy to do.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.440
Easier to do, to adhere to.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.009
And this graph is
just showing where

00:44:10.009 --> 00:44:12.550
we're at in different regions
throughout the world in regards

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.160
to antiretroviral therapy
coverage for those

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.510
that are eligible for HIV.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.674
And I'm just highlighting here
in the red box southern Africa

00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:21.340
and eastern Africa
regions because those

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.440
are the regions that the
data is from that I'll

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.870
talk about today.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:29.080
And if we look at--
this is 2010 to 2015.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.150
And in 2010 in the
southern African and east

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.100
African region, we
see that about 25%

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.200
of people who are
eligible for treatment

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.920
actually got treatment for HIV.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.274
We see a substantial increase
to 2015 where about 55%

00:44:42.274 --> 00:44:43.690
of the population
that is eligible

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.360
is actually accessing
antiretroviral therapy.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.540
And although there's
still a large unmet need,

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.790
this jump is massive.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.280
A massive undertaking.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.010
So although there is about
50%, roughly, at least

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.140
in eastern and southern Africa,
that are in need of treatment,

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.400
this is not a small feat
to get to this point.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.010
So briefly about
observational studies

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.150
and experimental studies.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.260
And Janet had talked about this.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.590
Most of the work that
I do, until recently,

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.800
is in the world of observational
analytical research.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.380
And so our typical
prospective cohort design

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.710
is where you have a
population of people,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.060
you choose a
subsample, you classify

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.090
them as exposed or unexposed.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.840
And then you follow
them forward over time

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.560
to assess who develops disease
or your desired outcome.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.950
And then you compare the
risk or rates in the exposed

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.580
to the unexposed to look at the
magnitude of an association.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.560
And as Janet had
mentioned, basically, we're

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.410
only looking at what we
believe to be correlations

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.590
or associations causality
is difficult to establish

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.020
when you're in
observational research.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.260
Where we can do that is in
the experimental study design,

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.160
specifically the
randomized clinical trial,

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.650
which is our gold standard.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.340
So you have your population,
your underlying population,

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.080
you choose a
subsample, and then you

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.575
randomize that sample to either
received treatment or control.

00:46:01.575 --> 00:46:03.450
And then again, follow
them forward over time

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.270
to assess your desired outcomes
and to compare the risk

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.850
or rates amongst the
treated to the control

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.710
to look at the
actual causal effect.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.520
So if you're randomisation-- the
key here is that randomisation.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.170
If you're
randomisation held, you

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.180
can actually establish causality
in a randomized clinical trial,

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.100
which is what we're
always trying to go for.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.550
So in my mentorship
for the last five years

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.920
with Professor Matthew
Fox, he's always

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.880
challenged us to
think about when

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.780
we're working
observational research,

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.900
how can we get as close
to a clinical trial

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.225
design as possible with
secondary data analyses.

00:46:39.225 --> 00:46:40.850
Because we know in
experimental studies

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.430
we can balance confounders
in measured and unmeasured

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.620
because of the
randomization, if it holds,

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.170
but that's not a luxury
in observational research.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.030
So quasi-experimental
designs, the two

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:52.280
that I'll talk about
today, can help

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.620
us, if the assumptions
are met and they're

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.500
applied appropriately and
the question is appropriate,

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:03.610
help us get closer to that
establishing causality.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.360
So the first analysis
that I'll talk about

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.720
is looking at outcomes of stable
HIV positive patients that

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.930
have been down-referred from a
doctor-managed antiretroviral

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.420
clinic to nurse-managed
primary health care clinic

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.910
for monitoring and treatment
of HIV in South Africa.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.520
And this is a
prospective cohort study

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.170
where we use propensity
score matching

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.230
to balance confounding between
exposed and the unexposed.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.810
So we're trying to
simulate clinical trial.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.369
So here we see that the context
of this is in South Africa.

00:47:32.369 --> 00:47:34.660
And South Africa, just to
give you a bit of background,

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.420
is the largest HIV
epidemic in the world.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.000
About seven million people
are HIV positive, about 50%

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.850
of those are actually
receiving care for HIV.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:49.420
So again, there's a huge unmet
need, but that 50% is not

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.960
a small feat, by any means.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.990
In the clinic that
the data is from

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.600
and where I've worked
at for about four years

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.640
a while back is
Themba Lethu Clinic,

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.240
which is associated with one of
the largest secondary hospitals

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:03.930
in Johannesburg.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.900
It's called Helen
Joseph Hospital.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.410
And it's central Jo-berg.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.160
So the population
is a lot of migrants

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.560
back and forth,
Malawi's, Zimbabwean,

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.000
but also a lot of South
African nationals.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.780
And so what was going on in
this time, roughly around 2007,

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.020
is all of the model of care for
HIV treatment in South Africa

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.300
was doctor-initiated and
then doctor-managed care.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.700
So they always
felt that HIV care

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.000
had to be managed by doctors.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.666
They were the only
ones who could do it,

00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:36.040
nurses weren't going to
be capable of doing that.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.970
But what they started to see
was this overrun clinics, right?

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.067
There were long lines,
patients were leaving,

00:48:41.067 --> 00:48:42.150
getting lost to follow up.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.000
It was just very difficult to
access care in a timely manner.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.740
So what they started to do is
de-centralize or down-refer

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.190
patients who were stable to
local primary health care

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.290
clinics that were either
within the vicinity

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:59.130
of the actual main clinic,
which is Themba Lethu,

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.200
or a primary health
care clinic that was

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.560
closer to the patient's home.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.810
And so this began in
2007 where Themba Lethu

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.510
began to down-refer their stable
patients to primary health care

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.590
clinics.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.090
In the primary
health care clinics

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:16.497
the patients are managed by
nurses, not by doctors, OK?

00:49:16.497 --> 00:49:18.830
So at the same time that this
was going on my colleagues

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.930
were competing what was
called the CIPRA trial.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.930
It was a non-inferiority
trial comparing nurse

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.410
to doctor-managed
outcomes in patients.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.900
And what they showed was
nurses can manage patients

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.490
in a clinical trial
setting and have

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.060
comparable outcomes to doctors.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.680
But what this doesn't
answer is can nurses

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.690
do this in an
observational setting

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.570
where there's not close
supervision or strict inclusion

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.586
criteria of these patients.

00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:46.835
So this is where we went to
the Themba Lethu data set.

00:49:46.835 --> 00:49:48.720
It's a massive database.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.810
It's a longitudinal
prospective cohort

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.170
and the data is collected
in a database capturing

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.020
system called Therapy Edge
which was designed specifically

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.690
for HIV care and treatment.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.250
And then at each
clinic we collect

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.580
demographic information,
clinical information, drugs,

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.110
and conditions.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.210
And currently there's
about 35,000 patients

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.080
that are on treatment
in the database.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.300
The study population
for this analysis

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.060
was patients who were
adults and initiated

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.310
onto a standard first line
regimen at Themba Lethu

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.860
Clinic after 2004.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.080
And they had to meet
these eligibility criteria

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.410
for being down-referred to a
primary health care clinic.

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.180
And so that was
stable on treatment,

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.460
they had to have no
opportunistic infections,

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.880
they had to have a higher CD4
count, be virally-suppressed.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.380
And then the
clinicians, also, there

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.700
were some subjective
measures there

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.330
of whether the clinician felt
they were good candidates

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.190
for down-referral.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:47.230
And so in this population,
we were limited once we--

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.730
the eligible patients,
rather, there

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.615
were about 5,000
eligible patients.

00:50:50.615 --> 00:50:52.490
And they were all eligible
for down-referral.

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.570
So they all met these criteria.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:59.690
But 1,579 were
actually transferred

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.310
to the primary
health care clinic.

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.740
So we'll consider them
the exposed group.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.560
And the other
remaining 3,421 were

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.000
eligible but not transferred.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.730
So we'll refer to them
as the unexposed group.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.974
And we used logistic regression
to model the propensity

00:51:15.974 --> 00:51:16.890
of receiving exposure.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.480
And I'll go through this
in a little more detail.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.260
And then we matched patients
exposed and unexposed

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.980
based on their
propensity score, OK?

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.810
So we're trying to balance
observed and unobserved

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.720
confounders between the
exposed and the unexposed.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.755
And then we conducted
a survival analysis

00:51:32.755 --> 00:51:33.755
to look at our outcomes.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:39.710
So when we're talking about
modeling a patient's propensity

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.560
score, we're looking
at their probability

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.670
of receiving exposure.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.920
And exposure in
this case is being

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.990
down-referred to the
primary health care clinics.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.760
Because remember, they're
all eligible for it.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.093
It's just those that are
down-referred are the ones that

00:51:51.093 --> 00:51:52.540
are actually exposed.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:58.120
So we modeled that based on a
set of observed confounders,

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.600
which is gender, age, CD4
count, hemoglobin, body mass

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.410
index, and other factors.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.740
And so what we have is we
have the entire population.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.250
The red circle is our
population of patients

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.040
that are down-referred to the
primary health care clinic.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.590
The blue line is those that
are not down-referred but are

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:15.760
eligible.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.680
So we modeled the probability
that the entire population

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.660
would have the exposure
of being transferred

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.550
to the primary
health care clinic.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.000
And then we matched those
with that overlap of who

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.330
had similar propensity scores.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:33.880
And then that matched sample,
that overlapped sample,

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.750
is what we use for our analysis.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.290
And I'll break that down
in a little more detail.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.290
But just a basic calculation
of a propensity score.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.630
So this is a simple
two-by-two table.

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:45.940
On the left you
have patients that

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.220
have the actual
confounder of interest.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.070
On the right you have
those that don't have it.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.950
And then we have simple
exposed and unexposed groups

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.770
within both of those strata.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.130
You can ignore disease, d
equals one, d equals zero.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:59.588
It doesn't even
matter in this case

00:52:59.588 --> 00:53:03.160
because we're just looking
at exposure and confounders.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.530
So to model someone's
propensity score,

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.560
the probability of receiving--

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.420
probability of
being exposed given

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.940
that you have a
confounder is simply

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.370
84 over the total in the strata.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:19.270
Which gives us a
probability of 0.62 or 62%.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.430
The same thing goes for
the confounder, or those

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.530
without the confounder.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.030
So if we want to model the
probability of exposure given

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.520
that you don't have
the confounder,

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.980
is simply 177, the
total exposed, divided

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.390
by the total in the strata.

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:36.460
And that gives us a probability
or propensity of 0.44, 44%.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.165
So you can think
of in our analysis

00:53:38.165 --> 00:53:41.320
we have person A who's
been down-referred,

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.350
person B who is eligible
for down-referral

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.460
but not down-referred.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.680
So we have our exposed
and our unexposed.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.290
And they both have a predicted
probability or propensity

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:53.500
of 85% of being down-referred.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.220
So they're identical on
those observe confounders,

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:00.010
in regards to how we created
our propensity score,

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.690
and their exposure just differs.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.480
So you can think of them as
essentially randomly assigned,

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.200
OK?

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.019
At least on observed
confounders.

00:54:07.019 --> 00:54:09.310
And I'll keep saying that
because we can't say anything

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.930
about unobserved.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.770
So this is the actual
data from the study.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.450
So we had 5,000 patients.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.000
On the left we had
1,579 which were

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.850
down-referred to the clinic.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.920
3,421 which were not
down-referred but eligible.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.640
So on the left is exposed,
on the right is unexposed.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.910
After getting rid of some
due to exclusion criteria,

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.750
we had a final population
of exposed of 693

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:40.280
and a final population
of unexposed of 2,968.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.990
And so we had the
propensity scores

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.010
for that entire population.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:49.970
And then we matched the 693
to the 2,968 one to three, OK?

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:55.970
So we had a final population
of 693 exposed and 2,079

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:56.700
unexposed.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.720
So that's our final
analytical population matched

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.306
under propensity to be exposed.

00:55:03.306 --> 00:55:05.180
And this table, this
first table is basically

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.975
what you would see in table
one of a clinical trial, right?

00:55:07.975 --> 00:55:09.350
What we're trying
to show here is

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.200
that we're just balanced
unobserved characteristics

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.772
between exposed and
unexposed groups.

00:55:13.772 --> 00:55:16.230
And you can't probably see it,
the numbers are quite small,

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.540
but you can trust me.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.510
It is published, so
you can actually check.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.400
So our exposed group
is down-referred

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.020
and our unexposed
is not down-referred

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.420
and all this shows is that
these characteristics,

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.367
the proportions across
both, are comparable.

00:55:29.367 --> 00:55:30.950
But there's no
significant difference.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:33.870
That the propensity
score matching did work

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.060
and it helped us balance
observed confounders

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.050
between the two groups.

00:55:39.989 --> 00:55:42.280
And so what we were able to
conclude with this analysis

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.321
that we couldn't in the
randomized clinical trial

00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:48.070
is that patients managed
by nurses compared

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:51.805
to patients managed by doctors
for HIV care and treatment

00:55:51.805 --> 00:55:54.430
can have, if not comparable,
if not better outcomes

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:55.330
in this case.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.480
Because what we showed, and I
won't go into all the results,

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.730
but what we showed was
that those patients that

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:05.440
were treated by nurses had an
80% decrease in risk of death,

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.250
70% decrease in risk of loss,
and a 40% decrease in risk

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:13.060
of viral load rebound or
failure, in this case.

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.287
So they had better outcomes.

00:56:14.287 --> 00:56:16.120
And it's important to
note that the outcomes

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.574
in these-- the events
were quite few in number

00:56:18.574 --> 00:56:19.990
because these are
stable patients.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.150
So our conclusion
is that the results

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.312
are comparable, if
not maybe better,

00:56:24.312 --> 00:56:26.020
with patients that
are managed by nurses.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:33.890
The next analysis here, and this
is from my dissertation work,

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:37.640
using a regression discontinuity
design to evaluate a policy

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.870
change for HIV in 2010.

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:43.760
This is an application
of a method

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.880
that I'll continue to use
going forward in my career.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.460
If it's appropriate, obviously.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.700
So just a little bit
more background here.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.837
As I mentioned before,
in 2004 the WHO

00:56:55.837 --> 00:56:57.920
rolled out treatment in
resource limited settings.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.020
And at that time,
first line therapy

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:04.340
was two drug classes,
and three drugs total.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.690
And you don't have to worry
about the fancy names.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.620
The drugs were two nucleoside
reverse transcriptase

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.930
inhibitors, which was
lamivudine, and then

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.640
stavudine or zidovudine.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.320
And then one
non-nucleoside reverse

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.730
transcriptase inhibitor.

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:18.830
And again, the drug
names are not important,

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:21.410
but you will hear
me say them a lot.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:24.710
So stavudine and zidovudine
are the two older drugs

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:26.960
that were of interest
in this analysis.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.930
And then in 2010, the WHO
updated their guidelines

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:33.530
when new drugs became available
in resource limited settings.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.380
So the drug tenofovir, which
has been used in the high income

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:39.110
countries since early
2000, finally made its way

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.510
to resource limited settings.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.800
It was delayed
because of the cost,

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.770
and because one of the main
side effects of tenofovir

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.960
is renal insufficiency
and potentially renal

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.680
failure, which is really
expensive, but rare.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.620
Also during that time, efficacy
trials were coming out,

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.860
and safety trials, saying that
the side effects of tenofovir

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.250
compared to these older
drugs is a better toxicity

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.170
profile and less side effects.

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:06.709
So it's a better drug, better
quality of life for patients.

00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:08.250
And then also, the
Clinton Foundation

00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:11.340
did a really good job of
getting the prices down.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.920
Even though tenofovir is
still four times the cost

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.260
of the older drugs,
it's still much cheaper

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.970
than it was back
in the mid 2000s.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.220
So what the change
in the WHO guidelines

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.930
set us up to do
here, and this is

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:28.340
more of the quintessential
quasi-experimental design,

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.150
propensity score.

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.730
There wasn't a cut off, and
there wasn't, obviously,

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.590
any randomization
outside of trying to

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.840
simulate that with
propensity score.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.700
But this is more of the
quintessential ones.

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.390
What we're doing in this case is
we're not assigning, randomly,

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.740
patients to receive a
treatment or control,

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.950
but they're randomly assigned
based on a policy change.

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.610
And I'll explain
this in more detail,

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:54.090
but as long as nothing else
is changing, the population

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:55.590
or outcomes within
that population,

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:58.170
that policy change is
essentially random.

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.900
And patients on either
side of that policy change

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.660
can be considered similar.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.878
So we can get what is
called local randomization.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.910
At that time, there was a
handful of observational work.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.130
Some of which I had
put out previously,

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.720
myself and my colleagues.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.224
That was all
prospective cohort work.

00:59:19.224 --> 00:59:20.890
And so what was coming
out was this kind

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:25.830
of mixed bag of, when comparing
the old drug to the new drug,

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:26.516
results.

00:59:26.516 --> 00:59:28.390
Some were showing a
higher risk of mortality,

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.056
some were showing a
higher risk of loss,

00:59:30.056 --> 00:59:32.440
some were showing that
they were comparable.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.450
But we know that in
observational research,

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:36.430
a lot of this is based
on the assumption

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:38.410
that when we balance
based, or adjust

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.940
for observed confounders, that
we're balanced on unobserved.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.930
And that's a strong assumption.

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.820
Also what was
happening at that time

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:53.560
is two of the studies had
included patients that

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.690
were initiated onto
the new drug prior

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:57.410
to the change in the policy.

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.560
So these patients had
contraindications,

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.680
or were sicker.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.950
So they couldn't take the
drugs that were available,

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.930
they could only
take the new drugs.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.012
This leads to what we refer to
as confounding by indication,

01:00:08.012 --> 01:00:09.970
which is going to cause
them to be at increased

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:10.890
risk of poor outcomes.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.200
Regression discontinuity is best
shown visually, at least when

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.690
I learned it, visuals helped.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:23.420
So this is a method
that's been used

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.400
in econometrics in
the educational world

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.810
since the 1960s.

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:28.580
And it's kind of
foreign to epidemiology

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.010
because I think people
get really nervous when

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.540
I don't adjust for anything.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.480
So there's been some
concern and difficulty

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.910
in getting it published,
but we'll sort that out.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:42.650
So what this is
is, in this graph

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.050
we have time on the
horizontal axis.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:48.170
And then you have what we will
refer to as the threshold,

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.920
or the cutoff.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.420
Which in this case,
this dotted line

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.140
represents the date
of policy change.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.730
And then based on where
in this analysis patients

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.920
will be assigned to
either the control group

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.870
or the experimental
group depending

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:06.420
on the date of initiation
of treatment for HIV.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.450
So if a patient
initiates treatment

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:12.170
prior to the guideline change,
they're in the control group.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.560
If they initiate treatment
after the guideline change,

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.880
they're in the
experimental group.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.032
And if there is no
effect of the exposure,

01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:21.740
no effect of that
change in the guideline

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.870
or change in treatment,
then we would expect

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:25.040
to see something like this.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.940
No discontinuity or
break at that threshold.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:35.970
But if it's the appropriate
method, what we will see

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:37.740
is this break at the
threshold, and I'll

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.948
show you this in the results.

01:01:38.948 --> 01:01:41.160
So this break at the
threshold is the actual effect

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.520
of the intervention.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.200
So as long as nothing else is
changing along this timeline,

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.860
outcomes are continuous,
patient demographics

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.050
and clinical characteristics
are the same,

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:53.940
this is essentially randomized.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.890
Right around the threshold.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:58.792
So we're getting close to
simulating a randomized trial.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.950
The data source that we
use for this analysis

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:08.400
is a huge database for
HIV care and treatment.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.760
It's the International
Epidemiological Database

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.990
for Evaluation of HIV and AIDS.

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:19.170
It's a NIH funded project where
they pool observational HIV

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:23.340
databases into regions
all over the world.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.520
The region that we used for
this was southern Africa.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.820
Specifically, we used
Zambia in South Africa.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.670
This analysis is a
prospective cohort study

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.830
where we're applying a
regression discontinuity

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:37.710
design.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.055
It's a fairly big
population, over 52,000,

01:02:41.055 --> 01:02:42.930
the majority of which
came from Zambia, where

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.080
there's over 36,000.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.210
Their HIV positive treatment
naive, non-pregnant, patients

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:52.040
were greater than
16 years of age.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.930
Then they had to
initiate treatment

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:57.320
12 months prior,
or 12 months after,

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.490
the change in the guideline.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:03.050
And that date of change
varies between South Africa

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:03.980
and Zambia.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.220
South Africa was right along
lines with the World Health

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.920
Organization recommendation,
in April 1, 2010.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.190
That's when they said change,
and South Africa did that.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:15.710
Zambia changed a lot
earlier because they

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:18.770
got a huge donation from
the pharmaceutical companies

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:21.800
to roll out tenofovir, the
new drug, at an earlier time.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.830
So that's why it's
three years earlier.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.310
But these two dates are the
thresholds, or the cutoff,

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.920
that we used in the analysis.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.180
Then, all patients had the
potential for 24 months

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.900
of follow up to get a look at
our desired outcomes, which

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.140
were death, attrition, which
is a combination of death

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.510
and loss,
immunological response,

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.670
which is based on
your CD4 change, which

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.640
measures your immune
status, virologic failure,

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.380
and this is HIV failure.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.770
So two consecutive viral
loads greater than 1,000.

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:56.630
And then single-drug
substitution, and this

01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:00.380
is an indicator of
toxicity from a drug.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:03.110
And we're only looking at
that actual substitution

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:07.340
within that one class of
stavudine, zidovudine,

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.432
and tenofovir.

01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:09.890
We're not looking
at anything else,

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:14.300
just seeing if those drugs
are being switched out.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:19.410
Coming back to this graph,
regression discontinuity

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.650
can be implemented whenever
exposure is determined

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.290
by the threshold rule.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:28.040
So now that data [? verite ?]
initiation is that threshold.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.460
And I'll refer to what's called
the assignment variable, which

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.210
is going to assign patients to
either side of that threshold.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.790
And that's the date
they initiate ART.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.820
So if a patient initiates ART
before the date of guideline

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.700
change, they are
considered in the old drug

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.920
era for the control group.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.850
If a patient initiates
after the guideline change,

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:52.250
they're in the new
drug era of tenofovir.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:55.850
And then, again, as long as
there is no change in outcomes,

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.950
the patient population
is consistent over time,

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.610
we can assume that
those patients that

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:03.890
are just above and
below the threshold

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:06.990
are essentially randomized.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.520
And we call it
local randomization

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.215
because you can only say
that right around that line.

01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:12.840
The further you go
away from that line,

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.910
the assumption doesn't hold.

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.050
And so they're
essentially random,

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.320
or balanced unobserved
and unobserved factors,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.736
and the only difference should
be the treatments that they

01:05:22.736 --> 01:05:23.985
receive, is that exposure.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.109
I'm going to go
through this quickly,

01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:31.400
if you're interested in the
linear regression equation.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.170
It's a simple linear
regression equation.

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:35.150
We have a constant.

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:36.830
We have time and
then interaction

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.450
with the actual treatment.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:41.060
We have an exposure indicator.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.620
And then we have this beta2.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.420
Within a randomized
clinical trial,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.580
you're estimating what
we refer to as the intent

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.420
to treat effect.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.350
So you're analyzing
it based on what

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:54.930
people were assigned to receive
for treatment or placebo.

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:57.555
So this beta2 is what
we're interested in.

01:05:57.555 --> 01:05:59.180
We're not controlling
for anything else

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.350
or any other factors
because we're

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.870
assuming that they're balanced.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:05.220
And there's ways to check that.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.310
There is one main threat
to regression discontinuity

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.830
in regards to the
validity of it,

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:13.710
and that is manipulation
of the assignment variable,

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:17.260
so that data [? verite ?]
initiation by the individual.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.760
And you can think of potentially
two different scenarios, which

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.460
I think are highly unlikely,
but you could see happening.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.750
Where a patient knows that
there is a new drug coming out

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.480
after a certain date,
and so they hold off

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.030
on going into the clinic to
initiate care until that drug

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.522
is available.

01:06:34.522 --> 01:06:35.480
That's highly unlikely.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.970
Patients aren't really
in tune to what's

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:40.670
going on at a national level
and what the policies are.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.590
So that's most likely unlikely.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.500
You could also see a scenario
where a clinician could delay

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.420
treatment because they
know this new drug is

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.710
going to be available.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:49.850
But that's unethical.

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:52.910
These patients are coming into
the treatment extremely sick,

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:54.600
their CD4 count
is very, very low.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.360
So to send them away
without drugs is unethical.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.200
So that could be occurring,
but we don't believe it is,

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.940
and there's ways
to test for that.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.634
We can test for that by looking
at if our observed confounders

01:07:06.634 --> 01:07:08.550
are balanced on either
side of the thresholds.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:11.510
So is our patient
population consistent?

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.314
And then we can also see if
there's that manipulation,

01:07:14.314 --> 01:07:16.730
if people are delaying treatment
until after the guideline

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:19.070
change, by just
basically graphing

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.830
the numbers of initiates
bend in weekly intervals

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:23.450
in our time period
to see if there's

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:25.520
any, what we refer
to as bunching,

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.010
on the right side
of the threshold.

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:30.620
So the results.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.830
This is basically a table 1 in
a randomized clinical trial.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:36.860
And all it's showing you is
we have South Africa here,

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.960
we have Zambia here.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.692
We have our observed
confounders here,

01:07:40.692 --> 01:07:42.650
which the only things we
could actually measure

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:45.590
were age, gender, CD4 count,
weight and hemoglobin.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.840
These are all clinical and
demographic characteristics

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.520
of patients.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.510
What we saw, there was
no significant difference

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.520
between our exposed and
our unexposed group,

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.460
or a treatment and control on
either side of the threshold.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.310
On either side of that
line, they were similar

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.870
in South Africa and in Zambia.

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:08.047
And that's all that's showing.

01:08:08.047 --> 01:08:10.630
To see if there was any of that
manipulation of the assignment

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.296
variable, people were
delaying treatment

01:08:12.296 --> 01:08:14.704
until after the guidelines
actually happened,

01:08:14.704 --> 01:08:16.120
this is just the
graph where we're

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.420
looking at the number
of patients initiating.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.100
So we have the red
line-- and this

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.319
is for the other graphs
I'll show you-- is always

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:27.040
the threshold or the cutoff
in Zambia and in South Africa.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.080
And then patients,
again, are initiated

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.630
on either side of this threshold
and either on the control

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:34.240
group, or the treatment group.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.750
Then we have just number
of initiates on the y-axis.

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:40.240
Then time on the x-axis,
so 12 months on this side,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.399
and 12 months on this side.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:44.950
These black arrows
represent seasonal trends

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:46.779
in South Africa, so
we expect to see dips

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:50.350
in patients, the numbers
initiating treatment.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.979
What we're looking at here
is, if those patients who

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:57.640
could have initiated over here
were delaying for some reason,

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.430
we would expect to see this
huge increase in patient numbers

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.214
on the right side
of that red line,

01:09:02.214 --> 01:09:04.630
because they were manipulating
the date that they actually

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.131
initiated treatment.

01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:06.880
We don't see that.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.850
We see a slight dip in
South Africa and in Zambia,

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:12.020
but then the numbers
basically increase

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:15.399
to the numbers that were
previously there, or previously

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:16.391
being initiated.

01:09:16.391 --> 01:09:18.640
So we don't feel like there's
evidence of manipulation

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.040
of the assignment variable.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.819
This figure is just showing
the actual probability

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:26.660
of tenofovir.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.729
So again, to orient
you, red line

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.359
is the date of the
guideline change,

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:33.200
and then control or
treatment on either side.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.180
And this is just the
proportion of patients

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.629
that are initiating tenofovir.

01:09:36.629 --> 01:09:39.170
This is the reason that we felt
like regression discontinuity

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:42.700
was a good design option,
because you can see right

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:46.250
at this threshold, the
exposure substantially

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.720
increases in South Africa.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.040
We go 81%, a risk
difference of 81%.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.300
And a risk difference
of 41% in Zambia.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.270
And remember, they delayed,
and it wasn't nationally done,

01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:00.710
so Zambia didn't have
as stark of a contrast.

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:01.377
So that's great.

01:10:01.377 --> 01:10:03.626
That's where we're like, OK,
regression discontinuity.

01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:05.410
There is a discontinuity
in our exposure

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:11.290
at that policy change, which we
were very excited about that.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.790
This was the only
outcome that there

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.145
was a significant difference.

01:10:14.145 --> 01:10:15.520
The orientation's
the same, we're

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.920
looking at the proportion
of single-drug substitution

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.150
on the y-axis,
and time on the x.

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.780
South Africa and Zambia.

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.280
And single-drug
substitution is just

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.560
that indicator of toxicity.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.220
So we see a significant
decrease in toxicity, a risk

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.350
difference of negative 15.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.780
And then a risk difference
of a decrease of negative two

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.280
in Zambia.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.870
So not as large, but still
a significant decrease.

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:41.410
And this was expected
since tenofovir

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:43.000
has a better side
effect and toxicity

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.345
profile from the other drugs.

01:10:46.345 --> 01:10:48.720
Then these other graphs, this
is just South Africa alone.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.499
These are the other outcomes.

01:10:50.499 --> 01:10:52.790
And remember how I said if
we had expected that there'd

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.840
be no effective
exposure on the outcome,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.180
we would just see a flat line.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:01.890
There was really no effect on
any of these other outcomes.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:04.282
We have death, attrition,
mean CD4 count,

01:11:04.282 --> 01:11:05.240
and viral load failure.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.080
So there really was
not a difference.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.150
The exposure did not
affect the outcome.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:10.390
Which should be.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:11.880
These drugs are
comparable, they're

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.070
effective at treating
HIV if they're taken.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:17.160
Then this is just Zambia.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.530
And we see again, we didn't
look at viral load failure,

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.550
but you see death, loss,
and then CD4 count.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:23.910
They're flat.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:27.960
So the policy change, or
that exposure to tenofovir,

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.580
didn't have a
significant increase

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.850
or decrease in the
outcomes in this case.

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:39.230
In summary, the study
allowed us to say

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:42.339
that starting patients on
tenofovir standard of care

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:43.880
reduced single-drug
substitutions, so

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.530
reduced toxicity.

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.960
But there were no changes
in other observed outcomes,

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.800
in this case.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.430
Strengths were huge
sample size, you'd

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.430
be hard-pressed to get
this in a clinical trial.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:55.600
It'd be very expensive
and you would

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.970
spend your whole entire life,
and your children's life,

01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:58.761
trying to get that.

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:04.056
If the assumptions are met
in a regression discontinuity

01:12:04.056 --> 01:12:05.930
design, it's less
vulnerable to major threats

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.050
to validity, like a lot
of observational research

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:10.970
that we do is, because
of the assumptions.

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.360
We can check those
threats to validity

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.480
by looking at if our observed
confounders are balanced,

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.510
or if there's any manipulation
of the assignment variable.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:22.240
And we saw that there was none.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.240
Hopefully what I've shown
you by these two examples

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.390
is that, as we move
from these descriptive

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.660
studies in observational
world into analytical, down

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.150
towards the randomized clinical
trial, our gold standard,

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.550
quasi experimental designs can
help us, if applied properly

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:42.400
and the assumptions are met,
to get a little bit closer

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.086
to that establishing causality.

01:12:44.086 --> 01:12:45.460
So instead of
correlation, we can

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:48.790
say that an exposure actually
causes the outcome that

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.496
were of interest.

01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:52.474
Thank you.

01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:58.831
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.298
- That was absolutely
fascinating.

01:13:00.298 --> 01:13:01.390
Thank you.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:07.615
And now we have 15 or 20
minutes for your questions.

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:09.490
And while you are thinking
of your questions,

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:11.440
maybe I'll ask one
or two of mine.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:18.580
Neal, I was struck
by the slide up there

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:23.890
that showed the proportion
of patient contacts

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:26.920
by what the procedure was.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.460
Checking vital signs was right
there at the top, like 36%,

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.850
38%, something like that.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:38.900
As you think about the
propensity for those contacts

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.640
in that network to
cause infection,

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.960
do you think about changing the
frequency of those procedures?

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.240
Is there any talk
about, maybe you

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.480
don't need to take vital
signs quite as often?

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.510
I'm sort of wondering how you
think about the procedures

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:57.920
in that mix.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.550
- So the procedures
themselves, we actually

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.070
ranked the procedures
based on propensity

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:05.460
to spread in organisms.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.420
So something like
vital signs, it

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.990
was like the lowest threshold
that's possible that we thought

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.766
could actually spread MRSA.

01:14:13.766 --> 01:14:15.140
But some of the
other procedures,

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.110
like the stool description and
testing procedure that I think

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.690
was the second or third
most common, yeah.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.910
I think that does warrant
reviewing that policy

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:26.330
to say, why are we
doing this so much?

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.860
Unless there's a good
reason for doing it,

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:32.840
this is a clear opportunity
for MRSA transmission to occur.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.140
Even though it's done
under non-sterile gloving,

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.040
there still is the potential
for something to happen.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:43.920
These are the kinds of
conversations that, this works,

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.600
spawned with our infection
control group at the hospital.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.990
And actually, I
hadn't particularly

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:53.409
thought of that, so I want
to go back right now and--

01:14:53.409 --> 01:14:54.200
- Excellent, great.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.720
- --say, how often are we
actually doing these things?

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.070
And do we need to
do them as often?

01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.695
- Yeah.

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:03.590
A really, really
interesting analysis.

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:09.840
Thinking also about acuity, and
the increased risk of acuity,

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.310
which is that mix of severity
of the cases in your NICU.

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:16.310
Is that an individual
characteristic,

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:19.814
or is that also as a
proportion of your population.

01:15:19.814 --> 01:15:21.980
It's sort of interesting
to think about the tension.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.780
Like when the acuity
is high, is it

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.700
the highly acute
cases who get sick,

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.070
or is it everybody's
risk that increases?

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.290
- Yes it's both.

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.860
It's both.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.080
It's the highly acute
patients because they

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.282
are at the greater risk.

01:15:34.282 --> 01:15:36.365
They're having more done
to them and they're sick,

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.080
or they may have a less of
a developed immune system

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.220
and skin system.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.720
But then it's that
breakdown that

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.840
happens overall, especially
if there's a code in the unit.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.130
If there's a code in the
unit, then all the demands

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:53.066
get focused right away on
that very critical infant.

01:15:53.066 --> 01:15:54.440
And then you have
to think about,

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.510
as the groups
disperse from the code

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.180
to go back to caring with
the other, at that moment,

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.710
they are most vulnerable
to spreading something

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:04.310
if that particular
patient happened

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.346
to have been
colonized or infected.

01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:08.690
- Really Interesting.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:13.100
So Alana, I think the
regression discontinuity

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.480
is really interesting.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.690
And I'm thinking of
other opportunities

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:22.200
for doing that, and also
thinking about sometimes

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.770
we get natural experiments
or disasters that

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:29.970
afford the same kind of
opportunity or threshold

01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:31.970
as a policy change.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:34.680
We once did a
study where we were

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.810
looking at the risk of preterm
delivery in a pregnancy cohort

01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:42.390
that we had going
on here in Boston.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:46.680
And we were interested in
the role of acute stressors.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.060
And September 11 happened right
in the middle of that cohort,

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:55.019
so we were able to look
on either side of it.

01:16:55.019 --> 01:16:57.060
But one of the things I
remember we wrestled with

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:02.670
is how much time is
eligible before the event,

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:04.000
and then after the event.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.330
And does that need to
be comparable length,

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:10.461
and how do you define
that against the risk of--

01:17:10.461 --> 01:17:11.960
the risk to these
things, of course,

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.440
is there's perhaps a
secular change going on

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.880
in the background.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.680
I wondered if you'd
talk about that.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.870
- So in this
analysis, you can have

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:24.840
a window around the
threshold if you want.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.582
Something like, I
mean there's obviously

01:17:26.582 --> 01:17:28.040
a date with September
11, but there

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.600
could be some
window around that,

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.960
where it could help you kind
of tease out the discontinuity

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.872
more clearly.

01:17:33.872 --> 01:17:34.580
But you're right.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:37.940
With something like a natural
disaster or a terrorist attack,

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.630
there are other
underlying factors

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:43.100
that may not be consistent.

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.310
Where that local randomization
or continuous outcomes

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:50.940
assumptions that
you have to make

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:54.480
would be actually consistent,
those assumptions would be met,

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.525
is what I would be a
bit concerned about.

01:17:57.525 --> 01:17:59.400
Just because of everything
that also could be

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.290
changing around that time date.

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.290
We're using this going forward.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:07.470
In South Africa, we're building
a national level cohort

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:12.000
of HIV, and then also with
chronic diseases, diabetes

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.040
and cardiovascular disease, by
doing a lot more big data work.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.840
We're using a laboratory system
that they have in South Africa

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.830
to link labs to each other to
create individuals and create

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:26.670
prospective cohorts and then
assess policy changes over time

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:29.220
where it's like a
clear cut policy,

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.140
and there isn't this kind of--

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.030
I think a natural
disaster or anything

01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:36.370
around that may be a little
bit more difficult to make

01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:38.190
sure the assumptions are met.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.940
But it'd be interesting to try.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.575
- Let's open up to questions.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.140
- I'm a particle
physicist, so I come

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:55.640
from a complete different
domain of how we do analysis.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.560
One of the things
I was curious about

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.050
is, we have this set of
tools called Monte Carlos.

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.130
And basically, we take a model
of the system we're studying,

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:09.950
including random stuff,
diffusion, that sort of thing.

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:13.550
It just struck me that when
you try to do a validation,

01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:15.200
the nice thing
about Monte Carlo is

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:21.770
that you can run 100 times what
you just did for the HIV study,

01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:24.590
or 100 times what you
just did, and then you

01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:26.660
can judge the
statistical significance

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:31.220
rather than just using the
more refined statistical tools.

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.200
I was wondering if
there's any attempt

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.810
to move towards
that in the field

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:39.810
that you're using these
secondary sources?

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:42.810
- Yes.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.309
In fact, I have
many colleagues that

01:19:44.309 --> 01:19:48.840
would be quite encouraged
by your comment there.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.280
Some of the other
work that I do,

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.650
I use a lot of
Bayesian methods, where

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:55.002
we bring in prior information.

01:19:55.002 --> 01:19:57.210
We don't start out assuming
everyone's at equal risk.

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.830
We assume some groups are
at greater risk than others,

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.010
and then we run these
simulations, many hundreds

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:03.100
of thousands of times.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.450
So there's definitely a movement
of foot in the field to go more

01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:08.130
towards that direction.

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.120
But from a teaching
aspect, it's still

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.050
being taught in a
traditional framework.

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.890
Just like, here's
how to get started.

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:22.380
So in some sense, it
has its own momentum

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.780
and it's being taught this way.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:27.390
But there are more and more
people using the techniques

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.250
that you're describing.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.560
- And I think as myself
and my colleagues

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.450
move into more of the
big data world, which

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.960
is kind of a broad term, a
lot of those techniques we're

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.850
talking about applying.

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.380
So yes, there's movement.

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.650
But you're right, it's taught
more in a traditional sense.

01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:46.730
- I don't know if I'm
speaking for you as well.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:48.600
Our field, I feel,
uses a lot of methods

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.170
that come from other places.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:57.170
For example, social sciences.

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:59.820
The methods that I'm
using for the work

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.100
that I presented on multilevel
analysis, a lot of that

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.090
comes from the social sciences.

01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:06.240
So I feel that your
group is pioneering

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.680
some of these methods, and
speaks well for our group

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.179
and it'll just take a little
bit of time to catch up to you.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:14.868
- Other questions?

01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:22.160
- Hi.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.470
It's a question for Neal.

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:30.030
How much variation are there
in NICUs in other places?

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.960
Is there a, kind
of, gold standard

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.560
where they don't have
these problems at all?

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.490
- Absolutely, critical
care management of babies

01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:40.510
differs institution
to institution.

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:43.410
So in some sense,
I wonder with you,

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:48.600
how generalizable are our
findings to other NICUs.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.440
A lot of the day to day
what goes on in NICU

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.500
is fairly well prescribed,
and they follow

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.220
protocols and guidelines.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.450
So in some sense, there
will be a variation.

01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:02.940
I would love to actually
repeat this analysis

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:06.000
with a whole group of NICUs
and see what's out there.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.580
But if another NICU is
doing some infection control

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.580
procedure because they
have a flag in their EMR

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:19.200
to say it's a high census right
now or it's a high unit acuity,

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.380
then our findings may not
necessarily apply to them.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.260
That is kind of a
next step, I think,

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.340
with this work is
let's see if we can

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.070
replicate this in other NICUs.

01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:31.020
Is this something just
specific to Christiana care,

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.020
or is this truly a
generalizable issue that's

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.220
happening across the board.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.930
- As a follow up
question, the size

01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:50.320
of the NICU that you described
is considerably larger

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.150
than the community hospitals
that I've worked at.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:58.150
It would be interesting to
compare the size of the NICU

01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:01.150
in terms of the outcomes,
because this would certainly

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:04.870
have a significant
effect on advice as

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:07.850
to whether regionalize
this kind of care

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:11.350
or whether it can be as
diffusive as it is now.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.340
- Yes.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.390
I'm dealing with a level 3 NICU
that can go up to 70 patients.

01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:20.470
And if you consider a smaller
regional hospital that

01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:25.786
maybe has like a 10 or even just
a very, very small 5 bed NICU,

01:23:25.786 --> 01:23:29.791
I think that's a great
question to explore.

01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:30.290
- All right.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:34.750
I know we have tea and coffee
and cookies waiting outside,

01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.280
so let's take a break.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.655
I want to thank you guys,
these were really fascinating--

01:23:38.655 --> 01:23:41.900
