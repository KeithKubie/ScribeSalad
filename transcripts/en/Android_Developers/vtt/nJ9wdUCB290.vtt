&gt;&gt;Male speaker: Good afternoon everyone and
welcome to this episode of Friday Review of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.940
Apps.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.720
I am Reto Meier and I am
joined in the studio today by Fred Chung.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
&gt;&gt;Fred: Good afternoon.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.720
Hi everyone.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: And today we're going to do things
a little bit differently, uh, we're going

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.300
to continue to try to work on themes.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.490
So the theme for today's episode is News Apps.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.960
And that's being liberally interpreted by
our viewers, as news and RSS

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.320
reading apps, so that's a lot of what we got
in the moderated queue this week so that's

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.940
a lot of what we're going to be
looking at.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.740
What we're going to try and do is take a look
at some of the top voted apps from the moderated

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.870
queue, have a
look at them and see what we like and what

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
we don't like, and then right at the end,
I'm going to spend a little bit of time

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
showing you some of my favorite news apps,
and why they are some of my favorites and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.829
see how they compare with what some of
you guys have nominated.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.300
So I think we'll start off by providing a
little bit of context.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.970
So I've put together a list of
what I want in a news app which would make

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.780
it my favorite news app.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.619
So if you could put that on screen for us,
Ian?

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.850
&gt;&gt; Fred: Ahh....

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.299
&gt;&gt;Reto: There we go.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.490
News app wish list.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.889
&gt;&gt;Fred: Check it out.

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:17.039
[laughter] I like that list!

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.920
&gt;&gt;Reto: Any of these items which a news app
doesn't have makes me angry, as you can clearly

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.520
see on the graphic.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149
Thank you
very much Roman Nurik for your artistic skills

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.810
here in putting this together.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.270
So, what makes a great news app?

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.459
For me, I need it to do a few things so I
needed to have no latency at start up, so

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.979
I don't want a splash screen, EVER.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.229
I don't want to be presented with "loading,"
or when pulling down news articles,"please

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.229
wait."

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.229
Anything after the first
time.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.889
I'll allow it the first time, seems reasonable,
because you can't load data before your app

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.459
has loaded at least once,
but beyond that, I want to see news, and its

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.599
freshness is up for debate, but I never want
to be presented with an empty

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.719
screen or a loading dialog.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.249
I want to have great notifications.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.960
I want notifications which are rich, as in
rich notifications from Jellybean, I want

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.810
them to be not too interrupting, so that they
just come up when I want them, and the content

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.810
needs to be relevant.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.700
It needs
to be related to the things that I am interested

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.030
in seeing.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.980
Breaking news, stuff where there's a really
high chance that

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.680
this is something I actually want to see.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.780
And it's the same sort of thing for widgets,
you know, I want to have a great widget that's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.750
resizable so I can leave it on
my home screen so I can make sure I don't

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.240
miss anything important throughout the day.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.719
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whoa, hang on you guys, this is really
weird, we were streaming and now we're not.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.719
&gt;&gt;Reto: Okay.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: I have a start streaming button again.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.459
&gt;&gt;Reto: Uh.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.159
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's do this all over again, â€¦ [shouting]
Woo Hoo!

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.170
[Reto and Fred laugh]

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.819
&gt;&gt;Ian: we'll get it right this time
&gt;&gt;Fred: Take two.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.849
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, do we just start again from the
beginning?

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: [sings] Start again, it's a nice day
to--

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.880
&gt;&gt;Fred: So, did we not stream or what?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.520
Or did we stream at some point?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh Shit!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.939
Somehow it stopped itself and it can't, it
says it can't start broadcasting again

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.390
because it already ended.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.310
Holy shit, what the hell?

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.620
This is so wrong.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.500
Let's see
[long silence]

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.159
Oh okay.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.580
Sorry everybody that was MY fault.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.459
My fault, Ian Ni-Lewis admits that it was
HIS fault.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.569
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's a shame we don't have a producer
cam today, I feel that putting a face to the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.909
name and the blame would be
useful in this instance, you think?

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.359
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can find me on Google Plus.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.249
&gt;&gt;Fred: In Circle Ian
[Reto laughs]

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.530
&gt;&gt;Reto: We'll be looking at a post mortem
for that in about an hour's time.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.689
But in the meantime, can I presume that everyone
has been listening and viewing along since

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.689
the beginning?

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes, you don't get a do over after
all.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.310
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's a shame, I think everyone would
like to have, to see exactly how much I can

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.180
do this exactly the same way.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.249
So
let's bring up my list of hopes and dreams

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.239
once again, if possible, Ian.

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.730
Where were we....so I was talking about notifications
and widgets.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.540
So the other thing I want to have,
similar to that, is offline support.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.280
I want to make sure that if I'm reading it
on public transport, that every time I go

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.670
in
of out of a tunnel or anything like that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: Like when you're flying

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Flying is a little more of a challenge

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.740
&gt;&gt;Fred: or a submarine

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] Submarine, indeed.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.450
I think, for me, it's not as important that
it be like completely offline but it works

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.570
in intermittent situations so that if I happen
to click on an article when I go underground

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.150
or lose cell connection or
something, it still works for, let's say,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.150
five minutes.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.150
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: So five minutes is a good time length.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.150
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's fair.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.150
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think so.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.800
I also want to have something that is similar
to the experience I get when reading a newspaper,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.340
which I
realize dates me significantly, but I still

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.820
kind of like that flow, of being able to sort
of page through news and see

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.290
what's interesting, see what catches my eye.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.091
Some sort of narrative, some sort of category
browsing which lets me just sort

00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:17.770
of jump between articles and continue reading
things which I think are interesting.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.970
What else?

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.260
I don't want to read through
the whole list, you guys, it's been on screen

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.080
long enough, you can probably see it by now.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.420
The only other thing I want to
call out is you know I do want to have fresh

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.360
data, so I do want to have background refreshes,
but I don't want it to drain

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.570
my battery.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.850
So I noticed, after installing all the apps
today that my battery life went to twenty-five

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.270
percent within about
four hours of installing them all, so that's

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.430
a bad sign.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.270
Harder to judge, sort of, when I install a
bunch of things at once,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.220
but definitely an important thing for anything
that is going to stay installed on my device,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.330
is that it keeps fresh, but
doesn't drain my battery.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.090
So is there anything in particular that you
want to call out

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.460
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's a hard, hard balance to strike,
huh?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: It is.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.600
It is a tricky balance and that's how you
get the big bucks.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600
[laughter]

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.810
&gt;&gt;Fred: There you go, there you go.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.870
&gt;&gt;Reto: Was there any of those items which
you particularly want to call out...

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: I'd like to highlight the fact that
an app would work well on different screen

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.690
sizes, as what we've been
advocating, would be very very nice, because

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:17.050
each one of us have multiple devices and I
would imagine it's not uncommon for

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.090
a regular consumer to have a little bit over
one device.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.170
one point five to two devices.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.170
[Reto laughs]

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: One and a half devices, absolutely.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.300
&gt;&gt; Fred: One and half devices on average.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.290
You have a phone with a smart screen and then
maybe a tablet, a Nexus 7 for

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.660
example or a ten inch device, so make sure
your app looks pretty nice and good job on

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.990
the "on air" sign.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.990
[Reto chuckles]

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.010
Umm, yeah,shall we get started?

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's get this going.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.080
So to give you guys a bit of background, we're
not going to into as much depth as we have

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.991
in
the past on each app, we're basically going

00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:51.010
to buzz through the five apps that we've got
installed and try to highlight how

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.942
it fits into that list that I showed you just
before hand, and then I'm going to show you

00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:57.930
two of my favorite news apps and
see how they compare.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.760
So let's get started, let's fire up Good News.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.650
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's switch to the tablet, Ian, please.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.650
&gt;&gt;Reto: Perfect.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.880
So, Good News.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.460
Good News is a RSS reader if I am not mistaken.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.320
So is this tied to the Google Reader?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320
&gt;&gt;Fred: It is.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.460
It is tied to the Google Reader so when you
first launch it asks which account would you

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.790
like to associate
this app with.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.520
So I went through that authentication process
and it automatically pulls down from my Google

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.650
Reader, lists
all my subscriptions, and all the starred

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.060
items.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:40.710
Let's go into the starred articles, it shows
you a bunch of apps, but at

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.130
first glance it feels like it's so sparse.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.660
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's very sparse, isn't it, yeah?

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.770
It's basically a white screen with a few things
on either end.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.950
&gt;&gt;Fred: We're looking at a ten inch screen
and um, if that's the layout, if that's the

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:01.390
only one layout that you want to
do, at least put some margins, on the two

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.390
sides.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.560
&gt;&gt;Reto: It feels very very cramped here
&gt;&gt;Fred: yeah, even better, obviously, would

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.670
be to implement the two pane version.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mm-hmm.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: The two pane layout for a bigger tablet
screen size.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: It would seem like a pretty obvious
thing to do for an app like this where you

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.650
are going to be doing a lot of
navigation through lists of categories and

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.470
then trying to read the articles, so having
the two pane layout really could

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.400
simplify that navigation.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: Exactly.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.460
So there are different sources available.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.770
Let's tap into CNN and I expect to see a lot
of Olympics

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.770
related news

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.339
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughing] You should have gone to
the BBC if you wanted Olympics related news.

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:33.500
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh that's right.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.669
CNN
&gt;&gt;Reto: There you go

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.669
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.520
&gt;&gt;Reto: Again, it's the same sort of theme
where you've got this massive amount of screen

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.890
and it's just a lot of white, with
very small amount of text and no, no images

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.520
at all.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.210
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oops, let's go back to BBC.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.650
Let's try to draw down to a particular article.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:03.430
It's a one line headline, and if you
want to, I guess, go into the website, you

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.190
press the website or the detail icon but it
doesn't show you anything.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.190
[Reto laughs]

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: So it's not immediately obvious what,
uh, how this app works and what you're trying

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.480
to do with it, which is, which
makes for an interesting sort of challenge.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.360
It definitely isn't optimized for tablet devices.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.390
If we switch to the phone
camera, you'll see that it's sort of a better

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.830
layout, if not perfect.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: there it is.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.540
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sorry, Ian, if you could switch us
across there and show the folks at home, perfect.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.820
So you can see, it's
exactly the same layout, it's just that that

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.780
small paragraph of text here fits in a way
that sort of much more easily

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.070
readable.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.750
They get that right, it's clear that the layout
here's been designed specifically for small.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.310
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's more natural.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:01.130
If that's only one thing that you can do is,
I strongly suggest, adding, like what I said

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.030
before, adding some margin,
to left and right to make it more natural.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.950
So let's switch back to the tablet cam because
I know the folks back home prefer the high

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.630
resolution
one.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.740
Let's see, if we exit out and go back in,
do we have any latency on the first.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.060
It opened straight back up to where
we were beforehand

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.060
&gt;&gt;Fred: Good.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.060
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is nice.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.990
You can see down here at the bottom you can
see that it kicked off synchronization which

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.230
is nice.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.570
Um, too early to judge how well how it does
in terms of battery life overall, but certainly

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:35.110
it gets the no latency solution
which is good.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.190
One thing that it doesn't do, so you did the
initial sign in profile, so this was for an

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.910
account that
wouldn't have had a Google Reader account

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.460
associated with it.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.700
Did it suggest to you a bunch of different
topics and sources

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.890
that you might be interested in?

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.070
&gt;&gt;Fred: I actually didn't go through its use
case

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: You had an account

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.170
&gt;&gt;Fred: I had an account, with some articles
associated with it, but that's a good suggestion

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.480
by the way.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that would be useful, so then again,
you want that experience, so for all the people

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.470
who are going to download
this app specifically to read their Google

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.350
Reader articles â€¦ but for the people who
don't use Google Reader, and there are

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.000
probably a few of them, you are gonna want
to basically provide them with that sort of

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.930
newspaper content, like here's a
bunch of stuff that other people think is

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.940
useful.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.000
That's definitely something I'd consider in
your flow, if it's not already

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
there.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's great.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That's great.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.420
And in fact, that's what the Google Reader
product does

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: It does.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.730
&gt;&gt;Fred: When you first log on, when you are
the first time user, it actually suggests

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.740
a number of articles, so you don't
need to stare at a blank screen.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm going to turn the Wi-Fi off

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.710
&gt;&gt;Fred: So what are you trying to simulate?

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: I turned the Wi-Fi off and see how
we do offline.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.820
&gt;&gt;Fred: All right.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.110
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's see if we can read this, so
we can, so it's actually downloading the content.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.600
&gt;&gt;Fred: I can see the headline, which is nice

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.400
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's fine, I mean it's new, it's
an [indistinct] so I wouldn't expect it to

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.650
cache the links, but we can at
least go through here and read all the text.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.610
It doesn't have the images, but again, that
is probably a reasonable

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.610
compromise.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.920
So we can go through here, find out which
articles we're interested in and we can star

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920
them for

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920
&gt;&gt;Fred: Future

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah for future reference.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160
That's interesting.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.180
So I click here, it's actually allowing me
to select the mode for

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.180
it.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.180
Read, Read List, and Starred.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.180
That's a little bit counterintuitive.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.930
I would expect that if I hit the star here,
for

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.480
it to just star it.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480
&gt;&gt;Fred:Boring, it's boring.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.540
Either star it or not.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think it is actually.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:34.130
I think if I hit the star, it works, it's
if I hit it anywhere else on the heading that

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.130
it
goes

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.760
&gt;&gt;Fred: So it goes back to the point where,
you know, you want to lay out your app properly,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.810
for a bigger tablet screen
versus a small screen.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:41.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.730
So these touch targets are way too small,
I should say these touch targets.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.070
So we want to make them much
much bigger.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.790
As we can see here, they're using a, are they
using a view pager?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.790
I thought they were

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: I swear I saw it.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.790
I saw it briefly..

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: They are using a view pager but it's
seems very

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.230
&gt;&gt;Fred: What are you paging through is what
I

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: The different stories

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.140
&gt;&gt;Fred: The different articles within CNN.com

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.550
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's confusing

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.550
time out?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.550
sorry?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: oh

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: We're getting hand signals from Ian
and we're not quite sure what they mean

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're right, we haven't agree on the
hand signals, you're just supposed to shake

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.670
your head or nod like a
baseball

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.670
&gt;&gt;Fred: wink

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: excellent

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Catcher.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:24.220
No, I just wanted to mention that, two things,
first that, despite earlier promises, you're

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.360
spending a lot
of time on this particular app

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.360
[Reto laughs]

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: true

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: And second that we do have Steve from
Phandroid on the line

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
&gt;&gt;Fred: All right.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Android is up next

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let's move on, so thank you for
the heads up because we do tend to get a little

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.560
involved so, big highlight
here: It does work online and off line; biggest

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.180
issues is that you've got a huge amount of
white space so it doesn't create a

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.280
really immersive reading experience.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.810
So you really want to think, about updating
this for tables specifically.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.630
Let's move
on to

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.630
&gt;&gt;[together] Phandroid.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: Phandroid News, because we have the
creator online with us.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.950
&gt;&gt;Fred: I'm sorry, what's your name again?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.350
&gt;&gt;Steve: I'm Steve Albright..

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.820
&gt;&gt;Fred: Glad to meet you..

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hey Steve, thanks for joining us.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.770
Why don't you spend a couple of minutes and
talk us through the app, what should

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.540
we be looking at, and how closely do you think
it conforms to the sorts of things we were

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.890
talking about earlier?

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:26.760
&gt;&gt;Steve: From what you were talking about
early on, one thing the app does not have

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.040
yet is tablet layouts.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.770
Um, it is
something we do plan on integrating in the

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.930
future, but currently, right now, we wanted
to make sure we got all of the bugs

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.780
out of the app before we moved on to adding
more layouts.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.780
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.780
&gt;&gt;Steve: I think it's just good

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.780
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's iterate

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think that makes sense

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:49.010
&gt;&gt;Steve: It looks like a little bit of your
screen is getting cut off.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.010
Oh never mind.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.800
It looks like it is looking pretty
accurate to what I assumed it would be on

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.360
a tablet

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.270
&gt;&gt;Reto: So one of the things that I should
probably point out is, looking at it on the

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.040
tablet like this, as you say, it
looks like part of the screen is getting cut

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.100
off, and that's distinctly possible with our
AV set up.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.000
But it actually does
highlight a good point, that you don't really

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.980
have any padding around the outside.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.910
So if you have a look at our design guide,
it

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.850
will give you an idea of what rhythm your
app should follow and I think it's at least

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.790
a six pixel border around the outside,
I could be wrong on the specifics.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.640
But what you've got now makes it look a little
bit cramped, so that everything feels like

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.980
it's almost falling off the edge.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.270
So you just want to add a little bit of padding,
around each of your elements and around

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.620
the edges of your layout to make it feel a
little bit more comfortable within the app.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.589
And you can see that at the top where
you've got your icon and the action bar, it's

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:43.230
that kind of level of padding where you want
to bring everything sort of in

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.920
and out, in the same way that the action bar
works.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.720
It just makes things feel a little bit more
comfortable.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.850
&gt;&gt;Fred: I also suggest looking into increasing
the font size a little bit.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:57.370
Because if you are looking at the category
heading or the news starred, they are just

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.839
a little bit too small.

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:02.390
&gt;&gt;Steve: I do have where you can switch the
actual font sizes.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, great!

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.970
&gt;&gt; Steve: [indistinct]
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's have a look at it.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.960
I imagine it's under the overflow menu

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: Font size, there you go

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.110
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's check on the font size.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.110
Great, tiny!

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's make it huge

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.209
&gt;&gt;Fred: Tiny, small, large, huge

00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:17.040
&gt;&gt;Reto: Whoa, that was interesting.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.810
So was that, I take it that's a custom animation
you've put in there to shake the

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.810
screen when you've changed the font size?

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.810
&gt;&gt;Steve: Itâ€™s a pretty common shake one.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:23.890
Most people use it for errors, error dialog.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:33.680
I had to put something there so you
know that it's actually processing.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: I quite like that actually.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.680
It looks neat.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.580
One of the things I wanted to point out, to
highlight specifically about

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.870
this app that I like, is the way you've handled
starred items.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.279
I've seen this done a bunch of different ways,
and most

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:48.670
commonly, people will have a single list where
the starred items are at the top of that list,

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.051
so then you'll click something
on the list it will disappear from where it

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:53.000
was and move it to the top and that drives
me crazy.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.700
Because it really interferes with your normal
work flow.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.100
What you've done here is great.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.960
I can star all of these,
and then they appear here in my starred list,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.410
which I really like, so, youâ€™re doing the
instant star, you get everything

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.610
highlighted and you straight away have this
list, and if I want to remove them, I can

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.980
take them off this list and they
disappear and that makes sense to me.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.980
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's intuitive.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.980
Good Job.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: So I rather like that.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.699
And it still keeps that nice simple interface,
and I assume that all of the news that you're

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:19.619
displaying within this app comes from Phandroid?

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.480
&gt;&gt;Steve: Correct, yes.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:28.230
&gt;&gt;Fred: And I see the refresh icon up in the
action bar, but what's the refresh strategy

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.230
like?

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.230
Is it manual or is it
periodic?

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.639
Or how configurable is it?

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:37.690
&gt;&gt;Steve: What I do is, by default I have a
background service that runs every thirty

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.690
minutes,

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: Uh huh.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.429
&gt;&gt;Steve: Now the limitations of widgets [unintelligible]
upgrade every thirty minutes.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:46.289
I need upgrade my own service.

00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:47.289
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:51.689
If you need to go more frequent than that
you need to implement your own service.

00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:56.350
&gt;&gt; Steve: Some people like every 5 minutes,
but that's a little overkill for me.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.350
[Reto laughs]

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.350
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.120
&gt;&gt;Steve: I'm like once an hour, but if I set
it with no options then I get people complaining

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120
from both ends, asking for

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120
&gt;&gt; Fred: Manual, right.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.490
I think if you set a default, out of the box,
refresh frequency of thirty minutes, that's

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.279
a
frequency that is reasonable for a news site

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.530
like Phandroid.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: One of the things that I talked about
at my IO talk this year was trying to create

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.340
something a little bit more
dynamic, in terms of setting that default,

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.139
so it's great that you give users the options
to choose, but one option you may

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:28.970
want to consider is sort of a dynamic sort
of back off to those updates, so that you

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.570
default at thirty minutes, but if the
user has installed the app but they've never

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.980
actually opened it, or open it very infrequently,
than that thirty minutes is

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.710
suddenly really aggressive right, because
you're draining the battery every half hour,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.679
firing up the network, you know,
doing that download, and I only open the app

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:44.679
twice a day.

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.259
So what I basically recommend to do there
is that you keep track

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:51.919
of how often they open the app or click on
the widget or anything else and if you go

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:57.809
past the interval of your refreshes,
then double it so then okay, they haven't

00:18:57.809 --> 00:18:59.659
looked at it in thirty minutes, so I'm going
to make it an hour.

00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:01.055
They haven't
looked at it in a hour, so I'm going to make

00:19:01.055 --> 00:19:02.320
it two, four, eight.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.639
So you're just updating once a day.

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:06.639
And then as soon as
they do open the app and look at it you can

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:10.009
go straight back to that most aggressive thirty
minutes.

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:13.190
So you're trying to
balance their battery life versus the freshness

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.129
based on how frequently the users are actually
using the app.

00:19:16.129 --> 00:19:17.990
It might be
something to look at.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.000
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's a good tip.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Otherwise, the app looks good.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.570
I think it's really interesting strategy you've
got with your advertising league.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.529
Give people the opportunity to turn it off
if they want to, but make it clear that basically

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:34.760
by leaving advertising on,
they're helping to support the website, which

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.840
is, I think an interesting take on an advertising
supported app.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.789
&gt;&gt;Reto: Can I ask you, what do you find the
split is?

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:44.590
Do most people leave it on? or do most people
turn it off?

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.789
Do you
have analytics run on that?

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:54.039
&gt;&gt;Steve: It really seems like a mixed crowd,
I mean, the hardcore Phandroid readers, they

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:56.809
like to support us you know?

00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:02.399
I think giving the option to do it or not
to do it, it kind of encourages them to leave

00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:03.399
it on.

00:20:03.399 --> 00:20:04.399
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:20:04.399 --> 00:20:07.590
It's like, you could turn them off but you
could help us out a little bit

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.029
&gt;&gt;Fred: It would be really helpful.

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:10.029
&gt;&gt;Steve: If you force them into displaying
ads everywhere possible, then you're probably

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:15.679
just going to get a lot of
complaints and no one to support you

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:20.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, it's interesting that even

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.679
though you haven't specifically optimized
your app for our bigger screen size, I noticed

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:28.519
that the
ad size, they have adjusted themselves to

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:33.750
fit nicer on a tablet versus a smaller ad
unit on a phone.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:40.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we fully, want to move on again
pretty quickly, but what I like is, the reason

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:43.200
why we don't have to spend too
much time is this is nice and simple, it does

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.620
exactly what you expect it to, does the update
schedule which we talked about,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.039
do you have widget for this particular app?

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:53.460
&gt;&gt;Steve: Actually, I have three widgets.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Three widgets, nice.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:02.019
&gt;&gt;Steve: One is just an icon widget, which
was first starting to mimic of what an icon

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:09.129
is, ended up removing the app title,
or the actual app name off the icon because

00:21:09.129 --> 00:21:14.270
I couldn't get it to be perfect on one of
the devices, it was very difficult to

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.590
get it to look right.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.590
The other two
&gt;&gt;Fred: Itâ€™s a stack widget

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:26.990
&gt;&gt;Steve: One is a news widget which has left
and right arrow buttons, and I obviously also

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.630
have the stack widget.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.270
&gt;&gt;Reto: I do like a stack widget, so that's
showing us the first article in each of the

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.270
categories?

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.359
Is the number
representing the number of articles within

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.129
that category or what does the number represent?

00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:45.200
&gt;&gt;Steve: The numbers are consistent with how
many comments are in the article.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh!

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200
I see I see.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.399
So it's each of the articles, because you
only have essentially one category because

00:21:50.399 --> 00:21:53.519
all the
articles are on Phandroid and then the count

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:56.129
is for how many comments are for each article.

00:21:56.129 --> 00:21:57.129
That makes sense.

00:21:57.129 --> 00:22:03.030
&gt;&gt;Steve: If there are new articles which are
triggered by the background service, there'll

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.929
actually be like a little bubble
up by the Phandroid's logo, which displays

00:22:06.929 --> 00:22:07.929
how many there are

00:22:07.929 --> 00:22:09.149
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very cool.

00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:15.570
&gt;&gt;Steve: Once you enter the app, you'll clear
those counters, or any notifications that

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.460
appear, and there new articles which
is different than read and unread.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Right, gotcha.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.460
Okay.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's great.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's nice.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.909
So like I said we should move on, but one
last thing I want to mention, in terms of

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:31.669
the background
updates, given that you've already gotten

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:35.929
a fairly aggressive timetable for those refreshes,
you may want to consider using

00:22:35.929 --> 00:22:41.090
Google Cloud Messaging, so that you're notifying
each of your users whenever you get those

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.190
new articles so rather than
waking up every thirty minutes, or potentially

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:48.549
every five minutes for those really hardcore
users, presumably you guys aren't

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:54.580
quite publishing every five minutes yet, so
you can kind of back that off by just alerting

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.320
each of your users when there are
new articles to read, so then the device can

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.980
wake up and next time it's connected it can
go ahead and get those updates,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.690
rather than sort of doing it all on the device
side.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.570
&gt;&gt;Fred: Cool.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:15.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: So yeah, GCM If you aren't familiar
with it, Google Cloud messaging was a re-released

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.090
version of Cloud to Device
Messaging which we released at Google, so

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.960
there's no quotas or anything like that, so
it makes it sort of perfect for this

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.539
sort of thing, where you want to blast out
a lot of messages to people.

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:26.120
&gt;&gt;Fred: And it supports batching, too.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120
&gt;&gt;Fred: Which is awesome.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.249
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's very handy.

00:23:29.249 --> 00:23:30.249
Cool.

00:23:30.249 --> 00:23:35.080
Alright, thank you very much for joining us
and I think we should move on to a couple

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.159
of
these other apps while we still have time.

00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:38.159
&gt;&gt;Fred: Thanks.

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:40.159
&gt;&gt;Fred: So should we try Reader?

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:41.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:23:41.159 --> 00:23:43.409
Let's look at Reader HD, which if I'm not

00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:45.640
&gt;&gt;Fred: Reader HD, what?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mistaken, I think Ian represented
this is the moderator queue, is that right

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.210
Ian?

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.390
Is this an app you're a fan of?

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh no.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:58.519
My app is G Reader Pro, but I'm eager to see
if Reader HD beats it.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:23:59.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, let's check it out then.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.859
So this is again, this is an RSS reader, so
presumably, this is looking at the same

00:24:04.859 --> 00:24:05.859
source

00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:08.789
&gt;&gt;Fred: The same source as Google Reader,
provisioned with the same account.

00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:09.789
&gt;&gt;Reto: Google Reader

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:10.789
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's got a two pane UI,

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:12.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent, excellent, we like that.

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:16.019
&gt;&gt;Fred: Which presents itself nicely on the
bigger screen size, uh, like what we're looking

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:17.419
at.

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:22.019
And on the right pane, on
the right fragments to be exact, you see a

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:29.509
bunch of news listings, with ability to star
an article, I assume.

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.029
The article
has been starred right.

00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:36.790
Check box right here, I assume that is whether
I have read it or not

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.919
&gt;&gt;Reto: Shows if itâ€™s been read, very nice.

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:44.210
&gt;&gt;Fred: The setup is pretty straight forward,
like the previous news apps that we looked

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.210
at today.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very nice.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.740
&gt;&gt;Fred: Rugby, it shows you an ad down below
in the news item

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: Do me a favor, star one of those,
Reticent Brits for example, give that one

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:58.350
a star, because I happen to have the
app open on a phone here as well and I want

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.850
to see it magically update.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.259
&gt;&gt;Fred: Is it provisioned using the same account?

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:05.259
&gt;&gt;Reto: It is the same account.

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:06.259
&gt;&gt;Fred: Okay, cool.

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:08.629
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's see if it magically does it.

00:25:08.629 --> 00:25:09.629
[Both chuckle]

00:25:09.629 --> 00:25:12.570
I rather suspect, oh no, it is refreshing,
so we'll see.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.010
I suspect that we'll have to jump out of this
and jump back in for

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.080
it to refresh while we're doing it dynamically.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.639
Let's try that.

00:25:19.639 --> 00:25:21.200
Alright, not yet.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.950
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's go on, we'll report back

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: We'll report back, exactly.

00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:26.829
So we'll switch back to the tablet.

00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:27.829
&gt;&gt; Fred: All right.

00:25:27.829 --> 00:25:28.829
&gt;&gt;Reto: Perfect.

00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:32.539
In terms of the layouts, there's a lot of
white space, but it's white space that is

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:34.529
keeping it simple
rather than keeping it empty.

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:40.269
Umm, so we have all of the screen being taken
up, great use of the action bar, great use

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:44.649
of
the split panel, which Fred was describing

00:25:44.649 --> 00:25:45.679
earlier.

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:46.679
It looks pretty good.

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:47.679
I quite like the looks of this.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.679
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's pleasant.

00:25:48.679 --> 00:25:49.679
It's a pleasant experience.

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.679
Let's go ahead and test the offline test.

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:51.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: Please, yes.

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:57.760
&gt;&gt;Fred: I just switched off the Wi-Fi, go
to the screen, and let's go back to Reader

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760
HD

00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: And again.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.279
Thereâ€™s no latency there, so that's definitely
a win.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:04.580
&gt;&gt;Fred: That looks good and it looks like
news headlines are cached.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.509
Nice, so you can go in and read the summaries
of each

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:08.509
&gt;&gt;Fred: Makes Reto happy.

00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:09.509
&gt;&gt;Reto: It does.

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:10.509
It does make me happy.

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:14.759
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, I'm not going to be happy until
you can view original offline

00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:15.759
[Fred and Reto laugh]

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:17.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's see what happens when you view
original offline.

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:23.070
It's opening up the browser and failing.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.070
So uh

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.539
&gt;&gt;Fred: We have Reto happy, not so much Ian.

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:28.379
&gt;&gt;Reto: Not so much Ian.

00:26:28.379 --> 00:26:29.480
Let's see if Reader Pro

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:35.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think that Reto is not quite the
connoisseur of reader apps that I am

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.049
&gt;&gt;Reto:This is probably true.

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:42.519
I have to be honest, I do love Google Reader,
but I do tend to use that on my computer,

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:46.809
whereas when I am on mobile, I tend to sort
of read news from news sources.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:47.809
&gt;&gt;Fred: All right.

00:26:47.809 --> 00:26:54.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's have a look at um, oh we don't
have news gReader Pro on that device, that's

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.529
interesting, so, gReader
pro, I have it on this one.

00:26:58.529 --> 00:26:59.870
So let's uh, let's have a look.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.399
Just going to scroll this down while I sign
in, we can just look

00:27:04.399 --> 00:27:06.610
at this here, so you don't have to see that
email address.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.029
It has the authenticator on the device, which
is nice,

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:14.249
It goes through, so this is interesting.

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:18.639
The Phandroid app did this as well, when it
first loaded it tells you what's new,

00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:22.929
um, which is great, except for the most part,
people don't care.

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:25.570
So there is a place on Google Play to be able
to say

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.970
exactly what's new, and I certainly don't
have any objection to putting it up in your

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.830
overflow menu, but having it as sort
of the first thing you see, just sort of slows

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.830
me down.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.489
If I click that icon, I just want to read
some news, I am not

00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:38.070
particularly interested in what's new in the
app.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.289
&gt;&gt;Ian: The other deal breaker is down under
notes.

00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:48.379
&gt;&gt;Reto: "If you like gReader, rate us with
5 stars" Yeah, this is the thing, there's

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:51.169
been a lot of back and forth, even
within our own team, about how we feel about

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:55.229
apps that solicit ratings in Google play.

00:27:55.229 --> 00:27:58.549
&gt;&gt;Fred: There's a pretty important distinction,
right?

00:27:58.549 --> 00:28:04.590
Between asking people to rate your app, versus
asking for a very

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.130
specific rating.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.960
I think we're pretty much all in agreement
that if you're specifically asking for a five

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.919
star review, umm,
even if you say, only if you like it, five

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:17.070
stars, that definitely crosses the line.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.869
Me, personally, I don't like it at all.

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:23.859
I think, people know how Google Play works,
if they like your app and they choose to rate

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:25.269
it, they're going to do so.

00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:28.739
Asking them
explicitly to do it, I don't think it's going

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:30.049
to give you a lot of value,.

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:31.049
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's uncool.

00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:35.340
&gt;&gt;Reto: But definitely don't solicit five
star reviews specifically because, you know,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.440
it's kind of not kosher.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.849
So let's uh, let's close this, and move on.

00:28:39.849 --> 00:28:45.370
So this is the general layout, so they've
got an action bar style bar along the

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:50.659
top, which I have to be honest, I'm not a
huge fan of because it's way too small so

00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:54.230
you can see my finger in relation to
those buttons, as the camera

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.679
&gt;&gt;Fred: Custom action bar?

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:59.989
&gt;&gt;Reto: And they're all too small, and I'm
going to accidentally miss this and hit the

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.260
wrong thing.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.119
It's also interesting
because this, see, I'm confused straightaway.

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:10.999
Because I expect these to be actions, I expect
them to be things which I click

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:17.929
and they perform something, plus should you
know add a new subscription, which it does,

00:29:17.929 --> 00:29:21.109
&gt;&gt;Fred: It throws you to a screen that has
a different look and feel.

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:22.210
It's got a dark theme.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.330
&gt;&gt;Fred: Versus the white, light theme that
we were looking at.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.760
So, it's kind of throwing me, and I can browse,
let's see dot net, something I did in a previous

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.760
life.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.190
Go
look at Scotty Gu's blog.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.970
So this is all taking a little longer than
I would like, because I'm an impatient person

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:45.590
so I'm
going to hit the back, I am not expecting

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:50.740
this to function as navigations, but as actions
but they're sort of working as

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.820
navigations so as I am clicking through these,
this is switching between feeds and tags,

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.480
which isn't what I'd expect,
alright.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.609
So everything here I would expect to be an
action, and it's actually navigation.

00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:06.049
So if you're doing that with an
action bar, navigation stuff should all be

00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:10.210
on this side, next to the app icon.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:15.139
So this is all fine, this is just the
overflow menu, with customized, which we're

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.139
fine with.

00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:19.539
But again, I would think about how you can
put these, either as

00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:24.080
tabs, or viewpager items, or something like
might make it easier to understand.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.609
&gt;&gt;Fred: Does the app have viewpager in it?

00:30:26.609 --> 00:30:29.549
&gt;&gt;Reto:It doesn't at this level, at least.

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:36.049
So I go through, read one of the articles,
and the articles themselves are, and

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:39.330
this is quite nice with the fade in fade out.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.929
I thought it was fading in fading out, perhaps
it isn't.

00:30:42.929 --> 00:30:44.309
Maybe I'm just too
quick.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:46.799
But so these overlays are quite nice.

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:49.309
I guess this is going to let me increase the
size of the text.

00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:52.119
But again, all
the touch targets are a little bit too small.

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:55.740
So it's good that they're not obtrusive, but
it's really hard to sort of

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.500
click them, and understand what's happening
there.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.690
So, you've got it on the tablet now

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.809
&gt;&gt;Fred: I do, I do.

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:02.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let's open it up there.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.409
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's switch to the tablet.

00:31:04.409 --> 00:31:06.659
&gt;&gt;Reto: Close this, it's the same opening.

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:08.220
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh nice.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.979
We have a two pane layout which is good.

00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:11.979
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:16.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's go to Engadget and look for
some stuff.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.559
Left hand side, shows you a list of high level
titles and right hand side once

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:28.229
you've chose a title, a news source, you can
browse through the various news articles,

00:31:28.229 --> 00:31:30.570
which is quite nice on the right hand
side.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:34.239
And on the tablet, I'd say the touch targets
are a little bit, uh bigger.

00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:35.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Well this looks like a standard action
bar to me

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, an action bar.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: It looks like the tablets have just
gone with a regular standard action bar.

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:41.359
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:42.359
It does look like it,.

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:43.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: So it's much more to my liking.

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:44.359
&gt;&gt;Fred: So it just feels more natural.

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:48.919
A lot more natural on the tablet with the
bigger touchable target.

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:50.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's take it offline.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.109
We've done that to all the other apps, so
let's do the same thing here.

00:31:53.109 --> 00:31:54.109
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh yeah.

00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:58.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: And let's see if Ian's favorite app
will actually do what Ian was hoping it would

00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:59.029
do.

00:31:59.029 --> 00:32:00.029
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright, the moment of truth.

00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:01.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: gReader Pro...

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:03.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: It may indeed be an optional setting,
so

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, okay, we'll check that.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:10.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: You may want to look at some of the
settings, I completely agree with you on layout,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.919
this app frustrates me to no
end, But I haven't had anything, I haven't

00:32:14.919 --> 00:32:19.960
been able to find anything that has the same
features that this does.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.549
The
specific things that I like are it has, if

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:27.419
you read long articles, the viewpager will
remember where you were,

00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:28.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, that's nice.

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:29.419
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh wow.

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:30.419
&gt;&gt;Ian: uh

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:33.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: So as we're scrolling through, let's
take a look at this Penn state scandal, that's

00:32:33.019 --> 00:32:34.019
not long.

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:35.570
These are all short
articles.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.210
So if we've got sort of multiple pages that
we're scanning and flick through it's going

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.019
to automatically move to
the right place in each of the viewpages?

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:43.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's correct.

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:44.019
&gt;&gt;Fred: Cool.

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:45.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's very nice.

00:32:45.019 --> 00:32:46.019
&gt;&gt;Fred: Does it remember across devices, based
on your experience?

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:47.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, it does not.

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:48.019
&gt;&gt;Reto: That would be nice.

00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:49.539
&gt;&gt;Fred: That would be awesome.

00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:50.539
&gt;&gt;Ian: That would be incredible.

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:53.539
I don't think it actually remembers for very
long.

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:54.539
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmhmm.

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:57.359
&gt;&gt;Ian: But that is not usually what I'm looking
for.

00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:02.179
Usually what'll happen is I'll be reading
a blog, let's say, and flick

00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:08.239
through to the next article and then realize
that I really wanted to see something in the

00:33:08.239 --> 00:33:11.619
previous article, or I'll even
activate the viewpager by accident.

00:33:11.619 --> 00:33:16.779
Which can be very frustrating if you are reading
a very long blog article to lose your

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:17.779
place like that.

00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:18.779
&gt;&gt;Reto: Makes sense.

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:24.279
&gt;&gt;Ian: The other thing that it does is it
automatically mobilizes the text, I think

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:26.250
that might be a something you have to
set.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:32.510
I've seen other RSS readers do this, but if
the blog that you're reading is one of those

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:38.029
where it just has just has a
sentence or two of text in the RSS feed,what

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:41.979
you can do is ask it to go and fetch the article
and cache it offline.

00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:44.309
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is exactly what we're looking
at on screen here.

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:46.830
So in settings, in offline reading, there
is an offline

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:52.590
usage which allows you to enable or disable
or switch for Wi-Fi only.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.460
Downloading the article contents after you've
synchronized the headlines, so that's really

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.789
a very interesting feature.

00:33:57.789 --> 00:34:00.710
I want to riff off this idea of being able
to

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:05.900
synchronize across devices, which I think,
from a games perspective, I think a lot of

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.970
us have been after this for a while,
so you could synchronize your progress, and

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.350
I would love to see this across more apps
like news, where, I just want to be

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:18.089
able to fire up the same app on multiple devices
so I'm reading it on my phone, and then I

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:22.210
sit down and pull out my Nexus 7
and be able to continue reading the same things

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.990
at the same place so that just feels like
everything is magically

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.179
synchronized to you.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:31.590
So obviously you're going to need to find
ways to identify yourself on the various devices,

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.460
but for
users who do choose to do that, it would be

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.679
a real advantage.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.799
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's a huge plus.

00:34:37.799 --> 00:34:38.799
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:34:38.799 --> 00:34:39.799
So this is, this is nice.

00:34:39.799 --> 00:34:44.129
Again I like the layout here, again using
that sort of white theme.

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:47.549
I would
point out, down at the bottom here where you've,

00:34:47.549 --> 00:34:53.810
I guess these are filters, so we can filter
through these various items.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.260
The iconography here, using the colors, almost
it feels out of place , compared to the rest

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260
of the app.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.690
I think it makes
sense where you've got the names with the

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.731
icons associated with each of the sources,
because they are something that people

00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:07.890
recognize those colors for.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:12.380
But for the most part, within the hollow theme,
anything which is sort of a menu item, or

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.280
an
action bar item anything like that tends to

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.849
be a monochrome icon, a flat monochromatic
icon . And I think that would look

00:35:18.849 --> 00:35:20.450
much more in place.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:21.450
&gt;&gt;Fred: Mmhmm.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.450
&gt;&gt; Reto: If it was the same thing here.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:27.450
&gt;&gt;Fred: Go look at the design guidelines and
go through them.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, yeah.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.740
I don't think there's anything specific in
the design guidelines for it, because this

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.099
is quite a
custom thing, but I think it would just sort

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:34.099
of fit.

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:35.960
I also noticed one of your texts is getting
cut off

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:42.099
here"recommend---" and given that that side
bar is gonna be, you get to decide how big

00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:44.160
it is, you probably want to make
that a little bit bigger.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.900
But also keep in mind that, Roman pointed
this out for an app we were looking at I think

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.680
yesterday, is that we tend to, this almost
works like tabs, and it seems to suggest in

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.310
tabs you should either go for just images,
or

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.640
just text, rather than both.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.170
In this instance, I think just images, as
long as you can provide icons which are obvious

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.069
enough, which I think in this case, everything
but recommended would fit into that category.

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:13.900
&gt;&gt;Fred: But for menu items, it's okay, if
there's

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.180
&gt;&gt;Fred: enough screen real estate to include
both icons and text.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.440
&gt;&gt;Fred: Definitely keep that in mind.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.099
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we have, I think, seven minutes
to go,is that all the

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:25.470
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's go through your favorite apps
&gt;&gt;Reto: We have a couple more.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.780
Yeah, I wanna look at my favorite apps, but
I think these last two, or at least News 360

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.180
is
an actual news app.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.980
So I just want to bring this up real quick,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.150
&gt;&gt;Fred: Let's go back to the tablet, Ian.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.150
Thanks.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:46.000
&gt;&gt; Reto: 360, no images in this category,
this means, see what this is going to do.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Interesting.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: Oh, is it offline?

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: Uh, possibly, yeah.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.329
That may not be fair.

00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:55.910
It actually worked pretty well considering
it was offline.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.420
Let's have a look.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420
Latest news.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.990
"An internet connection is required to use
categories" but you have internet connection

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.990
now.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.990
Okay

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: Take some time.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: Take a little bit of time.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.990
&gt;&gt;Fred: Ian, stop browsing.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.990
Oh, there you go

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.990
[Reto and Fred laugh]

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: All right.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.589
So, we've got an internet connection now so
we'll try it again.

00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:16.779
So again, this doesn't have latency
at startup which is nice.

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:18.760
Rich display.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.559
Showing us that sort of two panel option so
we can see latest news, so we can

00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:24.730
sort of browse through each of these.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.730
It's a little bit slow.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.720
I would like for things to come up a little
bit quicker when

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.180
I change categories, so you'd at least have
the boxes and the headlines and some of the

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.250
text even if it takes a little bit
longer for the images to come through.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.250
This is nice.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.620
&gt;&gt;Fred: I like the color scheme, the overall
color scheme.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.809
&gt;&gt;Fred: It blends in pretty nicely within
the app.

00:37:43.809 --> 00:37:44.849
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:37:44.849 --> 00:37:48.829
Nice use of the pseudo action bar, everything
on this side is a bit custom.

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:53.829
Not a fan of the settings
page, at all.

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:57.130
Or the settings icon . Youâ€™d be better off
here to use an overflow menu with settings

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.599
in there rather
than, find it in your inconsistent thing.

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:11.140
If we go back, search using the built in search
widget, so hitting back should

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.240
make the search widget go away, other than
make the app go away.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.040
Just a little tip there.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.490
So that's the 360 view.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.500
So that's
the name of the app, 360.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.641
Oh, that's a grim picture to have

00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:25.550
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's like the differentiator of this
app

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.430
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, it's kind of cool, we can
scroll through the pictures, and I'm guessing

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:34.180
if we click on one of the images,
we get the ability to read the article associated

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180
with it.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.250
That's actually quite nice.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.210
And in the article view, we actually
have, it's obviously a very visually based

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:44.170
app where the pictures are a big part of what
you're looking at.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.890
Ah, that's
cool.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.640
Okay, that's having looked at all those other
apps, in the few moments we have remaining

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.710
I wanted to highlight a couple of
what are my favorite apps.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.690
So one of those, particularly for news, is
News Republic.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.799
Umm, I'm gonna, that's unexpected.

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:04.490
&gt;&gt;Fred: Maybe I was looking there

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.270
&gt;&gt;Reto: Must've already been using it.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.920
So this kind of follows that thing that I
was talking about right at the beginning of

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.881
an app which is being able to help create
that narrative flow, which means I can just

00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.290
open it up and start reading what I
think seems interesting.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.589
So we have this quick tour explaining what
everything is.

00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:27.500
You know, I'm, to be honest, a little bit
ambivalent towards these helpful screens,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.440
they kind of feel like, apps should be obvious
when you open them up, You should

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.451
just, up, and start being able to click things.

00:39:33.451 --> 00:39:38.540
Things should just happen, and you should
be able to learn from what you are

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.810
doing, particularly news, we've all read news
before.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:45.170
&gt;&gt;Fred: And for News Republic, in particular,
they've done, itâ€™s very very intuitive you're

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.170
right.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.170
There are only two options.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.640
You can either go through the news articles
or search.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.750
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, so for the most part, these
functionalities are pretty self-explanatory.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:00.869
So to your point, Reto, I think that
the tutorial screen is rather redundant in

00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:01.869
this case.

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:04.980
Just because again, you guys have done such
a great job organizing

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.980
your UI.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, so let's have a look.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:11.089
Let's go into a category, straight away, they've
got some interesting UI elements

00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:14.789
there where you click on a category and it
does that sort of 3D fade.

00:40:14.789 --> 00:40:15.789
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right

00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:19.809
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is nice, doesn't go on for too
long, which is important.

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:22.190
So we can see all of the articles here on
the left,

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:27.310
we go straight away, this is kind of important,
we go straight into reading an article, in

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.151
the two pane view, so we don't
sort of get the list first and then have to

00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:31.829
choose an article before we start reading.

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:34.570
We straight away get to start reading
content.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.990
I don't think there's a viewpager.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.400
Oh, there is.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400
Excellent.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.059
So you can viewpage through each of these,

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:47.069
&gt;&gt;Fred: As you view pages,as you view page
through, it synchronizes the carets.

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:50.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we can see straight away, and we
can navigate either way.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.170
That's nice.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.170
&gt;&gt;Fred: Cool.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: One of the things.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.680
So they've done, there's a couple.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.349
For the most part it's a pretty standard news
app, I like

00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:58.349
the layout.

00:40:58.349 --> 00:41:01.730
I think it looks really nice, thereâ€™s a
couple of differentiating features which they've

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.299
done that I think are
kind of cool.

00:41:04.299 --> 00:41:08.910
One of which is that you're able to, this
icon here, just on the top right, gives you

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.890
an indication of how
people feel about that particular piece of

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.890
news.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.869
And so I click on it, it will tell me what
people's moods are, whether they

00:41:17.869 --> 00:41:21.180
are astonished, pleased, indifferent, worried,
sorry, angry, there's whole sort of set.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.589
We can say, well, I haven't read
the article so I wouldn't want to judge it,

00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:29.319
and then it will tell you up here how people
are feeling so as you can see, as

00:41:29.319 --> 00:41:30.319
we go through here

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:31.319
&gt;&gt;Fred: People seem to be indifferent.

00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:32.322
&gt;&gt;Reto: Everyone seems to be indifferent to
pretty much all of this news

00:41:32.322 --> 00:41:33.470
&gt;&gt;Fred: Maybe they haven't read the news today.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.470
[Reto laughs]

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's go to the top stories, that's
probably more likely to have some opinions.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.410
Mmm, possibly not.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.041
Ah, here we go.

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:46.630
We can see three people have an opinion on
this, most indifferent, a couple of worried

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.140
folks, but this is really
interesting because it gives you an idea as

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.890
we sort of scroll through it, what the mood
of it is, is this something that's

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.560
going to surprise me, make me happy, sad,
and then that helps when I am just sort of

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.559
doing my news browsing to decide if
that is something I'm likely to be interested

00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:03.710
in.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.440
So we can see how people are, pleased.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440
Which is nice.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.730
The other thing I
wanted to highlight was this sort of 3D view,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.730
which is kind of crazy.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:12.730
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's cool.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.549
&gt;&gt;Reto: And this lets me browse categories,
and so one of the big things about this particular

00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:20.619
app is that it tries to
crosslink everything, if there's a particular

00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:24.280
topic you want to read about, you can follow
that train through a bunch of

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.760
different stories the same way you would on
something with a feed.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.140
So yeah, you can go into health, so here for
example we

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.359
can see that there's been a bunch of things
which have been highlighted so we can click

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:41.130
London twenty twelve, and it's going
to find us a bunch of news articles around

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.130
that.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.710
We get that sort of Wikipedia effect of being
able to just follow the trail

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:46.710
of breadcrumbs.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.119
So you can just keep reading for hours and
hours.

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:56.279
Let's see what the Sex Pistols are up to
I may be spoilering the Olympic opening for

00:42:56.279 --> 00:42:59.589
myself and others so I shouldn't read too
much more.

00:42:59.589 --> 00:43:02.130
So I really like that.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.880
It does a lot of those things right.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.930
One of the other things I wanted to show you
real quickly, let's see, I need to make

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.771
sure I don't have too many things open on
my other phone, because I need to use my real

00:43:13.771 --> 00:43:14.940
phone for this.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:21.460
There it is, so if
we switch to the camera phone, we'll see.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, I'll switch as soon as I know
you're not going to leak something again

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.170
[Reto laughs]

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:30.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: Where's the fun if we're not leaking
things, come on man.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.490
Perfect.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.490
Oh wait!

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.299
You shouldn't have seen that, no, I'm
kidding.

00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:37.910
What we've got here is one of my favorite
things

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.941
&gt;&gt;Fred: Rich notification

00:43:38.941 --> 00:43:40.650
&gt;&gt;Reto: Rich notifications

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.839
&gt;&gt;Fred: What is richer than android notification?

00:43:42.839 --> 00:43:43.839
Rich notification.

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:49.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, I discovered this sort of by accident,
this morning when I was just playing around,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.980
you know because I saw this,

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.400
and thought "I'd really like to read the rest
of that, but I don't want to open up the app"so

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.270
I just gave it a try and
dragged it down and 'boom' there is all the

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.270
information I need.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:05.480
It even has the ability for me to share or
select my mood

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.839
right there from the notification screen.

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:12.390
This is really, really useful, I"m really
looking forward to more app implementing

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:17.119
these rich notifications and big props to
the guys at mobile News Republic for building

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:20.049
out this stuff so quickly after
their release.

00:44:20.049 --> 00:44:25.060
One of the things I like about this app is
they tend to follow all our new stuff as soon

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.300
as we release it, so
for me, as someone who always has the latest

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.170
phone, the latest OS, I get to take advantage
of this feature straight away.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.839
Thank you guys, I very much appreciate that.

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:38.279
Now, it has been a bit of a love fest, if
we switch back to the tablet.

00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:41.420
We've
been talking about all the good things about

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.950
this app, one thing that I want to take this
opportunity to point out to them,

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:49.980
is that they do fail one of my tests, which
is the zero latency, pretty quick from the

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.640
Transformer Prime, but I get this
splash screen, and I get this splash screen

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.700
every time I load the app.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.230
Which is particularly painful when I'm following
one

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.930
of their great rich notifications.

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.150
So they have great notification system, which
every time a news article pops up, it tends

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.571
to be something I'm interested in, because
you're able to customize what kind of news

00:45:08.571 --> 00:45:11.650
you want to read, so it tends to be
something relevant for me.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.390
And I'll click it and have to wait two or
three seconds while it loads past the splash

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.320
screen,
which kills me.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.170
By the time that's happened, I'm bored.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.700
I was just going to read it quickly while
I was waiting to do

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.370
something else.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.500
So if you guys could figure out a way to remove
that splash screen and the associated latency

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.050
then I'd have
close to a perfect news reading.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:37.589
&gt;&gt;Fred: I would suggest that they use one
of the techniques that Reto already mentioned,

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:42.740
to track to the last time the user
has entered the application and if it was

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:49.440
only two minutes ago then you can bring back
up the previous news items versus if

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:59.780
the last use was thirty hours ago, then you
might optionally put up a screen that spins.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.920
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's really a very good point, which
I hadn't even realized, is that it doesn't

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.420
go back to where I was,
particularly if I'm hitting the home screen.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:15.440
Like if I'm here, in the process of reading
through, ah, let's have a look.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.500
If I go through and have a look at all of
the happy, friendly news, which if Ian puts

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.829
on the tablet, you'll be able to see,
that we've been able to select just good news

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:25.400
things which make me happy.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.820
Yeah, everyone's happy, the stocks are going
up, I

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.820
know I am.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.820
&gt;&gt;Fred:Yay.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.579
&gt;&gt;Reto:So I'm in the middle of reading these
things and I go back to the homescreen to

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:38.299
do something else, to check what time
it is, and then go back in, I would expect

00:46:38.299 --> 00:46:42.400
that to take to exactly where I was, but it's
dumped me back into sort of the

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.619
main homescreen of the app, and that makes
me sad.

00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:50.000
So, yeah, that's definitely something you
want to work on as well.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Perfect.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
So I think that's pretty much

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
&gt;&gt;Fred: All right, so we're

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.810
&gt;&gt;Reto:all the time that we had because I
went on at length over the first app again.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.810
I'm going to need to learn
discipline, but that's all the time we have

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.760
today for our news apps.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.859
Next week I think we are looking at recipes.

00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:04.059
&gt;&gt;Fred: What are we doing next week?

00:47:04.059 --> 00:47:05.059
&gt;&gt;Reto: Recipes is what we're looking at.

00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:06.059
&gt;&gt;Fred: Some lifestyle apps.

00:47:06.059 --> 00:47:07.059
&gt;&gt;Reto: I want a recipe app.

00:47:07.059 --> 00:47:12.640
I want an app that lets me browse recipes,
store my own recipes, all those sorts of things,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.720
and
I have not yet been able to find a great one,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.890
so importantly, I'm going to be looking specifically
to pick out apps to

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:23.150
highlight which allow me to store my own recipes
and share them with other people, not just

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.640
apps that provide excellent
recipes.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.741
So do check out the moderator page, and if
you have an app that you've been using that

00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:31.670
you think is perfect for
this, please put them in there and we will

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.670
check them out, next week.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.670
&gt;&gt;Fred: Sounds good.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: Awesome.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:38.190
Stay tuned, weâ€™ve got Ian and Dan for the
Friday Game Review.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.130
I believe they're looking at tower defense
games this week so that should be interesting.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:44.150
They'll be on in just ten minutes.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:48.609
So stay tuned, and we'll see you next week
same time, looking at recipe apps.

00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:49.640
&gt;&gt;Fred: Bye.
