[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.190
MISTRAL MYERS: And I'm delighted
to welcome our two guests here

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.070
today, one of whom you
recognize from the screen

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.309
just a moment ago,
and Michael Rauch, who

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.170
is the executive producer.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.420
So quickly, Michael
has written, produced,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.750
and directed for numerous
television series, including

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.980
creating and producing
"Love Monkey" on CBS

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.920
as well as "Royal Pains,"
"Beautiful People," and "Life

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.970
Is Wild."

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.220
Rauch wrote and directed
the independent feature

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.810
film "In the Weeds," starring
Ellen Pompeo, Bridget Moynahan,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.202
Molly Ringwald, and Eric
Bogosian-- is that what it is?

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.410
MICHAEL RAUCH: Bogosian, yes.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.535
MISTRAL MYERS: There we go.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.250
And directed and produced
the filmed version

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.374
of Bogosian's Off-Broadway
show for IFC, "Wake Up

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:51.290
and Smell the Coffee."

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.130
So welcome, Michael.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.171
MICHAEL RAUCH: Thank you.

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.630
MISTRAL MYERS: Thank you so
much for being here with us.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.298
Yes, please, some applause.

00:00:57.298 --> 00:01:00.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.180
And now to introduce
our star, Alan.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.067
Alan Cumming is, as
many of you know,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.940
a wildly accomplished
performer in film,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.340
in television, in theater--

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.480
an author, as well--

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.780
whose work includes
seven seasons

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.410
as Eli Gold on "The Good Wife,"
for which he won an Emmy.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.311
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.560
Yes, "Good Wife" fans in here.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.070
ALAN CUMMING: I
didn't win an Emmy.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.140
MISTRAL MYERS: Oh,
nominated for three.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.870
ALAN CUMMING: Yeah, didn't win.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.703
MISTRAL MYERS: Someone's
got your bio wrong.

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:30.200
ALAN CUMMING: I won an Emmy
for something else, but--

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.660
you should Google that.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.440
MISTRAL MYERS:
Google got it wrong.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.350
He's also appeared on "Sex
in the City," "Frasier,"

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.230
"The L Word"-- a
personal favorite--

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.140
"Web Therapy," and
"Tin Man," PBS' "Master

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.460
Mystery!," "The Smurfs," also.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.080
The list really goes
on, and on, and on.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.860
In theater, Alan has
gained stateside notoriety

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.430
for the defining role of
the Emcee in "Cabaret,"

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.770
for which you did win a Tony.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.740
ALAN CUMMING: Yes.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.400
MISTRAL MYERS: A Drama Desk
award, Outer Critics Circle

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.250
award, Theater World award,
at New York Press award,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.752
and many, many others.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.210
ALAN CUMMING: Lots
of awards, yeah.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.880
MISTRAL MYERS: The
list really goes on.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.100
I had to actually cut this
down, because it would really

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.600
be too long.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.650
We'd be sitting here forever.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.660
Although his acting
credits do extend back

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.857
more than three decades.

00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:19.690
ALAN CUMMING: [LAUGHS]
That was unnecessary.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.035
MISTRAL MYERS: More than
a decade and a half plus.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.160
So we're really delighted
to have both of them here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.910
to talk about "Instinct,"
this wonderful show that you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.670
have both created.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.390
So, I had to start with a
burning question for you

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.320
both, which is, why did
Dr. Dylan Reinhart have

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.060
to be American?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.954
I'm so curious.

00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:42.370
I mean, I get the
CIA background--

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.437
ALAN CUMMING: Well,
I mean, because he

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:45.520
was American in the book--

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.910
MISTRAL MYERS: In the
James Patterson novel.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.890
ALAN CUMMING: --that
it was based--

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.820
the James Patterson
book that it's based on.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.680
I mean, he's in the CIA--

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.550
he was in the CIA.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.400
There's not many
Scottish-- do you

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.609
mean, why is he not Scottish?

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.316
MISTRAL MYERS: Well,
I mean, I'm curious.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:58.450
Was it written that way
because you really wanted

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.539
to do the American accent?

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.830
ALAN CUMMING: Play an American?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.625
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:03.190
ALAN CUMMING: No, I
don't take jobs just

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.481
so I can do an American accent.

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.527
I tend to just play someone,
and if they have an accent,

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:09.110
I try and do the one
that they should.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.990
But I mean, he seems to
me a sort of a very much,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.100
from my non-American-- being
born outside of America--

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.300
perspective, he seems
a very American type.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.190
You know, he's kind of an East
Coast, kind of white bread.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.590
He was in the CIA.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.450
His father was in the CIA.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.480
He's a kind of accomplished,
educated, privileged

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.040
white American.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.807
So I think for me not to sound
like that would be wrong.

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:42.640
MISTRAL MYERS: Fair.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.600
ALAN CUMMING: What do
you think, Michael Rauch?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.880
MICHAEL RAUCH: I think that's
all correct, Alan Cumming.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880
ALAN CUMMING: Thank you.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.860
MICHAEL RAUCH: I would
also say, I think--

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.510
which you may get to--

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.930
this being the first
network broadcast

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.180
hour long with a gay lead--

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.480
which is amazing.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.792
I think to then have that person
also have an accent may be--

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:01.750
ALAN CUMMING: Too much.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.791
MICHAEL RAUCH: --loading
a lot onto the character

00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.900
for an American audience.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.800
Not in a bad way, but
maybe not in the best way.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.430
ALAN CUMMING: And I
also say that I always

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.320
think it's hilarious when
people say that someone

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.420
doesn't have an accent.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.090
He has an American accent.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.340
MICHAEL RAUCH: No, he doesn't.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.569
ALAN CUMMING: Yes.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.610
MICHAEL RAUCH: No accent.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.280
ALAN CUMMING: It's
so funny, people

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.405
say I don't have an accent.

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.022
I'm like, you sound
like an American.

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:23.480
Doesn't that-- an interesting
thing about the way Americans

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.438
think about themselves.

00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:26.920
MICHAEL RAUCH: Alan is
Scottish, playing an American.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.440
Daniel Ings, who plays
Andy, Alan's husband,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.450
is British, playing an American.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.860
And Bojana, who plays
Detective Lizzie Needham,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.910
is Serbian-Australian,
playing an American.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.480
So we have these incredible
American accents,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.980
and the director
yells cut, and it's

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.370
just-- it's a free for all.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.450
There's just all these
different things going on.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.127
Yeah.

00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:45.460
MISTRAL MYERS: That's fantastic.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.710
Exactly why we
ask the questions.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.646
See, we wanted to know all
these behind the scenes, what's

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:48.820
going on.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.180
ALAN CUMMING: That's right.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.995
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yes.

00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:51.370
MISTRAL MYERS:
So, Michael, we're

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.510
fortunate to have you here
to be able to discuss also

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.770
the origins of the show.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.310
So, it was based on a
book by James Patterson.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.560
What brought you
both into wanting

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.824
to turn this into a TV series?

00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:07.490
MICHAEL RAUCH: For
me it was two things.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.140
One is I had never done
a crime show before.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.500
I had a deal with CBS,
and they sent me the book.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.570
I had never read a James
Patterson book before.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.030
I didn't know about the
lead character being gay.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.150
I really enjoyed the book.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.608
I didn't want to
do a show, though,

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:23.690
that had nothing new in it.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.310
And when I found out that
Dylan was, in fact, gay,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.980
it totally changed
my perspective on

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.170
and interest in wanting
to do a show like this.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.410
And then I heard that
Alan was interested.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.080
And that, for me,
was, I'm in 100%.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.357
I was and still am an
enormous fan of his,

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:41.565
despite his anti-Americanism.

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:43.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.680
And there was no one else.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.980
You know, like, all of a
sudden, the whole thing just

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.870
jumped off the page,
and it felt like this

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.940
is a guy I want to write for.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.640
So we had coffee and talked
about the book, and the show,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.140
and our ideas, and
it felt very much

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.360
like we were on the same page.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.470
MISTRAL MYERS: Did you
encounter any challenges--

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.261
and you know, we have
lots of conversations

00:06:05.261 --> 00:06:08.020
internally about
representations of LGBTQ people

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.380
and creating narratives
around the LGBTQ experience--

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.480
did you have any
challenges navigating that?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.470
I mean, I understand, Alan, also
that you are an EP on the show.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.140
So, did you work
on that together?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.210
Did you confront
any difficulties

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.650
in how it's not
always easy to write

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.410
for a very sort of
particular experience

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.910
that you may or
may not have had.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.530
ALAN CUMMING: Well,
I think actually

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.670
what really attracted
me, one of the things

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.180
was the way that, in the book,
Dylan's gay and has a husband.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.740
So it's not something we have
actually invented or tried

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.000
to add to it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.010
That was what the story was
in the James Patterson book.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.220
And what I loved about
it in the book, which

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.699
we weren't able to do in
the show, was that the--

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.240
I wonder if they've
changed that now?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.185
They've got the new
version of the book.

00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:52.560
Because the book,
he was called--

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.390
I think his husband was
called Tracy, was it?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.210
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yes.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.567
ALAN CUMMING: And they--

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:58.150
because it's a
literary thing as well.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.316
You know, you don't see it--

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:02.359
so they have this reveal when
he's talking about Tracy.

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:04.900
And then you think it's a woman,
then you realize it's a man,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.400
so.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.970
But I actually really
like the fact that the--

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.060
because it kind of really
annoys me that on--

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.280
certainly on network television,
if not all across the board--

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.260
if there is a gay character,
it's about their gayness.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.184
The whole story is
about, is gay, gay, gay.

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:24.850
And usually in quite a sort of--
you know, they've got problems,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.696
or they're are HIV positive, or
they're-- you know what I mean?

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:32.680
Not only is it
not very positive,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.850
it's actually completely about
your sexuality, rather than,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.425
you know.

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.550
So, I found what was really
refreshing about this--

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.883
and frankly it's something I
did not expect from a James

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:43.660
Patterson novel
nor a CBS series--

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.610
is a gay character, or
two gay characters, who--

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.706
and especially me--

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:51.580
really, his gayness is,
like, the fifth thing

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.890
that you mention in the
list of things about him.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.440
That in itself is
really refreshing to me.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.660
And also that you
see a relationship

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.470
that is a happy, stable
same-sex relationship.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.120
That's unusual.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.490
And both those things
were really important

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.520
to me, and why I
wanted to do it.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.570
But it wasn't really
anything we did.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.820
I mean obviously,
as ongoing, it's

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.290
something that we're
being very conscious of.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.550
And GLAD have been very involved
in terms of helping the writers

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.560
and things like that.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.610
And we're doing a screening
with them tomorrow.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.800
But really, it's James
Patterson who was

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.540
the person who kind of had it.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.159
And kind of based on, he
was roommates at college

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.370
with this guy--

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.039
who's the--

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.419
MICHAEL RAUCH: Bill?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.880
ALAN CUMMING: Bill, who's gay.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.520
And they've been
lifelong friends.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.064
And I think, actually, Dylan
is the name of Bill's daughter.

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:48.980
So there's all these
little connections there.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.660
He used it from
his own experience,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.870
which is always the best
way to do things, I think.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.910
MISTRAL MYERS: That's great.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.880
I can speak on behalf of a lot
of members of our community

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.250
that it is
extraordinarily refreshing

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.016
to see a show in which
there is a gay male lead,

00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:04.390
and exactly as
you say, that it's

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.570
not revolving around some issue
to do with their sexuality

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.200
or struggles with their family.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.030
It's sort of the
entire narrative.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.560
ALAN CUMMING: And I like the
sort of confoundingness of it,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.300
like he drives a motorbike.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.542
Like, a middle-aged sort of
dandy, fuddy-duddy gay guy

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:17.500
who drives a motorbike.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.150
I think I love that already.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.230
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah, I was
going to ask, actually.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.120
That was one of the
questions later on

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.150
is, your weaving together
so many different sort

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.250
of characteristics within
the same characters.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.820
Nerdy, intelligent
professor who has

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.110
multiple PhDs, a slight
sort of CIA bad ass,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.550
warm, loving husband clearly
in a stable relationship.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.290
Those things are not
often woven together,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.600
so how did you sort of prepare
to imagine this character

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.270
as you were getting
into it and weaving

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.540
all those pieces together?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.956
ALAN CUMMING: Well, in a way
that's the biggest challenge.

00:09:52.956 --> 00:09:56.050
Because most sort of
television things,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.640
there's a one sort
of sentence hook

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.719
to what your character,
or even the whole show

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:00.510
is about, actually.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.240
And so, to have so many
seemingly disparate

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.200
characteristics in one person
was both challenging, but also

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.780
attractive to me, because
potentially I could

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.190
be doing this for a long time.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.190
And it's actually
lovely to think

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.070
there's so many areas of
him that we can explore.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.050
And even those funny
things, like there's

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.320
an episode where we were at
this farm, because obviously

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.370
some murder's happening.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.030
And there's a lady
comes with a chicken,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.000
and she thinks that I've
come to pick up a chicken.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.450
So she hands me
this live chicken,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.010
and I go, oh, thank you.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.510
And I start to say,
oh, it's a blah,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.310
blah-- whatever kind it is.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.393
And I say, oh, yes, I used
to rear these in Egypt.

00:10:38.393 --> 00:10:39.340
And we just move on.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.006
And I love that.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.600
I wanted to go, when
was he in Egypt?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.840
What was he doing
rearing chickens?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.846
So, it's actually a
really great sort of--

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.220
do you call it in America
[INAUDIBLE],, like a lucky bag?

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.580
Do you call them that?

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:51.850
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yes.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.260
ALAN CUMMING: There's
all these characteristics

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.839
in a sort of lucky bag of Dylan
that I actually look forward

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:56.380
to exploring.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.796
But also it is
kind of-- you know,

00:10:57.796 --> 00:11:00.310
that's the challenge as well,
is to try and make it like one

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.720
whole person.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.657
But you know, I have a
lot of different facets.

00:11:04.657 --> 00:11:05.940
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.550
ALAN CUMMING: Do you
want to know about them?

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.841
MISTRAL MYERS: Uh, yes, please.

00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:10.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.855
ALAN CUMMING: I'm
not a natural blonde.

00:11:11.855 --> 00:11:14.850
MISTRAL MYERS: Aw,
damn, fooled us all.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.991
Actually, your career
has really spanned

00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.240
a number of different genres--

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.630
ALAN CUMMING: I'll say.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.490
MISTRAL MYERS: --and
you've played a variety

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.460
of different characters.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.000
Everything from, we've seen
you in action films, "X-Men,"

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.230
"Goldeneye," to
theater and "Cabaret".

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.094
How do you choose
each of these roles?

00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:38.260
How do you prepare for them?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.770
What is your process
for getting into so

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.340
many different headspaces
as you're moving from--

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.420
ALAN CUMMING: Well, first
of all, I have to confess,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.250
I really don't like
the word process.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.911
I always say I am not a
cheese, I have no process,

00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:55.660
when people ask me
about acting, because I

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.880
feel like that's the
antithesis of how

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.092
you do maneuver those things.

00:11:59.092 --> 00:12:00.550
If you think about
it as a process,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.170
then it's sort of
like a formula.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.990
And actually, like
real people, we don't--

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.841
we are all sort of idiosyncratic
and have no kind of logic,

00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:08.340
almost.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:14.540
So, I think of acting as just
like being a child and playing.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.320
And so obviously, you take all
the different characteristics,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.010
and you take all the skills
that you've picked up.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.155
It's just trying to be
someone else and meaning it.

00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:25.780
You know, it's not
a difficult concept.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.270
Some people are better
at it than others.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.811
But I think of acting like being
double-jointed or something.

00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:32.710
Some people are double-jointed--
or riding a unicycle.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.900
Some people can do
it, some people can't.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.520
And you can learn
to ride a unicycle,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.110
but you might not be that good.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.450
Anyway.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.620
But what I do from terms in
what I'm attracted to in a role,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.960
there's usually just one thing.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.600
Like with this,
it was the variety

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.060
of facets to the character.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.990
Then it was also like
when I met with Michael,

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:58.930
and I saw his intellect
and wit, and we really

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.200
got on, as you said.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.190
And it's a personality
thing as well.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.140
Sometimes it's just,
you know, I'd just

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.310
done a thing that
I shot, because it

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.710
was sort of a childhood
fantasy of mine to do it.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.945
And other times, it's like, oh,
I'd like to go to this country,

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:14.320
or I'd like to work
with this person,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.410
or I'd like to earn this money.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.150
Do you know what I mean?

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.733
There's different
things, and you just

00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:19.990
have to balance
everything to make

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.010
the life that works for you.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.180
MISTRAL MYERS: I think
telling a room of Googlers

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.280
that there's no
logic or process--

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.156
we have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:13:29.156 --> 00:13:31.280
Everything has to be written
down in a spreadsheet.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.080
What are you talking about?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.210
We have process docs.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.501
ALAN CUMMING: Or you really do?

00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:36.610
Oh, maybe I should
come and give you

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.350
a seminar on lack of process.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.340
MISTRAL MYERS: That would
be great, would you?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.800
ALAN CUMMING: Yeah.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.633
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:42.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.240
Great.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.440
Clear your calendars.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.170
ALAN CUMMING: I always
hated talking about acting,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.600
but then the New
York Public Library

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.542
conned me a couple of years
ago into doing this thing,

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:55.000
an evening of
talking about acting.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.170
So I called it, "I Am Not a
Cheese, I Have No Process,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.680
Alan Cumming on Acting."

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.880
And I did.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.930
Like this, I had
PowerPoint presentation.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:06.894
Oh, it was all--

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:08.560
I would like-- and a
video would come on

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.500
and everything like that.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.160
MISTRAL MYERS: Except
hopefully when you come here,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.070
it'll be Google Slides.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.403
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, Google Slides.

00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:13.344
Yes, I'm all for that.

00:14:13.344 --> 00:14:14.250
No, I loved it.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.719
I actually liked that.

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:18.010
I mean, I like playing at that.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:23.370
But if that's the
way you function,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.216
I think it's good to
have order around you.

00:14:25.216 --> 00:14:26.590
I have very good
order and really

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.298
good people, some of
whom are here today,

00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:30.116
who help me have the
life I want to live.

00:14:30.116 --> 00:14:31.490
But actually at
the center of it,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.560
I think you've got to be
a little more carefree.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.880
MISTRAL MYERS: We will try
to be carefree, of course.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.590
We'll try.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.070
So, for the folks
in the room who

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.440
are involved in their
own LGBTQ activism,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.529
can you talk a little bit
about the kinds of campaigns

00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:51.820
that you've become involved in?

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.900
I know probably some
Googlers in the room

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.900
know the work that you've done,
performing a duet with Liza

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.540
Minnelli to raise funds
for Broadway Cares, which

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.915
is in service of HIV.

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.040
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, not just.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.930
It's actually a much
bigger, wider thing than--

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.930
I mean, Broadway Cares--
sorry to interrupt you,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.140
but it's actually--

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.830
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights
AIDS, they kind of combined.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:24.520
But actually though, they
have this breast cancer place

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.250
and helps people when
they're homeless and things.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.880
It's a really great
sort of umbrella.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.000
It's interesting,
actually, when you

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.510
see how organizations sort
of transmogrify according

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.940
to their circumstances.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.000
It was started off, obviously,
as very much about a grassroots

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.430
thing about people who
are-- the theater community

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.750
was devastated by AIDS and HIV.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.000
And then when that kind
of got more manageable,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.530
it kind of diversified,
as it were.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.900
And so I really think it's
a great organization though

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.920
because of that.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.450
It's moved with the
times, and it's opened up

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.420
its ideas of who it can help.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.250
But also, the other
things I do, like I'm

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.575
an ambassador for the
Hetrick-Martin Institute,

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:06.075
which is a really
good organization.

00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:11.370
It helps a lot of homeless
LGBTQ young people.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.292
I do a lot of things
with young people.

00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:15.000
The Trevor Project,
I've done stuff with.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.510
My big thing is that I
think it's bad enough,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.020
it's hard enough being
queer in this country.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.160
And especially right now.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.920
I mean, I think that's
what's so amazing about--

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.670
you know, it's not good time
to be gay in this country.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.910
Trump and this administration
are peeling back

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.062
rights in various states.

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.270
And also just by his silence,
he is condoning so much

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.580
violence and persecution against
gay people all over the place.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.530
And so, it's more
scary to be gay now

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.860
than it has been for many,
many years in this country.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.490
So the fact that there's going
to be a positive depiction

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.220
of some gay people
on network television

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.035
is even more special
and necessary.

00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:03.170
So I'm actually even more
happy that that's happening.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.869
So, I think it's hard
enough at any time

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.069
in this country to
be queer, let alone

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:12.640
if you are in a place of
abuse, or if you're homeless,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.062
or if you're trying to
educate yourself to get out

00:17:15.062 --> 00:17:16.020
of a certain situation.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.720
So I feel a great
sort of personal

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.690
hoping to rewrite or rebalance
the world by helping when I can

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.126
and those sorts of things.

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:30.750
And then on broader
issues as well I've

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.000
kind of done some other stuff.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.582
But that's really what I
feel I can be most effective.

00:17:36.582 --> 00:17:38.790
MISTRAL MYERS: Next question
actually for both of you

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.760
on that same topic,
which is that we've both

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.880
been in the entertainment
industry for quite a while.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.870
And for those of us who are
not familiar with that space,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.110
we've watched, I think
collectively as a nation,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.850
collectively as a
world, attitudes

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.250
about LGBTQ people shifting.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.650
How have you seen
that shift working

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.600
in this space in the
entertainment industry

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.942
over the last several years?

00:18:01.942 --> 00:18:03.400
Given that there
are ups and downs,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.316
I'm curious how you've
seen that shift happen.

00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:08.880
Is it easier to
put on a show that

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.319
has the first gay male lead
on network television, or?

00:18:12.319 --> 00:18:13.860
MICHAEL RAUCH: In
terms of this show,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.680
it could not have been easier.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.500
CBS as a network
and CBS Studios were

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.810
100% supportive from the pitch.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.700
Alan and I went in
to pitch the show,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.090
and I don't we got one note
until we finished the season

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.090
about the character's sexuality
or the depiction of Dylan

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.860
and Andy and their life.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.860
I think it's going to be
really interesting when

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.000
we start airing on
Sunday to see if there's

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.790
an audience response
about Dylan's sexuality,

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.570
and what it is.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.480
If it's supportive, if it's not.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.580
As Alan was saying, given the
current government's silence

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.780
and behavior towards
marginalizing people,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.200
I don't know what to expect.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.680
I have faith in
our audience, so I

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.470
hope that people love the
show and kind of shrug at--

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.290
they don't care that
Dylan is gay or not gay.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.800
But I think we have worked
very hard in the writers' room,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.320
and on set, and, as
Alan said, with GLAD,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.220
to make sure that the
depiction of the marriage

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.490
and of the character are not
just accurate, respectful,

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.170
and authentic.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.520
And as Alan said,
this isn't a show

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.820
about a gay CIA
working with a cop.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.010
It's a show about an
ex-CIA guy working work

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.960
with a cop, who
happens to be gay.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.850
And it's just a part
of the storytelling.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.080
And just like in any crime
show or medical show,

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.660
sometimes you'd follow the lead
home and meet their partner.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.300
And that's what we do here.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.970
And the storytelling is
neither more dramatic

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.770
or less dramatic because of it.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.480
So it's a long way
to your answer,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.170
but I think in this sense,
there was no pressure at all.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.412
And so, I think with streaming
and premium cable now,

00:20:02.412 --> 00:20:03.870
there's so much
more representation

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.690
of all different types
of people that it's

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.790
kind of taken the
pressure off the networks

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.044
to be able to do it.

00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:12.210
ALAN CUMMING: And I think
it's an interesting thing,

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:20.470
that the people who
make television and film

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.170
are, I would say, more
likely not to be supporters

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.890
of the current administration's
stance, or lack of stance,

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.430
or their silence on
certain things happening

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.990
in different states, various
rights being pulled back.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:43.110
So, it's actually a funny
time when, in a way,

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.250
maybe we are not representing
a lot of the population's

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.760
opinions.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.420
But that's because
those opinions have--

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.560
I think sometimes you have to
be a little more, you know--

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.790
you're not just a cipher.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.450
You have to actually say, I
think this is right and good,

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.380
and we're going
to represent that,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.739
rather than what some parts
of the population might--

00:21:07.739 --> 00:21:09.280
negative things they
might be feeling

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.290
in terms of how the rest
of the country thinks.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:11.740
So, I don't know.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.160
I think it's really interesting.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.060
I think it's interesting
for a network like CBS

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.770
to be launching a
show that essentially,

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.770
with this topic, is kind of
potentially controversial

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.430
or unusual in a time
where the country is kind

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.340
of going a little
backwards, in terms

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.991
of its openness and diversity.

00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:35.990
But I think that's all
the more reason to do it,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.640
and I'm very excited about that.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.580
And I think whatever
happens, it's

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.510
going to be a really
interesting, telling time

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.272
for who we are.

00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:47.230
MICHAEL RAUCH: And CBS
is, of all the networks,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.457
I think they've taken
the most flak for--

00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:51.790
ALAN CUMMING: Lack of diversity.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.890
MICHAEL RAUCH: --yeah,
a lack of diversity.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.160
So, you know, they
have been incredibly

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.740
supportive and excited
about the storytelling.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.820
And not just with Dylan,
but the mayor, as you

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.380
guys saw, is an Indian American.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.990
The kind of top cop is
also diverse in the show.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.830
So, we know it's trying to
represent the real world

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.730
and that people in power
aren't just white men.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.432
ALAN CUMMING: It's
the diversity show.

00:22:20.432 --> 00:22:22.057
MISTRAL MYERS: It's
the diversity show.

00:22:22.057 --> 00:22:24.100
Well, with you both as
executive producers--

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.010
again, for those of us who
are less familiar with the ins

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.070
and outs of filming a show,
what creative control does

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.432
that give you over some of
these characters you have?

00:22:33.432 --> 00:22:35.765
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, [INAUDIBLE]
has most creative control,

00:22:35.765 --> 00:22:37.890
because he's in the writers'
room making them up.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.590
MISTRAL MYERS: Perfect,
that's exactly--

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.530
MICHAEL RAUCH: Alan comes
in with a monocle on a stick

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.000
when we're not shooting.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.930
No, this show, like
pretty much every show,

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.610
you have incredible creative
control to a certain point.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.189
And if there are
issues, whether it's

00:22:53.189 --> 00:22:55.480
with the studio or the network,
in terms of characters,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.438
they'll give you notes.

00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:58.510
And you try to adjust
the ones you agree with.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.960
But personally, I
really collaborate

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.930
with the actors, and
especially the leads,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.520
and especially someone as
talented and smart as Alan.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.470
Because there's a
certain point where

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.610
their understanding of the
character is equal to you,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.110
and sometimes
surpasses the writers,

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.540
because they're playing
this person every day.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.162
And so, there are
times that Alan is

00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:21.370
very respectful of the words.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.030
But also, if he or
Bojana say, you know,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.600
I have a problem with this, or
this doesn't seem right to me,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.330
they're usually--

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.919
as your ego, you resist
it in the beginning,

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.210
and then five seconds later,
you realize they're right.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.060
And you can figure out something
that works for everyone.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.230
And it always makes
it work better.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.160
ALAN CUMMING: And I think
it's an interesting thing that

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.210
for me, being an
executive producer,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.360
it means that I have access
to lots of information

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.296
that I probably would never
have had just as an actor.

00:23:52.296 --> 00:23:53.920
Which is also getting
the scripts early

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.835
and being able to
sort of make comments

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.210
earlier on than
I would have been

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.709
able to had I just gotten them
when they were the production

00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:01.270
draft.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.850
And that's been fascinating.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.840
And also just seeing
cuts of it early on.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.060
And I mean, it's
quite a lot of cuts,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.370
so there's a lot of watching.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.010
But for me actually,
the thing that I

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.460
like most about having a
bit more power in terms

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:24.040
of my position in the show,
is just actually thinking--

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.830
my two areas of
executive producers--

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.200
I really was like,
we've got to make

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.540
sure we work long, long hours
when we do this, but let's

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.600
be very respectful and
try and get people to have

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.340
some semblance of a home life.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.745
The crew, let's try and make
sure that we don't muck about.

00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:42.370
If we have directors who are not
prepared and are wasting time,

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.203
then we should give
them a kick in the pants

00:24:44.203 --> 00:24:45.410
or not ask them back.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.451
Those sorts of things are
really important to me,

00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:49.030
because you work
incredibly hard,

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.090
and you have a great
group of people,

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.880
but you've got to make
them feel good about coming

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.960
to work and make them feel
that they're respected.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.085
So that was very important.

00:24:55.085 --> 00:24:57.280
And the other area
was the catering.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.960
Because, as a vegan, I remember
having a conversation saying,

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.740
salad is not a vegan option.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.410
It's salad.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.550
And so I had a chat
with the producer,

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.640
and I remember saying, it's 20--

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.350
he said, we can bring
you food in from--

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.950
I was like, I don't want that.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.630
It is 2017, it's New York City,
there's 150 people on the crew.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.390
A large percentage are going
to be vegetarian or vegan.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.700
They need to have more
than just fucking salad.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.880
So things changed, and
it was really great.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.820
We have vegan options.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.874
And what's so funny about it
is that I'll be walking to set,

00:25:31.874 --> 00:25:33.790
and there's all the
trucks and all the things,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.120
and a teamster will come around
going, Alan, hey, morning.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.522
I just wanted to--

00:25:38.522 --> 00:25:39.730
thanks for the vegan options.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.300
And there's all these kind
of closeted vegans coming out

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.203
of the closet now.

00:25:45.203 --> 00:25:47.830
They've able to wave their vegan
flag because there's actually

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.124
things they can eat.

00:25:49.124 --> 00:25:51.040
MISTRAL MYERS: You'd
think that New York would

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.240
be very friendly to vegans.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.240
New Yorkers love vegans.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.570
ALAN CUMMING: Yes, vegan power.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.350
MISTRAL MYERS: Vegan power.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.850
Does this change
your relationship

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.016
to developing the character?

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:01.720
Since you're saying that
you have a little more time

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.720
to think over the script,
you have a little bit more--

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.200
have you EPed on
shows previously

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.250
and, if not, then how does
that change your relationship

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.867
to actually acting?

00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:14.700
ALAN CUMMING: Well, I
guess I haven't done--

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.090
I've, like, produced
films and things

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.256
like that that I've been in.

00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:21.300
But the good thing about
it and how it might change

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.982
is that you actually have the
material for a longer time.

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:26.440
And I'm someone that I don't
really do lots of preparation,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.150
unless it's, you know, I've
got to learn some skill.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:35.530
And well, in this, I chatted
to a few former CIA operative,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.952
because I can understand what
it's like to be a lecturer,

00:26:37.952 --> 00:26:39.910
I can understand what
it's like to be a writer,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.860
but I don't know many spies.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.760
So it was actually really
fascinating to talk to people

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.780
and actually be able to
ask them really, sometimes,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.130
to them, peculiar questions.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.630
But just, I can't imagine it.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.460
So I that was what I did.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.390
When you have the
information for longer,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.840
the material for
longer, for me, I

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.360
feel like it's a sort of a
seeping in kind of thing.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.634
Like, often I just
let things ruminate.

00:27:03.634 --> 00:27:05.050
And then when you
come to do them,

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.020
you realize you've actually
made quite strong decisions

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.910
about things without actually
having been active about that.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.690
I feel it's like
kind of by osmosis.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.660
So, the longer you get it,
the more ingrained it gets.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.650
So I like that part of it,
just having more access

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.147
to the material for longer.

00:27:23.147 --> 00:27:25.480
And then, of course, they do
rewrites and change it all.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.047
MISTRAL MYERS: Of course.

00:27:26.047 --> 00:27:26.963
ALAN CUMMING: Showbiz.

00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:30.670
MISTRAL MYERS: So, speaking
of the other characters

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.670
who are in the show around
you, working with you.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:38.110
Did you develop those
characters understanding

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.557
that it's based upon the
novel, but this particular show

00:27:40.557 --> 00:27:42.640
version of those characters,
did you develop those

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.570
with those particular
actors in mind?

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.820
MICHAEL RAUCH: No, not at all.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.297
In fact, this is the
only time, for me,

00:27:49.297 --> 00:27:51.880
I've ever written a show knowing
who the lead was going to be.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.400
MISTRAL MYERS: Interesting.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.280
MICHAEL RAUCH: Which was
an incredible experience,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.488
because it enabled me, in
terms of writing the pilot,

00:27:56.488 --> 00:27:59.550
to write specifically to Alan.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:03.070
And as a fan of his,
to how I imagined

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.427
he would be playing the role.

00:28:04.427 --> 00:28:06.010
Every other part was
written before we

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.790
had Whoopi Goldberg, or
Bojana, or Naveen, or Sharon.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.190
So part of what you do in
the writers' room, especially

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.980
in the first season, is, after
the first couple episodes,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.020
you get a sense of
the actor's rhythms

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.314
and how they do certain things,
and you try to write to that.

00:28:21.314 --> 00:28:23.230
So that as they're
discovering the characters,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.659
you're discovering it with them.

00:28:26.659 --> 00:28:29.200
MISTRAL MYERS: I wanted to ask
you, as I'm watching the clock

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.750
and seeing that we're going to
need to leave time for everyone

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.083
to be able to ask questions,
I wanted to quickly ask you

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:35.230
about your books.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.570
So, you've written
a couple of books.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.810
You've written "Tommy's Tale,"
"You Gotta Get Bigger Dreams,"

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.670
"Not My Father's Son,"
which became a number

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.278
one New York Times
Bestseller, congratulations.

00:28:46.278 --> 00:28:48.810
ALAN CUMMING: Thanks.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.690
And I've done a
kids' book as well

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.521
called "The Adventures
of Honey &amp; Leon,"

00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:55.605
illustrated by my husband.

00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:56.729
MISTRAL MYERS: Interesting.

00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:58.420
We're going to have
to check that out.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:58.582
MICHAEL RAUCH: Beautifully
illustrated by your husband,

00:28:58.582 --> 00:28:59.195
yeah.

00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:00.990
ALAN CUMMING: And there's
a second one coming.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.360
MISTRAL MYERS: What is
the children's book about?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.693
ALAN CUMMING: Our dogs who died.

00:29:03.693 --> 00:29:06.406
Well, I mean it's about
our dogs, who died.

00:29:06.406 --> 00:29:07.430
Not our dead dogs.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.406
MICHAEL RAUCH: It's a great
children's book, yeah.

00:29:08.406 --> 00:29:10.020
MISTRAL MYERS: The death
part is not in the book, OK.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:10.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.900
ALAN CUMMING: Although when
we were doing the press

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.537
thing for it coming out, there
were two hilarious things

00:29:14.537 --> 00:29:15.120
that happened.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.844
We had to go--

00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:17.510
you know, I did all
the stuff like this.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.650
But then I also
went to some sort

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.233
of-- there was a
thing I had to go to.

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:22.805
These moms influencer bloggers.

00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:24.680
You know, moms bloggers
and things like that.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.920
I was like, what?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.620
And so I went to it, and
there's all these kids there,

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.130
and things.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.990
And I just remember
thinking, oh, I

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.700
hope they don't ask
where Honey and Leon are,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.990
the kids, because Honey
and Leon are dead.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.745
And one of them did, and I said,
oh, they can't be here today.

00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:40.620
Because they're dead.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.995
But the other thing was, it was
an interesting kind of, for me,

00:29:45.995 --> 00:29:48.620
a little bit of a wake up thing
about how weird I am and Grant,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.570
my husband, is, in
terms of our lives.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.840
Because somebody said,
where did you do this thing?

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.580
And I went, well,
it was this place,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.640
it was sort of like a doggy
day care, but it had kids.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.450
Someone said, so,
you mean a day care?

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.471
So my life is really
not about children.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.640
Yeah, so I've written one.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.920
And it's about two dogs who
live in the East Village

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.820
with their two dads.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.390
So it's a little bit of
a queer message there.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.902
And the dads travel
so much, and the dogs

00:30:22.902 --> 00:30:24.860
don't like it, because
they can't protect them.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.860
So they decide to go in
disguise and follow them

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.960
around the world.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.390
So that's that.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.630
And then the second one
is coming out next year.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.280
Grant's just finishing it.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.807
The first one is called "The
Adventures of Honey &amp; Leon,"

00:30:36.807 --> 00:30:39.140
and this one's called "Honey
&amp; Leon Take the High Road,"

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.139
and they go to Scotland.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.860
MISTRAL MYERS: Aww.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.590
So, what was it
that compelled you

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.150
to move from acting in theater,
and in film, and in television,

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.150
to writing?

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.690
What compelled you, particularly
for those personal books

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.290
that you--

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.430
ALAN CUMMING: Well,
there's two things.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.380
It wasn't really a move,
I've always written.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.110
I mean, I wrote that
novel in, like, 2002.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.420
But before that, I've written
screenplays and material

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:06.920
for myself.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.170
I used to do a stand-up
comedy thing with another guy.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.420
You know, I've written
a lot of stuff.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.370
I've always written.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.250
And I sort of wanted to write
a novel about how I felt.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.515
I mean, in a way the
novel is actually

00:31:18.515 --> 00:31:22.910
a very thinly veiled memoir
of where I was at the time.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.450
And then, of course, I wrote the
memoir "Not My Father's Son."

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.850
I actually feel it's more of a--

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.461
it's not just about books.

00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.960
It's about a thing-- like, with
also this, that movie I did,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.251
"The Anniversary Party," and
about various other things

00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:39.650
I've done, where
I feel when you--

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.840
and especially when
you get well know.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.270
And there's a thing that
happens when you actually

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.960
realize that people
are as interested if,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.260
perhaps, not more interested
in you as a person

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.220
as they are in your work.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.490
And that's something
that you have to kind of,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.600
I feel, own, take
responsibility for, and then

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.840
hopefully use it in a way that
can actually make your art,

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.390
your work better.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.210
And so, I feel that there's
various things that I've

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.580
done in my career that
I feel like-- which I've

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:16.460
used my real life,
and I also, in a way,

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.580
played with the audience's
perception of who I am.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.470
And those make, I think,
better connections between--

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.430
because I think it's an
interesting thing that when you

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.320
look at a screen, and
you see-- or a stage--

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.240
and you see people,
there's some people

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.560
you want to look at more.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.060
And I think that's
another thing you

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.670
have to try and make
sense of when you're

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.020
the person being looked at.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.520
What is it?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.130
And I feel it's authenticity,
that's what people respond to.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.195
So for me, my books
and things like that,

00:32:42.195 --> 00:32:44.870
are taking that
kind of authenticity

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:49.070
to another genre, but
also another level

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.700
of being really, really open.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.700
And it's actually a very
liberating thing to do,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.910
that when you've completely
told everyone everything

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.560
there is really
to know about you

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.970
and some areas of your life.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.620
It's actually very liberating.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.470
And then when also with
"Not My Father's Son,"

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.800
that was incredible to
realize I had inadvertently

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.660
helped lots of people
deal with things

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.360
in their life about abuse
and stuff like that.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.810
But really in, I
suppose, a selfish way,

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:19.310
it's actually about this
kind of long, several decades

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.070
thing I've got about
the work I think

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.670
works best in a certain way,
of being the most connecting

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.560
with an audience, and
the most revealing,

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.561
is work that's actually
been more about my life.

00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:30.976
MISTRAL MYERS: I
want to make sure

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:32.810
that I leave enough
time to open it up.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.050
Sorry?

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.200
MICHAEL RAUCH: You left
out one thing that he does.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.700
MISTRAL MYERS: I did?

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:34.970
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yes.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.428
Because after he writes, and
gives awards, and gets awards,

00:33:37.428 --> 00:33:41.600
and then works 13-hour days
on set, instead of sleeping,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.620
he goes to Club Cumming, which
is a nightclub that Alan opened

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.150
down in the East Village.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.460
ALAN CUMMING: Yes.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.050
And I bartend.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:49.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.440
MICHAEL RAUCH:
Bartends, and dances,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.480
and sings till like 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.150
And then he gets picked up
at 4:00 to come back to set.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.550
ALAN CUMMING: I was very good.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.310
MICHAEL RAUCH: No,
you were great.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.220
I don't know how you do it.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.090
It's unbelievable.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.589
ALAN CUMMING: But
I didn't go a lot.

00:34:01.589 --> 00:34:04.290
I only went in Fridays or, you
know, if I had a morning off.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:04.880
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yes,
that's what he says.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.810
And then I'd wake
up in the morning,

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.239
and I'd go on Instagram,
and there'd shots of him,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.414
like, with a mic in
his hand and-- yeah.

00:34:11.414 --> 00:34:13.330
ALAN CUMMING: This is a
terrible thing to say,

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.690
but most people I
know who are actors

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.340
have been a barman, or a waiter,
or a barman, or something.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.428
And I've never done that.

00:34:21.428 --> 00:34:22.719
I've always just been an actor.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.210
And I've actually secretly
yearned to be a bartender.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.400
And now I can,
because I own a bar.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.070
It's so great.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.120
And also, I don't have to
be particularly good either,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:32.800
because I just--

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.315
MICHAEL RAUCH: No, you made
me a delicious drink at--

00:34:34.315 --> 00:34:35.270
ALAN CUMMING: See, I-- yeah.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.280
But there's some-- there's a
thing, there's a little card,

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.830
like that, on the bar, which has
got the house special drinks.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.760
And I-- sometimes people ask
for them, and I'm like, uh-huh,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.260
yes, yes, sure, I
can get you that.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.989
And after I've got to take
that thing and look at it,

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:45.989
look at the ingredients.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.969
And I just do it.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.060
But I'm kind of a sloppy
but heavyhanded barman,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.560
so people don't mind.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.860
MISTRAL MYERS: I feel like
that's a good reason for all

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.310
of us to go.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.650
ALAN CUMMING: Yes, come on down.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:54.710
MISTRAL MYERS: Field trip?

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.730
MICHAEL RAUCH: It's
a great club, yeah.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:56.300
ALAN CUMMING: It's such fun.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.630
MISTRAL MYERS: That's fantastic.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.130
ALAN CUMMING:
Actually, I think it--

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.730
because I include Club
Cumming in the list of things

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.044
that I was just talking about.

00:35:03.044 --> 00:35:04.460
I know this sounds
funny, but I do

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.390
feel it's my greatest
creative achievement.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.290
Because I've actually
wanted a spirit and a mood.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.650
I imagined a spirit and a
mood of a place to happen,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.460
and it happened.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.660
Because I kind of, like, put the
word out and kind of created it

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.140
in the ether in a way.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.390
Obviously, I wrote things
about how I wanted it to be,

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.556
and I kind of gave interviews,
and things like that.

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:27.770
But it's actually-- that
spirit has really happened.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.652
And it's a place of
people of all ages,

00:35:29.652 --> 00:35:30.860
and genders, and sexualities.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.350
And there's performance, and
there's dance, and it's sexy,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.980
but it's kind of inclusive
in all sorts of ways.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.460
And it's just kindness
is the biggest--

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.230
kindness and no judgment
are the kind of--

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.240
We did a screening of the
"Spice World," the movie.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.730
25th anniversary of "Spice
World," the movie, in which I

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.045
have a leading role, thank you.

00:35:51.045 --> 00:35:51.480
MISTRAL MYERS: Which
you were in, yes.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.770
ALAN CUMMING: And so it
was a 25th anniversary

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.320
with a screening
of that, and we had

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.611
a come dressed as your favorite
Spice Girl competition.

00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:58.430
So I was judging
it a little drunk,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.140
and the first boy,
he was-- there

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.090
was a couple of Baby Spices.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.180
And the first boy that did it--

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.460
and it's a tiny little stage.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.620
And I said, so, where are you
on the Baby Spice spectrum?

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.487
And he said something mean about
the other Baby Spice person.

00:36:13.487 --> 00:36:15.070
And the audience
were a bit [GROANS]..

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.386
And I went, oh, gosh,
I'm going to have to ask

00:36:17.386 --> 00:36:18.510
you to leave the stage now.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.610
And he was like, what?

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.490
And I went, that did not meet
the level of kindness that

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.395
is expected at Club Cumming,
and so you're disqualified

00:36:25.395 --> 00:36:26.270
from the competition.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.478
He was like, are you serious?

00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:29.120
I went, yes, please
leave the stage.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.182
And everyone cheered.

00:36:30.182 --> 00:36:31.640
And then what was
great was-- well,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.532
it wasn't great-- but he
went off stage, and fell off

00:36:34.532 --> 00:36:35.240
and cut his knee.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.640
And so Daniel, my partner
in the bar, looked up

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.570
and he went, spice karma.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.010
Then Daniel was putting
vodka on his knee.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.890
And this boy dressed as Baby
Spice was getting vodka,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.000
wasting vodka on his knee.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.100
But I just, like, that's
really important to me.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.970
I don't want that
bad energy in my bar,

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:54.990
do you know what I mean?

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.930
I'm just like, no.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.650
The staff know that, too.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.530
If I hear-- if any of us who
run it hear of people being mean

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.540
to customers, or just
being mean in general--

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.670
and I don't mean you
need to be like a robot.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.400
Just actually be kind, you know?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.235
So that's very important to me.

00:37:12.235 --> 00:37:14.360
MISTRAL MYERS: Last question
is, do you sleep ever?

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:14.882
ALAN CUMMING: I do, I do.

00:37:14.882 --> 00:37:15.967
MISTRAL MYERS: Do you,
like, eat or take breaks?

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:16.020
ALAN CUMMING: I do, actually.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.600
MISTRAL MYERS: Or no, it's
just work around the clock?

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.766
ALAN CUMMING: No, I'm very--

00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:21.389
I mean, I have a lot going
on, but I'm very focused.

00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:22.430
I think that's the thing.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.670
I really focus on where
I am, what I'm doing.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.674
Then I focus on fun
as well, you know.

00:37:30.674 --> 00:37:31.590
And I'm a good napper.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.210
I think you've got to be.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.520
To do what I do, you've
got to be a good napper.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:34.830
MISTRAL MYERS: That's key.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.470
ALAN CUMMING: And I could
be shooting a scene,

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.546
and there'll be like
20 minutes of lighting,

00:37:38.546 --> 00:37:40.420
I'll go up and sleep
for 15 of those minutes.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.330
MISTRAL MYERS: Googlers
know all about that.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.190
We have nap pods here,
and I legitimately--

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.240
ALAN CUMMING: I really would
like to see one of those.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:44.747
I heard tale of your pods.

00:37:44.747 --> 00:37:44.963
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah, we'll
take you to see one afterwards,

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:45.980
definitely.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.480
It's very important
when you've been

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.430
doing a long stretch
of coding, and you just

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.361
need a quick little.

00:37:50.361 --> 00:37:51.735
ALAN CUMMING: I
also think I saw,

00:37:51.735 --> 00:37:53.070
like, you've got the juice
bar, you've got the rest,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.750
you've got all these things.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.520
It's all just, like, to
lure you to stay here

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.310
for as long as possible.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.840
Is that what it?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.722
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah, of course.

00:37:57.722 --> 00:37:58.130
Naturally.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.350
ALAN CUMMING: And so, you can
actually sleep here as well.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:37:59.610
MISTRAL MYERS: Right.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.272
ALAN CUMMING: Is
there a launderette?

00:38:01.272 --> 00:38:02.022
MISTRAL MYERS: Uh.

00:38:02.022 --> 00:38:03.170
ALAN CUMMING: So, you've
got a laundrette or no?

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.390
MISTRAL MYERS: No, but I'm
sure there's one nearby.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.641
ALAN CUMMING: And you
should have, like, a bodega.

00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:07.748
A "bo-doogle-a."

00:38:07.748 --> 00:38:11.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.490
I'm on a roll, Michael.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.022
MISTRAL MYERS: So, let's
open it up to all of you

00:38:17.022 --> 00:38:17.730
to ask questions.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.855
Please go up to the mics
on either side of the room

00:38:19.855 --> 00:38:23.302
so that we can capture
you and hear you properly.

00:38:23.302 --> 00:38:25.410
You wanna line up?

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.754
Hi.

00:38:26.754 --> 00:38:29.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.540
Alan, I loved your
performance back in 2013

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.324
in "Macbeth" at the Barrymore.

00:38:34.324 --> 00:38:35.490
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, thank you.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.422
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:36.422 --> 00:38:37.001
Thank you.

00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:39.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's one of
the favorite live performances

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.958
I've seen you do,
where you played,

00:38:40.958 --> 00:38:42.720
like, literally every
one in "Macbeth."

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.580
It was quite astounding.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.690
I have a question about the plot
in the pilot that we just saw.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.250
I was curious as to,
how did you decide

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:59.131
when and how you revealed that
you were a former CIA agent?

00:38:59.131 --> 00:39:00.880
Because I thought it
was very interesting,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.590
kind of the timing
of when you said it.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.370
And it was sort of,
like, nonchalant.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.060
But I was curious as to why
it was revealed in the pilot,

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.540
and why not, like, buried
for a later episode?

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.206
ALAN CUMMING: I guess because, I
mean-- well, that would be more

00:39:17.206 --> 00:39:17.970
a you type of question.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.678
I mean, my idea--

00:39:18.678 --> 00:39:20.920
well, this is what I think,
is that it's actually

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.020
quite important in
terms of who he is,

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.360
that he's got that background
that is sort of very

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.250
different to what you might
think on the initial impression

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.750
of him.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.550
A lot of the time-- as will come
clear as the series goes on--

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.542
a lot of the time,
Naveen's character

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.750
helps him out with getting
information that might not

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.310
be available to the NYPD.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.590
And so his whole CIA
background becomes

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.444
kind of an issue in terms of how
he can work with Bojana, but--

00:39:48.444 --> 00:39:50.110
MICHAEL RAUCH: It
also, I think, for him

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.264
to work with the homicide
division of NYPD,

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:53.680
for the audience
to know that he's

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.100
got a background
in chasing bad guys

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.760
helps make it a
lot more credible.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.820
ALAN CUMMING: Yeah,
he's not just a--

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.060
MICHAEL RAUCH: And I don't
want to rewrite your question,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.980
but I was really hoping
you were going to say,

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.280
you know, I saw you
do "Macbeth" in 2013,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.610
it was really incredible.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.776
Would you do it now, please?

00:40:08.776 --> 00:40:10.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.889
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we want
the Lady Macbeth soliloquy.

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.430
ALAN CUMMING: Come, you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.850
Unsex me here, and
fill me from the top

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.922
to the toe top-full
of direst cruelty.

00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:25.030
Um, something my blood.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.787
Stop up the access and passage
to remorse [MUMBLES] something

00:40:28.787 --> 00:40:29.620
compunctious nature.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.850
Shake my fell purpose.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:36.118
Come, thick night, and pall me
in the dunnest smoke of hell.

00:40:36.118 --> 00:40:37.240
Um, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.450
MICHAEL RAUCH: Yeah.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.283
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah!

00:40:38.283 --> 00:40:40.649
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:40.649 --> 00:40:42.440
MICHAEL RAUCH: Who is
the cartoon character

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.740
over the shoulder that you did?

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.454
You know, the-- in that movie?

00:40:45.454 --> 00:40:46.620
ALAN CUMMING: In what movie?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.036
MICHAEL RAUCH: You
were, like, a--

00:40:48.036 --> 00:40:51.010
because I want you to do
that now, after "Macbeth."

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.160
You did that cartoon--

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.970
you know, you, uh--

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:53.892
I'll remember it.

00:40:53.892 --> 00:40:54.850
Onto the next question.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:55.350
ALAN CUMMING: On my shoulder?

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.050
MICHAEL RAUCH: It was so funny.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:56.550
No, no, no.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.444
It was in a movie.

00:40:57.444 --> 00:40:58.860
ALAN CUMMING: Oh,
the Great Gazoo.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.470
MICHAEL RAUCH: Great Gazoo, yes.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.520
Going to go from Lady
Macbeth to the Great Gazoo.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.490
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, what was he--

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.460
MICHAEL RAUCH: The
range of Alan Cumming.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.270
ALAN CUMMING: Yeah,
what was it, again?

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:06.250
Like, dum-dums.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.410
It was probably dum-dums, yeah.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.771
A range.

00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:12.770
MISTRAL MYERS: Go ahead.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:13.311
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:15.090
Thank you both for being here.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.910
My question is actually
very much related

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:22.050
to the previous one, but
I'll go one step further.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.140
So, the pilot introduces
the lead character

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.230
as this mysterious guy,
but paradoxically we

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.910
see a lot of him.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.780
I mean, a lot about his life.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.810
We know that he
works for the CIA.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.490
And we also know
that he's happily

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.080
married to a man, which I feel
like in a regular TV show,

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.440
that fact would stay
hidden for a bit longer.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.560
So is the lead character
really that mysterious?

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.900
How much more should we
expect from the next episodes?

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.910
I must admit that I haven't
read the novels, so, I'll--

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.730
yeah.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.630
ALAN CUMMING: One in every 17
readers in America has, but--

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.940
well, I mean, I think--

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.720
it's a pilot.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.570
You've got to, like, say as much
as you can about the characters

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.680
to get people interested.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.110
You know what I mean?

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.276
So he's not that mysterious.

00:42:11.276 --> 00:42:12.640
You know a lot about him.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.820
But that's what pilots are.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.380
That's how you--
otherwise, you might not--

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.270
you've got to, like, fling
stuff at the audience a bit.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.300
But the thing I think--

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.750
and I guess we do know, and in
a broad way, all these facets.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.500
But actually, like,
you know, I was saying

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.340
that thing about the hen.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.340
That's, for me, it's hilarious.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.048
Like, I suddenly get
a script and go, oh,

00:42:34.048 --> 00:42:36.560
I was once in Hong Kong
doing a blah, blah.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.635
That part of it, I think,
there's much more in.

00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:42.300
And there's also actually
more about his family

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.604
that you don't know yet.

00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:48.020
The good thing about having
so many different facets, even

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.890
though you kind of show
your cards a little,

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:58.070
is that there's a wider or
a bigger suite to go to.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:03.800
But yeah, I think
that his mystery isn't

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.315
that he's got hidden depths.

00:43:06.315 --> 00:43:07.940
Would you say, Michael,
as the creator?

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.898
MICHAEL RAUCH: I agree.

00:43:08.898 --> 00:43:11.542
I'd also say that, although
you in the audience know it,

00:43:11.542 --> 00:43:12.500
the cops don't know it.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.750
So everyone he's working
with doesn't know his past,

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.610
doesn't know he worked
for the CIA, which

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.130
obviously would change their
perception of him enormously.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.505
So that's something that we
play with in terms of keeping

00:43:21.505 --> 00:43:22.580
the secret from them.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.320
And Lizzie getting
involved in that

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.865
also, because I think that
her boss, the lieutenant,

00:43:27.865 --> 00:43:29.990
would have a very different
take on the information

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.850
they're getting
if she knew where

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:32.957
they were getting it from.

00:43:32.957 --> 00:43:34.790
AUDIENCE: It was such
a privilege seeing you

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.230
in "Macbeth," and I'd love
to see you on stage again.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.780
Is there a project that
you have coming up,

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.420
and/or is there something that
you're really eyeing to play

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.392
in the future on Broadway?

00:43:46.392 --> 00:43:47.850
ALAN CUMMING: I
mean, we're waiting

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.040
to see if this goes again.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.410
So that kind of makes my long
term planning rather difficult.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.920
So if that's the case, then we'd
start shooting again in July.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.470
But I do my concerts.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.870
Like I'm doing a new
show called "Alan

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.396
Cumming, Legal Immigrant."

00:44:05.396 --> 00:44:06.770
It's sort of like
a cabaret show.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.103
My last one was called "Alan
Cumming Sings Sappy Songs."

00:44:09.103 --> 00:44:11.990
And I'm doing a really
great thing, actually.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.200
We're doing some shows on
tour, but then in June we're

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.260
doing two weeks
here in New York.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.630
Because with the
last show, I began it

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.600
at the Cafe Carlyle,
which is an amazing sort

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.830
of historical cabaret
space to play at,

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.810
but it's very expensive.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.879
And then we did Carnegie
Hall, which is also,

00:44:31.879 --> 00:44:33.170
of course, an incredible thing.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.730
But I was just like,
none of my friends

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.688
can afford to come and
see me doing this thing.

00:44:36.688 --> 00:44:39.080
So I finished it in
December at Joe's Pub,

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.079
and we did a few
nights at Joe's Pub.

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:43.120
So now, with the new one,
with "Legal Immigrant,"

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.036
I'm doing this great
thing-- and I can't quite

00:44:45.036 --> 00:44:47.750
believe they let me-- is
that we're doing an 8:45

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.170
show at Cafe Carlyle, and then
a midnight show at Joe's Pub

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.550
every night for two weeks.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.750
So, I feel like I'm downtown
boy living in an uptown world.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.960
So that'll be the
next thing that I'll

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.950
be performing here in New
York, and on some dates

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.420
throughout around America.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:09.470
And then after the middle of
July, it's kind of all on hold.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.980
I've got a few gigs,
actually, on weekends.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.590
There's ones like
the Kennedy Center.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:19.900
You can't turn down
the Kennedy Center.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.316
MICHAEL RAUCH: You can't turn
down the Kennedy Center, no.

00:45:22.316 --> 00:45:26.300
ALAN CUMMING: But in terms
of plays, there's nothing--

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.211
there's a couple of things I'm
sort of loosely attached to.

00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.960
And there's definitely
people, like John--

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.004
talking about
"Macbeth"-- oh, you were.

00:45:34.004 --> 00:45:35.420
John Tiffany, one
of the directors

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.610
of that, who is here
in town, actually,

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.680
is just directing that Harry
Potter play that's coming on.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.370
I just love him.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.750
We've done a few shows together.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.570
He's in "The Bacchae" that I
did when I played Dionysus.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.870
And I just really want to
do something with him again.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.530
It's been a few
years now, and I feel

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:54.750
I haven't actually got
anything in the works with him.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.650
And so I kind of miss
that sort of urgency.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:03.150
But yeah, you know, it's
definitely in my periphery

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.690
that I'll be back on stage.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.630
AUDIENCE: Well, we can't wait
to see you on a bigger stage

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:07.005
again.

00:46:07.005 --> 00:46:08.004
ALAN CUMMING: Thank you.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.394
Oh, there's one more.

00:46:12.394 --> 00:46:13.560
MISTRAL MYERS: One more, oh.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.101
AUDIENCE: So, this
one's for Michael.

00:46:15.101 --> 00:46:17.640
But Alan, I have to say, you're
one of my favorite people

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.690
to follow on Instagram.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.005
ALAN CUMMING: Oh, thanks.

00:46:19.005 --> 00:46:21.420
AUDIENCE: And I hope to
see at Club Cummings.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.724
ALAN CUMMING: Cumming,
Cumming, -ming, -ing, -ing.

00:46:23.724 --> 00:46:24.640
AUDIENCE: Oh, Cumming.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.570
Oh.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.390
So, in terms of writing
for a character where

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.935
you know who the actor is,
what would you say are some

00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:34.560
of the cool parts of
that, and anything

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.579
you need to be mindful of?

00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:38.370
MICHAEL RAUCH: I'll
answer the second part.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.170
I think being
mindful of not trying

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.300
to repeat what you've
seen him do before

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.760
and what you've fallen in
love with the actor doing,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.250
so you're not just going
down the easy route.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.620
But, you know, when I write,
I don't think of actors.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.786
So I just create a
character and follow it.

00:46:53.786 --> 00:46:55.410
But to be able to
have someone in mind,

00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.825
and visualize them, and have an
idea of what their rhythm is.

00:47:00.825 --> 00:47:03.930
And, I mean, Alan was talking
about not having a process,

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.050
and I respect that 100%.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.860
But someone with
that type of talent,

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.110
there is a magic that happens.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.690
And you watch them
because there's

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.990
something going on that
makes you need to watch them.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.000
And Alan has that.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.660
So, to be able write a
character and imagine them

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.250
in a bespoke tweed suit
with a pocket square,

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.107
and at the same
time pull out a gun,

00:47:31.107 --> 00:47:33.690
I don't think there's a lot of
people who could pull that off.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.190
So, I don't know
if I would have had

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:40.110
the confidence to do that if
I didn't know it was Alan.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.500
I imagine Alan
dressed like that.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.722
In fact, we had this
Christmas party at CBS

00:47:44.722 --> 00:47:46.430
that we had to-- we
didn't have to go to,

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.431
but you had to go to it.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.471
ALAN CUMMING: You had to.

00:47:48.471 --> 00:47:51.150
MICHAEL RAUCH: And we happened
to be shooting two blocks away

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.240
from the party so that we could
get the actors to the party.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.724
So, we shooting
the finale, and it

00:47:56.724 --> 00:47:58.890
was really important to get
there at a certain time.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.120
And I just said to Alan--

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.370
he wrapped-- I was, like,
we're still shooting.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.320
I was like, listen, can
we get there quickly,

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.700
can you just go
in your wardrobe.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.170
You know, he's wearing
this beautiful suit

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.280
and these great shoes.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.224
And he was like, I'd rather
just get in my clothes.

00:48:11.224 --> 00:48:12.640
I was like, what's
the difference,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.950
you're in this beautiful suit.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.250
And he was like, let
me just quickly change.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:16.500
So he quickly changes.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.127
And all of a sudden, it's a
totally different human being.

00:48:19.127 --> 00:48:20.460
And I forgot that that was Alan.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.680
You know, with his spiky
hair, and a t-shirt,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.000
and these great pants.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.660
And so, I imagined the other
guy, and Alan became that guy.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.610
And so it just became a
much more enjoyable way

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.470
to think about it.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:34.610
Do you write?

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.340
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:35.850
I'm just interested.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:36.360
MICHAEL RAUCH: You
know, you're just

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.550
trying to figure out
when you're coming up

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.966
with a character all these
little different parts of them.

00:48:39.966 --> 00:48:41.910
And when you have a
head start, especially

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.464
this type of head start, it
makes it much more enjoyable.

00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:46.880
ALAN CUMMING: And I think it's
funny as well that I feel--

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.210
obviously, I sound and look
very different to the person

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.980
you saw earlier on the screen.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.265
And we haven't shot it, we
were finished in December.

00:48:56.265 --> 00:48:58.890
So it's like a couple of months
now, a few months away from it.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.220
I've done other
things in between.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.803
That it's actually crazy-- like,
just today, doing talk shows,

00:49:02.803 --> 00:49:05.250
they play a little
clips of the show.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.110
And I'm like, oh,
yeah, that's funny.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.110
Oh, I forgot about that.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.680
And actually, when you're
in it, it's so easy,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.077
and kind of you're
just that person,

00:49:13.077 --> 00:49:14.910
and you know that you
have all these traits,

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.159
and you have all these things.

00:49:16.159 --> 00:49:18.139
And actually standing
apart from it,

00:49:18.139 --> 00:49:20.305
it's sort of, you look back
and think, I don't-- oh,

00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:22.049
I can't remember
what that was like.

00:49:22.049 --> 00:49:24.090
But the great thing about
this character, I feel,

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:29.327
is that there's a multitude
of different layers.

00:49:29.327 --> 00:49:31.410
It's actually something
I'm really looking forward

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:34.650
to going back to explore more.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.880
I think there's a lot of
stuff that we could do.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.840
And that's really
exciting to me, to go back

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.410
and try and do that.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.300
MICHAEL RAUCH: He's
very stuffy in the show.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.710
And it just brings
so much comedy

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.110
to see him be stuffy
and unhappy about when

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.440
things don't go his way.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.262
And it's so unlike
how he is in real life

00:49:52.262 --> 00:49:53.970
that you just want to
keep writing to it,

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.287
because it's so absurd to
get to see him do that.

00:49:56.287 --> 00:49:57.870
ALAN CUMMING: And
then when we dance--

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.970
we have this thing
where one of the--

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.670
there's probably about three
cameras all going at once.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.670
And they have the dolly.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.130
You know, the thing
they'd push like that.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.960
And they have these
little, you know,

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.165
like Alexa-- oh, what's
the Google version?

00:50:09.165 --> 00:50:10.290
MISTRAL MYERS: Google Home.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:10.500
ALAN CUMMING: What?

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.310
MISTRAL MYERS: Google Home.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.060
ALAN CUMMING: Google Hum?

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.030
MISTRAL MYERS: Google Home.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.238
ALAN CUMMING: Home, oh I see.

00:50:14.238 --> 00:50:14.890
Google Hum.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:17.040
Bit of a Google Hum.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.210
Well, anyway, imagine a
Google Home on the dolly.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.120
And in between takes,
we would dance.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.870
Like, just dance like crazy.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:26.640
The whole crew.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.410
Sometimes, to keep warm.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.519
Just on the stages,
that would be our thing,

00:50:30.519 --> 00:50:31.560
we'd just be like mm-hmm.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.870
And you can tell different
directors who are coming

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.220
in were like, what's going on?

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.270
They'd come up to
give me a note,

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:37.830
and I'm like,
uh-huh, yeah, what?

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:38.100
Oh, sure.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:38.891
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:40.150
Yeah, right, OK.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:42.430
And it was a really great
thing, because also I

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:45.280
loved how many people
would post things of it.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.890
To see me and Bojana, in the
police station, for example,

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.090
me dressed in my sort
of fuddy-duddy way

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:56.540
rocking out to, like,
Black Box from, like, 1998.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.530
It's really fun.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.738
And I think that's the thing.

00:50:58.738 --> 00:51:03.560
You've got to try
and be both things.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.350
Go straight for that character,
but also retain your own self.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.280
And again, that's also
the thing but making

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.145
the crew feel that
everyone joins,

00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:12.520
and everyone does
the same thing,

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.780
and everyone feels good
about coming to work.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.440
Because there's not
many shoots I've

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.830
been on where the leading
actor kind of demands

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:25.300
that you dance between takes.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:25.980
Or you're fired!

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:29.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.700
I need to ask you
about "The Good Wife."

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:37.380
So, big fan of the series,
and, of course, Eli.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.360
I want to ask you how you
feel about the show ending,

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.690
and also will we see
Eli on the spin-off?

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.330
Because I know his
daughter's there, Melissa.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.110
But will we see you
in the second season?

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:51.310
ALAN CUMMING: Ehm,
no, is the answer.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:58.030
There was talk of it, but some
technical issues happened.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.050
See, I feel like--

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.660
I think there's a thing in
America where people aren't

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.322
good about ending things.

00:52:06.322 --> 00:52:08.530
And I think it's all about
sort of-- when something's

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:13.112
a success, you just
whip it until it falls--

00:52:13.112 --> 00:52:15.320
or until you jump the shark,
that's what you call it,

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.330
doesn't it?

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:18.470
So I felt like when
"The Good Wife" ended,

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.470
I thought it was the
perfect time for it to end.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.800
I thought the arc of
the story was great.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.280
It was the creators
who were still

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.863
working on the show who did that
and ended it how they wanted.

00:52:26.863 --> 00:52:30.166
It wasn't kind of
just, you know--

00:52:30.166 --> 00:52:32.090
in a funny way, I feel
like on television,

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.965
especially on network
television, what you're

00:52:33.965 --> 00:52:35.710
doing is just making
stuff to fill up

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.690
the gaps between
the commercials.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.600
So when you have a chance
to actually really craft

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.979
something, I think part of the
craft is to kill it as well.

00:52:44.979 --> 00:52:45.520
Or to end it.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.880
Maybe kill is the wrong word.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.380
So I was actually really glad
that "The Good Wife" finished.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.589
I was ready to go as well.

00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:52.380
I was going to leave,
and then they told me

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.380
they were ending it, so I
stayed for the last season.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.130
So that was great.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.980
But then when this
spin-off thing came up,

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.140
"The Good Fight,"
and I knew they

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.610
were going to do that, I
was like, oh, that's nice.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:05.270
But then when we were shooting
our show, a lot of the people

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.720
were in the same sound stage,
and some of the same crew

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.679
had been working on it.

00:53:08.679 --> 00:53:10.178
I was like, oh, so
what's happening?

00:53:10.178 --> 00:53:10.730
Oh, really?

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:11.390
Oh.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:12.790
Well, my daughter's in it.

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.870
Did they mention me ever?

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.760
Did they mention Eli?

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.680
It was kind of funny.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.763
It got me all going again.

00:53:17.763 --> 00:53:20.830
And actually it'd be quite
funny to go back and do Eli.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:21.871
MISTRAL MYERS: All right.

00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:24.580
Well, in our last minute
or two, without giving away

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.380
too many spoilers,
can you just let

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.530
us know what we should
expect from the upcoming

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.337
season of "Instinct"?

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.790
ALAN CUMMING: At
one point, I shoot

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:41.830
a glass of poisoned iced tea
out of Whoopi Goldberg's hand,

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:43.020
thereby saving her life.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:45.990
How is that?

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.700
MISTRAL MYERS: That is the
perfect way to end this.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.910
I can't wait to see it.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.350
ALAN CUMMING:
That's basically it.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.141
MISTRAL MYERS: Please
give everyone a round

00:53:54.141 --> 00:53:55.660
of applause for our two guests.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.310
[APPLAUSE]
