00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.666
Here is an example from UML. It concerns a a machine,

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:10.075
that's either heating or cooling. It's some kind of air-conditioning system.

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:16.081
And on the lower right is a nested state called heating.

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.632
Heating is just a two state sub-system.

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:23.976
One of the states is activating, and the others is called act,

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:29.160
active. Okay, it's got a default state which is the activating state, and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.630
it's got a transition which occurs when the activating is ready.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.680
And it the action that takes place is to, to turn things on.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.630
This nested state is part of the larger system, which at the top

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.010
level has three important states. It has an idol state, a cooling state, and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.850
this nested heating state. The default state for the larger machine is idle, and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.387
the final state is a shutdown state. And there are transitions

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:06.820
between the various outer states. But notice also the transitions that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.780
from the nested heating state, go only to the boundary of that state and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.670
not into the internals of that state. Thereby saving duplicate copies

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.980
of the lines coming from each of the internal states in the heating state.
