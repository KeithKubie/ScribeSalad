00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:06.900
PAVNI DIWANJI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.840
I'm Pavni.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.890
I am a VP of Engineering
here, leading Project Unicorn

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.570
on kids and families.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.060
And I am just absolutely
thrilled to be here.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.580
We have two very special guests
for Talks@Google, as you know.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.350
We get a lot of amazing actors
and musicians and artists here,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.260
but today I think is
very, very special,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.659
as we have Ajay and Kajol.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.370
They have been entertained us in
Bollywood for almost 25 years.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.350
They have won numerous Filmfare
Awards and Padam Shris,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.721
so I am absolutely
thrilled to have them here.

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.220
And they're going to be talking
to us about their new movie,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.020
"Shivaay."

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.440
The movie's scheduled to
come out in Diwali time.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.420
So please join me and
show your enthusiasm

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.940
in welcoming Ajay and Kajol.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.986
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:06.230
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Kajol!

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.596
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:09.970
PAVNI DIWANJI:
Welcome to Google.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.890
AJAY DEVGN: Thank you so much.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.410
KAJOL: Thank you so much.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.570
PAVNI DIWANJI: We are thrilled
to be here, and have you here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.865
As you can see, we have
several hundred Googlers here,

00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:19.150
and watching us on live stream,
and then later we're also

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.510
going to be posting on YouTube.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.614
And so we're-- the company's
excited to be hosting you.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:24.780
KAJOL: Thank you, thank you.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.960
PAVNI DIWANJI: And I am, too,
as you can tell. [LAUGHS]

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.330
So, I think my first
question, I was

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.790
going to lead with you, Ajay.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.090
Is it your first
visit to the Bay Area,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.465
to the tech capital
of the world?

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:38.256
AJAY DEVGN: Ah, no.

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:39.540
But I've come after years.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.360
PAVNI DIWANJI: After years?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.735
AJAY DEVGN: Yeah.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.600
I mean, everything has
changed, so, technically, I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.020
would say it's my first visit.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.257
PAVNI DIWANJI: [LAUGHS]
How are you finding it?

00:01:46.257 --> 00:01:47.840
AJAY DEVGN: I've
hardly seen anything.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.210
I mean, it's fabulous.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.000
But I've just entered.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.730
And it's been just
like three hours.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.510
We just went to--

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.670
KAJOL: We just landed, like we
landed in the morning, yeah,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.419
this morning, so--

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.240
PAVNI DIWANJI: And I know you
stayed for a while in Bay Area

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.799
with "My Name Is Khan."

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.590
KAJOL: Yes, we did.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.510
PAVNI DIWANJI: San Francisco,
and it was lovely to see--

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.130
KAJOL: I love San
Francisco, I have to say.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.540
PAVNI DIWANJI: --the
city through your eyes.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.030
KAJOL: Yes.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.305
It's one of my favorite
cities in the world.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:09.520
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.270
KAJOL: I love it.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.875
Love it.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.760
PAVNI DIWANJI: So what's
your favorite place?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.710
People are asking.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.763
Like, they want to go see
Kajol's favorite place.

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:18.559
KAJOL: [LAUGHS]
My favorite place?

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:19.100
I don't know.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.936
Because I think
San Francisco's one

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.780
of those wonderful
combination cities.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.180
It's just got the best of
Europe, America, and it's just,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.230
it's so perfect.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.030
I mean, you have the
most amazing houses.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.870
You have the most amazing food.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.300
AJAY DEVGN: It is [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.290
KAJOL: You're the
most amazing people.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.650
Thank you so much
for all you guys.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.920
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.670
KAJOL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.350
PAVNI DIWANJI: So,
as you might know,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.490
YouTube is part of Google.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.790
And you have a very, very
popular channel on YouTube.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.700
And so we call-- we can, I
think, pretty much safely

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.620
call him a YouTuber.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.140
What do you guys think?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.010
Yeah.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.700
So, and recently, I know you
released the wonderful trailer

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.100
of your film, "Shivaay," on it.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.360
And I was looking,
and it quickly

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.910
got like 20 million views,
which is quite impressive.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.760
So question for you is, how
has your YouTube journey

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.670
been so far?

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.010
AJAY DEVGN: It's been fabulous.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.447
I think I was late entering
it, but now that I'm in,

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:24.030
it's fabulous.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.300
And nowadays, most of
the time on YouTube.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.030
PAVNI DIWANJI: So, you know,
we have some Google engineers,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.855
and, I think, YouTube
engineers, too, watching.

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:37.410
And so, as I was saying,
if you have some wish list,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.410
they might say make it.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.707
You can say make it so to them,
and they might actually make--

00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:42.331
AJAY DEVGN: OK.

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:45.010
So let me think of something,
and then I'll let you know.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.460
PAVNI DIWANJI: Something
really difficult.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.970
So, speaking of YouTube,
one of the things,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.690
we heard a lot of questions, and
we can't accommodate everyone,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.500
so we picked a few
questions on the video.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.020
And speaking of videos, one of
the super-fans of yours, Kajol,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.950
has submitted a video
question for you today.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.560
She's like one of the
biggest fan, [? Re Re Lee. ?]

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.350
She's a Googler
in Mountain View.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.160
And so we would love to roll
the video question, if we can.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.980
[? RE RE LEE: Hi. ?] My name
is [? Re Re. ?] I'm a huge fan

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.312
of Kajol's because
of her movie, "DDLJ,"

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:23.770
which really got
me into Bollywood.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.048
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.964
[? RE RE LEE: But I was ?]
wondering, for her,

00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:30.060
what her thought process is when
she's deciding which project

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.870
and movie to be in?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.880
Also, which of those is
her favorite, and why?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.420
Thank you.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.280
KAJOL: Ah, OK.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.460
What is my thought process?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.650
You know, I'm a big reader.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.634
I love to read.

00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:46.050
I've been one of those voracious
readers from the time-- I

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.383
think, my mother tells me,
from the time that I was two,

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:50.670
I was reading the
newspaper, the headlines

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.660
of the newspaper at that age.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.810
So I love, love, love to read.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.300
And when I listen
to a script, that's

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.380
really what I'm expecting
the script to be.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.130
I'm expecting it to
be my favorite book.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.370
And if it is, if it comes up
to that level, then I'm like,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.980
OK, I'll do your film.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.640
And if it doesn't, which most of
the time it doesn't, you know,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.480
I'm like, ah, OK.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.170
Not so great at
the end of the day.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.320
So yeah.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.150
That's really my first
and only criteria,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.110
that it should be
an amazing book.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.360
PAVNI DIWANJI: That's awesome.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.110
That you go in with a completely
open mind, and read a book.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.670
Awesome.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.930
Going along, I think
we-- I understand

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.090
that you've been on a whirlwind
tour here for the movie.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.510
And can you tell us a
little bit about the tour?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.900
And also, how the
film came about?

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.650
AJAY DEVGN: This tour
has been very short.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.510
I mean, day before yesterday,
we landed in New York.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.047
Yesterday morning,
we were in Houston.

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:53.089
KAJOL: We were in Dallas.

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.838
AJAY DEVGN: We were
in Dallas and Chicago.

00:05:54.838 --> 00:05:56.460
And I'll be here,
and leaving tonight.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.650
I'm going back to India.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.025
Because I have to
finish my film,

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.600
so I can't afford
staying for another day.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.217
So this has been my
journey right now.

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:05.050
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.230
Tell us what brought it on.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.020
How did you conceive
of the idea?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.300
AJAY DEVGN: It was a basic
idea which inspired me,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.360
because I would like to make
films which really touch

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.260
your heart, and this was
something-- not the story,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.620
but the relationship.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.120
It's about the
relationship I speak about,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.650
which is very close to my heart.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.060
And that's how the idea started.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.350
And I had read an article
which really inspired me.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.040
So we started working on it.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.050
And that's how the
whole process started.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.150
And once we got
the script right,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.980
and then I really felt that I
need to take this film beyond,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.340
because why do people have to
turn around and say that we

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.530
can't do this in our country?

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.550
We can't make films at par.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.680
But I would say,
want to make better

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.130
than world cinema
or Hollywood films.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.950
And that's how the
whole process started.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.200
PAVNI DIWANJI: So it's like
a true made-in-India film.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.408
AJAY DEVGN: I would say that.

00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:10.140
I would say.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.931
PAVNI DIWANJI: Wow.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.870
Let's roll the
trailer, and then we

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.970
can talk a little
bit more about.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.316

AJAY DEVGN: Thank you so much.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.390
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think
it's very impressive.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:13.460
I was wondering, we are here
at Google, the heart of tech,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.310
and maybe you can take
us through your journey

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.970
on how you actually managed
to make a film like this.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.325
AJAY DEVGN: I think how, I
would like to tell you all

00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:24.960
after I release the film first.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.980
Because I should not
give out so many secrets.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.330
But yes, we worked
very hard on it.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.780
And our biggest
challenge, I would say,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.990
was we have-- our country
has lovely technicians, so it

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.820
is not that we don't
have the talent.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.020
I can see most of our
talent here, also.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.650
So it is usually the
budgets which restrain us.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.770
And more than that, I would
say, it's the planning.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.270
And if you are
technically savvy,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.740
you can execute a lot of things.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.520
You do not need to
go mad and spend

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.020
like they do in
Hollywood, because we

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.090
can't afford that much.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.600
But we can get that
kind of quality

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.632
if we apply our
mind right, and--

00:12:08.632 --> 00:12:10.340
PAVNI DIWANJI: You
have to do it smartly.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.340
AJAY DEVGN: Smartly,
and shoot it right.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.173
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:12:13.173 --> 00:12:15.670
And I think I was reading online
that you almost, like, you

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.160
saw a need, and the film needed
a certain type of camera.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.890
And then, instead
of, like, nothing

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.266
was available, and you--

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:25.640
AJAY DEVGN: [INAUDIBLE] there
was some kind of equipment.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.890
If you see the shots
which rotate all around,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.020
and things like this, and that
kind of equipment, most of it

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.674
is not-- I mean,
we don't have it.

00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:37.840
There are some equipment
which are not there at all.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.790
So we designed it, I would
say, like Desi stuff,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.080
but, you know, where we could
get our job done perfectly.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.260
And yeah, so we all
worked very hard over it,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.620
and we really figured out,
we designing the shots first,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.120
because the most important thing
is how you design the shot.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.000
And then, when I
did design the shot,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.790
people said, OK, this
sounds very good,

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.396
but how are you
going to execute it?

00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:04.520
And that was the challenge.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.902
And then it just happened,
touch wood, very easily.

00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:11.470
PAVNI DIWANJI: Kajol was
saying, behind the screen,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.370
that you are a
tinkerer, and you like

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.972
to kind of make your own
things, and experiment, and--

00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:19.930
AJAY DEVGN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.721
PAVNI DIWANJI: --not
take no for an answer.

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:22.780
And I also read, you--

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.090
KAJOL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.714
PAVNI DIWANJI: --kind
of drove the team

00:13:24.714 --> 00:13:26.080
to quite off the edge, too.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.900
Not just in the movie,
actor off the edge, so--

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.580
AJAY DEVGN: Yes.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:39.380
In fact, my father is, and
was, the most respected action

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.081
director in our country, and--

00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:43.580
KAJOL: He invented
so much, himself.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.913
AJAY DEVGN: He invented so much.

00:13:44.913 --> 00:13:46.870
KAJOL: As far as film
making was concerned--

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.300
AJAY DEVGN: When the effects
and CGI was not there.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.792
I mean, he did films
like "Mr. India."

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:53.750
I don't know if you all
have seen a film called

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.460
"Mr. India," which was--

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.293
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:55.810
Yeah.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.310
Yeah.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.450
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.670
AJAY DEVGN: And at that point
of time, it was all live.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.360
So you couldn't cheat.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.270
And he could manage
doing a lot of things.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.930
And I was eight, nine years old.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.027
And when I used to keep
discussing with him,

00:14:10.027 --> 00:14:11.860
and he used to come and
tell me, I did this.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.980
Tell me how.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.890
And that's how the
whole process started.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.950
By the age of 12, I
was editing with him.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.450
And--

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.410
KAJOL: And editing,
at that point of time,

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.610
was not with a mouse.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.660
So it was actually--

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.340
AJAY DEVGN: Oh,
it was actually--

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.970
KAJOL: --frame by frame.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.678
AJAY DEVGN: A machine
called the Moviola.

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:28.910
So you had to hold the reel.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.785
And you had to stand.

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:31.210
And there was a small monitor.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.899
And you had to--

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:32.690
PAVNI DIWANJI: Wow.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.648
KAJOL: Press the pedal.

00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:35.760
AJAY DEVGN: Like
the accelerator.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.500
We had to stand, and keep
rolling with our hands.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.580
And, I mean, actually cut
the frame and join it.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.580
KAJOL: Actually cut the
frame of the film print.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.820
AJAY DEVGN: So it was a very
different process altogether.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.111
So we've gone through all that.

00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:51.840
And at that point of time, I
started making films myself,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.520
also, and obviously,
I couldn't afford it,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.220
so-- But I started
making my own equipments

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.850
at that point of time, where
I could take shots, which

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.150
so many people, at
that point of time,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.990
he used to see those small
videos of mine, and say, OK.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.640
I will go all my
father's friends, saying,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.944
can I use this shot in a film?

00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:15.860
I'm going to copy you.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.970
Said, go ahead.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.960
So it was like this.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.090
That is the whole process.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.540
So I think, because of my
father, I learned a lot.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.450
And I tried to create things
which were not possible, also.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.700
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah, I mean,
it shows in the trailer--

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.610
AJAY DEVGN: And
nowadays, it's become--

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.820
PAVNI DIWANJI: --how different--

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.403
AJAY DEVGN: --a lot
more easier, also,

00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:34.615
with the effects, and
lots of things coming in.

00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:36.490
But at that point of
time, there was nothing.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.948
PAVNI DIWANJI: How
different it is.

00:15:37.948 --> 00:15:40.390
I feel like you are going
to single-handedly raise

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.447
the bar on Bollywood.

00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:42.780
AJAY DEVGN: Not single-handedly.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.520
PAVNI DIWANJI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.200
AJAY DEVGN: I think
the whole team--

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.620
PAVNI DIWANJI: Team.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.040
Team.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.330
Yeah.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.579
AJAY DEVGN: --very big effort.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.260
PAVNI DIWANJI: I
think the thing that

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.530
struck me here was, it's
quite an action-packed film.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.090
AJAY DEVGN: Honestly,
it's an emotional drama.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.290
But if you notice the
action part of it,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.740
also, it's not just
for the sake of it.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.810
And there is pain on
the face, on my face,

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.574
also, and the other actors,
also, who are doing action

00:16:08.574 --> 00:16:09.490
at that point of time.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.670
So it's actually a very
real kind of thing.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.360
PAVNI DIWANJI: Wow.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.460
One of the things I was
talking in the hallway,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.720
and someone mentioned
that you have always

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.870
been at the forefront
of this action drama.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.845
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger come
to mind, for Bollywood, right?

00:16:27.845 --> 00:16:28.720
Would you guys agree?

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.475
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:32.600
PAVNI DIWANJI: And I also--

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.248
KAJOL: Better accent, though.

00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:39.900
PAVNI DIWANJI: [LAUGHS] And
I read that, a lot of times,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.210
you like even doing
the stunts yourself,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.450
and to figure out how
these stunts are done.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.990
So you are not just like
tough guy on the screen,

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.642
but you're actually
trying to live it.

00:16:52.642 --> 00:16:54.350
AJAY DEVGN: Actually,
that is by default,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.780
because when I started
acting, my first film came in.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.400
As I told you, I am an
action director's son.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.130
So they expected me to
do the action myself.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.910
They did not-- they
thought-- I mean,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.869
he would not need a duplicate.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.290
And I was practiced
for it, because

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.609
of my father and his
whole team and everything.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:19.200
So, actually, it was by
default. So I was pushed into it

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200
that, you know, you're
an action director's son,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.100
so you have to do
your action yourself.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.030
PAVNI DIWANJI: [LAUGHS] Well,
great results, we have to say.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.660
AJAY DEVGN: And then
I started enjoying it.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.367
And now--

00:17:28.367 --> 00:17:30.200
PAVNI DIWANJI: "Shivaay,"
"Singham," I mean,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.852
there's so-- there's a whole--

00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:32.560
AJAY DEVGN: Yeah.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.610
And now it's been 25
years in the industry,

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.090
so when I started, I was 19.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.750
I'm like 47 now.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.700
And now I like
doing my own stunts,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.230
trying to prove a point--
what the duplicates can do,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.820
I can do.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.409
So [INAUDIBLE] gives me
some kind of satisfaction.

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:51.200
PAVNI DIWANJI: So much
for showing the way.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.700
Great.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.750
I think it's great.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.950
I think the Google team wanted
to know what's next for you.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.200
What's the next big challenge?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.579
Are we going to see you guys
in some romantic role, maybe?

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:02.370
What's coming next?

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.110
Give us something
that we can't--

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.540
AJAY DEVGN: I'm starting
a film on our production.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.490
We're starting a film with her,
which is a fabulous script,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.440
and she's loved a lot.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.310
Like she just said
that she takes her time

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.210
to choose a script, so--

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.310
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.589
So we'll actually be
able to see both of you?

00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:19.630
AJAY DEVGN: No, I won't
be in that film because--

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.820
KAJOL: I tried to make him
do a cameo, or a passing

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.320
shot, or something like that.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.153
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:18:23.153 --> 00:18:25.460
I think he should, right?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.239
Clap your hands, or stomp your
feet, if you want [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:31.592
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.470
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.315
KAJOL: Sorry?

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.470
KAJOL: See?

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.800
AJAY DEVGN: Yeah.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.790
That's not a bad idea.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.230
KAJOL: I've been telling him.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.670
He told me, I got
married to you.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.460
That was enough.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.460
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:49.940
PAVNI DIWANJI: I read
somewhere that you never

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:55.050
left home without your sense
of humor, and it shows, right?

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.700
So we've heard from
some global fan,

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.740
but you also have a
huge fan following

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.800
in India, of course, and
also in Google in India.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.850
And so our next question is
going to come from a Googler

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.625
all the way in Hyderabad.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:10.440
KAJOL: Wow.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.854
PAVNI DIWANJI: So could we
please roll the question?

00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:14.020
[? SHUP: Hello, ?] Ajay sir.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.370
Hello, Kajol ma'am.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.550
I am [? Shup, ?] and
I'm from Hyderabad.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.560
It's really a real
pleasure for me

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.620
to get this opportunity
to ask you a question.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.355
And I have been a very
big fan of both of you,

00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:30.215
you know, since a long
time, ever since the "Pyaar

00:19:30.215 --> 00:19:31.830
To Hona Hi Tha" days.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.904
So today, the question I'm
going to ask is for both of you.

00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:38.260
And the question is, you have
both been in the industry

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.240
for a very, very long time.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.220
And during this time, there
has been a sea of changes.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:48.620
My question to both of you today
is, as established superstars,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.690
what do you both do to
keep up with these changes?

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.860
Thank you.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.722
AJAY DEVGN: Honestly?

00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:58.450
KAJOL: Very little.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.140
AJAY DEVGN: No.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.870
In fact, we learn a
lot from our kids.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.565
KAJOL: Yeah.

00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:04.814
AJAY DEVGN: And their friends,
and the new generation.

00:20:04.814 --> 00:20:08.240
I think it's very,
very important.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.930
I don't even know how to
be on the net properly.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.150
I mean, whatever I learn
is from my daughter.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.709
And when I ask her a question,
and she does something,

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:17.750
I say, how did you do it?

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.583
She says, don't ask me,
you old [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:20.630
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.296
AJAY DEVGN: So that's
the answer we get.

00:20:22.296 --> 00:20:23.380
They can do anything.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.382
So I think it's great.

00:20:24.382 --> 00:20:25.590
PAVNI DIWANJI: We can relate.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.260
I can relate, too.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:26.610
AJAY DEVGN: Of course.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.235
And it's great.

00:20:27.235 --> 00:20:29.570
And it's great you have
to learn from them.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.135
PAVNI DIWANJI:
That's the future.

00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:33.260
AJAY DEVGN: That's how you
keep upgrading yourself.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.260
PAVNI DIWANJI: That's
great. [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.200
I think Kajol was
telling us, at the back,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.120
was that she's a
big Android fan.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.980
Can you believe it?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.555
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:41.930
PAVNI DIWANJI:
And she frequently

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.060
has debates in the house,
because the kids like iPhones,

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.200
and she loves Android.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.550
So we are thrilled to hear that.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.870
So this is a question.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.053
The next question is
related to the change.

00:20:58.053 --> 00:21:00.920
And we at Google are very
passionate about women's

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.780
involvement.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.940
And I know both of you are.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.600
And I just saw the
"Parched" movie trailer

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.940
that you released on YouTube.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.290
And it kind of moved me.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.840
It promises to-- I haven't
watched the full movie yet,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.340
and I'm really, really
looking forward to it.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.830
And a question first, for
you, Kajol, on the topic,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.930
is, it seems from
outside of Bollywood

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.880
that the change is coming
slowly, in terms of respect,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.650
and female actress
respect in Bollywood.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.420
KAJOL: It is.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.230
Definitely.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.420
And I think that's because,
like I said earlier on,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.610
that's because the
audience has changed.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.830
Not for any other reason.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.840
But, you know, when people start
turning around and spending

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.120
money to go and watch a film,
which is not in the quote,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.150
unquote, "regular"
stream of films,

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.740
or regular kind
of genre, I think

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.480
that's when that change
actually happens.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.930
And right now,
actually, I think it's

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.090
an amazing time in
the film industry,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.530
because we have so many
different kinds of films

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.480
being made.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.800
And it is now economically
feasible for them to be made.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.870
Because people are going
outside, watching them,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.855
enjoying them.

00:22:09.855 --> 00:22:12.230
Social media has a lot to do
with it, because they go out

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.610
and they talk about it
on every media platform

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.090
that they can find.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.120
And I think that, in
itself, makes it huge.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.740
That, you know, you don't have
that herd mentality anymore,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.235
to say that, you know,
if one person-- You know,

00:22:27.235 --> 00:22:28.760
nobody is making
money on this film,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.750
because one person has
not liked the film.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.394
You have 100 different opinions.

00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.560
Everybody has their opinion.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.894
And everybody can go out and
say that, I like this film.

00:22:36.894 --> 00:22:38.310
Let me go and watch
it, and let me

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.270
take my 30, 40 friends with me.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.240
So, yeah.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.430
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.570
As I was watching the trailer
for "Parched," I was moved,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.180
and, like, OK, this
is a story that we

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.864
should have told a while ago.

00:22:49.864 --> 00:22:51.280
And I'm really
glad that someone--

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.530
AJAY DEVGN: And the best part
is, the film is based in India.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.650
But, I mean, it's gone
all over the world.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.184
It's gone to 28--

00:22:59.184 --> 00:23:00.100
KAJOL: Film festivals.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.350
AJAY DEVGN: 28 film festivals.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.460
It's won 18 awards.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.860
And people, women,
people all over the world

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.240
connect with this film.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.304
Some way or the other--

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:10.720
KAJOL: From every
kind of strata--

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.800
AJAY DEVGN: --they feel that--

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.739
KAJOL: Doesn't matter.

00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:14.030
AJAY DEVGN: --it is their film.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.910
So I think the
situation for women

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.100
is the same all over the world.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.850
I mean, it must be different--

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.910
KAJOL: Women feel the
same all over the world.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.410
I think--

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.910
AJAY DEVGN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.160
KAJOL: And they're put in
the same kind of situations.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.520
AJAY DEVGN: --same
issues also, yeah.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.360
PAVNI DIWANJI: I
think it's so great

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.860
to see both of you championing
these really, really

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.250
important social causes.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.630
AJAY DEVGN: We try
to balance it well,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.670
because the field we
are in, entertainment,

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.890
it cannot just be about
social causes, also,

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.580
because people expect you to
make films which entertain them

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.850
in whatever format--
not just comedy,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.380
but any which way
which touches them.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.520
So we need to strike a balance.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.027
And that's what we try to do.

00:23:58.027 --> 00:23:58.860
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.693
It's pretty awesome.

00:23:59.693 --> 00:24:02.695
If you guys haven't watched
it, I was quite moved.

00:24:02.695 --> 00:24:04.820
KAJOL: I want to just say
one thing about "Parched"

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.700
that-- It's one of those films.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.260
Sorry.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.010
I'm just going to
just put it out there.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.300
But "Parched" is one of those
things that is not preachy.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.850
That is not trying to
teach you anything.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.320
It's not giving you a lesson.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.004
It's literally like
a slice of life.

00:24:20.004 --> 00:24:20.920
It could be your life.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.753
It could be my life.

00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:24.190
It could be your best
friend's life with you.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.370
So it's that kind of a film.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.560
And there is something.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.650
The message behind "Parched"
is absolutely wonderful,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.370
because the message
behind "Parched"

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.870
is that women's empowerment
starts with women.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.550
It starts with every woman
standing up for herself.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.420
You may need a helping
hand sometimes,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.570
but it starts with
you, inside yourself.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.675
That power within you,
you have to access.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:49.800
And that's what "Parched"--

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.841
PAVNI DIWANJI: Well said.

00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:51.406
Well said.

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:53.720
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.269
AJAY DEVGN: Somebody just
said that I've seen it.

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:57.810
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I
felt-- As a woman,

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.735
I felt this is what
I was waiting for.

00:25:00.735 --> 00:25:01.360
KAJOL: Awesome.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.630
AUDIENCE: And I felt so proud.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.340
There is someone out there for
us, who is thinking about it,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.969
and is making such
movies. [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:09.760
AJAY DEVGN: I hope the
director of the film

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.202
is listening to this,
and this is for her.

00:25:13.202 --> 00:25:15.535
PAVNI DIWANJI: So I'm going
to shift gears a little bit,

00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:21.200
and go from reel to real life.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.682
And I'll start with you, Kajol.

00:25:22.682 --> 00:25:24.820
You have played
multiple roles, right?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.842
Daughter, girlfriend,
wife, mother--

00:25:27.842 --> 00:25:29.341
KAJOL: Girlfriend
was too long back.

00:25:31.987 --> 00:25:33.560
PAVNI DIWANJI: Which
do you find most

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:39.060
challenging and satisfying,
both in the reel and the real?

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.490
KAJOL: You know, my husband
told me this amazing line.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.640
He's like, you know, women,
from the time they are kids,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.460
have played multiple roles, are
taught to play multiple roles.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.430
That's why we're so
good at multitasking.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.750
So we're natural multi-taskers,
because we're sisters.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.060
We're daughters.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.170
We're children.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.020
We grew up, and we become
girlfriends, wives.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.080
AJAY DEVGN: What I meant
was, women, their roles

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.730
keep changing.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:10.930
You know?

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:16.310
They start from daughters,
sisters, girlfriends, wives,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.560
mothers.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.530
They keep evolving.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.100
Men don't.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.700
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.910
AJAY DEVGN: Which is a fact.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.190
A man is always a man.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.740
And we're born to be a man.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.500
Till he dies.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.490
And even when we
talk about "Parched,"

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.450
it's just not about women.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.880
It's about the pressure
of society on men

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.730
to do certain kind of things--

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.490
KAJOL: And to remain
in a certain groove.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.230
AJAY DEVGN: --to show
that they are men.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.820
But you don't need to
prove that you're a man.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.960
You don't need to prove it.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.460
KAJOL: You don't
need to do whatever

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.150
they say that you need to do
to prove that you're a man.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.360
AJAY DEVGN: So I think
women evolve faster,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.780
and that's why they grow
better, and men get stuck.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.860
I really read this, also,
that-- maybe it was mythology

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:09.400
or what-- that in
the olden times,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.300
man was supposed to
[? ask ?] to-- I mean,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.110
Hindus, maybe, takes [INAUDIBLE]
or just leave the family

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.770
and go away after
the age of 40, 45,

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.900
because it is the same thing
that a man couldn't change.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.420
He always wanted
to rule the house.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.810
He wanted the power.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.460
And obviously, it's the
same lion mentality.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.430
You know, when the
other one has come,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.755
one has to leave the jungle.

00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:38.140
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think it's
really great to see you

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.480
guys have such a great rapport
and partnership of views,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.530
as well.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.480
This really brings me
to the next question,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.990
which is one of our
other video questions,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.300
from fans Michelle
and Monica, who

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.720
want to learn about your
secrets of what we call here

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.510
work-life balance, if
there is such a thing.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.976
So could we roll the
video question, please?

00:28:01.976 --> 00:28:02.476
MICHAEL: Hi.

00:28:02.476 --> 00:28:03.000
I'm Michael.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.350
MONICA: And I'm Monica.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.025
And we're super
big fans of yours.

00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:10.350
And we were curious-- as
a high-profile couple,

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.290
how do you balance being a
couple with your careers?

00:28:15.884 --> 00:28:17.050
AJAY DEVGN: Going to answer?

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.200
KAJOL: I will.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.660
No need to ask me that question.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.659
You have to stop me and
put a muzzle on my mouth

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.260
most of the time.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.710
But I think this is something
that a lot of people ask us,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.960
the how do you balance?

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.080
How do you make that?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.300
How do you make it work?

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.740
How do you make it OK every day?

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.200
And I just have one
answer for that,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.470
because you have to
work at it every day.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.110
You can't decide that, OK, today
I'm taking a holiday from work.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.910
That's not going to happen.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.150
It's a relationship.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.680
It is your life, at
the end of the day.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.450
It's your kids, your husband.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.082
And whatever they are, they are.

00:28:54.082 --> 00:28:55.540
I mean, they are
my life, for sure.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.390
I don't know about
everybody else.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.610
But, yeah, they are my life.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.110
And when I'm talking
about, when I'm

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.840
talking about balancing your
personal work and your family

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.250
life together, it's a work
in progress every day.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.670
You put in that effort.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.080
You put in that little
extra every day.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.140
And you have to put in a little
bit of extra for yourself,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.189
as well.

00:29:13.189 --> 00:29:14.730
I mean, there's no
two ways about it.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.130
If you don't put in that
little extra for yourself,

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.480
you will feel shortchanged.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.280
And that's where all
the guilt starts.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.810
And that's where all those
horrible cycles start,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.720
where we don't want
to, you know, oh, god.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.710
I'm feeling martyred.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.876
And, oh, god, why I'm doing
all this and nobody else

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:30.360
is helping me out, and all that.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.370
So I think, I honestly
believe, that everybody has

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.860
to-- Every day is a new day.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.360
Every day.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.590
Some days, I'm a good mother.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.100
Some days, I'm
not a good mother.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.560
Some days I'm a better wife.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.020
Some days I'm a better actor.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.410
Some days I'm a
better multitasker.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.862
Some days I don't
finish my checklist

00:29:48.862 --> 00:29:50.320
that I wake up with
in the morning.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.650
So I think, forgive yourself
for whatever you're doing.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.360
We women are conditioned
to carry so much guilt

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.650
from the time that
we're born, really.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.150
I think we need to learn how
to forgive ourselves, and teach

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.200
our children that.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.075
PAVNI DIWANJI: Great.

00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:03.974
Hear, hear.

00:30:03.974 --> 00:30:05.867
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:30:05.867 --> 00:30:07.950
PAVNI DIWANJI: So I know
you have two lovely kids.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:08.911
And Nassa--

00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:09.410
KAJOL: I do.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.166
AJAY DEVGN: Nysa.

00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.112
KAJOL: Nysa.

00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:11.945
PAVNI DIWANJI: Nysa.

00:30:11.945 --> 00:30:16.999
And you both come from a long
lineage of film families,

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:22.260
and acting and directing,
and action, is in your blood.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.606
And we are curious.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.580
Do you coax them to follow
your footsteps into, and join

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.510
the industry?

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.020
Do you take them to work?

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.897
How do you approach--

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:33.730
KAJOL: No, we don't.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.430
We don't do that.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.515
AJAY DEVGN: They're
too small, as yet.

00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:36.800
My daughter's just--

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.460
KAJOL: 13.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.890
AJAY DEVGN: 13.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.910
KAJOL: Though she
looks very [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.660
AJAY DEVGN: Now she's
started teaching us.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.720
But my son's too small, as yet.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.380
So it's--

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.220
KAJOL: And I think
it depends, also--

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.390
AJAY DEVGN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.580
KAJOL: I mean, it's like
what makes her happy.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.740
And we'd rather, as two
people who have so much

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.140
of the limelight on us, keep
the limelight away from them,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:02.820
so that they grow up to have
a personality of their own,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.830
have dreams and
aspirations of their own,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.830
which are maybe somewhat
connected to us,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.380
but not connected to
who and what we are.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.790
PAVNI DIWANJI: I
think you're right.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.520
Early on, you want
to shield them,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.910
so that they can
develop on their own,

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.400
and develop their own.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.100
So, talking about limelight, one
of the questions that came up

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.770
is, none of us know the fame
and recognition that both of you

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.480
do.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.560
And I know it must
impact your daily lives.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.410
And so, one of the
questions that came up

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.010
is, how do you live
in this bubble?

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.050
If you want to go to
Chowpatty and have pani puri,

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.552
or go to the [INAUDIBLE], or--

00:31:41.552 --> 00:31:42.420
KAJOL: See?

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.700
Now you have convinced me.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.830
I'm taking my shoes off.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.650
Very uncomfortable.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.550
I've got Band-Aids on my feet.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.252
I'm just taking them off now.

00:31:51.252 --> 00:31:53.030
And I'm going to stand
on my tippy toes,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.946
and nobody's supposed
to comment on my height.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:56.268
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.111
PAVNI DIWANJI: I said to her
before, and it will be fine.

00:32:01.111 --> 00:32:03.997
This is Google.

00:32:03.997 --> 00:32:08.820
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.070
PAVNI DIWANJI: But do
you have to work at just

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.240
making your lives regular.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.230
in some--

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.700
AJAY DEVGN: It's-- actually,
it's been quite a few years

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.200
now.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.710
I mean, we did have
issues earlier.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.947
But I think it becomes
a part of your life now.

00:32:21.947 --> 00:32:24.280
KAJOL: And I think the kids
have also gotten used to it.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.696
We were very worried
at one point,

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:27.962
because when the
kids were younger,

00:32:27.962 --> 00:32:29.420
it was like they
were really small,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.210
and when you're entering an
airport or something like that,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.510
and you have 30, 40 people
trying to grab on to you,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.850
or click pictures, or
screaming and shouting.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.650
And, you know, my daughter--

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.610
And they're kids.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.240
They're small.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.620
And they feel like,
oh my God, you know,

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.244
somebody's attacking
you, or somebody's

00:32:44.244 --> 00:32:46.850
trying to get on you, and you're
trying to control the kids,

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.890
and you're trying
to manage the media.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.660
And it was-- when
they were younger,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.670
it was a bit of a mess.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.370
But I think now, now that
they've grown up a little bit,

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.540
they've gotten used to it.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.790
We've gotten used to it.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.570
So, yeah, we're better now.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:59.320
PAVNI DIWANJI: OK.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:32:59.990
Awesome.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.660
So I have one last
question for both of you,

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:10.600
and it goes back to you two make
such a magical pair off-screen,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.420
and Googlers, one of the top
requests from the Googlers

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.730
is, they would like to see
you on screen together.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.764
So when can we expect to see
you guys together on screen?

00:33:23.764 --> 00:33:25.930
AJAY DEVGN: Hopefully, when
we get the right script.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:26.370
I think--

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.120
PAVNI DIWANJI: Ah!

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.482
The right book.

00:33:28.482 --> 00:33:29.190
AJAY DEVGN: Yeah.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.760
The right book.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.770
We both are quite fussy.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.145
And if we work
together, I think it

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:36.910
should be something fabulous,
and we both should like--

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.090
KAJOL: Which justifies both
of us, and where we are,

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.140
and who we are today.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.930
AJAY DEVGN: Like the film
she's doing right now,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:48.560
which we'll start-- there's no
character for the-- If I have

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.060
to play any character in the
film, it'll be her son, so--

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.504
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.820
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think the sense
of humor runs in the family.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.530
KAJOL: At my cost.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.380
PAVNI DIWANJI: So I wanted
to say a huge thank you

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.982
to both of you for coming here.

00:34:12.982 --> 00:34:13.690
KAJOL: Thank you.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:13.909
AJAY DEVGN: Thank you.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.280
PAVNI DIWANJI: We really
enjoyed this conversation.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.370
And you have an amazing
movie coming up in "Shivaay."

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.260
And we look forward
to watching it.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.719
KAJOL: It's releasing on the
20th of October, in case you

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.739
guys, nobody knows about it.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:30.350
Which I'm sure you'll
already know, but--

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.989
PAVNI DIWANJI: So,
folks, please give them

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.311
a big, big round of applause.

00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:35.155
KAJOL: Thank you.

00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:36.000
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.110
AJAY DEVGN: Thank you so much.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.190
It was lovely being here.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.949
KAJOL: Thank you.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:41.800
PAVNI DIWANJI: Thank you.
