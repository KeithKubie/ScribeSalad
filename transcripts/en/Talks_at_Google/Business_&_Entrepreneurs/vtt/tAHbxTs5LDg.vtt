JESSE MICHELS: Welcome,
everybody, to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.760
We are so happy
to have you here.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.590
We're very happy to have our
guest here, our esteemed guest,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.270
Scooter Braun.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.600
Scooter is one of the biggest
entrepreneurs and innovators

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.030
in entertainment today.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.020
He started as a
teenage party promoter.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.420
He was the biggest college
party promoter in Atlanta

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.350
while going to Emory.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.020
He leveraged that into a
director of marketing position

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.420
at So So Def in its heyday.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.020
He left So So Def, found
a little-known artist

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.590
named Justin Bieber, and
then basically leveraged that

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.910
into creating the largest,
or one of the largest media

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.600
empires in music and
entertainment today.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.910
SB Projects covers all media.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.680
It's not just music.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.610
So he obviously manages artists
like Kanye West, Ariana Grande,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.510
Justin Bieber, of course,
EDM acts like Martin Garrix

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.760
and then models
like Karlie Kloss.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.710
It also has a tech incubator
arm called Silent Labs.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.390
We were just talking
about it earlier.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.750
They have really impressive
investments in Uber, Spotify,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.530
Waze, Pinterest, to name a few.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.850
So his track record there
is pretty impressive.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.800
And he's also all
about giving back.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.990
So he's on the
board of directors

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.110
of his brother's foundation,
Pencils of Promise, as well

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.185
as his wife's foundation.

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.310
And I don't think we're
allowed to curse here, so--

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.435
SCOOTER BRAUN: Fuck Cancer.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:32.650
- There you go.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.615
He went for it.

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:34.990
SCOOTER BRAUN: I
don't work here.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.620
- And that's his wife, Yael
Braun, also very impressive

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.610
in her own right.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.740
Please give it up
for Scooter Braun.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.066
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:48.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:49.080
JESSE MICHELS: Awesome.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800
So I actually want to
start with your childhood

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.090
and just set a little context.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.144
And I want to start with a
movie you made, a student film.

00:01:57.144 --> 00:01:59.060
When you were in high
school, you made a movie

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.680
about the Jews of Hungary.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.549
And this had a special kind
of place in your heritage.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.090
And you actually
got some recognition

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.610
from Steven Spielberg
on it, is that correct?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400
Can you tell us that story?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.180
SCOOTER BRAUN: I went to school,
and my teacher in middle school

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.790
said, there's something
called National History Day.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.150
And no one from our school
has ever gotten to nationals.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.650
But if you get to
nationals, there's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.320
an all-expense paid
trip to Washington DC.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.370
And I really wanted to
go to Washington DC.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.620
I wanted to see the monuments.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.694
I wanted to see everything
I'd seen about it.

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:32.360
So I went home that
day and I said, Mom,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.697
I'm going to Washington DC.

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:35.030
And then she said, you're crazy.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.571
She goes, what are
you talking about?

00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:37.960
And I came up with this idea.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.860
So my grandparents are
Holocaust survivors.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.350
My grandmother was liberated
from Bergen-Belsen,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.100
was in Auschwitz, and my
grandfather was in Dachau.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.400
And I was always
kind of fascinated

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.280
by the story of how they could
just live in this country

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.950
and live a normal life like
I was living at the time.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.260
And then suddenly, their
country just betrays them

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.730
and everyone in their
family dies and they

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.700
are the only survivors.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.400
So I decided to do a
10-minute documentary called

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.020
"The Hungarian Conflict."

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.770
And it was the story of how
hundreds of thousands of Jews

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.050
were deported over
two weeks voluntarily

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.540
by the German people
and the German army

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.510
towards the end of the war.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.850
And I submitted it, won
regionals, won states.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.240
Lost in nationals to a
documentary about airplanes

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.290
that make loud noises and fly
over a neighborhood in Chicago,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.280
because that is the most
important topic that can beat

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.136
a story about the Holocaust.

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:35.760
I'm not bitter.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.440
I'm 36.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.450
I've let go of it.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.100
But actually, I had
an amazing time.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.800
I got to go down there.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
I made a lot of friends.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.020
And I was 13, 14 years old.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.070
And when I came back, my other
grandmother, my mom's mother,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.790
she was very proud, and she sent
it into the Holocaust Museum.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.640
And somehow, someone got
it to Steven Spielberg.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640
She had sent it to his
office and everyone else,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.810
because he had the
Shoah Foundation.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.101
He was collecting information
about Holocaust survivors

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:03.170
at the time.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.455
And I had no contact
to entertainment.

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:07.580
No one in my family had a
contact to entertainment.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.880
We knew no one in the
world I now work in.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.070
And one day in the
mail, I get this letter

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.350
from the office of
Steven Spielberg.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.010
And a letter typed
out on his letterhead

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.740
signed by him,
talking about my film

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.780
and encouraging
me to keep going.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.741
And I framed it and it's
been on my wall ever since.

00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:28.490
When I went to college,
it was on my wall.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.520
It's on the wall in
my home office now.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.890
And it made me believe that I
could really achieve anything.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.440
Like, if a kid who
had no contacts

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.810
could get to Steven Spielberg,
I thought anything is possible.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.510
And funny enough,
about 17 years later,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.030
I was at the White House
press dinner with a client.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.270
And they moved us
into a private room

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.880
with celebrities, because
they didn't want the press

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.160
just hounding these
celebrities in the big room

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.330
before the event with
the president started.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.980
And Steven Spielberg
was in the room

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.389
and he started talking to us.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.180
And I said, listen.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.721
I don't mean to
interrupt, but I just

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.590
need to tell you years
ago when I was a kid,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.510
I did a video about
the Holocaust.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.343
And you-- and before I
could get a word out,

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:15.960
he goes, you didn't do the
Hungarian one, did you?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.950
And he remembered,
17 years later.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.960
And I was completely in shock.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.566
And it's just a testament to
who he is and how genuine he is.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:25.940
And it was just
very encouraging.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.605
I still have it on
my wall to this day.

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:31.980
JESSE MICHELS: You mentioned
something pretty remarkable,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.521
which is that you
started off knowing

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.640
no one in entertainment.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.440
Now you know everybody
in entertainment.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.550
So if the first inflection point
was Steven Spielberg giving you

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.570
recognition and that giving
you just the belief in yourself

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.510
to do anything after that,
a second inflection point

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.710
is cut to Atlanta.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.590
You're throwing
parties for rappers

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.790
like Ludacris and Eminem.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.380
How exactly did that come about?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.190
SCOOTER BRAUN:
Atlanta was racist.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.630
And that's the
reason it happened.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.444
I went down to Atlanta
to play basketball

00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:08.860
and broke my dad's
heart because I

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.130
took a D3 offer instead of a
D1 offer, because D1 said, hi.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.080
You're 5'11" and can't
really jump or run that fast.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.831
So nice jump shot.

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:20.080
You're going to sit the bench
for the first two years.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.559
And I didn't really like that.

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:23.350
So I was like, OK, I'm
going to go play D3.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.544
I'm going to come out and
start to get playing time.

00:06:26.544 --> 00:06:28.960
And I got down to Atlanta and
no one cared about our team.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.417
And my best friend
was at Duke, and he

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:32.500
was the star of that team.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.620
And we played AAU basketball
against each other,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.020
so that's how we
knew each other.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.060
And when I got down there,
because I came from an AAU

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.350
basketball team where I
was a minority on my team,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.290
I was one of three white guys on
a majority black baseball team.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.424
And our team-- since we were
14 years old in our state--

00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:55.590
every weekend, three to
four months out of the year,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.110
we were in hotel rooms
together as brothers.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.414
I mean, these guys are still
to this day my brothers.

00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:02.580
I have to explain to my
wife when one of them calls.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.960
Like, well I've never
even met this person.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.959
You're just going to let
him sleep in our house?

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:10.322
And said, in my
childhood, this is family.

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.030
So when I got to
Atlanta, I didn't really

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.550
have that perspective
of white people

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.942
went to clubs that played
techno and black people when

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:18.150
to clubs that played hip-hop.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.770
And there was no mixing.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.780
So I didn't like that
and I saw an opening.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.030
And I needed legit money
because I was broke.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.000
And selling fake IDs was
not a long-term plan.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.984
So I stopped by this club
called Chaos in Buckhead

00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:40.650
back in the day.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.570
And I said, if you let me bring
people here, will you pay me?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.570
And he goes, well how
many people can you bring?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.590
I said, how many do you hold?

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.400
And he said, 800.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.020
I said, that sounds about right.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.311
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:51.720
I went to Kinko's,
I made flyers.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.320
I named my company
Kryptonite Entertainment

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.510
because I liked Superman.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.210
And I had a bunch
of freshmen girls

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.330
pass out flyers for me, because
I had a high school sweetheart.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.820
So the freshman girls
weren't threatened by me

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.380
because I would
dance and have fun,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.390
but I wasn't trying
to sleep with them

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.210
because I was loyal to my
high school sweetheart.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.950
And where the freshmen
girls tell you to go,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.380
it seems like the rest
of the campus went.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.370
And next thing you know,
I had 800 people there.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.880
And-- this is a long story,
but sorry for taking so long--

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.550
that first party, someone
approached me and he was like,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.640
this party is amazing.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.205
Look at all these kids,
different diversity,

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:34.080
listening to hip-hop.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.913
And I looked at him.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.742
I was like, you're
Michael Jackson.

00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:38.200
And no, it was not
Michael Jackson.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.530
But it was Jason Weaver,
who played young Michael

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.701
Jackson in the VH1
movie that I would

00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:44.159
watch every single
year when they'd

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.290
play it about the Jacksons.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.140
And he was like, yeah, I'm
on a different TV show now.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.420
That was like 10
years ago, dude.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.267
And he said, do you want to
see how the other half lives?

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.100
And I said, what do you
mean the other half?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.820
He goes, black people.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.510
And he took me to Velvet
Room on a Tuesday night.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.190
This guy remembers old Atlanta.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.040
So the original Velvet Room.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.800
And there was a guy named
Alex Gidewon, who is now

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.470
one of the biggest club owners
in Atlanta, who originally

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.380
started off as an Ethiopian
immigrant parking lot

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.280
attendant.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.250
And at that point, he'd
become a huge promoter.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.300
And he had a
stutter, still does.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.040
And he was so fascinated
that I was there that he said

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.129
l-l-l-l-l-let the white boy in.

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:34.920
And he let me in for
free instead of paying

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.610
the $100 a head cutline charge.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.270
And I would put parties on
every Thursday for college kids

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.440
and spend every dollar of it
on Tuesdays meeting people.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.470
Basically faking
it till I made it.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.145
And then I made so much
cash with the parties

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:55.020
because Alex really
taught me how to promote.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.330
I learned what I really deserved
to make at those parties.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.163
I started making the
door a part of the bar.

00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:01.020
And he educated me.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.570
And I bought a purple Mercedes
with rims on eBay, cash.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.310
And I started driving
that to the party

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.420
so I could really floss and
get everyone's attention.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.920
And they were like,
who is this kid?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.966
And I was like, you
should come to my parties.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:16.590
And I said, we're
playing hip-hop, too.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.800
And I started getting basically
all these rappers of Atlanta

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.660
started coming to my events.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.860
And I wasn't paying them.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.901
They were coming for free
and having a good time.

00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:27.450
And the first artists I
ever worked at my parties

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.640
was a DJ in Atlanta
called Chris Lova

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.517
Lova, who had an alternate
personality named Ludacris.

00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:35.350
And he had a record
called "Throw Dem 'Bows"

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.141
and that was the first
record I ever worked.

00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:39.890
And that's how I kind
of got on the scene.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.147
And then one day,
Jermaine Dupri called me.

00:10:43.147 --> 00:10:44.730
And he was-- when
you came to Atlanta,

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.896
there was a big billboard
that used to say, Welcome,

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.120
the Home of So So Def.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.697
And he was on top of his game.

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:51.030
A lot of people don't know this.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.490
Jermaine Dupri is the
only producer in music

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.960
to have a number one on the
Billboard charts for 16 years

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.185
straight.

00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:58.060
JESSE MICHELS: Crazy.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.643
SCOOTER BRAUN: More
than Quincy Jones.

00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:02.820
And Jermaine asked me
to come meet with him.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.570
And Jermaine is not a tall man.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.220
So we met, and his feet were
dangling from this chair.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.970
And he was talking to
me and I was just so

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.440
fascinated that his feet
didn't touch the ground.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.590
And he asked me to come
help him run his company

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.431
and do marketing.

00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:23.055
I was 20 years old and I became
the vice president of marketing

00:11:23.055 --> 00:11:24.950
at So So Def Records.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.040
JESSE MICHELS: Amazing.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.956
SCOOTER BRAUN: That was
a long, roundabout way

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:29.170
of answering one question.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:29.430
JESSE MICHELS: No, that's--

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.450
SCOOTER BRAUN: By
the way, he told me

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.490
before we started that
when it's about crypto,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.510
this place is packed.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.340
So should we just
talk about crypto?

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.380
Just put the word out.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.750
Just be like, yo, it's
not what you think.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.090
It's not about Kanye and Bieber.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.185
It's about crypto.

00:11:45.185 --> 00:11:46.292
Get in there right now.

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:47.500
We're talking about Ethereum.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.940
It's getting crazy in here.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.190
JESSE MICHELS: That's awesome.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.750
This is actually--

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.083
SCOOTER BRAUN: The guy has tips.

00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:57.270
He's got information
on Quantstamp.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.840
JESSE MICHELS: No ICO
talk, unfortunately.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.174
But that was incredible.

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.840
I don't think I've
ever heard that story

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.925
at that level of detail.

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:09.650
OK, so you're director of
marketing at So So Def.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.360
Talk about your decision to
leave So So Def and then--

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.610
SCOOTER BRAUN: You want the
truth or the nice version?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.030
JESSE MICHELS: I want the truth.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.050
SCOOTER BRAUN: What
do you guys want?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.440
AUDIENCE: Truth.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.731
JESSE MICHELS: What do we want?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.980
SCOOTER BRAUN: How
many people see this?

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.850
JESSE MICHELS:
700 k subscribers.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.260
SCOOTER BRAUN: OK, just us?

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.135
JESSE MICHELS: But you
have final edit right.

00:12:30.135 --> 00:12:31.759
SCOOTER BRAUN: Jermaine
changed my life

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.440
because he gave
me an opportunity.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.360
And he knows this.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.860
I actually just
was down in Atlanta

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.800
and we spent the night
hanging out together.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.695
I'm incredibly grateful to
guys like him, Shaka Zulu, who

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.240
was Ludacris' manager,
who put me in.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.114
A guy named Shakir
Stewart, who unfortunately

00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:48.567
is no longer with us, who
brought me into the music game.

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.650
Guys like Steve Rifkin who
gave me my first record

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.530
deal for Asher Roth.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.960
And these guys really
changed my life.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.874
But at the time, I had all
these ideas about social media

00:12:59.874 --> 00:13:00.790
and how to break acts.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.452
And Jermaine wasn't
listening to me.

00:13:03.452 --> 00:13:05.410
He was really focused on
what he was focused on

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.360
and just wanted me to kind
of promote what he wanted.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.000
And I had to go to London for
something, some other project I

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.490
was consulting for.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.577
And while I was over
there, I ran into Lil Jon.

00:13:16.577 --> 00:13:18.910
And a lot of people don't
know this, but for nine years,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.160
Lil Jon worked as an A
&amp; R at So So Def Records

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.990
before he became Lil Jon.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.720
And we started talking and he
said, don't take nine years.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.386
He goes, I wouldn't
have become Lil Jon,

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:30.520
I wouldn't have the success I'm
having now if I took this long.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.590
And we had just had
"Yeah!" with Usher.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.930
And he produced that, we
executive produced that album.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.680
And that was really
resonating in my head.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.420
And when I came back, I would
say I had one foot out the door

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.680
but I was scared.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.420
You know, I wanted
to chase my dreams.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.190
I wanted to pursue what
I wanted to pursue.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.550
But I had built this
identity at 23 years old,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.640
over the three years I was with
Jermaine, you know almost 24

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.240
at that point.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.100
And I was afraid of
stepping away as much

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.787
as I didn't want to be
there, because I think

00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:01.120
a lot of people-- you know,
you guys work for a company,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.329
so a lot of you probably
have entrepreneurial spirits

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:04.370
and want to do something.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.360
But there's something
about the steady paycheck

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.670
that's crippling.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.050
And Jermaine's mother
came into the office.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.500
She had an office.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.344
Don't ask why.

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:18.510
And for some reason that
day, she was just in a mood

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.790
and wanted to tell
everyone who worked there

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.160
that her son doesn't
need any of them,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.720
and he makes all
the money, and all

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.850
you people are just overhead.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.960
And I said, look.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.367
With all due respect, I have
my own company and promotion

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:31.200
separately for this.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.284
But I love your son.

00:14:32.284 --> 00:14:34.200
But I don't have to be
here and I don't really

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.360
appreciate you saying
that, so could you

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.426
chill it a little bit?

00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:38.550
And I was being respectful.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.020
And she looked at me
and said something

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.290
that out of respect for
him, I will not repeat,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.900
because that's his mom.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.850
But it was disrespectful
and completely

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.730
inappropriate and hurtful.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.240
And not just to me,
but to people beyond me

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.560
as an individual.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.634
And I decided instead of saying
something back, I just left.

00:15:03.634 --> 00:15:05.550
And when I got back to
the office the next day

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.860
and kind of calmed down,
didn't worry about it,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.050
she had a letter in
my mailbox firing me.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.870
But what killed me was it
was signed also by him.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.310
So I went over to see him
and I'm like, what the hell?

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.643
And he's like, man, it's my mom.

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:24.260
Just give it two weeks and
I'll straighten it out.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.590
And that was all
I needed to know.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.290
And I remember taking my
car, driving over to Kroger

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.320
by my house, sitting
on the hood of my car,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.150
and realizing as
scared as I was,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.730
this was the opportunity I
actually really did want.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.526
And the universe
forced it on me.

00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:42.770
The universe has a way of
doing that in your life.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.150
Like, you really
want to do something

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.410
and you're holding back,
you're holding back.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.210
And then you think
something bad happened.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.140
It's just the universe usually
correcting something for you.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.100
And that sent me
out on my own track.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.380
And I'm grateful she decided
to say some crazy shit to me.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.230
Sorry, Google,
for cursing again.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.425
You know you can search
curse words on Google, right?

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:07.550
JESSE MICHELS: That's true.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.320
They do show up and
you can search them.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.620
Yeah.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.300
SCOOTER BRAUN: You guys
actually don't block anything

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.590
that you're saying
you can't say.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.160
JESSE MICHELS: That's true.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.701
I actually don't even know what
the official policy is on it.

00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:17.870
SCOOTER BRAUN: Well,
my question is--

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.760
especially with
so many languages

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.260
you have around the world--

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.560
I would challenge you
right now with the cameras.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.552
I want you to pick any
curse word you want.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.010
But I want you to
say it right now,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.230
because I want to
release this for you.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.200
I want to give you
this freedom back.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.979
So we're going to
just count to three

00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:37.520
and you're going to
say a curse word.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.630
JESSE MICHELS: I'm
going to say curse word?

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.463
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:40.160
One, two, three.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.360
JESSE MICHELS: Shit.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.193
SCOOTER BRAUN: Give him
a round of applause.

00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:43.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.904
That was very scary for him.

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.570
And I want to let you
know that you were

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.551
let go about two seconds ago.

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.842
JESSE MICHELS: You realize
I went for the most PG curse

00:16:51.842 --> 00:16:52.110
word.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.776
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah,
it was pretty weak.

00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:55.804
But it's cool.

00:16:55.804 --> 00:16:56.720
All right, keep going.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.220
JESSE MICHELS: Thank
you for that, Scooter.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.350
SCOOTER BRAUN: Crypto.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.800
We're talking about
crypto in here.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.966
JESSE MICHELS: That's right.

00:17:01.966 --> 00:17:03.040
Get in on it.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.540
Scooter coin is
coming up, actually.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.640
SCOOTER BRAUN: Oh, hell no.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.510
That one will not make
it past the bubble.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.020
JESSE MICHELS: OK.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:17.660
So you leave So So Def, kind
of an abrupt ending there.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.230
Talk about the time
in between So So Def

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.569
and finding Justin Bieber,
and then how exactly--

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.319
you found Justin Bieber
on YouTube, right?

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.152
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:25.740
Thanks, guys.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.240
Well done.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.660
Yeah.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.478
That worked out well for me.

00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.480
Just a grown man in the middle
of the night in his underwear

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.520
looking at the internet,
staring at little boys singing.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.440
And look at my life now.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.880
I wasn't even arrested.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.222
It was good.

00:17:48.222 --> 00:17:49.430
Actually, I did get arrested.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.000
That's not true.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.708
I got arrested in Long
Island for Justin.

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:53.519
So maybe that was the reason.

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.310
JESSE MICHELS: Got to
ask about that later.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.750
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah,
that was just a mall

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.708
that things were crazy.

00:17:57.708 --> 00:18:01.220
I was the first arrest in US
history for refusing to tweet.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.190
JESSE MICHELS: Jesus.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.500
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.550
Long story, we don't
have to go there.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.550
You guys can look it up.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.030
My record is expunged so I
can get global entry again.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.067
It's awesome.

00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:12.440
All right.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.450
In between, I needed
a calling card,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.450
so I went back to the
original guy, Ludacris.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.080
Bill O'Reilly, he
had said Ludacris

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.920
is a gangster
rapper and companies

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920
shouldn't work with him.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.200
And suddenly, companies believed
Bill O'Reilly for some reason,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.824
and Ludacris lost
all his endorsements.

00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:31.960
Pepsi, everything.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.780
And I was like, if you
guys give me a shot,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.100
I'll find you something.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.780
And he was in an
amazing movie called

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.630
"Crash" that was coming out.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.500
And my buddy knew
someone at Pontiac

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.676
and said, hey, maybe go there.

00:18:45.676 --> 00:18:46.800
They're doing the Solstice.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.925
I heard they have a budget.

00:18:47.925 --> 00:18:51.450
So I called to pretend I was
a college reporter trying

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.961
to do, how do you guys
do endorsement deals?

00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:55.710
And they told me the
name of their agency.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.390
I went to the agency
and said the same thing.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.180
I'm a college kid
doing a report on this.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.020
Would you like to speak to me?

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.749
And got to the woman, said,
look, there's no report here.

00:19:04.749 --> 00:19:06.040
This is what it's really about.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.260
And she goes, I don't
know about Ludacris.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.830
And I said, look, come to the
premiere of "Crash" with me

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.980
and you'll see.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.960
And when she saw "Crash"
and saw him in it, she said,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.650
I love this.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.580
And we did a deal for
the Pontiac Solstice.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.384
I took his song
"Two Miles an Hour."

00:19:21.384 --> 00:19:23.050
I've never told this
story, so this is--

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.744
I'll never get another deal
with Pontiac after I tell this.

00:19:25.744 --> 00:19:27.660
So like I said, I really
didn't have anything.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.340
Like, I was kind of
going week-to-week,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.600
I started throwing parties
again to kind of get paid.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.091
And I got them to agree to let
us shoot the video with one

00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:40.590
of our music video
directors, and we

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.017
would make a music video
with the Pontiac Solstice

00:19:43.017 --> 00:19:45.600
and then give them 30-second and
minute clips to actually make

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.770
into their commercial.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.980
And it was a huge
$10 million campaign.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.280
But the Pontiac, at the
time, was still a prototype.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.702
Like, they hadn't started
sending out the actual cars.

00:19:54.702 --> 00:19:56.160
So if you know
anything about cars,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.950
the prototypes are
like $2 million each,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.020
because it's not the actual car.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.510
It's the model.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.490
So we needed it for the video.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.680
So they sent it down.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.225
And you're not
supposed to drive it.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:08.725
It drives.

00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:13.160
It's a car, but it's a
$2 million prototype car.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.210
But I didn't have money
to put it on a flatbed

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.900
and take it across town.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.400
So I drove the $2 million
car down the highway,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.440
literally like freaking
out the whole way,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.870
and got it to the video.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.630
And to this day, no
one knows I did that.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.569
But now, 800,000
people just found out.

00:20:33.569 --> 00:20:35.110
And that was kind
of my calling card.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.550
And people were like--
this was before Jay-Z

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.425
had a deal with Nike.

00:20:37.425 --> 00:20:40.704
And rappers and hip-hop didn't
really have endorsement deals,

00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:42.370
so people started
hearing about the fact

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.930
that I was able to pull it off.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:49.180
And then, I did a party for
him for the Anger Management

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.370
tour with Eminem and got
Showtime to sponsor it

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.110
with their show "Soul Food."

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.370
And I started using
this as a calling card.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.390
And I was doing consulting and
marketing for hip-hop and R&amp;B

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.180
acts all over Atlanta and
then around the industry.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.181
And I decided, I'm going
to start my own company

00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:05.263
because I have all these
ideas about social media.

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:06.760
And I found a kid
on Myspace named

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.270
Asher Roth who didn't
even have a mix tape out,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.670
but I just liked his lyrics.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:18.910
And I had an idea about a part
of rap that is very common now

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.030
but wasn't being
represented at the time,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:27.010
because you had Eminem, and that
was just it from white boys.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:32.716
And flew Asher down to Atlanta,
got him to move onto my couch,

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:34.090
and we just started
that process.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.964
Then I got him a house
around the corner that

00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:37.900
was, like, filled with rats.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.399
And got my old college DJs--

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.190
when I was a big party
promoter in college,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.560
they were two guys that were
going to Clark and Morehouse,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.430
and that was DJ
Drama and DJ Cannon.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.200
And they had become
big mix tape DJs,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.480
so I got them to do a mix
tape for Asher, because we

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.880
kind of came up together.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.210
And when Asher wrote
"I Love College,"

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.294
four months after finding Asher,
I found Justin on YouTube,

00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:06.460
flew him and his mother
down on the first plane ride

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.220
either of them had ever been on.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.880
Put them illegally--

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.960
Donald Trump-- into a house.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.680
It's Canadians.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.420
He's not as threatened.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.220
We'll talk about all that later.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.960
And had them living around it.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.520
And when we wrote
"I Love College,"

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.290
Justin was actually sitting
there as a 14-year-old kid.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.700
And it was kind of this little
family unit that we had.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.640
And since I see a lot
of young people here--

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.580
it's strange.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.370
I didn't know Google had
so many young employees.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.660
It's so against your reputation.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.960
And I was 25.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.450
I had Justin living
in a townhouse

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.610
under my name with
Aaron's Rents furniture

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.350
that I bought and Asher living
in a house around the corner

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.734
from him in this
decrepit, rat-filled house

00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:04.400
with his buddies that
just came with him

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.310
and dropped out of
college with him.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.080
And I had my apartment.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.486
And I had money for 13
months before I went broke.

00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:12.610
And I wasn't doing parties.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.740
I was pot committed.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.610
I was in it.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.510
Burn the ships.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.610
I was there and that was that.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.940
And I was in month 11 and my dad
called me just to kind of check

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.450
up.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.102
And I remember being 25 and
just breaking down, hysterically

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:27.310
crying on the phone, saying,
I'm a failure and nobody

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.429
in Atlanta knows.

00:23:28.429 --> 00:23:29.720
Everyone thinks I'm killing it.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.237
Everyone thinks I'm doing
it, and I'm two months away

00:23:32.237 --> 00:23:33.820
from losing it all,
and I haven't done

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.825
anything for these guys yet.

00:23:35.825 --> 00:23:37.450
And he goes, well
you've come this far.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.116
Two more months, let's
see what happens.

00:23:39.116 --> 00:23:42.240
And the next day, Asher
wrote "I Love College."

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.790
And within the two months,
I was able to pull off

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.930
hyping a publishing deal
at South by Southwest.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.750
I had one publisher meet me at
a restaurant across the street

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.630
from the other, so I made
sure they saw each other

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.760
and created a bidding war.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.010
Got Asher a
million-dollar pub deal,

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.980
took the commission to
that, saved my company,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.590
and never looked back.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.410
And that's pretty much the
way I would describe to you,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.480
that's how close failure
and success actually are.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.030
There's a very fine line.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.170
And to get to success, you have
to walk right next to failure.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.480
And I've paid for
pizza with change.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.020
I've cried on the
phone at 25 years old.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.270
And it's funny to
actually think I'm 36 now.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.650
It's been 11 years, and
my life is very different.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.829
And I'm glad I
learned that lesson.

00:24:32.829 --> 00:24:34.120
JESSE MICHELS: This is awesome.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.310
This might be the most candid
interview I've ever given,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.140
so I appreciate it.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.299
SCOOTER BRAUN: Am I
better than my brother?

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:40.090
JESSE MICHELS: Yes.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.600
I don't know.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.810
I can't-- no, I
can't take sides.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.520
SCOOTER BRAUN: You said yes.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.410
It's on record.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.140
JESSE MICHELS: Sorry, Adam.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.220
SCOOTER BRAUN: Adam, if
you're watching, I'm sorry.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.678
JESSE MICHELS:
Adam, you did great.

00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:50.710
SCOOTER BRAUN: He interviewed
my brother in SF last week.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.500
Last week?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.130
JESSE MICHELS: A few weeks ago.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.020
SCOOTER BRAUN: A few weeks ago.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.610
My brother is very impressive.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.710
He's mom's favorite.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:57.760
I'm older.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.770
He's a lot more impressive.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.560
If you guys look into
MissionU or Pencils

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.990
of Promise or the
fact that at 32, he

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.250
was the UN Global Education
Crisis Committee head, yeah.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.000
He's like, yeah.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.800
He's like that guy, 100%.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.790
Mom loves him.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.960
And my sister?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.850
Mom loves even more
than both of us.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.684
It's not even close.

00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:19.099
JESSE MICHELS: " He says he
gets very competitive with you

00:25:19.099 --> 00:25:19.790
in basketball.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.020
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.104
I mean, our dad's a coach.

00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:22.519
JESSE MICHELS: I
didn't know that.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:25.150
SCOOTER BRAUN: So we grew up
playing competitive basketball

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:25.890
our whole lives.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:31.290
And Adam is a better athlete and
definitely has a better handle,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.825
but his jump shot's weak.

00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:35.950
I definitely have the best
jump shot in the family.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.350
He won't contest that.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.424
But that's all I got.

00:25:38.424 --> 00:25:39.590
JESSE MICHELS: Taking shots.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.014
SCOOTER BRAUN: But it's real.

00:25:41.014 --> 00:25:41.680
And that's good.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.217
And as you get older, my
game is more efficient.

00:25:44.217 --> 00:25:46.300
Because as you get older
and you have a jump shot,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.880
you can survive three-point
line to three-point line.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.880
I like how there's like
three people in here who

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.421
are basketball fans
and everyone else

00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:55.990
is just like, get back
to the crypto talk, bro.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.380
Get back to the crypto.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.005
JESSE MICHELS: We
have more Velvet Room

00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:01.321
goers than basketball fans.

00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:01.820
OK.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.860
So that's crazy.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.670
It's almost like Asher
gave you the runway

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.770
to do what you did
with Justin, which

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.900
is maybe a little-known fact.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.700
Which is-- that's
pretty incredible.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.680
When you saw Justin on
YouTube, you flew him out.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.370
You flew him and his mother out
and you got this trial period,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.240
and you got them to
take a chance on you.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.150
How did you know that
this kid's special just

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.650
from seeing him on YouTube?

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.691
SCOOTER BRAUN: You know, a
manager of a great new rising

00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:33.940
artist actually came to see
me last night at my house.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.189
And it was our first time
meeting, and we kind of just

00:26:36.189 --> 00:26:37.567
wanted to get to
know each other.

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:38.400
And we were talking.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.956
He's a really good dude, and
we were talking about data

00:26:40.956 --> 00:26:41.830
and different things.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.579
And I just looked at
him and I said, look.

00:26:43.579 --> 00:26:47.539
I remember when Sean
Parker woke me up one night

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:50.080
to tell me that he was going to
create an algorithm for a hit

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.640
song.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.880
And it's not the first time
I'd heard something like that.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.270
You know, when you
asked me how did I know,

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.430
I like going with gut.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.500
Data is a great thing,
but going with gut

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.730
is a much better way to live.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.240
And if everybody could take
data and figure it out,

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.350
then there would
not been hit songs.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.070
There wouldn't be movies.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.905
There wouldn't be innovation.

00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:19.780
We would just be following
data and following

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.610
some kind of timeline of how
we're supposed to do things.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:28.990
And then, there's no
sensation of discovery.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.592
And I think data's
very important,

00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.800
because you can learn from
it and you can go with it.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.030
But if you go through life--

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.570
I mean, everyone in this
room will understand this--

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.160
if someone gives
you a ton of data

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.030
but your gut just tells you it's
wrong, but you follow the data

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.700
and it's wrong,
you're miserable.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.330
You are like, I knew it.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.370
I absolutely knew it.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.390
This drives me crazy.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.800
But if you go against the
data and you follow your gut

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.335
and you're still wrong, you
actually don't feel bad.

00:27:59.335 --> 00:28:00.460
You're like, you know what?

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:00.960
I tried.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.084
I went with my gut.

00:28:02.084 --> 00:28:04.000
And what's the point of
really doing anything?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.640
The real point is being
content and finding happiness,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.310
because you can win 100 times
and not find happiness and then

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.582
be even more depressed.

00:28:12.582 --> 00:28:14.790
So I just think going through
life and going with gut

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.539
is the best thing.

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:17.280
And when I saw Justin,
my gut went off

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.390
and I actually saw
from start to finish

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.140
how to take this kid
on YouTube that, when

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.790
I showed other friends,
they were like, cute kid,

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.930
but I don't get it.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.750
I knew exactly how to make him
one of the biggest pop stars

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.350
ever.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.530
Like, it all, like, flew in.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.210
And I am a spiritual
person, so I

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.120
think it was someone upstairs
that kind of gave me that plan.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.930
And then I used data.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:42.800
Then I used YouTube.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.000
I knew I had to
convince people who

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.960
didn't think the way I thought.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.334
So I was like, OK, I'm going
to use the data from YouTube

00:28:47.334 --> 00:28:49.770
and the analytics that YouTube
is now sharing with me.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.700
And I'm going to prove
it to the naysayers.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.110
I'm going to take him from
60,000 views to 66 million.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.360
JESSE MICHELS: You hear that--

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.929
SCOOTER BRAUN: By the way, my
nose is itching like crazy.

00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:01.220
And in Los Angeles or New
York when you itch your nose,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.205
people completely
get the wrong idea.

00:29:04.205 --> 00:29:07.560
So I just wanted to say
I live a healthy life.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.920
I just have some allergies.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.430
That's it.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.282
I'm not that entertainment guy.

00:29:12.282 --> 00:29:13.490
I just want to itch the nose.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.656
JESSE MICHELS: Scooter is
sober and lucid right now.

00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:17.990
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.290
Very honest.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.980
The only way to go through life.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.350
JESSE MICHELS: Wow.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.540
Ariana Grande, in
my mind, is probably

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.220
the closest thing we've seen
to Mariah Carey since Mariah

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:29.720
Carey.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.660
Mariah Carey was a So So
Def artist back in the day.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.161
Talk about how you
met her and got

00:29:35.161 --> 00:29:37.410
her to sign on board, and
then your journey with her--

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.260
SCOOTER BRAUN: She
was never So So Def.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.670
Jermaine produced her album.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.160
JESSE MICHELS: Oh,
I didn't know that.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.800
SCOOTER BRAUN: He produced
"Emancipation of Mimi."

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.706
JESSE MICHELS: The Velvet
Room guy knows too.

00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:45.664
SCOOTER BRAUN: It's OK.

00:29:45.664 --> 00:29:48.042
I wasn't going to correct,
you, but I was like, no, I'm

00:29:48.042 --> 00:29:48.470
going to correct you.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.636
JESSE MICHELS: You know way
more about this than me.

00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:51.260
OK.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.080
Got it.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.910
SCOOTER BRAUN: It
wasn't it a big mistake.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:53.410
We're good.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.614
Keep going.

00:29:54.614 --> 00:29:56.970
JESSE MICHELS: But how
did you meet Ariana?

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.360
How'd you convince
her to sign on board?

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.300
And then talk about the journey,
because she left and came back.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.810
SCOOTER BRAUN: I saw
Ariana on YouTube

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.790
do a cover of a
Justin Bieber song

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.860
while she was playing
a secondary character

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.510
on a Nickelodeon show.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.830
And I was blown
away by her voice.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.900
And I was like,
this girl is a star.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.270
And I wanted to meet her, and
I couldn't really get to her.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.200
And then I saw that she
wanted to make music,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.670
so I reached out
to a buddy and I

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.530
was like, look, I know I might
be a jerk because now she

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.090
just wants to make music and
I've never reached out before,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.719
but I've wanted to
for a long time.

00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:35.510
And it turned out that
she had been wanting

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.520
to meet me for a couple years.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.470
And people that she
was asking to set up

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.160
were kind of blocking it,
because they didn't want me in.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.150
They wanted to be in.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.730
And we met and
completely hit it off.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.450
And I said, let's do this
and went on this amazing run.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.060
What shocked me is
that Nickelodeon

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.590
had a deal with Sony.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.690
And I was like, how are
you not signed to Sony?

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.920
And it turns out she said,
hey, I want to make music.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.600
And they heard her sing.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.280
And they were like,
well, she's not a star.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.330
We're not going to
give her a record deal.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.370
And Sony actually
passed on Ariana.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.950
Their loss, our gain.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.600
And we did the deal, and
we started working together

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.960
and we had two
number one albums.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.340
And as you can see on the stage,
I don't really hold my tongue.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:29.672
And there were some other people
in her life that were kind of--

00:31:29.672 --> 00:31:32.480
as you become more and more
popular and famous and more

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.664
success, people just
start showing up.

00:31:34.664 --> 00:31:36.080
And they want to
create dissension

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.810
because they want to create
opportunities for themselves.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.393
And there were people who were
creating dissension between she

00:31:41.393 --> 00:31:45.110
and I. And instead of just
kind of succumbing to that,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.210
I said what I felt.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.830
And in that confusion,
we went separate ways.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.670
And six months later
when those people

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.000
showed their true colors, she
called me up and she said,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.340
can we meet?

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.070
And we met up.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.610
And we had stayed cordial.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:07.750
And it was nothing.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.800
It was a hug, forgiven,
forgave each other for anything

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.260
that was said, and back to it.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.000
And then we had
incredible success.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.790
And then I'm sure
your next question

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:26.497
is we went through some
really trying times together.

00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:27.330
JESSE MICHELS: Yeah.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.372
And talk about-- switching,
actually, to Kanye--

00:32:31.372 --> 00:32:33.205
SCOOTER BRAUN: Oh, I
thought you'd go there.

00:32:33.205 --> 00:32:34.260
JESSE MICHELS: Well
actually, yeah.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.030
I should go there.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.210
You kind of teed me off.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.846
Well, can you talk about those
trying times with Ariana?

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:39.970
SCOOTER BRAUN: Look, it's--

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.250
yeah.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:41.940
Glad you asked.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.160
I didn't see that coming.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.800
Look, Ariana-- very well
known-- had a terrorist attack

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.070
at her show in Manchester.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:01.140
And over 20 people were killed,
including a 9-year-old girl

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.760
and other kids.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.520
And she was there.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.070
And these people were
there to see her.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:12.294
And there's that guilt you
carry when that happens.

00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:12.960
And I was angry.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.168
Because of my grandparents
being Holocaust survivors,

00:33:15.168 --> 00:33:19.189
I always knew that kind of
evil existed in the world.

00:33:19.189 --> 00:33:21.480
And I'd kind of waited my
whole life for an opportunity

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.810
to take it on.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.804
So I was, like,
rearing and ready to go

00:33:24.804 --> 00:33:25.720
and filled with anger.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.730
And I was like, we're
going to do a show.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.930
We're going to go back.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.340
And when I got to
her the next day,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.814
she, rightfully
so, was torn apart.

00:33:33.814 --> 00:33:35.730
And she was like, I don't
know if I could ever

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.270
sing these songs again,
let alone go on stage.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.180
So I had to kind of pull
myself back and realize

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.074
this wasn't a moment for me.

00:33:46.074 --> 00:33:47.490
And I worked on
canceling the tour

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:48.948
and worked with
her insurance team.

00:33:48.948 --> 00:33:51.839
And the insurance
company was British,

00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:53.880
and they completely
understood and actually said,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.364
we're going to pay the
full fee for all her shows

00:33:56.364 --> 00:33:57.405
for the rest of the tour.

00:33:57.405 --> 00:34:00.060
We're going to fully
cover the insurance.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.104
And think about that.

00:34:01.104 --> 00:34:02.520
So now she's getting
her full fee,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.890
but she doesn't have
to pay for production.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.650
She doesn't have to
pay for the costumes.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.066
She doesn't have
to pay for staff.

00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:09.150
She's actually going to make
more money by not performing

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.360
for the last two months than
she would on the entire tour,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.239
by just accepting the insurance.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.030
And by the time I flew
home two days later,

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.111
I got home to 16 text
messages saying, call me.

00:34:20.111 --> 00:34:20.610
Call me.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.397
Call me.

00:34:21.397 --> 00:34:22.230
And I called her up.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.570
And she knew that
financial point.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:27.060
And she said, if I
don't do something,

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.800
I'm not who I say I am.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.854
And all these kids
who come and see me

00:34:30.854 --> 00:34:33.300
and all the things I tell
them, they're not real.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.639
So what's the plan?

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.839
And I said, look, I--

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:39.630
she goes, I'm ready to
go on tour tomorrow.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.280
I want to go back.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.190
And I said, look,
I think you need

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.773
to take some time to make sure
you're strong enough, because I

00:34:43.773 --> 00:34:45.360
think you're excited right now.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.639
But let's go back in two
weeks, because that's Paris.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.719
We'll cancel six shows
because you need time

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.230
to heal and really take this in.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.882
And Paris is where the Eagles
of Death Metal happened,

00:34:56.882 --> 00:34:58.590
and I thought that
was a great statement.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.660
And I said, but I
have a crazier idea.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:05.730
Before Paris, instead of waiting
three, four months, a year,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.871
we should go back to
Manchester and perform.

00:35:07.871 --> 00:35:09.120
And she goes, do you think so?

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.619
Why?

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:11.672
And I said, because
the reason terrorists

00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:13.630
do this is they want to
change our way of life.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.940
They want to scare us.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.000
And the best way to stop
it from happening again

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.460
is answering right away
and answering in defiance

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.085
and letting them know
they're not going

00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:23.340
to change our way of life.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.180
And she, without even
pausing, was like, I'm in.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.530
And we had two weeks.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.520
We put the show together.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.390
And I put a tremendous
amount of pressure

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.970
on a small Italian
girl's shoulders.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.977
And she stepped up
and she handled it.

00:35:38.977 --> 00:35:40.560
And there were a lot
of amazing people

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.768
who stepped up for that show.

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:44.222
And that will always
go down in my mind

00:35:44.222 --> 00:35:45.930
as the most important
and most incredible

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.370
show I've ever been a part of.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.910
To give you a little context,
we finally got back to the UK.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.410
We were rehearsing
the night before.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.920
Staying in Manchester, we
rehearsed at Wembley Arena

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.540
the night before.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.379
And that night was the night
of the London Bridge attack.

00:36:01.379 --> 00:36:03.420
So the second terrorist
attack happened the night

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.520
before our show.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.394
JESSE MICHELS: Wow.

00:36:05.394 --> 00:36:07.810
SCOOTER BRAUN: And that was
the first time I was thinking,

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:12.229
is my excitement and arrogance
going to get people killed?

00:36:12.229 --> 00:36:14.520
And before I could even think
about canceling the show,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.950
Chris Martin from Coldplay--
he was in the show--

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.730
sends me a text.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.230
Please don't cancel.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.150
And then Marcus
Mumford calls me,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.920
because I'd just seen
him at rehearsal.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.540
And says, do not cancel.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.940
It's more important than ever
that you guys do this show.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.945
Ariana, I never everyone
even talked to about,

00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:29.820
didn't even go there.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.190
She had already gone to sleep.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.710
And I spent the night,
talked to her mom.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.540
We decided to go
on with the show.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.310
And the Greater
Manchester Police

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.700
wanted me to release a
statement on behalf of our team

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.260
that the show was
going to go on.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.718
I spent the whole
night writing it.

00:36:44.718 --> 00:36:46.890
Woke up, put it out,
and I said that we

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.260
have a greater responsibility
now more than ever

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.990
to continue on this journey.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.000
Not only for the
victims of Manchester,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.680
but the victims of
London, to honor them

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.560
and be on that stage.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.230
And then the Manchester Police
put out a statement saying,

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.710
the show will go on.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.210
However, please understand
that the alert is now

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.500
at high, which means
there is, quote,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.350
"likely going to be an attack."

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.050
And we were going
to be on YouTube--

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:19.750
thanks-- Facebook, Twitter,
Capital Radio, BBC Radio,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.460
and the BBC.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.970
So you could watch our
entire show from your home.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.430
I was convinced no one
was going to show up.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.610
And when Marcus walked
out to open the show,

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.794
the Mumford guys
weren't in town.

00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.960
It's the only time Marcus
Mumford has ever performed

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.610
without Mumford and Sons.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.850
And he did "Timshel," and he
changed a couple of lyrics

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.200
to honor the victims.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.616
And when he walked
out, there were

00:37:42.616 --> 00:37:44.290
60,000 people in the place.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.760
It was packed.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.550
And it was chills because it was
about to be a three, four hour

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.420
show.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.570
And he and I talked beforehand
about how to start it.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.390
And we asked for a
moment of silence.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.010
And at the end, he said,
let's not be afraid.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.120
And the place roared.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.916
And it's something I'll never
forget for the rest of my life.

00:38:00.916 --> 00:38:02.290
JESSE MICHELS:
That's incredible.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.669
That's awesome that you guys
were able to stay the course

00:38:04.669 --> 00:38:05.460
and make it happen.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.667
Yeah, give it up.

00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:10.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:11.811 --> 00:38:12.310
OK.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.500
So I want to talk about Kanye.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.090
You've had a relationship
with Kanye for a while,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.330
but you signed him kind
of later in his career.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.800
Can you talk about what Kanye
means to you as a friend

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.710
and as a colleague now and what
the future holds for Kanye?

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:38.370
SCOOTER BRAUN: Look, he is
the most interesting person

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.630
I've ever met in my life.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.180
He is a genius.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.600
And I've witnessed
and experienced

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.930
that he truly is
a creative genius,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.570
because all my other
clients, a lot of it

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.350
kind of comes on the
creativity, the ideas.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.920
A lot of it, myself
and team members,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.210
it's on us to kind of come up
with and then work with them.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.650
Kanye's always the person,
he's like, yeah I like that.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.240
But what about this?

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.156
And you're like, damn.

00:39:01.156 --> 00:39:03.840
How did I not see that?

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.600
But he's even made me
see colors differently.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.760
Like, we've spent
so much talking

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.700
about colors and
palettes that I actually

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.130
see colors and
aesthetic differently

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.070
because of his education
of hours and hours

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.377
and hours of conversation.

00:39:18.377 --> 00:39:20.460
JESSE MICHELS: Doesn't he
have synesthesia, like--

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:20.930
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah, he does.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.454
JESSE MICHELS:
--sounds are color?

00:39:22.454 --> 00:39:24.620
SCOOTER BRAUN: When he hears
sounds, he sees colors.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.200
JESSE MICHELS: Crazy.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.530
SCOOTER BRAUN: And we were
friends for a long time.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.160
If you look up the
Ludacris "Stand Up" video,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.650
I am the promoter, club owner
jumping around dancing in it.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.320
And Kanye produced that song,
and he makes a cameo in it.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.290
And we actually met then before
he had just signed to the Roc,

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.180
and he was a
producer, and no one

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.100
knew who Kanye West
was other than if you'd

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.930
worked with him as producer.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.770
And we met on that
set and were friendly.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.750
And kind of over the years,
always knew each other.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.166
His original manager, John
Monopoly, was always good to me

00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:57.210
when I was a younger guy.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.330
And then when he put up a
tweet saying he was $52 million

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.040
in debt, he's my friend.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.370
So I texted him, are you OK?

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.180
And I guess a lot of people
didn't ask him if he was OK.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.760
So he called me
back just to talk.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.470
And after talking
for about an hour,

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.690
he said, you know, you
need to come work with me.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.750
And I said, Kanye, we've
talked about this before.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.810
I don't want to do that.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.017
Like, I'm afraid
of working with you

00:40:22.017 --> 00:40:23.850
because I don't want
to lose the friendship.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.787
I love you, dude.

00:40:24.787 --> 00:40:26.370
No, no, you need to
come work with me.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.682
You need to manage me.

00:40:27.682 --> 00:40:28.640
I'm going to call Izzy.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.556
You need to manage me.

00:40:29.556 --> 00:40:31.625
And I said, no,
no, no, we're good.

00:40:31.625 --> 00:40:33.000
Why don't we--
when are you back?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.916
You're back in a week?

00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.310
OK, you're back in a week.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.367
We'll talk about it then.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.700
And I thought this is like
the eighth time he and I have

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.908
had a conversation like that.

00:40:39.908 --> 00:40:41.070
We're going to get it.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.469
We'll stay friends.

00:40:42.469 --> 00:40:44.760
The next morning, I get a
call from Adidas and Def Jam.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.160
So we're told you're the
manager and to deal with you.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.076
And that is how I became
Kanye West's manager.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.370
But he's become like a brother.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.130
And I joke around that it's
been 2 and 1/2 years now

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.890
and I think we'll
always be friends

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.810
and we'll always find
ways to work together,

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.600
because we both have
this feeling of,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.920
art can change the world.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.074
And I joke around all the time
that I'm his manager today,

00:41:10.074 --> 00:41:11.240
but I might not be tomorrow.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.820
Like, I've lasted
longer than most.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.660
But I'm going to be
with him next week

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.100
and I saw him last week.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.200
And he knows it.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.970
He's like, someday
when you're older,

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.428
you're going to say you managed
Kanye West and that's cool.

00:41:27.428 --> 00:41:29.470
And I'm like, it's
cool right now, bro.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.470
I mean, we walked in, you
were like nice Yeezys.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.820
I was like, you're
goddamn right.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.230
JESSE MICHELS: He's
like, I got a hook up.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.664
SCOOTER BRAUN: But he
really is a genius.

00:41:38.664 --> 00:41:40.830
And here's a thing I like
to say about him publicly,

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:41.700
because I don't like
to talk about it

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.950
too much publicly out of
respect for that's not really

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.280
his thing.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.920
But Kanye West is
the best listener

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.020
of any artist I've
ever worked with.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.710
JESSE MICHELS:
That's incredible,

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.750
because I feel like that's
probably the biggest

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:52.847
public misperception.

00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:54.180
SCOOTER BRAUN: Biggest misperc--

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.370
Kanye wants the information.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.552
He wants to learn everything.

00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:01.010
If you interrupt him and say,
hey, my bad, he goes, no, no.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.480
What did you want to say?

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.880
He is the best
listener of anyone

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.427
I've ever worked
with, hands down.

00:42:07.427 --> 00:42:09.760
And he's also someone who
doesn't keep you on the phone.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.920
If I say, hey, my kid needs me.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.961
I'll call you right back.

00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.050
No problem.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.620
He's actually incredibly,
in his own way,

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.057
empathetic and considerate and
is a really, really, really

00:42:20.057 --> 00:42:20.640
good listener.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.580
When he gets frustrated,
his passion might take over

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.270
and he goes what I call Full Ye.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.180
But he has a heart of
gold, and he really

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.890
is an amazing listener.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.894
And that is, yeah, I think
100% the biggest misconception.

00:42:35.894 --> 00:42:38.560
JESSE MICHELS: I'm going to name
some people you've worked with,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.200
and you just give me the first
word that pops into your head.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:41.996
OK?

00:42:41.996 --> 00:42:42.790
SCOOTER BRAUN: OK.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.999
JESSE MICHELS: Justin Bieber.

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:46.331
SCOOTER BRAUN: Why did hair
come to the first thing that

00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:47.240
came to my head?

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.460
No, that's family.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.210
JESSE MICHELS: Usher.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.350
SCOOTER BRAUN: Also family.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.640
Brother.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.120
JESSE MICHELS: Karlie Kloss.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.500
SCOOTER BRAUN: Kindness.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.900
JESSE MICHELS: Martin Garrix.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.390
SCOOTER BRAUN: Wild man.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.845
JESSE MICHELS: BloodPop.

00:43:03.845 --> 00:43:06.900
SCOOTER BRAUN: Martin's
also jump into your pool,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.000
fully clothed.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.310
BloodPop, brilliant.

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.459
JESSE MICHELS: The Wanted.

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:16.250
SCOOTER BRAUN: Hmm?

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.870
JESSE MICHELS: The Wanted.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.621
SCOOTER BRAUN:
Um, Glad You Came.

00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:21.495
JESSE MICHELS: Kanye.

00:43:21.495 --> 00:43:22.110
Last one.

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.370
SCOOTER BRAUN: Genius.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:23.970
JESSE MICHELS: Love it.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.300
OK.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.465
SCOOTER BRAUN: You
didn't ask Ariana.

00:43:25.465 --> 00:43:26.923
JESSE MICHELS: I
didn't ask Ariana.

00:43:26.923 --> 00:43:27.910
Ariana.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.420
SCOOTER BRAUN: Brave.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.991
JESSE MICHELS: Awesome.

00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:35.370
And it feels like right now,
you represent mostly pop,

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.510
would you say?

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.630
You came from a
hip-hop background.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.407
Yeah.

00:43:40.407 --> 00:43:41.490
How do you reconcile that?

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:45.287
Do you want to do
more hip-hop stuff?

00:43:45.287 --> 00:43:47.620
SCOOTER BRAUN: I am in business
with more hip-hop people

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.110
than I let know publicly.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:52.585
And I'm also in business
with a lot of country music

00:43:52.585 --> 00:43:53.960
that I don't talk
about publicly.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.610
Our company has a
branch of it that

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.730
owns a piece of a bunch of other
companies within our business.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.550
So we own 50% of a lot
of other companies.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.091
We just don't talk
about it publicly.

00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:07.150
It allows me to
touch other genres,

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.360
be involved with other genres.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.730
And we've done EDM.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.780
We've done country.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.739
But there's people that
they'll see me at shows

00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:20.279
and be like, I didn't know you
were friends with this person.

00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:22.600
And sometimes, I'm in
business with them as well.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.370
But it's funny, because
probably of any manager

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.110
in music history, I've
probably put myself

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.120
out there probably
the most, because I

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.360
thought it was a new world.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.936
And if you can create
a brand for yourself,

00:44:35.936 --> 00:44:37.310
then you can launch
other brands.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:38.860
And social media
was changing things.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.580
So I made a conscious
decision to do that,

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.454
knowing that it would
put a target on my back

00:44:42.454 --> 00:44:44.870
and it would be something
people used to criticize me

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.479
and kind of judge my
character and assume that--

00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:49.520
people that don't know
me, they might assume, oh,

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.070
he's doing that because he
wants to become a public figure

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:53.360
or be consumed by that.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.940
And the truth is, the majority
of the successes we have,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.310
we'll never speak about.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:02.900
And the majority of my private
life isn't very public.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.690
I choose to show my
family in certain aspects

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.490
publicly only
because when I came

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:14.920
into the industry, fast women,
fast cars was a stigma that you

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.110
thought of when you thought of
a successful entertainment man.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.730
And I wanted to
change that paradigm.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.080
I want people to
see me, and I want

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.210
them to know you can have
success in this industry

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.760
and be a good husband, a good
father, a good friend, a family

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.260
man.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.884
And I also think--
especially with what

00:45:33.884 --> 00:45:37.360
I'm seeing now with "Time's
Up" and the "Me Too" movement,

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.990
that this movement can't
just be about women.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.730
This movement needs
to be about moving

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.200
the needle on men
in the industry

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.090
so they treat women better.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:46.921
And--

00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:48.959
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:48.959 --> 00:45:50.500
--I think the only
way you do that is

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.260
you move the needle on
what a man's goal is.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.690
If you tell a young man
coming into the industry

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.770
that success doesn't
look like that,

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.760
that's actually
not a good result.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.144
Success is being someone who's
honorable to women and someone

00:46:05.144 --> 00:46:07.060
who is honorable to their
family and honorable

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.760
to their commitments of family.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.300
Then I think you're going to
see more young men not acting so

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.120
inappropriately and
becoming like the generation

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.510
that we're seeing
fall right now.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.004
And that is something I want.

00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:22.420
Because I was raised by a
strong woman, and I married one,

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.190
so I don't want the next dude
coming up looking at my success

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.650
and thinking, oh,
I want that car,

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:31.750
and I want that young girl.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.680
No, that's not what it's about.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.522
That's actually a very
shallow life, in my opinion.

00:46:37.522 --> 00:46:38.980
Sorry I talked
about this too long.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.896
JESSE MICHELS: Well,
you're a good role model.

00:46:40.896 --> 00:46:42.580
No, that's great.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.630
You talk about a lot of your
success going kind of unspoken

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.050
and unrecognized or you kind
of keeping silent about it.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.440
Fittingly, the tech
arm of the SB Projects

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.240
is named Silent Labs.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.660
Can you talk about-- we
were talking earlier--

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.220
just the history of your
involvement with tech,

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.077
to the extent that you
can talk about that?

00:47:04.077 --> 00:47:05.910
SCOOTER BRAUN: So the
itch came because when

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.560
I was a big college
party promoter,

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.980
Emory was one of the first eight
schools to launch the Facebook.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.090
And I was like, what a great
way to get my parties out

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:19.810
there without having to
hack the school database.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.980
So I got in touch
with the contact page

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.850
and the master of dungeon
ceremonies, Mark Zuckerberg,

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.620
whatever the hell
it said at the time.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.300
And he wrote me
back, please talk

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.260
to Eduardo, who I saw was the
master of coin or something

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:34.920
like that.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.950
And Eduardo and I,
for about four months,

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:44.272
negotiated 10% of
Facebook for $100,000.

00:47:44.272 --> 00:47:45.230
I still have the email.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.480
Dear Scooter, Mark
wants to launch

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.106
32 more schools in two weeks.

00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:50.480
So unfortunately
at this time, he

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.847
refuses to take any
outside investment.

00:47:52.847 --> 00:47:54.680
Let me know if you're
coming to Boston so we

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.570
can catch up and see if there's
other stuff we can do together.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.952
Now, I joke around in my head
that I know I'm a closer.

00:48:01.952 --> 00:48:03.410
And if I would have
gone to Boston,

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.490
I probably would have
closed that deal.

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.920
But remember that high school
sweetheart I told you about?

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.320
Well, she ripped my heart out.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.290
And she went to BC.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.480
So the idea of going to
Boston and running into her

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.847
was not happening.

00:48:15.847 --> 00:48:17.930
So I was like, aw, man,
screw this Facebook thing.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.940
I'll have to find another
way to promote my parties.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.800
And a year later, it
was like, Peter Thiel

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.716
invests a million dollars
for 10% of Facebook.

00:48:23.716 --> 00:48:26.550
And I was like, I could
have made a million dollars.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.425
JESSE MICHELS: That's
an unprofitable breakup

00:48:28.425 --> 00:48:28.760
right there.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.360
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.320
But I didn't know
what it was going

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.569
to be so I can't claim credit.

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:35.030
But when it continued becoming
this giant conglomerate,

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.940
it made me say, well
there was something there.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.580
And it actually made me start
investing in tech very, very

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.576
early before the
music industry in LA

00:48:43.576 --> 00:48:45.200
wanted to start going
up to the Valley.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.660
I started going up and
not really telling anybody

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.090
because I didn't want
anyone else going up.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.750
So I was able to get in
early in a lot of really

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.180
amazing companies.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.930
And they were personal
investments for me.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:00.560
And then we had our incubator
if I wanted the company

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.840
to invest as well.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.630
But I was able to--

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:06.740
I went up and I was meeting
with another company,

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.180
and they ordered me an Uber.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.680
And I'm like, what
the hell is this?

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.120
They're like, it's a new
thing here in San Francisco.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.480
It's really cool.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.020
And then a friend of mine
said, I met this guy, Travis.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:18.110
And I have this great picture
of Travis in my living room

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.710
here in LA pitching me
about Uber coming to LA.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.210
And I was already
an investor when

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.150
it was just in San Francisco.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:30.290
And seeing that whole thing,
and then his competitor

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:35.050
came up, which I got
into also, which made him

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.395
mad at me for a little while.

00:49:36.395 --> 00:49:38.020
But John Zimmer went
to my high school.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.811
John Zimmer was the
same age as my brother.

00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:42.100
He played soccer
with my brother.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.769
When that thing happened,
at first it was Zimride

00:49:44.769 --> 00:49:46.810
and I basically passed
because I was an Uber guy.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.820
But later on, I had
some frustrations

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.030
and I decided, John, OK.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.130
You know, let's go do this too.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:58.450
And I was on a 30 under 30 list
in Billboard when I was 27.

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.880
There was a 24-year-old
kid on the list.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.067
And I called up Billboard.

00:50:02.067 --> 00:50:03.650
Bill Werde was the
editor, and I said,

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.710
can I have the name and
number of every single person

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:06.209
on the list?

00:50:06.209 --> 00:50:09.610
Because I feel like my
peers are the people

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.980
that I want to grow with,
not somebody I aspire to be.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.790
We're going to come up together.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.720
Because whenever you meet
someone powerful, they say,

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.430
oh, of course I know them.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:16.055
I'll call them.

00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:17.505
We've known each other 30 years.

00:50:17.505 --> 00:50:19.630
And you realize that the
people sitting next to you

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.190
when you're working your
way up are the people

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.482
that you actually are going
to need when you get there.

00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:25.523
So I called everyone on
the list, and one of them

00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.310
was a young guy from
Sweden with a startup

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.870
that was just in Sweden.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.046
We became friends,
and he let me invest

00:50:32.046 --> 00:50:33.295
in his startup called Spotify.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:40.180
And along the way,
different friends

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.630
got me into different companies.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:45.419
And it worked out.

00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:46.960
JESSE MICHELS: You
make it seem easy,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.584
like you were like
accidentally friends

00:50:48.584 --> 00:50:49.820
with all-- that's crazy.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.903
SCOOTER BRAUN: No, listen.

00:50:50.903 --> 00:50:52.770
I just think--

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.380
I don't really think I'm
that good at this stuff.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.431
I really think I'm really lucky.

00:50:58.431 --> 00:51:00.180
When I was a kid and
I didn't do homework,

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.105
there'd be like
a freak snow day.

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:03.480
Because I've got
a lot of friends

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.280
who work really, really
hard, and they just

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.960
can't catch a break.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.440
And I'm the dude who goes on the
internet in the middle of night

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.720
and finds Justin, or
my friend sends me

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.762
a funny video of an
overweight Asian dude dancing

00:51:14.762 --> 00:51:16.469
and I'm like, oh, it's
like the Macarena.

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:17.400
I'll sign that.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.870
And it's Gangnam Style.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:24.060
And the things that have
happened to me in my career,

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.682
it just doesn't
really make sense.

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:27.140
So I don't really
think it's on me.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.940
I think somebody-- I'm going to
get real spiritual on you guys,

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.398
but I actually
really believe this,

00:51:31.398 --> 00:51:33.470
because when you cry
to your dad at 25

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.850
and then you wake up 11
years later next to who

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:40.960
I get to wake up with, with
my two kids and my life,

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.640
you can't just sit there and
be like, OK, this is normal,

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.840
because it's not.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.532
So I believe that
you get blessings

00:51:48.532 --> 00:51:49.740
to give them to other people.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.080
Otherwise you stop getting them.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.300
That's actually my
personal belief.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.330
And I believe as long as
we keep doing philanthropy,

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.600
as long as we keep giving back,
as long as we wake up every day

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.670
and find a way to make
sure somebody else

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.950
gets an opportunity,
then somebody upstairs

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.240
keeps opening the door
for more opportunities.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.310
And that's just my
personal belief.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:12.210
And there are
really shitty people

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.620
who get to win along the way.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:18.060
I'm not interested in
paying attention to them.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.424
We've just got to do what we do.

00:52:19.424 --> 00:52:20.757
JESSE MICHELS: That's beautiful.

00:52:20.757 --> 00:52:21.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.720
Do you have time for a couple
questions from the audience?

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.470
SCOOTER BRAUN: I've
got time for whatever.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.360
We didn't know how long
this was going to be.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.530
And originally when
we planned this,

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.904
we didn't know we'd be in our
new office in Santa Monica.

00:52:30.904 --> 00:52:34.150
So we thought coming out
here was going to take hours.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:38.187
So I don't really have anything
to do for another hour.

00:52:38.187 --> 00:52:40.770
And Zach has my phone, so I have
no idea how many clients have

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.822
called while I'm up here.

00:52:41.822 --> 00:52:43.530
And I'm actually really
enjoying the fact

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:44.910
that I don't have a phone.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:48.174
This is like when I
went to Burning Man.

00:52:48.174 --> 00:52:49.590
JESSE MICHELS:
Google Burning Man.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:49.980
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.970
JESSE MICHELS: Do
you have anything--

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:51.930
SCOOTER BRAUN: This
is nothing like when

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.846
I went to Burning Man.

00:52:55.052 --> 00:52:56.760
JESSE MICHELS: They
do say Burning Man is

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.490
the new Davos though, like
it's all just tech execs.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.000
SCOOTER BRAUN: I liked it.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.875
I rode a bike around.

00:53:00.875 --> 00:53:01.672
I don't do drugs.

00:53:01.672 --> 00:53:04.130
And for those people who have
this stigma that you do drugs

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.530
at Burning Man, not true.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.130
I don't do drugs,
but I do ride bikes.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.840
And I rode a bike
around that desert

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.480
like I was 15 years old
at Bible Street Park.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.560
My phone wasn't on.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.730
I was a wild man.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.160
I was riding that thing
straight into oblivion,

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.160
and it was awesome.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.039
So if you like
bike riding, I will

00:53:20.039 --> 00:53:21.330
tell you there's a great trail.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.330
It's called Burning Man.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:25.440
JESSE MICHELS: OK.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.920
I'm going to pass this mic
around for audience Q&amp;A.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.540
Before I do, do
you have anything

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.870
you want to plug or promote
that SB has going on?

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:33.870
SCOOTER BRAUN: I'm good.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.070
You guys are Google.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.403
You don't need anything from me.

00:53:36.403 --> 00:53:38.117
You've got a tea
shop in your office.

00:53:38.117 --> 00:53:41.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:41.197 --> 00:53:42.780
AUDIENCE: Oh, you're
going to toss it.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.090
That's part of the fun.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.370
JESSE MICHELS: And feel
free to pass to the next--

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:45.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.330
JESSE MICHELS: Cool.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:48.746
AUDIENCE: Diana [INAUDIBLE],,
thanks for being here today.

00:53:48.746 --> 00:53:50.570
You are an amazing storyteller.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.980
I've learned so much just
from listening to you.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.330
You've talked a lot about using
technology like social media

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.210
to discover new music
and new artists.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:04.290
Thoughts on super new technology
that could potentially

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:05.820
be used to discover new music?

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.510
Like robots, self-driving
cars, drones?

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:11.280
And to give some context, I
work at Google X. I'm just--

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.363
SCOOTER BRAUN: Blockchain.

00:54:12.363 --> 00:54:13.300
No, I'm kidding.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.174
AUDIENCE: Blockchain.

00:54:14.174 --> 00:54:15.465
Yeah, I think that will work.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.510
SCOOTER BRAUN: Technology
has actually always shaped

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.330
how we see the music industry.

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:28.532
So before Tesla really created
what we know as radio today,

00:54:28.532 --> 00:54:30.240
there was no music
industry because there

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.407
wasn't a way to distribute.

00:54:31.407 --> 00:54:33.990
So technology actually was the
creation of the music industry.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:39.660
And then if you look at
whether it be vinyl and then

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.160
the adaption to 8-track and
then CDs and cassettes and all

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.850
these different things and then
going to MP3 and now streaming,

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.310
technology has
always built, lifted,

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.380
and saved the music industry.

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.810
I have no idea what
it's going to be next.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.520
I know that I think
we're actually

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.500
in the infant
stage of streaming.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.583
Because if you actually
look at it and we're like,

00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:03.630
oh my god, this person
sold 5 million albums.

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:05.049
That's mind blowing.

00:55:05.049 --> 00:55:06.840
But the amount of people
on the planet that

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.923
listen to music, that
actually isn't mind blowing.

00:55:08.923 --> 00:55:11.730
We've never created
a way where, when

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.520
there's such a great separation
of wealth in this world,

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.980
to be able to distribute music
properly amongst all people.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.810
And now we have streaming,
which is changing that.

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.080
So I don't really know,
necessarily, what's next.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.330
I know I think
we're in round one.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.251
I mean, I think
it's $8.6 billion

00:55:28.251 --> 00:55:30.500
that streaming is now creating
for the industry, which

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.890
has brought it back up to where
it was and a little bit above.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.990
I think we're in,
literally, the first inning

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:38.000
of a nine-inning
game of streaming.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.160
I think it's going to
take the value of music

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.920
up in a way we
haven't seen before.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:48.004
And then I think as far AI, that
is the most interesting part

00:55:48.004 --> 00:55:49.670
for me, because that's
how we're getting

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.544
a lot of this playlisting
and everything else

00:55:51.544 --> 00:55:52.850
that's becoming so influential.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:58.260
But I still think it's
missing the human touch.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.250
Because AI can kind of
identify what songs go together

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:04.740
or how we put stuff
together, but a human touch

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:09.730
can identify a human's
interaction with music

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.380
in a timeline of life.

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.860
Because if I say to
you, tell me what

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.590
you were doing when
you were 11 years old,

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:19.860
you're probably not going to--

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.790
maybe something influential
happened when you were 11.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:23.873
But a lot of people are
like, I'm not really sure.

00:56:23.873 --> 00:56:26.030
But if I play you a really
big song from that year,

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:27.405
it's going to take
you right back

00:56:27.405 --> 00:56:28.940
to when you were 11 years old.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:32.600
And there's something
special that AI can't

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.450
do about identifying that.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.660
But also there's so many
people we're going to need AI.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.930
So I'm interested to
see what someone like

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.640
yourself comes up with next.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.860
And hopefully, by
the time you do,

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.360
I will be out of
the music industry.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.230
No, I'm kidding.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:49.177
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:49.177 --> 00:56:50.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.300
SCOOTER BRAUN: Good throw.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:58.940
AUDIENCE: So, Scooter, what
are your thoughts on blockchain

00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.630
technology?

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.090
SCOOTER BRAUN: My thoughts
are blockchain technology

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.750
is amazing, and it's going
to be innovative in 100

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.850
different industries.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:16.210
But coins aren't needed
in every single industry.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.360
So I think having
a coin associated

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.970
to every piece of
blockchain technology

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.900
is why 99% of the
coins will disappear.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.961
And the ones that make
sense for the technology

00:57:26.961 --> 00:57:29.460
that they're associated with
and make sense for the industry

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.320
that they're going
into will survive.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.340
And those coins will be
the Amazon of this bubble.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.940
But I think that there's
a very big difference

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.000
between blockchain technology
and cryptocurrency,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.120
in my opinion.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.160
And I think that the actual
use of blockchain technology--

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.160
listen, if they can break
blockchain technology,

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:50.790
we're all screwed.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:52.456
Because that means
that people can break

00:57:52.456 --> 00:57:54.900
our entire financial system.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.260
But I think it's going to
make all of our systems

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.559
more efficient.

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:02.850
But I think that people should
start educating themself

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.730
on the difference between
crypto and what blockchain

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.825
is, and actually
understand that it's way

00:58:08.825 --> 00:58:10.950
too easy to make coins,
and that's why most of them

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:11.995
should disappear.

00:58:11.995 --> 00:58:14.970
But until then, I'm going to
have as much fun as you are.

00:58:18.149 --> 00:58:20.190
JESSE MICHELS: [INAUDIBLE]
right in front of you.

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:21.222
Oh, right there.

00:58:21.222 --> 00:58:22.930
AUDIENCE: Scooter,
this has been awesome.

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.410
Thanks for coming.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:26.420
You're a tremendously
successful entrepreneur

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.710
across a range of industries--
tech, non-profits, music,

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:31.619
media.

00:58:31.619 --> 00:58:33.410
What excites you the
most in your business?

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.720
SCOOTER BRAUN: I'm really
cheesy now that I'm a dad--

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.710
bed time.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:44.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:50.540
I mean honestly, I get
excited by challenges,

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.850
and I get excited by insults.

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:56.510
So when everyone is like,
oh, you've done so well,

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:59.270
I get really bored, because
I don't know where to go.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.830
Insults have
usually led me where

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:03.860
to go because doing
the unreasonable thing

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.516
has always led to
the great thing.

00:59:06.516 --> 00:59:08.390
Doing what everyone
expects-- the status quo,

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.681
the reasonable-- doesn't lead
to any kind of greatness,

00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:12.260
doesn't lead to a good story.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.440
And I always said I wanted to be
my own story instead of reading

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.530
everyone else's.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.118
But what gets me
excited at this point--

00:59:22.118 --> 00:59:24.650
who here is a parent?

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:26.002
OK.

00:59:26.002 --> 00:59:28.460
So the people that raised their
hand are going to get this.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:30.920
My kid, my 3-year-old,
woke me up this morning,

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:36.790
slapped me in my forehead,
and said, Daddy, I love you.

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:38.670
So much better than a Grammy.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:42.350
So much better than,
you know, an IPO.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.590
There's no real describing it.

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:46.150
Because you do all
this stuff and you

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.870
don't really understand.

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.160
You're like, what am I here for?

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.118
And then you have kids.

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:52.205
And then you understand what
you actually are here for.

00:59:52.205 --> 00:59:54.580
You have a purpose, when you
have children, that you just

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.880
didn't have before.

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.534
And there's no good
time to have kids,

00:59:57.534 --> 00:59:59.200
because you're always
planning your life

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.310
and seeing it through
your own eyes.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.960
And then when they finally
show up, you're like,

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.890
I don't really
understand what life

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.560
would have been without you.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.620
Yeah, I know I sucked.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.110
You guys are leaving?

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:08.470
You guys want to leave?

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:09.280
Yeah, I know.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.665
I saw Dave Chapelle do this
one time at The Comedy Store.

01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:13.790
He did, like, a [INAUDIBLE]
when people walked out.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.550
And he did this.

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:17.008
Everyone give him a round of
applause because they hate me.

01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:18.958
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.110
I like [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.980
What makes me excited
is either the first time

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.070
I do something, being with my
family, experience like that,

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:33.050
or when someone I
work with has a first.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.860
Like, the first time I saw
this guy, Mike George, who

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:39.424
works for me, receive his first
platinum plaque in our company,

01:00:39.424 --> 01:00:40.840
I had, at that
point in my career,

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.580
received a lot of
platinum plaques.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.160
They're in the garage.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.370
Seeing him have the
joy of that first time

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.320
reminded me of what that felt
like, and that gives me joy.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.890
So I'm kind of at
a point now where

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:57.030
I feel like my life
is kind of absurd,

01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:00.090
and I have everything I've
ever needed and a lot more.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.590
And I only got there
because I stood

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.660
on the shoulders of all these
people that believed in me.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.730
So now it's my turn to
kind of work for them

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:08.030
and make sure I pull
them up to where I'm at.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.780
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.280
Thanks.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.060
AUDIENCE: So what
was your response

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:19.650
when Kanye West showed kind
of support for Donald Trump?

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.860
SCOOTER BRAUN: I disagreed.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.850
I mean, it's-- here's the thing.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.682
Living in Los
Angeles, I'm really

01:01:27.682 --> 01:01:29.390
grateful that I lived
in Atlanta, Georgia

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:32.600
until six years ago.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.554
Living in Los Angeles
and New York is amazing.

01:01:34.554 --> 01:01:35.970
And living in the
state's amazing,

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.980
because it's probably the most
forward state in the nation.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.110
But we're not without
fault. The largest

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.900
separation of wealth in the
country is in this state.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:49.670
And people acted like they lost
their damn minds when he won.

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.800
And to me, when he won,
I didn't freak out.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.289
Because that's the process.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:54.830
Someone needs to
win, and then you're

01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:56.661
supposed to heal
and come together.

01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.160
A lot of things
that he's done since

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.740
have disappointed me to
a place that I'm not OK.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.240
But I was going to
give him a chance

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.370
in the beginning, because
I think that's the process.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.400
And if you don't, then
you're a hypocrite.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.497
Because if Hillary would
have won and they said, oh,

01:02:10.497 --> 01:02:12.080
we don't want to
support her, we would

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.016
have been yelling at them.

01:02:15.016 --> 01:02:16.640
So when he felt that
way, I said, look,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.780
that's your opinion.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.870
But I also felt like he
was feeling that way when

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:23.990
at a point where he was sick.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.159
And I felt like there
were people around him--

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.200
it was very frustrating--

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.952
I thought were taking advantage
of a time where-- like,

01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:31.910
if you saw Quincy Jones'
most recent interview,

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:32.990
nobody should have
let that person

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:34.031
in the house at the time.

01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:36.320
Like, sometimes people
need to be given privacy.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.820
Just because they're
public figures,

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.330
they need to be given
a moment to process.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:44.210
But I know his heart.

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.270
And I know that
he's a human being

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.990
that I don't always agree with.

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.870
But I respect him.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.140
And he said what
he wanted to say.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.262
And I'm allowed to
have my own opinion.

01:02:53.262 --> 01:02:55.220
You know, just because
I manage someone doesn't

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.511
mean I need to agree with them.

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:59.540
Me and Vic Mensa, who I
manage, had a big disagreement

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.304
recently.

01:03:00.304 --> 01:03:02.720
And I was proud that he put
up on his Instagram-- he said,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.240
I know Scooter Braun
vehemently disagreed with me,

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.140
and he's my manager.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.900
But I appreciate him at
least having a conversation.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.204
I think we've messed
up in this country.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.620
And really around
the world, we've

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.580
forgotten how to
speak to each other.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.590
And we're forgetting
the same people

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.548
who were yelling at other
people we're claiming

01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:18.720
that we're supposed to help.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.690
And I think we need to
start having conversations

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:21.564
out of respect again.

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:24.804
Otherwise, nothing
is going to change.

01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:25.660
AUDIENCE: Cool.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.320
SCOOTER BRAUN:
You've got to throw

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.820
it all the way over there.

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.240
You have to throw it.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.830
Oh, good catch.

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:36.340
I thought she was going
a U. She went deep.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.749
She's got a Kirk Cousins arm.

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.290
AUDIENCE: So first of all, I
was a college student in Atlanta

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:43.051
from 2002 to 2006.

01:03:43.051 --> 01:03:44.800
So I probably went to
some of your parties

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.600
and didn't even know it.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.434
But you mentioned about
how when you have success,

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:51.100
you get bored, and
you're kind of always

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.433
looking for that next challenge.

01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:54.460
So is there something
on the horizon for you

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:58.000
that you feel like is some
sort of moonshot thing

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.500
that you think
you'll go after next?

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.510
Or is it just going
to be bringing up

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.330
those people behind you
and all of those things?

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:06.080
SCOOTER BRAUN: I think
it's a combination.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.080
If I want to bring them up,
then I've got to keep going.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.290
So the way I look at it,
here's the challenge.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:15.520
I'm 36 years old.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.680
He's like, you've
got a cool story.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.940
If this is the end of
my story, then I failed.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.200
Because I'm 36.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.610
The average entrepreneur
hits their stride at 39.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:28.540
So to me, I'm just
getting started.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.699
So I don't know,
necessarily, what it is next,

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:32.990
and I don't like talking
about stuff before it happens.

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:34.790
So there's things
we're working on.

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:37.570
But I also know part of my story
is going to include failure.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.060
Because the last decade of my
life has had so much success

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.030
that statistically-- if I'm
really not being a moron

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.490
and paying attention
to a little data--

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.100
statistically, I should
have some serious failure

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.420
on the horizon.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.760
You know, the Wall Street
goes up, it goes down.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.343
There's always got
to be a correction.

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:55.840
So what I'm excited
about is regardless

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.090
of what that correction is,
it's not going to stop me.

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:00.700
It's just going
to be a pit stop.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:05.180
Because now, where the
universe messed up is

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.830
they gave me too much.

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.040
Now that I got my wife and kids,
I'm playing with house money.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.470
So you can't really take
anything away from me.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:15.590
If I lose some money, or
like lose some popular--

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:17.960
you know, if I drop the
ball and some naysayers who

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.540
wanted to see me fail are
all like, I told you so,

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.915
they're going to be super
disappointed when they find out

01:05:22.915 --> 01:05:24.142
I'm not that upset.

01:05:24.142 --> 01:05:26.600
But I'm just going to keep
going and see where it takes me.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.030
And whatever comes
next, I'm ready for it.

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:31.340
And I get bored.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.230
But I also, I'm a workaholic.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.290
I can't really shut it off.

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:38.990
The hardest challenge for
me is work/life balance.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.376
I'm constantly getting better.

01:05:41.376 --> 01:05:43.250
But my wife-- she was
the one who said to me.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.833
She goes, there's a difference
between being present and being

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.060
present.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.900
And that's the thing I'm
working on the most at home,

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.400
putting the phone down
and being present.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.300
AUDIENCE: Good luck.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.480
SCOOTER BRAUN: Thanks.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.862
I hope you enjoyed the
party back in the day.

01:05:59.862 --> 01:06:00.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.500
This has been awesome.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.970
I'm curious.

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:07.480
Do you think you could have been
as successful had you pursued

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.836
a completely different path?

01:06:08.836 --> 01:06:10.210
Like, how much of
your success is

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.820
attributable to your
passion for music

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:17.590
and your craft, as opposed
to just your inherent drive?

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.090
SCOOTER BRAUN: I
mean, I don't know.

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:20.770
I know that I didn't go
into life being like,

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:21.894
you know what I want to do?

01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:23.380
Music.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.905
I just wanted to
be an entrepreneur.

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:27.280
And that's the way I've always
kind of considered myself.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.821
And I read a book
about David Geffen,

01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:31.060
where he said music
was the fastest way in.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.890
Because music takes a night.

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:34.930
And movies and TV and
entertainment take years.

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.540
But the one song can change
your life in a night.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.850
I was like, I'm in Atlanta.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:38.350
Let's go.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:44.652
But I don't know what
my life would have been.

01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:46.360
I think there's so
many points in my life

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.505
I look back and
think, if I would

01:06:47.505 --> 01:06:49.000
have turned that way
instead of that way, what

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:49.834
would have happened?

01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:52.208
You know, if I would've stayed
in that relationship, what

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.130
would have happened?

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.380
You know, there's so many
different ways I look at it.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.760
All I know is I thank
God every day I wake up,

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.440
and this is where I ended up.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.821
Because I'm 36 years old,
and whenever I get depressed,

01:07:02.821 --> 01:07:04.570
the one thing I remind
myself of is, like,

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:08.070
if you put my life against
any 36-year-old on the planet,

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.230
I'm going to take my life.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.410
I'm going to choose this.

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:13.970
This is good stuff for 36.

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.010
I'm working with this.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.210
This is fine by me.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:17.200
Except for the Jets.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.272
We never win.

01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:19.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.390
I see you with the
Steelers shirt.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.890
Sorry.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480
AUDIENCE: This is great.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.140
And I actually listen to
you on [INAUDIBLE] as well.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.887
So I'm one of your
three basketball fans.

01:07:30.887 --> 01:07:31.720
SCOOTER BRAUN: Nice.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.280
SCOOTER BRAUN: That
was fun with Bill.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:33.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.064
SCOOTER BRAUN: He's got to
show up at my pickup game now.

01:07:36.064 --> 01:07:39.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and there's
not too much overlap today.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.070
Curious-- you said
that Facebook was

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:43.770
kind of like the one that
got away on the tech side.

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:46.544
Curious if there's something
on the artist side--

01:07:46.544 --> 01:07:47.460
oh, I saw this person.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.835
They didn't come with me.

01:07:48.835 --> 01:07:51.210
SCOOTER BRAUN: I mean, there's
a bunch of different ones.

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:52.626
But I really--
it's like Facebook.

01:07:52.626 --> 01:07:53.550
I don't have a regret.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.630
I feel like it just led
me one way to another.

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:59.430
I mean, a funny story is I knew
Macklemore before he blew up.

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.710
We were friends, and I
knew about him in Seattle.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.860
And he had the mix tape, and
it was just all the hits.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.990
But it wasn't out yet.

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.865
And he sent it to me.

01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:07.930
We were talking.

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:09.780
And I was just like,
is there any way

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.054
I can get you to sign over here?

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.220
And he said, look, the only
person I would sign with

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.540
is Drake.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.195
So I hit up Drake.

01:08:17.195 --> 01:08:18.569
And I'm like, you
should do this.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:19.439
And he's like, OK, hit.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.189
And he tells me one
of his guys, you know,

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:23.330
to hit-- who he trusts
on the A&amp;R side.

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:27.710
And Drake and I weren't in
business the way we are now,

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.740
but we were friends.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.729
And his guy just didn't
pay attention and passed.

01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:34.229
And when Macklemore's album
went number one, they were like,

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:35.789
don't tell Drake.

01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:38.939
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:42.689
But, like I said, I wake
up and I look at my life.

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.700
I don't want to look
back and have regrets.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.075
I think the only
thing you should

01:08:46.075 --> 01:08:49.020
have regret about is things
that you do that were malicious.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.300
Missing out on stuff
or anything like that,

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.859
I don't have regrets.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.520
That's part of the journey.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.340
But if you do
something malicious--

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.200
I'll tell you something
I have regret about.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.350
I was at basketball camp when I
was in seventh grade or eighth

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:04.089
grade-- like sleep away camp--

01:09:04.089 --> 01:09:06.130
and these older kids, a
year older than me-- they

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:06.970
were real cool.

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.386
They were like,
come hang with us.

01:09:08.386 --> 01:09:09.819
Because I was good.

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:13.390
And they were like, man, this
kid in our hall, he's a dork.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.470
And I'm like, dork--

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.979
I'm a dork.

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:16.982
But OK.

01:09:16.982 --> 01:09:19.065
And they broke into his
room while he wasn't there

01:09:19.065 --> 01:09:20.815
and they put all his
shorts on the ground.

01:09:20.815 --> 01:09:23.050
They're like,
Scooter, pee on it.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.285
And I knew it was wrong.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:26.160
But these older kids
were peer pressuring me,

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.200
and I peed on this
poor kid's clothes.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:32.970
The camp-- it gets reported.

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:36.300
Kid's having to wear his
bathing suit to play and stuff,

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.649
because there's pee.

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.790
And I just felt so bad.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:42.337
I was like, screw these kids.

01:09:42.337 --> 01:09:44.420
So I went up to him and I
said, I did this to you.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.240
I'm so sorry.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.290
Screw these kids.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.250
I reported myself.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:48.750
They didn't let me play
in the all-star game

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.040
even though I had
made the all-star team

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.330
at the end of the week.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:54.870
And to this day, even
though I made it right,

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.480
kind of, I never
forgot that, because I

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.620
was like, that's regret.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.820
I knew better.

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.350
I shouldn't have done that.

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:03.071
But everything else in my life--

01:10:03.071 --> 01:10:04.320
if I missed out, I missed out.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.788
I didn't do anything bad.

01:10:07.788 --> 01:10:11.300
I shouldn't have peed
on his clothes, man.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.000
What seventh grader does that?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.360
Also, his mom-- he didn't tell
his mom that we made good--

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.080
so I didn't tell my
dad what happened.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.740
He didn't understand why I
wasn't in the all-star game.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.850
And the last day of
camp, the parents come.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:23.590
And the mom--

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:25.090
I'm sitting there,
and she comes up.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.210
You disgusting little kid.

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.620
How dare you pee on
my son's clothes.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.220
I'm like, what?

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:28.670
He's like, no, mom.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:29.110
We're good now.

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.520
We're good.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.103
And my dad's like,
what are you doing?

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:34.760
And I was like,
I don't know dad.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.640
And then he goes, how
dare you say my son.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.390
She goes, he peed.

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:39.230
He goes, he did not pee.

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:39.590
Tell them!

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.173
And all of the sudden,
he looks at me.

01:10:41.173 --> 01:10:44.560
And I'm like-- and he
goes, oh, you're dead.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.970
And that was not
a good interaction

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:49.340
with my dad at that time.

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.910
Coach Braun was
not happy with me.

01:10:53.422 --> 01:10:54.380
AUDIENCE: Hey, Scooter.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:57.380
Question-- what are
conversations at the dinner

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.900
table like with your family?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:06.950
The Emanuels bring
their work to the table,

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:09.920
and their narrative reminds me
a lot of your family's as well.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.154
So I was curious if your
family has a similar--

01:11:12.154 --> 01:11:13.320
SCOOTER BRAUN: So, question.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.732
Do you want to know what
it was like growing up

01:11:15.732 --> 01:11:16.690
or what is it like now?

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:18.106
AUDIENCE: Let's
do the growing up.

01:11:18.106 --> 01:11:19.322
SCOOTER BRAUN: Growing up--

01:11:19.322 --> 01:11:20.780
it was very important
to my parents

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.055
that we sat down at the
table and had a family meal.

01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:25.430
And my parents
were 9:00 to 5:00.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.890
Because my dad was a coach
and then he was a dentist.

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:29.540
And my mom was an orthodontist.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.060
So they could be home
every single night

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.854
when work was done.

01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:35.270
And it was always important
for us to sit around the table

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:36.270
and have a conversation.

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:39.440
And me and my brother
were very competitive,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.610
and we'd get into fights because
we were only two years apart.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:44.720
But if we fought too much,
then dad got involved,

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.650
and he was bigger and
stronger and fights better.

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:52.970
But it was very much challenges,
extremely competitive

01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:53.660
challenges.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.790
Me and my dad were
definitely the loudest.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:58.790
My mom, when she spoke,
everyone shut up and listened,

01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:01.110
because she was the quiet boss.

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.010
My dad would talk a lot, but if
my mom spoke, it was like, OK.

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:08.120
We're done now.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.160
But it was always,
what did you do today?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.614
Very competitive, kind of
pushing each other, but also

01:12:13.614 --> 01:12:14.780
a tremendous amount of love.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.050
There was high praise.

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.170
We were appreciated
for our achievements,

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.370
and we were always told--

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:23.420
every night before
we went to bed,

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.130
my dad used to come to
my room-- as long as I

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.320
can remember-- and say, hey.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.607
Brauns are different.

01:12:27.607 --> 01:12:29.190
And we were like,
what does that mean?

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:29.990
And he would always
say, it doesn't

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:31.760
mean you're better than
anybody, but you're different.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.468
And I hold you to
extraordinary standards

01:12:33.468 --> 01:12:35.120
because I think
you're extraordinary.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.700
And after a while, you begin
to believe the propaganda.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.370
So we went into
life just believing

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:43.730
that we could do anything
because he had ingrained that

01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:45.380
into us.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:51.170
What our conversations
are like today is,

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:55.972
Levi will usually say, ahh.

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:58.990
[TONGUE FLAPPING] Ahh.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.820
Daddy.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.280
Mama.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.380
Go.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.580
Jagger has a new song
called onion man.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:13.010
The lyrics are, onion man,
onion man, onion man, onion man,

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:14.120
onion man--

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.934
over and over and over again
for about half an hour.

01:13:18.934 --> 01:13:19.850
AUDIENCE: Sample that.

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:21.140
SCOOTER BRAUN: And
then my wife and I

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.306
are just trying to have a
conversation while they're

01:13:23.306 --> 01:13:26.120
awake, and then we usually talk
once we get them down asleep.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.700
But actually, I'll tell
you a good conversation

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.620
about my wife, because I haven't
spoken about her a lot today.

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.244
But I want to give
you an understanding

01:13:32.244 --> 01:13:35.417
of why I am the way I am.

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:37.250
So, she didn't want to
date me because I was

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.880
in the entertainment industry.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.820
And I saw her TED
Talk on Fuck Cancer,

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.150
and it made me want to meet her.

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.710
And I had to trick
her into a date

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:49.390
when I found out she was
single like a year later.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:50.930
JESSE MICHELS:
How'd you do that?

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:51.830
SCOOTER BRAUN: Well,
she thought she

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:53.000
was going to drinks
with a bunch of people.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.710
When she showed
up, it was just me.

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.400
And I had my friends set it up.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.310
And then, like the
first date, we kind of

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.490
fell in love pretty
quickly, and that was that.

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:06.230
But now we're
together for a while,

01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:08.716
and I think some
of you in this room

01:14:08.716 --> 01:14:10.340
might have heard that
Justin Bieber had

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.460
a turbulent time in his life.

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.417
Things weren't always so
easy for the young man.

01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:19.250
And that was a very,
very, hard about a year

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.480
and a half, two years.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.790
And one day, he and
some other clients

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.456
were going through
stuff and it was just

01:14:24.456 --> 01:14:26.745
like four days of
just really bad stuff.

01:14:26.745 --> 01:14:29.120
And I was bringing it home
night after night after night.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:29.660
We're getting in bed.

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.534
I'm bringing it home.

01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:34.670
And she is just like, look.

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:37.090
You can't keep
bringing this to bed

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.670
because I'm not
getting any of you.

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.280
You've got to cut it
off when we go to bed.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.680
And in the classic
entertainment prick move,

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.791
I respond with, look.

01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:52.040
You have to understand this
is what I do for a living.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.331
You don't appreciate what I do.

01:14:53.331 --> 01:14:54.500
This is how I provide.

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.560
This is how I am able
to do everything.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.270
And my wife looks at me
and she says, OK, cool.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:03.561
You're right.

01:15:03.561 --> 01:15:05.310
So I was helping someone
with chemo today.

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.640
I'm going to bring that to bed.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:13.519
And I shut up, realize instantly
how much I loved her and said,

01:15:13.519 --> 01:15:14.310
I love you so much.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.854
Thank you.

01:15:14.854 --> 01:15:16.520
Because my wife is
the number-one person

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.186
who introduced in my
life the difference

01:15:18.186 --> 01:15:22.520
between problems
and inconveniences.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.180
When we work in this world
of tech or entertainment

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:30.620
or wealth, you tend to
think that what you're doing

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.920
is very, very important.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:38.180
And 99% of the stuff I deal with
is inconveniences-- high-class

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.700
inconveniences,
but inconveniences.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.170
And what my wife deals
with is problems.

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.262
And I think she taught
me the difference,

01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:46.470
so it's given me perspective.

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.853
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:47.853 --> 01:15:49.747
JESSE MICHELS: That's awesome.

01:15:49.747 --> 01:15:51.080
AUDIENCE: I'm writing that down.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.930
Problems versus
inconveniences-- I like it.

01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:53.721
AUDIENCE: Throw it?

01:15:55.887 --> 01:15:56.720
SCOOTER BRAUN: Good.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.400
You guys are very athletic.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.220
Everyone has perfect throws.

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.841
No one's dropped.

01:16:02.841 --> 01:16:03.840
AUDIENCE: First of all--

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.673
SCOOTER BRAUN: Can we
sign them to the Jets?

01:16:05.673 --> 01:16:09.170
Yeah, we need you.

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:12.110
AUDIENCE: I appreciate you being
very honest and candid and not

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.860
scripted.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.830
I like all the stories
you've been telling.

01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:18.110
So, a lot of people
like the entertainment

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:21.320
industry in all its fame
and glory and wealth,

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.960
and a lot of people want
to stay far away from it

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.350
because of all the egos.

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:28.850
In your journey through
the entertainment industry,

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.920
what have you learned
to really like about it

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.172
and what have you
really hated about it?

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:35.630
SCOOTER BRAUN: What
I like about it

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:37.370
is, most of the
stuff I do that I get

01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:39.820
paid for I would
actually do for free,

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.710
like to be able to go to a show
or help someone make a record

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:50.360
or make a TV show or a film
or advise someone on a tech--

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.560
that's fun.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.930
Most of that stuff
I would do for free.

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:57.530
The bullshit is what I get paid
for, the stuff that I hate,

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.180
the inconvenience
versus problems,

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.910
and people not understanding
the difference.

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:04.490
But the hardest part--

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:08.590
does that answer the
good part well enough?

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.130
And also, when
you're in an elevator

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.800
or when you're in a restaurant
and the background music

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.787
is a record that
you were a part of--

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:16.370
that's actually a
really cool feeling.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.120
Because you're not really paying
attention and you're like,

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:18.911
why do I know this?

01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:22.230
And all of a sudden you're like,
I helped put this together.

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.800
That's pretty damn cool.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.731
Or I just made $0.25 because
I have the publishing.

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:36.506
The hard part is
knowing your truth.

01:17:36.506 --> 01:17:38.380
And I think it's
highlighted in entertainment

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.200
because it's so high-profile,
but knowing your truth is

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.100
really the hard part because
people that even I think know

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:50.070
my character, that have gotten
to know me, have been like--

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.940
because of their own
issues or whatever--

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.320
they will call you out
on your truth and say,

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.640
well, I think you're in
it for the wrong reasons.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.370
They'll kind of put you down.

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:02.320
They'll project their
negativity on to you.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.700
And because I decided
early on, OK, I

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.190
want to build a brand
that I can build off of,

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:11.540
I did put a target on my back.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.210
And having to know who I
am and what I stand for

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:17.390
and what I believe
in and who I love

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.780
and who loves me has been the
greatest challenge of holding

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.080
onto that so I don't get lost
in other people's expectations

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.200
and--

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.170
not even expectations--
their projections

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:32.390
of what they want to see to
make themselves feel better.

01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:33.932
And understanding
that you don't have

01:18:33.932 --> 01:18:35.139
to be friends with everybody.

01:18:35.139 --> 01:18:36.500
You could be polite to everyone.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.320
You could be kind to
everyone, but you're not

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.560
going to change someone.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.110
If they want to project
that negativity on to you,

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:48.010
you have to just be OK with it
and know it's not your truth.

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:50.450
And in my industry,
it's very, very hard

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:56.420
sometimes to not get lost in
the amount of negativity that

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.320
exists.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.200
People aren't happy
for each other.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.016
They want to break
each other down.

01:19:02.016 --> 01:19:03.890
They want to count your
money or your success

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.600
and hope that you fail.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.300
And right before we
got on the stage,

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.839
I was joking because we were
talking about people's success.

01:19:10.839 --> 01:19:12.380
And I said, look,
my thing is, I hope

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.921
everyone's successful
because I don't

01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:15.770
want to pay for your vacation.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.310
I want to go on
vacation with you,

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.700
and I want you to pay
for your own vacation.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.440
Do you know what it's like to
bring friends on vacation that

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.460
can't pay for their vacation?

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.376
It's very frustrating.

01:19:23.376 --> 01:19:25.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.810
So yeah.

01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.660
I'm telling you, if we can
all go on vacation together

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.970
and everybody stands on
their own two, it's great.

01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:36.632
So I want everyone
to be successful.

01:19:36.632 --> 01:19:38.590
One of my buddies just
launched his own company

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:41.700
and finally left an
agency after 12 years.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.640
I couldn't be happier for him.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.810
I'm rooting for
him from the top.

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.370
And originally, he
wanted to come in,

01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.530
and I was going to get 50%
of the company and fund it.

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:50.880
And then he changed his
mind and goes, look.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.140
You'll be my first
investor if I need it,

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.090
but I don't think I
need funding right now.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:56.010
And another friend was
like, are you upset?

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:56.730
I was like, no.

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:58.140
He's doing what's right for him.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.064
I want him to win.

01:19:59.064 --> 01:20:01.230
And at the end of the day,
if he becomes successful,

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.620
he buys dinner.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.490
So, I think it's
just not getting lost

01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:07.599
and that's the hardest thing.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:09.390
You got to throw it
all the way over there.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.931
You got this.

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:10.480
You got this.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.380
You got this.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:11.880
Yes.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.570
JESSE MICHELS: Wow.

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.695
SCOOTER BRAUN: I'm telling
you, this is incredible.

01:20:14.695 --> 01:20:17.260
AUDIENCE: I'm British, so
we don't catch things well.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.000
We just run away.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.980
SCOOTER BRAUN: Use your feet.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.600
AUDIENCE: Big feet, small arms.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.640
It's interesting
hearing you talk,

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.330
because you said you always
wanted to be an entrepreneur.

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.010
But the way you talk
about your life,

01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:28.080
it doesn't seem like
your primary goal

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.140
has ever really been about
business or about money.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.850
It sounds as though
you've wanted

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:35.280
to go on a journey that's
allowed you to uncover what

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.630
is valuable in life for you, and
now you've reached that point.

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.280
Would you say that's true?

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.050
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yeah, but I--

01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:46.500
god, you guys got me telling
so many life stories.

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.190
So when I was a kid, we moved
from the Bible Street Park area

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:52.680
to this house out
in the boonies.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.400
And this guy from Greenpeace
showed up at the door

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.630
and he asked us for money,
explained everything.

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:02.130
And I was like, oh,
this is amazing.

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:03.620
He's going to save the world.

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.540
And I went and got
my mom and was like,

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:05.840
we should write him a check.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.470
And she's like, look.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.300
We give to charities, but
we can't just give money

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.260
to every single person.

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:11.660
We got to pay bills and
put food on the table.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:12.979
And I was like, no mom.

01:21:12.979 --> 01:21:13.520
It's amazing.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.228
Give him a check.

01:21:14.228 --> 01:21:17.090
So I convinced my mom to give
him whatever check it was--

01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:18.680
$25, $50--

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.660
to support Greenpeace.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:26.900
And he starts to leave, and
I'm like, where's his car?

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.110
And my mom was like,
he doesn't have a car--

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:30.860
part of the cause,
he's walking from house

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.130
to house because he's
supporting the environment.

01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:36.170
And I was like, but we
don't live near a bus

01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:39.170
station or a train station.

01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:41.030
He's going to be
walking for miles.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.840
And my mom's like,
yeah, that's part of it.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.440
And I was like,
this guy is amazing.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.540
But in that moment, I was
like, if my mom doesn't

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.910
write him a check,
he's just a dude

01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:51.860
walking from house to house.

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.030
He's too reliant on the check.

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:57.940
And I always like to figure
out ways to skip steps,

01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.980
and that was when I
realized-- very young--

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.442
that money was an
avenue to freedom.

01:22:02.442 --> 01:22:04.650
And as I got older and got
to witness a lot of people

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.191
with money, I realized a lot of
people don't understand that,

01:22:07.191 --> 01:22:09.180
and it ends up trapping
them even more.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.700
But I think being
an entrepreneur

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.860
allows me to do everything
that you're describing.

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.620
And that's why
I've always wanted

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:22.430
to have financial freedom and
success because I don't ever

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:25.800
want to be limited or have
my dreams or my passions

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.430
or my wants for this world
to be blocked because I

01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:32.980
can't get a check from someone.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.930
And I'm seeing it now.

01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:37.420
We did the telethon last
year called "Hand in Hand"

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.060
where we raised money for
the victims of the hurricane.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.710
And being able to go out and
do that because of the power

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:48.340
I had as an entrepreneur,
that was liberating.

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.850
And then people gave money.

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:53.230
I agree with you.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.540
I think if I didn't
look at it that way--

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.370
the word entrepreneur
is funny, because we

01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:59.850
think, oh, it's someone who
wants to make a ton of money.

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:02.592
But ask that person what they
want to do with the money.

01:23:02.592 --> 01:23:05.050
And if they don't know what
they want to do with the money,

01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.977
I think they're a pretty
shitty entrepreneur.

01:23:06.977 --> 01:23:08.560
I just know what I
want to do with it.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.722
I want to provide for
my family, my friends,

01:23:11.722 --> 01:23:13.930
and I want to be able to
make an impact in the world,

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:16.229
because in 100 years, no
one's going to remember me.

01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:17.770
No one's going to
remember any of us,

01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.270
to be honest with
you, in 100 years.

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:21.170
But I think they'll
feel our impact.

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:23.860
So I want to be able
to have as much capital

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.591
as I need to create impact.

01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:29.776
Does that answer it?

01:23:29.776 --> 01:23:31.160
JESSE MICHELS: All right, guys.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.912
That might have been
realest, best interview I've

01:23:33.912 --> 01:23:35.370
been a part of for
Talks at Google.

01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:35.911
So thank you.

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:37.400
SCOOTER BRAUN: Over my brother?

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.983
JESSE MICHELS: I
kind of implied that.

01:23:38.983 --> 01:23:40.670
I'm not saying it
explicitly, but--

01:23:42.644 --> 01:23:44.310
SCOOTER BRAUN: I just
like repeating it.

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:46.460
Like I said, we're
very competitive.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:50.290
By the way, before I leave,
would you mind standing up?

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.340
Yes.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.384
Please turn around.

01:23:52.384 --> 01:23:54.550
Everyone, please, he put
together a wonderful outfit

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.758
today and I want you to give
him a round of applause.

01:23:56.758 --> 01:23:58.709
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:58.709 --> 01:24:00.250
JESSE MICHELS: Give
it up for Sanjay.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:01.041
SCOOTER BRAUN: Yes.

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:02.830
Thank you.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.925
It is not that cold.

01:24:03.925 --> 01:24:06.578
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:06.578 --> 01:24:07.536
JESSE MICHELS: Oh, man.

01:24:07.536 --> 01:24:08.595
SCOOTER BRAUN: All
right. this is fun.

01:24:08.595 --> 01:24:09.660
JESSE MICHELS: Scooter,
thank you so much--

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.120
SCOOTER BRAUN: Thanks
for being a good sport.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.270
JESSE MICHELS: --for coming.

01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:11.560
Give it up for Scooter, guys.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.210
[APPLAUSE]
