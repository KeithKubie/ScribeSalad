00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.370
Are you building apps
for business customers?

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.620
If yes, I'm going
to tell you how

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.370
to take your app to more
than 5 million businesses

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.197
by publishing on the
Google Apps Marketplace.

00:00:11.197 --> 00:00:13.160
Hi, I'm Apoorv Saxena.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.450
I'm the product manager of
Google Apps Marketplace.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.306
You're going to learn
three things on this video.

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:22.340
First, what is the marketplace?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.730
Why should you publish
on the marketplace?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.680
And how to publish
on the marketplace.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
Let's get into details.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.630
Google Apps Marketplace is
the number one preferred

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.710
destination for over
$5 million businesses

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.160
that use Google
Apps for Business.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.200
Admins come to the
marketplace to discover

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410
high-quality, trusted
apps that they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.510
can install for your domain.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.620
These are apps,
such as FlashPanel,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.180
that have done great integration
with the Google Apps suite.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.050
FlashPanel is an admin
tool that allows customers

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.130
to manage and secure
their domains.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.900
Another example is
Mavenlink, which

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.230
has done a great integration
with Google Drive, Gmail,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.980
and Calendar.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.990
It's a project management app,
where once a task is completed,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740
you get a notification in the
email where you can understand

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.650
the status of the task.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.700
You can share documents within
Drive using that project

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.060
management app and
also set reminders

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.890
within Google Calendar.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.150
Admins can discover your
app by going to the website

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.190
or by going the admin console.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.010
Once an app is
discovered, the admin

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.280
can install your app
to a specific set

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.740
of users or all users
within their domain.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.740
So what happens when an app
is installed in a domain?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130
Once an app is
installed, the app

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.170
is accessible by the
users in the domain

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.220
through various touch points
within the Google App suite.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.760
For example, here, a Gmail
user can access your app

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.910
by clicking on the App
Launcher drop down menu.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.050
Here, for example, if the
user clicks on Insightly,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.770
he is single-signed
on into Insightly

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.490
right there from
the App Launcher.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.539
Users can also access their
app from the Drive Create menu.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.970
Here, an app such as Lucidpress,
a design and layout app,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.290
has done an
integration with Drive.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.050
Once the app is installed,
users can directly

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.940
launch Lucidpress from
Drive and also store

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.650
design documents in Drive.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.670
They can even open Gmail
attachments using Lucidpress.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.360
You might say, all
this sounds great,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.290
but how big is the marketplace?

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.950
And what is its reach?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.920
How about 200 million?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.130
That's the number of seats that
our customers have installed

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.850
since the launch of Marketplace.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.770
And this number is
increasing rapidly.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.590
But that's not all.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.320
Developers who have been
successful on the Marketplace

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.270
tell us Marketplace offers a
truly differentiated experience

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.310
than any other
distribution channel.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.120
It drives 4x more
paid conversion

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210
than any other
distribution channel.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.050
It drives 2x more engagement
than other channels.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.420
And it also drives
1.5x, in some cases,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.995
of customer lifetime
value for our customers.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.590
So let's look into how to
publish on the marketplace.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470
To publish on the
Marketplace, you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.190
need to do first
prepare your app.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.640
You need to create a project
in the Google Apps developer

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.150
console.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.460
In this project, you need to
configure the Google Apps SDK

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.610
and other associated
Google Apps SDK that you

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.320
need to build your integration.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.340
For example, if you're
building a drive indication,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.860
you need to enable
Drive SDK and also

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.660
ask for the Drive API access.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.430
Once you have done
these two things,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.230
your app is ready
for publishing.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.790
Publishing involves
three main steps.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
You are to prepare your app,
manifest and associated assets.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.660
Then you have to configure
in the Chrome Web Store

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.070
the publishing settings.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.960
And then you have to
submit an app review form.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.360
Let's go into the details of
each of these steps briefly.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.520
Publishing the app
manifest tells us

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.959
a little more information
about your app.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.700
This many app manifests should
look very similar to the Chrome

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.470
Web Store App
manifest if you have

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.890
published on the
Chrome Web Store.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.940
The only difference is the
domain installable container,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.420
as you see highlighted
in this slide.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.530
This tells us that you
are ready to publish

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.510
your app to the Google Apps
for Business customers.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.540
Once you have built
this app manifest

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.074
and uploaded the
corresponding app icons,

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:50.240
you now need to go to the
Chrome Web Store Developer

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.470
console, upload
this information.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.120
Also add other details,
like app descriptions,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240
screenshots, URLs.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.994
And also select the
necessary category

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.535
where you want this
app to be listed,

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:03.110
and region and the language.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.960
Once you have done
that, you're now

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.900
ready for the last step, which
is filling out the app review

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.610
form.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.790
We use this form to
understand what integrations

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.460
you are building and to make
sure you're following the best

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.400
practices as listed on the
Marketplace Documentation page.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.410
We also test out the
integration to make

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.040
sure the user
experience is seamless.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.500
We also use this step to
prevent any abuse and spam

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.440
of the publishing process.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.020
This step usually takes no
more than two weeks for us

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.790
since this time of you
submitting the review form.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.660
Once the app is
published, your app

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.130
is now visible to more
than 5 million businesses,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.010
as I mentioned.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.360
But that's not all.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.910
There is one more step.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.440
You can also drive more
installs for your app right

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.445
from your website by
clicking on the Integrate

00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:54.930
with Google button.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.270
This is a button that we
launched two months back.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.390
It helps admins directly
start the install process

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.930
from your website without
ever going to the Google Apps

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.430
Marketplace.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.770
For more information on how to
do integration with Integrate

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.960
with Google, please visit
the Marketplace Documentation

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.950
webpage.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.320
The webpage also
provides you more details

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.940
about how to be successful
on the Marketplace.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.890
In summary, Marketplace is
the preferred destination

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.950
for more than 5
million businesses

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.650
that are using Google
Apps for Business

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.360
for finding business apps.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.760
It is also driving great, high
quality installs for your app.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.450
And also, we have
done a great job

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.740
of providing three easy steps
to publish on the marketplace.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.950
So if you are a
business app developer

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.560
and if you haven't published
on the Marketplace,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.820
what are you waiting for?

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.970
Go out there, code,
and we would love

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.470
to see you on the
Google Apps Marketplace.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.280
Thank you.
