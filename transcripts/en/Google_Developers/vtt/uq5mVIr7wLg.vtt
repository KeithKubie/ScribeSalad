00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:33.510
DEREK SLATER: Hey.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.480
This is Derek Slater.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.030
I'm a policy manager
here at Google.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.010
And welcome back to
another edition of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.980
Google Developers Live.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.960
This time we're talking
about the ITU.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.690
This week, starting in Dubai,
governments from around the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.300
world have gathered to talk
at the International

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.630
Telecommunication Union about
the future of the internet.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.030
A number of important issues
are on the table.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.210
And with governments gathering
in Dubai, we wanted to have a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.800
global dialogue of our own here
about this issue with

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.110
some of the leaders from around
the world, in civil

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.190
society, and internet freedom
groups to speak about this.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.040
You can learn about what
Google's been saying on this

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.830
issue at google.com/takeaction.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700
But today we're going to turn
it over to these range of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.670
leaders from around the world
to hear from them and what

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.880
they're doing, what they think,
and what's the next

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.570
step in internet freedom around
the world after this

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.340
conference.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.840
We'll start with just a range
of introductions So you can

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.180
get to know the panel.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.300
Carolina, let's start
with you.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.550
Why don't you introduce
yourself?

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.745
CAROLINA BOTERO: Hello.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.230
I am Carolina Botero.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.750
I am a lawyer in Bogota,
Colombia.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.440
And I am directing a
group that's called

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.160
Internet Law and Society.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.610
And we have been active for the
last two years, like three

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.340
years, on the issues
of digital rights.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.740
And we're very interested
in the ITU.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.340
In fact, we managed to get
ourselves in the delegation to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.325
go and see how Latin American
countries were doing, but at

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:01.940
the end, couldn't travel.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.050
Anyway, we're doing it
from the distance.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.190
And my colleague is Pilar.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.110
PILAR SAENZ: Hello.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.530
I am Pilar Saenz.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.880
I work with Carolina
in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.040
And as she say, we are trying
to involve ourselves in the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.890
ITU meeting, but we
can't travel.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.072
But we think that it's an

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:31.040
important, it's a huge meeting.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.770
And we need to rework
[INAUDIBLE] in

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.840
a lot of this meeting.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.540
DEREK SLATER: Thanks, guys.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.870
Claudio, why don't you introduce
yourself and your

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.120
organization.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.780
CLAUDIO RUIZ: You can
hear me, right?

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.225
DEREK SLATER: Yes.

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:51.440
CLAUDIO RUIZ: Well,
I'm Claudio Ruiz.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.960
And I'm director of a Chilean
organization called Derechos

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.020
Digitales--

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.760
like, digital rights
in Spanish.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.265
And Derechos Digitales is a
nonprofit organization based

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:10.830
in Santiago who fights for human
rights in the digital

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.920
environment.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.020
And the kind of thing that we're
working on in the last

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.310
year or so was related to
copyright for one side,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.920
privacy for the other,
and freedom of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.660
speech on the internet.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.400
So we're very, very, involved
in all this ITU process and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.900
the way that can in some way be
involved or change the way

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.120
of the internet as a platform
for developing human rights.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.730
DEREK SLATER: Marilia,
why don't you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.980
introduce yourself as well?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.790
MARILIA MACIAL: Hi.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.440
My name is maybe
Marilia Macial.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.410
I am a researcher at the Center
for Technology and

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.230
Society in FGV in Brazil.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.520
The center is mainly devoted
to research on

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.990
intellectual property.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.110
We follow discussions in the
World Intellectual Property

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.340
Organization.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.980
And we also develop research
on internet governance.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.670
I've been involved in research
in internet governance for

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.790
seven years now, following
different topics basically and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.260
mostly in the UN.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.680
I have been a civil society
representative in the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.030
Commission for Science and
Technology for development,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.329
and on the working group
that has discussed IGF

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.019
improvements as well.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.459
And we are following
the ITU debates.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.940
We have a researcher from our
center that has managed to

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.400
join the Brazilian delegation.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.810
So we have information that
she's passing to us.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.236
And it's being quite
interesting.

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:33.940
DEREK SLATER: Well we look for
the hearing about that.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.740
Mawaki, please introduce
yourself.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.380
MAWAKI CHANGO: Hello.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.400
I'm Mawaki Chango.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.550
I have worked since the late
19s in the areas of

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.400
information and communication
technologies, which we refer

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.550
to as ICT in general; policy
and development, systems,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.440
notably at UNESCO, and with the
International Development

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.440
Research Center.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.140
And actually during the WSIS
process, I was a Civil

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.360
Society-- an African Civil
Society participant.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.560
And later on, just before the
second phase of the summit, I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.140
was a joint United Nations and
a DIPLO foundation fellow at

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.970
the Secretariat of the Working
Group on Internet

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.230
Governance in Geneva.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:38.310
Currently actually, I also
served as counselor with

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.180
ICANN's generic name supporting
organization for

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.240
generic top-level domain
names policies.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.770
And recently I have just
completed, actually, a Ph.D at

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.430
Syracuse University.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.466
And my research focus is
identity and authentication,

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:03.460
from digital identity
all the way back to

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.750
well medieval seals.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.960
So currently I'm project
coordinator for APC in charge

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.490
of internet policy in Africa.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.230
So as to APC, my organization,
which is the Association for

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.132
Progressive Communications, it
is a group that works for

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.100
[INAUDIBLE] work of
civil society

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500
organizations across the world.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.280
And its focus is particularly
on ICTs and particularly on

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:42.060
internet access across
the globe, and ICT

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.820
availability in general.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:51.390
And as such, APC advocates
for internet [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.290
policy making processes
so that everybody--

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.620
what you call nowadays--

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.060
can have a say in the
policy development

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.220
process regarding ICT.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.270
DEREK SLATER: Thanks Mawaki.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.530
Jochai, we'll let you introduce
yourself as well.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.240
Let me start with a
question for you.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.400
And then we can open it up for
discussion across the group.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.720
And it's great to have you all
from around the world.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.580
Jochai, why don't you
introduce yourself.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.620
And then tell us a little bit
about what is going on at the

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.370
ITU this week?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.370
Can you give an overview
for the viewers?

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.210
Where did this come from?

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.430
What's the history of it?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.200
And try and make sense of this
alphabet soup of internet

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.610
policy acronyms that we're
talking about today.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.380
JOCHAI BEN-AVIE: Sure.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.470
I'm Jochai Ben-Avie.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.960
I'm the policy director
at Access.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.470
We're an international
organization that defends and

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.250
extends the digital
rights of users at

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.170
risk around the world.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.440
So we combine a global movement
of users in almost

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.070
every country if not every
country in the world, who are

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.310
signing petitions, going to
protests, mobilizing around

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.330
these issues including
extensively around the WCIT,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.420
which we'll define.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.490
It's the World Conference
on International

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.740
Telecommunications.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.950
And then we have a policy shop
that I direct that does

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.030
practical policy recommendations
to

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.280
governments, corporations, and
civil society, and then a tech

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.710
arm that's providing near real
time 24/7 support to activists

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.740
on the ground and building new
technologies to support them.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.930
We've been pretty deeply engaged
in the WCIT and ITU

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.700
for some time now.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.300
One of our policy analysts
is over there as well.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.490
So let's go through this
alphabet soup.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.980
What is-- the ITU is
the International

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.799
Telecommunication Union.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.510
It's a UN agency.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.010
And right now they're
hosting the WCIT.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.750
Basically this is an opaque
government-controlled event.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.190
And the goal is to update a
decades-old international

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.420
treaty that's called
the ITRs--

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.370
the International
Telecommunication Regulations.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.940
So there are three points to
think about here in terms of

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.600
framing the debate and getting
some background here.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.270
Ultimately this is
going to be--

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.770
this treaty does need
to be updated.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.780
It is really out of date.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.910
It was last touched in 1988.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.950
And ultimately the biggest thing
that's going on here

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.230
is-- or rather in Dubai, I
should say-- is whether this

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.950
binding international treaty
and the ITU's corresponding

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.800
mandate should be expanded to
internet and internet policy.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.130
This would represent a really
big shift away from the open,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.760
multi-stakeholder institutions
that currently doing internet

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.200
policy making.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.650
Another sort of random alphabet
soup-- we have ICANN,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.320
the International Corporation
for Assigned Names Numbers;

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.170
the IETF, the Internet
Engineering Task Force; the

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.770
EEE, and a variety of others.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.660
And the thing that really
differentiates from the ITU is

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.900
that the ITU, only governments
have a vote.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.380
In order to join the ITU--

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.430
the Secretary General likes to
make a big point that there

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.770
are 700 sector members.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.800
But those 700 sector members
have to pay anywhere between

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.350
$2,000 and $35,000
to be there.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.210
And they still can't
speak on the floor.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.820
And this stands in
sharp contrast to

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.890
what we're doing here.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.830
In terms of the second point to
know about this process and

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.800
what it's been like, the
preparatory process has been

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.075
deeply flawed.

00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:18.110
Like the ITU, it lacks
transparency.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.734
Throughout the preparatory
process, the only way we've

00:10:19.734 --> 00:10:22.140
been able to be able to get
documents has been largely

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.470
through leaks.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.530
And it really lacks
inclusivity.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.100
Users have not had a voice.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.850
So society by and large
hasn't had a voice.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.930
And so I think the third thing
to consider is that the ITU

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.390
does good work.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.660
It does a lot of really
good work.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.530
We have to remember that this
is not just about the

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.190
secretariat.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.560
This is really about member
states using the WCIT to play

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.330
up their larger geopolitical
agendas.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.890
And so the authoritarian states
that are trying to

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.970
close down the internet to
curtail freedoms online are

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.290
pushing proposals
that do that.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.750
You have other blocs of
countries that have really

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.340
benefited from the development
work that ITU does.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:11.110
And so there's less of
a need to expand--

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.150
or less concerned with
expanding the ITU's

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.070
mandate in this way.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.660
And then I think there's also
sort of a community of folks

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:25.370
who are pushing back against
out-sized US influence in

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.260
internet policy making.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.330
I think it's important to
acknowledge this as a really

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.080
serious legitimate concern.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.580
And so I think that we
constantly have heard this

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.125
along the way, that developing
country voices need to be

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.970
heard more and their
agenda advanced.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.270
And so that's why they're
trying to WCIT.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.150
And I guess my questions to--

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.800
I'll start with Marilia because
I think she has some

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.310
insight into this process,
given her

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.520
colleague on the ground.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.520
Do you really feel that the
resilient agenda of the

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.260
developing emerging world, the
agenda is actually being

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.223
advanced during the WCIT
conversations?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.440
MARILIA MACIAL: Well as a matter
of fact, I'd like to

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.440
begin saying that I very much
agree with what you have said.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.460
I think that the ITU has
a very important role.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.785
And the awareness that has
been raised among civil

00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:24.850
society about ITU because of
WCIT, I hope it will be

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.400
continued after WCIT finishes,
that civil society becomes

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.210
more sustainably involved
in ITU's work.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.550
And I say this because I think
it's important to notice is

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:41.320
that on the one hand, we have
this group of states that have

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.500
made severely negative proposals
that will impact

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.680
negatively on freedom of
information, expression, and

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.640
innovation.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.790
But on the other hand, we also
have these group of states

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.190
that are trying to make us
believe that UN has no role in

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.610
internet governance.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.840
And I don't think this
is accurate.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.320
There is a lot of things that
not only ITU, but other UN

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.660
bodies should be dealing with.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.380
Maybe they are not yet taking
these issues into account.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.250
And maybe they're not taking
them as we like them to take

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.740
them, in a multi-stakeholder
fashion.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.240
But there are a lot of important
issues that UN

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.370
should be dealing with, such
as security and making

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.600
security not impact negatively
on freedom of information and

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.150
expression, and jurisdiction
issues,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.580
which is very important.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.520
We all know the cases of the
domain name seizure that have

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.750
taken place such as Rojadirecta
in Spain.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.320
This is something
very serious.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.110
National jurisdictions, they
impact on other jurisdictions.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.880
And this is something that
we need to look into.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.810
And I think that WICT presents
us with a very good

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.775
opportunity not only to know
more about ITU and UN's work,

00:13:59.775 --> 00:14:03.660
but also to take a look at
our national regulatory

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.270
frameworks.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.450
Probably many people know that
here in Brazil we are in a

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.120
very important moment.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.890
We have a regulation that
has been developed in a

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.680
collaborative way online.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.840
All the people that use the
internet and been able to make

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.640
comments to this regulation.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.870
And after this collaborative
process that lasted for three

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.520
months, this regulation has
been sent to Congress.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.900
And now it's being
on the revision.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.855
And because ITU happened at the
same time that this law

00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:39.520
arrived in congress, WCIT had
a negative impact on the

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.220
discussion of his view bill,
because this bill tries to

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.840
enable network neutrality, which
would be fundamental to

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.350
the guarantee of innovation
in Brazil.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.680
Because the discussion is taking
place in WCIT right

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.290
now, the discussions in Congress
have been stalled,

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.730
because our government doesn't
have a position on network

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.540
neutrality.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.280
And they wanted to go to WCIT
and hear from other countries,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.060
what are their perspectives,
hear from [INAUDIBLE] what is

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.980
their perspective.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.200
So I think that developing
countries that do not have

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.710
this regulatory framework in
place as developed countries

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.030
already have, this may have
a negative impact.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.260
But it also creates an
opportunity for us to be aware

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.970
of how there is an interplay
between international

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.820
regulation and national
regulation as well.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.730
DEREK SLATER: Claudio, I want
to turn you on that point,

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.930
because is that a comparable
experience to what you've had

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.140
with your organization?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.700
Or what are the key differences
with what Marilia

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.950
has been discussing.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.540
CLAUDIO RUIZ: I think what
Marilia has pointed out, it's

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.540
pretty important.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:56.620
It's the key discussion in all
this thing, especially because

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.265
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:01.370
the WCIT discussion has
been closed doors.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.220
And we don't have a very clear
idea about what the kind of

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.185
things that they are discussing,
the documents they

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:08.440
are sharing, and that
kind of stuff.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.990
I will say that although this
discussion has been framed in

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:17.660
some way as a take hands off
the internet from one side,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.860
and from the other side, this
idea of these governments,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.220
this government-centered
agenda trying to

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.460
take over the internet.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:35.860
And I would say it's not
either one idea what is

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.820
happening, and neither
is the other.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.180
I would say all the discussion
on WCIT, and all the

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.370
discussion about what we're
talking about, it's

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.540
just about the power.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.300
And it's just about controlling
things.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.570
And it's more about
a controlling

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.130
structure in some way.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.090
So my point here, and experience
that we have here

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:03.710
in Chile, I would say, is just
to try to use this opportunity

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.300
and to use this momentum, this
discussion momentum worldwide

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.300
international agenda.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.150
And one of the things that at
least here in Chile we have

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:19.079
faced, it's in spite of the fact
that or government has

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:26.869
this digital agenda, digital
plan for the next 10 years,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.770
and we don't have a very clear
idea about and what is the

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.020
Chilean position on WCIT, and
why our government is not

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.530
opening up the doors to other
civil society organizations or

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:45.610
different multi-stakeholders
and groups to just share

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:51.430
opinions and actually adding
some different points to the

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.260
Chilean position.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.810
So I think it's pretty important
what Marilia said

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.640
about how this WCIT discussion
worldwide can be useful on the

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.070
national level or even in the
regional level, to just

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.480
empower different stakeholders,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.040
structures to taking
decisions.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:17.560
And using multi-stakeholders
and groups to discuss the

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.020
internet in general, not just
in a technical way, or not

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.330
just in a political way, but
taking talking about the

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.250
internet as a platform to
developing human rights.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.290
And when we're talking about
human rights, we need to

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.820
address all the perspectives
which are involved in those

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.420
things, and not just the
government's point of view, or

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.740
not just the company's agenda.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.100
So I think that these things, it
would be very interesting.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.500
And I'm pretty concerned about
the way the discussion would

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.370
be framed in the future,
taking into account the

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.410
importance of the discussion
and taking especially into

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.740
account all the media attendance
that is now into

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.940
Dubai, and especially in
these human rights

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.960
groups around the world.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.620
I think that it would be
very, very important.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.970
DEREK SLATER: And Mawaki, one
of things that both Marilia

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.500
and Claudio spoke to as sort
of, this is an important

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.290
moment, not just what happens
at the WCIT today, but as a

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.870
moment of growing the community
of people who are

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.190
thinking about these issues.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.980
You have a bit of
perspective--

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.710
APC has been involved in these
issues for quite some time.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.330
And so what is the
history of this

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.070
community discussion like.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.090
And where do you see-- where
do you hope it goes now,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.790
coming out of the ITU and the
discussion we're having today

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.360
and this month?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.250
MAWAKI CHANGO: OK, thanks.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.010
The discussion about internet
governance has been around at

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.531
least since the '90s, at
the inception of ICANN.

00:19:50.531 --> 00:19:54.020
People have been more
or less aware of it.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.740
I have to admit that not many
people were involved in the

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.950
process at that time, especially
in the side of

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.050
African civil society.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:13.200
And WSIS was a tremendous
opportunity for engagement

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.040
around the world, particularly
in Africa.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.750
People have become aware of
internet governance issues and

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.710
challenges more acutely since
WSIS, since the preparatory

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.410
process in 2003.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:33.970
And APC has been, of course,
advocating around those issues

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.850
since then.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:41.530
In general, even before the
particular issue area of

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.450
internet governance, APC has
always been advocating for

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.630
more affordable access
to ICTs and inclusive

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.460
policy-making processes.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.140
So with the WSIS, the
internet Governance

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.610
issues came to the fore.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:04.390
Now as we progress, since 2002,
since the WSIS, the

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.570
ranks of civil society folks
involved in Africa have been

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.640
growing, the main challenge
always being capacity to

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.840
building and funding
to participate in

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.130
meetings around the world.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.070
With regard to the WCIT itself,
we have started

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:32.990
preparing ICT civil society
participants around the

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:39.840
continent through a discussion
list and a wiki page in order

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.260
for them to become more aware
of the issues at stake, and

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.150
try to position their respective
governments in

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.080
order to be informed about their
governments' positions

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.240
and the preparatory process that
their governments engage

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.190
in so that if possible, they
can even be part of the

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.440
national delegation.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.180
I'm happy to report that some
of our colleagues managed to

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.910
get on board with their
government delegation, like in

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.370
Kenya, probably also Uganda.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.410
We have been hearing different
updates, if you

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.510
will, from the grounds--

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.620
and possibly also
Cote d'Ivoire.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.970
Anyway, as Africa internet
policy progenitor, I'm not

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.160
focusing particularly
on [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.250
countries.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:43.250
And I am in the position of
being kind of an observatory

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:49.250
of how different governments,
different countries in the

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:55.890
continent progressing on the
issue of being more inclusive,

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.300
being multi-stakeholder in their
policy making processes.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.530
And there has been some low
progress in that regard.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:11.585
Now coming back to the WCIT's
agenda itself, I believe as a

00:23:11.585 --> 00:23:16.880
couple of my colleagues said,
it's really about power

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.340
struggle and about control.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.720
Control can be political.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.840
It can be under the guise of
a [INAUDIBLE] security.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.320
It can be about controlling
people and their freedom of

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.980
expression and constraining
those rights.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:42.340
It can also be about commerce
and financial reasons.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.730
What is happening here is that
at the core of the issues is

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:57.850
the fact that government, since
the last 1988 treaty, we

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.440
have seen a lot of things
change in the--

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.290
sorry, my--

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.870
DEREK SLATER: We lost
the lights there.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.246
Let me just--

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.060
there we go, and he's back.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.630
MAWAKI CHANGO: The
light is back.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.042
DEREK SLATER: Mawaki, let me
pause you there, because I

00:24:12.042 --> 00:24:13.760
want to ask Carolina
a similar thing.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.540
Because I know, Carolina, you've
been spending a lot of

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.960
time this year building up
capacity in your region and

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.040
working on new projects to try
and bring more people into the

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.990
fold of working on internet
policy and understanding it.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.560
What do you think--

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.270
what are the big challenges that
you see sort of ahead in

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.790
trying to get people to
understand why things like

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.810
these sort of treaty
conferences matter?

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.670
And what can people be doing
in their communities?

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.210
What do you think is effective
for people to be doing to

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.750
trying to raise awareness
about these issues?

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:50.055
CAROLINA BOTERO: Well what I
think that the main problem is

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.936
I would like to connect
with what Marilia

00:24:52.936 --> 00:24:55.080
was trying to explain.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.480
And it is that in our region,
except for only

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.350
Bazil and some other--

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.880
I don't know, Mexico, maybe
Chile, Argentina have some

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.430
kind of role in these issues.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.500
The rest of us are really
behind [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.635
For instance, we have been
trying to follow up positions

00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:19.630
in our countries
on [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:31.260
And what we found is that the
region is meant to be joined

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.590
CITEL position, which is an
Inter-American Organization of

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.510
Telecommunications for
the governments.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:45.550
And the point is, there are
39 statements on this

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.698
declaration, and really
each country has done

00:25:48.698 --> 00:25:50.042
only some of them.

00:25:50.042 --> 00:25:53.090
For instance, Colombia just
joined two of those

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.330
propositions of the CITEL.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.710
So really, saying that all the
countries are together in the

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:06.640
region with a position in Dubai
is not really true.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.262
The truth is that they have
discussed it a little bit.

00:26:09.262 --> 00:26:12.320
And each country has choosed
what to say.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.570
But when you ask them from other
countries, especially

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.245
little countries like ours,
they don't really know.

00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:22.735
And they don't explain it.

00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:27.930
For instance, we heard from
Ecuador that they had tried to

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:32.370
contact their ministry and tried
to find out what the

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.350
position is, how
are they going.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.805
And the response from the
functionaries from the public

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:44.050
servant was always, we're
doing all the CITEL's

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.220
recommendations.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.120
And that is really not true.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:53.480
So even the public servants that
are engaged into these

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.840
issues, especially in small
countries, are really little

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.570
aware of what's going on.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:03.100
This was one of the reasons why
we wanted to participate

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:08.000
directly in the delegation in
Dubai, because we found out

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.020
that in the region,
only Brazil is

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.060
attending as civil society.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.880
The rest of the countries are
not having any representatives

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.402
from the civil society, which
also means that you have the

00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:21.780
gap of language, because--

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.380
many countries.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.240
And having the information in
our language helps to breach

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.750
the situation.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:40.390
We really find that there is a
lack of information and a lack

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:44.690
of the sources in
our language.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.940
And Derechos Digitales is
actually doing a good job

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.280
translating and putting
some resources on.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.050
But it would be great to have
people Spanish-speaking

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.940
reporting from Dubai, telling
us what the different

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.650
presentations and delegations
from our countries are saying,

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.630
because our human impact,
especially small countries

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.050
that have very little
delegations on the other hand,

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:17.590
just one or two, they are
not necessarily--

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.570
PILAR SAENZ: Clear on
their position.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.230
CAROLINA BOTERO: --clear
on their position.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:26.030
And it would be very good to
follow them and give them more

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.030
information from civil
society perspective.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.690
This is more or less also what
we found in experience during

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.290
the last two years of lobbying
in the congress regarding

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:43.030
precisely norms or [INAUDIBLE]
laws that were put forward

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.910
into the congress, especially
to control

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.560
content on the internet.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.560
I would say that, of course as
Claudio said, that control and

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.210
power on the internet are both
issues to be aware of in

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.340
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.710
I don't know if you would
like to add something.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.620
PILAR SAENZ: Well I think that
the other important thing to

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.940
say is that, for example, CITEL
documents are open.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.110
But we didn't know them.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:21.810
And I think that we need more
people doing monitoring the

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.860
other [INAUDIBLE]
in the region.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.110
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.060
maybe there is more information
for our countries

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.980
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.990
of these countries.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:44.890
And when you see
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:50.650
the sites, the website, you
just don't see enough

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.550
information in another
language.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.800
They [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.560
for example.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.610
But I think that not all the

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.985
information is in other language.

00:30:02.985 --> 00:30:08.473
So it's important to try to have
more information in other

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:09.890
languages, for everybody.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.510
CAROLINA BOTERO: Just
to follow up.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.710
JOCHAI BEN-AVIE: Derek,
can I jump in here?

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.926
DEREK SLATER: Yeah.

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:16.630
Go ahead, Jochai.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.410
JOCHAI BEN-AVIE: I just
want to comment.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.390
I mean, I think Carolina and
Pilar raise a really important

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.230
point about the need for

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.450
in-language access to documents.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.170
But I want to comment a little
bit about the notion of, we

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.930
don't really know what's
going on here.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.530
I think--

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.910
we saw on day one, and it was
only on the first day of the

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.660
conference that we find out
whether civil society that was

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.990
not on a government delegation
was going to get in at all.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.690
They were-- that vote
did go well.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.970
They did allow society to be
at the conference venue, to

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.510
attend the plenary sessions and
the Committee 5 sessions.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.830
That's sort of where the bulk
of the treaty writing is

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.650
getting done.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.050
But what we've already seen in
just four days of conference,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.760
and only actually less than
that in terms of real

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:09.920
substantive debate, is that
as massive debates divide.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.850
It's very contentious.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.830
And the chair of the WCIT is
pushing a lot of these issues

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.030
into what are called
working groups.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.550
This is not working group like
you and I think, it's a couple

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.650
people trying to
hammer it out.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.210
It's still all 193
member states.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.850
But civil society is not allowed
to participate in the

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.466
working groups.

00:31:29.466 --> 00:31:31.850
Unlike the plenary sessions
and the full committee

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.920
sessions, they're not
live streamed.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.690
And so it's really hard to
get information out.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.870
And we can get--

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.530
those of us who have colleagues
who are on

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.760
government delegations
have some means.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.320
But then we can't share
that information.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:53.250
So again I think you saw the
move for the ITU and its

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.630
member states on the first day,
that to make a decision

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.580
behind closed doors, to give
a modicum of transparency.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.330
And this is really concerning
given the really dangerous

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.140
proposals that we're seeing.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.690
I think everyone sort
of touched on human

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.530
rights in some way.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.770
But right now there's a huge
debate about whether to

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.120
include human rights at all in
the treaty, particularly.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.880
And that's really concerning
when that's juxtaposed with

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.280
proposals like on spam, which
would say that governments can

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.950
block any content that has
no meaningful message.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.210
That's a really dangerously
subjective term in the hands

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.900
of a government.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.650
And then when you add that with
the obligation to take

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.130
affirmative steps, to
take measures--

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.100
appropriate measures is
the language used--

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.950
to curtail spam.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:52.150
If you look at the right to
know that would allow

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.140
governments to know how their
traffic is routed.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.995
First of all, that would require
a fundamental overhaul

00:32:56.995 --> 00:32:59.650
of the internet's architecture,
trying to shift

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.800
it more to how traditional
telecommunications work.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.890
But it would also open the door
to widespread, pervasive

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.440
surveillance.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.050
And then you have other
proposals, particularly from

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.480
Russia, and I'll stop after
this, just to give you--

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.310
I just want to contextualize
this in terms of what the

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.880
debates are.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.930
Because human rights is not
the discourse here.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.680
The Russian proposal would allow
censoring content that

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.410
threatens national unity
and security and is

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.240
of a sensitive nature--

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.630
these very ambiguous,
vague terms.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.970
And so we're seeing a really
contentious debate that's

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.480
happening, actually,
still largely

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.850
outside the public eye.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.260
DEREK SLATER: I want to make
sure that as we come up almost

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.070
to the end of our time, that we
take a little bit of time

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.080
for questions from people
who are watching.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.360
One question that really
is focused on--

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.810
obviously internet freedom and
human rights are critical.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.850
Obviously the internet can
also be used for illegal

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.410
activities for some
forms of harm.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.230
If this isn't the right forum,
what are the right ways to be

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.730
addressing this, or how do you
see that conversation going

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.260
forward, how to re-balance
those things?

00:34:10.044 --> 00:34:11.210
JOCHAI BEN-AVIE: Are you looking
for me to answer that

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.440
or someone else?

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.750
DEREK SLATER: I'll leave
it to the panel.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.469
But if Jochai, you want to
jump in, that' fine.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.000
Or Mawaki, you can as well.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.960
MAWAKI CHANGO: OK.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.190
CAROLINA BOTERO: Sorry.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:25.239
Before you answer, I would like
to make a point on what

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.600
you had just said.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.199
What the question Derek
made to us was how

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.900
to get people involved.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.370
And what I was trying to explain
is that in countries

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.850
like ours, we are like
step three behind.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.175
In order to explain to people
the importance of the meeting,

00:34:44.175 --> 00:34:47.670
you first need information
in their language.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.850
And that was my point.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.290
Of course if you're
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.659
Jochai said it's really
important.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.780
But then you are like
in a step six plus.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.163
You have all these countries
that are

00:35:00.163 --> 00:35:01.545
there, and maybe voting.

00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:06.192
And they are step three minus.

00:35:06.192 --> 00:35:09.880
They don't even-- and not just
their governments, with I

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.520
already said.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.850
The public servants
don't know.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.940
And the civil society
don't even care.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.850
So we have to first make that
as an issue, to be able then

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.780
to ask, to be there.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.620
I don't know.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.066
I just wanted to make
that point.

00:35:26.066 --> 00:35:27.970
DEREK SLATER: No, it's a
great point, Carolina.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.295
Mawaki, you were going
to jump in as well.

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:31.130
Go ahead.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.810
MAWAKI CHANGO: Yes.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.490
I want to say a couple things
about the question that you

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.670
just asked.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:41.960
We need to come back to the
idea, to the core issue of

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.510
this ITU debate--

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.120
the first question I believe,
which has been the question of

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.110
definition.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:57.630
And it is about knowing whether
internet-related

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:04.480
issues or governance can
be part of the ITR.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.270
And so the definition debate
has been about--

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.210
I think the US--

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.700
people are finding out about
that debate in the US.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.760
That has been a long-running
debate, whether internet is

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.150
part of basic telecommunications
or it's

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:26.170
what you call here enhanced
service, and whether the

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.050
telecom regulatory framework
applied to the internet.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:33.410
So once you understand that and
you understand that the

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.610
telecom regulatory framework
cannot apply to the internet,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:41.000
because of all the content
issues, for example, that you

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.670
mentioned, Jochai.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:51.390
So then the human right
issue does not

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.500
even become a problem.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.920
Because first of all, to
ITU is part of the UN.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:02.150
And there's a clear universal
human rights regime at the UN

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.180
organization level,
across the system.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:10.990
So those proposals going against
freedom of expression

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:16.810
and all that have to be opposed
up front, on the basis

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.380
of the human rights regime
that's accepted and is

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.760
supposed to be enforced at
the level of the UN.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.680
So at APC, we don't think we
need to include the human

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.320
rights issue within the ITR.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.035
Those are issues to be debated,
but not within the

00:37:33.035 --> 00:37:36.455
ITR, because the ITRs must be
about basic telecommunicaion

00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:38.340
regulatory framework.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.480
So as to the question, where
or how to approach those

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.170
issues related to internet,
we have had the Internet

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.560
Governance Forum.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.890
The problem is-- which is
multi-stakeholder, everybody's

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:56.170
welcome, civil societies,
governments, and businesses,

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.190
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.070
everybody.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:02.610
But the problem is how do
we go from integrating,

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:07.520
collecting, and integrating
people's inputs and views into

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.580
something that is actionable.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.540
That's what the IGF--

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.730
Internet Governance Forum--

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.540
has not been begged
to do so far.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.600
So if we can go back to a
formula like IGF but evolved,

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.510
from the simple talk shop
to implementation, to

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:29.550
recommendation, that would
be a good way to grow.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.940
DEREK SLATER: Well
thanks, everyone.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.830
We're just out of time.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.310
I know we haven't been
able to hear from

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.600
everyone multiple times.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.130
But it was great to hear from
all of you experts from around

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.090
the world on this important
subject.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.800
And Mawaki, as you were saying,
this issue of how do

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.780
we protect the free and open
internet, how do we protect

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.700
freedom online, certainly
something that's a

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.770
conversation that isn't ending
here, isn't even beginning.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.000
It's something that hopefully
will continue to expand, and

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.270
expand around the world to be as
inclusive and participatory

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.430
as possible.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.120
So we thank all of you for
joining us and for all of you

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.850
for watching.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.020
Again, thanks for joining
Google Developers Live.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.680
And we'll see you next time.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.930
MAWAKI CHANGO: Thank you.
