00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.800
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.980
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520
F. I guess my first question is like what?

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.790
What conceivable set of circumstances led to you doing what you did?

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.260
I just thought it would be a weird thing to do. Oh yeah. Yeah. Was like,

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.620
well that would be weird. We don't know if it's funny, but we try it out.

7
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:31.790
So yeah. Is it going to be weird? We'll do it. Yeah. Is it going to alien?

8
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:33.700
Had half the audience? Yeah,

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.350
<v 1>you are. So,</v>

10
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.670
<v 0>okay, wait, just to set things up,</v>

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.970
you'd better cause two people that you just heard your wrist and show Kurt

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.270
Brown. Oh, hello.

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.290
<v 2>They are comedians. That's it.</v>

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.220
And we first heard about the bit you're about to hear, uh, from Jesse Thorn.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.090
Yes. Host of the sound of young America. Great show. Are you rolling over there,

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.450
Jesse? No, let me record you. Okay. Check

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.180
<v 0>from my phone. Okay. Yeah, I'm rolling.</v>

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.110
So you said that when Kurt and Kristen walk on stage, what happens? Well,

19
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.920
there's a cuddle of jokes up top. You know, they joke about this,

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.010
this TV show that they hosted in the 70s uncle Ben's farmyard courthouse.

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.980
I explained the American judicial system using a court house,

22
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.500
made completely of animals, was canceled immediately,

23
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.110
and so the audience is kind of laughing at the jokes, but thinking like, oh,

24
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:35.790
this is going to be a regular comedy sketch sketch from it tonight. All right.

25
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.130
Hey, Harrigan. Ready? I'm ready. Okay,

26
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.790
well then they go into this song.

27
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.590
<v 3>Oh, okay. Tom</v>

28
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.923
[inaudible]

29
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.400
does this maniacal singing, clapping.

30
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850
Christine is doing this. Horsey dance.

31
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.393
Oh

32
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.903
Wow.

33
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
Wow.

34
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.483
Wow.

35
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.140
<v 0>It's, can you do this in like why</v>

36
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.990
Haitian Jad when we do it, we like at the, after the third rep,

37
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.200
my last name, they get it like, oh,

38
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.190
they could just going to do that over and over

39
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.010
<v 3>and then somewhere around like four AV around the fourth time.</v>

40
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.900
Then it's not really not funny. I use this quiet.

41
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.630
They're like, I'm done with that. I'm done. I don't want to watch this anymore.

42
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.810
Why are they still doing it? And then,

43
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.440
and then that changes to actual hatred and they're like,

44
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.520
you stupid people, you to stupid people,

45
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.750
but somewhere between like nine and 11

46
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.000
and they then they're like, oh,

47
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.620
I like this.

48
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.790
[inaudible] did you get this next level?

49
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.820
Which is they can't continue doing this and then they do continue doing it.

50
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.210
Okay, but it could, they really, their eyes are starting to cross by that point.

51
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:06.500
I'm dripping sweat. Kristen's angry that I've gone that long.

52
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.161
I mean,

53
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:15.140
you can hear a curb in that thing like losing track of the song because he's

54
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:16.730
going into some kind of [inaudible].

55
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.760
Okay. Have had her on stage whisper,

56
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.410
stop it. Walk in my

57
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.983
[inaudible].

58
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.280
This is maybe my favorite thing in the history of the world.

59
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.170
<v 4>What I love about it is that your brain is trying to make it into what you want</v>

60
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.040
it to be, which is a joke, but there is no joke happening.

61
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.320
And so what these two people are doing is creating the expectation that the

62
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:07.270
expectation is going to be broken,

63
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.200
but then breaking that expectation that the expectation is going to be broken by

64
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.290
just delivering the thing that they've been delivering over and over for the

65
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.960
past 10 minutes. What's the longest

66
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.690
<v 0>taking it? 10 minutes in Australia because you were drunk? Yeah,</v>

67
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.820
it seemed like it seemed like 10 minutes. We can't be sure if it was 10 minutes.

68
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.070
It seems like there's no way it's 10 minutes. What?

69
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.150
It was 10 minutes and the audience went crazy.

70
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.840
<v 1>No, [inaudible]</v>

71
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.800
<v 5>just in Charlotte as a whole. Kristen Schaal is a Ho.</v>

72
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.100
You look at her desk, look at her, go look good. Her Dad's like, Oh

73
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.170
hey, I'm Chad. Boom. Rod's in Charlotte. I'm Robert Krulwich Dad.

74
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.670
This is radio lab and today, oh, today it's all about loops.

75
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.210
Things

76
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.980
<v 6>that happen over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.</v>

77
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.170
Coming up. Lipstick hurt. You stream loops in here.

78
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.170
You in juice loops that scare you.

79
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.040
Loops and loops and loops that incomplete you

80
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.380
<v 0>at what? Kristen's</v>

81
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.020
<v 7>a</v>

82
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.403
[inaudible].

83
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.820
<v 0>So where, where are you guys? What, where in San Francisco? San Francisco,</v>

84
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.090
or if you're not in Texas, no, just sounds like we're in Texas.

85
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.350
She's from Texas. So like can you guys actually just a, if you don't mind,

86
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.260
introduce yourself so we know just could we have your name and all that?

87
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.100
I'm Mary Sue Campbell. I live in Novato, California,

88
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.850
and my daughter Christine is 30 years old.

89
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:44.830
I live in San Francisco. Um,

90
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.030
and I was raised in Nevada in the house that said this wouldn't happen.

91
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:51.610
That shall we begin. Okay.

92
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.140
Tell me the beginning how the story starts from the beginning. Uh,

93
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.060
I, it was odd.

94
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:02.710
Christine actually called me Tuesday morning about 10 o'clock and just said, oh,

95
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.690
what are you doing mom? And I said, Oh,

96
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:08.140
I'm just gonna go out in the yard and do some yard work and lend some errands.

97
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:08.670
And she said, well,

98
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.470
you ought to do the yard work early because it's going to be hot today.

99
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.870
So we're in the, we're in the summertime. It was summertime. Yeah,

100
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.850
it was August, August 24th and apparently what, 10 minutes later,

101
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.020
half an hour later, she's said, I called her,

102
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.100
she had left me a voicemail, something like, Hey Christine, it's mom.

103
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:30.130
Something's, something's not right. Something's wrong.

104
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.750
I need you to call me back. So I gave her a call back and,

105
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.720
and she said something, thinking about the house isn't right.

106
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:42.370
There's things look weird in here. What's weird? W what are you talking about?

107
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.350
And then she said, well, I'm looking at the calendar and it says August,

108
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.820
2010 and I'm like, uh Huh. She's like,

109
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.550
well that's not right. And I said, well,

110
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:57.400
yes it is August 24th,

111
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.730
2010 and as soon as I said that out loud, I grabbed my purse

112
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.420
<v 6>to leave. Oh my God, she's had a stroke. That was my, my,</v>

113
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.050
my first reaction. And um, oh, that makes me feel emotional.

114
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.820
And so Christine says she walked out of her house to the car,

115
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:16.770
keeping your mom on the phone. What else do you see?

116
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:18.930
I'm just trying to keep her talking to me. All the while,

117
00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:22.200
her mom's telling her one thing after another just doesn't look right.

118
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.930
She says there's a strange black truck on the driveway,

119
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.470
which is the truck that belongs to her boyfriend that has been parked there for

120
00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:32.640
10 years. So I'm of course, increasingly, I mean,

121
00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:34.350
I'm just freaking out at this point.

122
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:37.460
So she hangs up with her mom and then calls the paramedics. Medics

123
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.020
<v 0>and I, half an hour later, Christine arrived at the hospital.</v>

124
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:46.030
By the time I walked in, she had been there for five or 10 minutes at the most,

125
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.550
and as soon as I walked in, the doctor greeted me and said, said, uh,

126
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.000
this is her, Dr Jonathan Vallejo's Christine. It's immediately evident.

127
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.970
It's not a stroke, not an infection. That's, that's a huge relief. But I said,

128
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.550
your mother has, has transient, Global Amnesia,

129
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.410
fancy and global transients global. How do those words hit you?

130
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.350
I'll be honest with you. I had no idea what that meant.

131
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.750
I think the word I heard the most is amnesia.

132
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.950
Your mother has lost her ability to form new memories.

133
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.120
I mean she can't remember, but if it's not going to last forever, um,

134
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.570
it usually lasts between one and 24 hours and we're not sure what causes it.

135
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.110
And it's at this point where the story goes from something kind of frightening

136
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.270
to something a little more surreal. Yeah. So when I came in, um,

137
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.560
her mother is sitting up in bed,

138
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.610
she's a smiler and she immediately started asking questions. Okay,

139
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.250
so what's the date? I said, well, it's Tuesday, August 24th. Yes.

140
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.860
And of course we have a video on youtube of this. My birthday's already past.

141
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.900
Yep. Do you remember if I remember that?

142
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.620
I'm trying to remember the last date. I remember. I don't remember if my breath,

143
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.500
yeah. Wait, we hung out.

144
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:03.560
You came over to my house and we watched a video that I made for you when I was

145
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:08.480
in Texas and all of your sisters and some of your brothers said happy birthday

146
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:11.810
to you on video. Yeah. But we still have the videos that you can watch it again,

147
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:15.290
but you're going to remember eventually they say it's just temporary.

148
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.140
Where was that? It was at home. You were at home? Yep.

149
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.620
You're at home doing some gardening and you called me and you're feeling

150
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.890
confused. So I called the paramedics had been come and get you.

151
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.270
And then we came here. Did you have two tests on you? Okay, so what's the date?

152
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.550
August 24th it's Tuesday.

153
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.040
I'm trying to remember the last day I remember. Yeah,

154
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.940
I don't remember my birthday. Do you remember your birthday? Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.700
That must've just been recently. Yeah, couple weeks ago.

156
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.811
Now you might have missed it,

157
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.811
but this conversation they're having just started over this August because every

158
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:54.360
90 seconds Mary Sue's memory resets.

159
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.820
August 24th what's strange is the repetition,

160
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.490
like we started that last clip you heard with her saying this,

161
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.980
trying to remember the last day, Dan,

162
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:05.730
remember 90 seconds later after her memory resets, she says,

163
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.190
try to remember the bias of date. I remember 90 seconds later, I'm trying.

164
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.060
I don't remember the last damn remember.

165
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.960
And as you watched this video for a few minutes,

166
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:19.220
you realize what's happening here. Is that Mary sue? You're right, Dan Week.

167
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.020
It is. No, it's in a loop.

168
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.070
And it goes like this first the date. So what's the date?

169
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.020
August 24th she then responds in almost the same way every time,

170
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.750
like birthdays. She's missed her birthday. Yeah.

171
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.840
And every time she says that, darn in exactly the same way. If you fast forward,

172
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.240
it's already past my birthday though. Yeah.

173
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.890
She must enjoy her birthday quite a bit. You're going to remember it eventually.

174
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.020
Then she laughs. Hey, what happened?

175
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.730
Then they recapped you working in the garden and you gave me a call.

176
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.280
Christine explains the whole thing.

177
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.270
It's usually when she says the word paramedics called the paramedics right there

178
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.800
and have them come and pick you up.

179
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.220
The Mary Sue's eyes get really wide and this look of sheer,

180
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.740
utter disbelief. Yes. Yeah. Isn't that creepy? I mean,

181
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.600
every single you say that, isn't that creepy? Creepy.

182
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.700
90 seconds later is some creepy 90 seconds later

183
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.860
and it's softening this point right after creepy [inaudible] the two sets.

184
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.730
Okay. So I don't know. Tuesday,

185
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.300
like somebody put it on rewind over and over and over again. Okay.

186
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.513
Yes.

187
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:39.380
Add repeated the birthday so much that the nerves apparently was behind me

188
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.920
mouthing the words. Yeah. Oh, that's my birthday. Yeah.

189
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.350
It's like groundhog day in here. Groundhog's Day,

190
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.250
like every two minutes we're doing a list. The same thing. Yes, we do that.

191
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.760
We have had the same conversation over and over again.

192
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.200
Every two minutes for the last two and a half hours. Two and a half hours.

193
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.990
No, I think

194
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.990
we can't seem to talk about anything else.

195
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.050
That is what we're talking about today.

196
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.290
What Day of the week is it? Tuesday, August 24th

197
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.000
you didn't miss it. You were there. Yeah, I'm watching it.

198
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.560
I wanted to slap me. You know,

199
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.760
I wanted to reach out and slap me and say damn it.

200
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:28.170
I just told you that for the record. Yeah. I would never slept with my mom.

201
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:31.730
I would not. No, she would not. Okay, so I'll be quiet. Here is a clear,

202
00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:33.500
this is a person who's lost her memory. Yeah,

203
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:38.770
but why would her behavior from one cycle to the next be so precisely and

204
00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:43.580
consistently the same? I mean sometimes exactly the same. Yeah. Why?

205
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.260
I think what it is is one of the things the nurses said is that when you have

206
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:51.860
something like this, your true self comes out.

207
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.180
Your true, the word true is interesting. So yeah.

208
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.120
Is that what we're seeing on that video? Is that your true person,

209
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.520
your true self? Oh yeah. I mean that's my mom through and through right there.

210
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:05.220
I mean, she's, what Christine means is not the repetition,

211
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.800
but that her mom keeps asking so many questions, inquisitive.

212
00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:10.590
She just wants to know what's going on with, with all sorts of, you know,

213
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.590
across the board. I love problems. I love puzzles.

214
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.900
Are you like a Sudoku fiend? You know, I am. I am. I hate to admit this,

215
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:25.520
God, I play Escape Room Games on the Internet escape room.

216
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:26.330
What are those?

217
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.590
They're stupid little games where they have little hidden pixels that you find

218
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.320
you're, you're stuck in a room and you have to get out.

219
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.580
You've got to find the key to the door and there's all these little hidden

220
00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:41.410
places. Oh, this is the perfect metaphor. Oh yeah.

221
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.150
I was my own escape room

222
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.410
Tuesday. There's a different way of seeing this. First of all,

223
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:55.010
Jonathan blow that er doctor who's seen a bunch of these cases, he said, well,

224
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.560
that puzzler instinct, that's not just Mary sue.

225
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.620
What everybody does is struggle over and over again with where am I and when am

226
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:08.630
I. It's just the brain in survival mode. And another thing that everybody does,

227
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.720
and he's seen about six of these patients so far, is that everybody,

228
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.890
not just Mary sue,

229
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:17.220
but everybody becomes a broken record right down to the,

230
00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:21.250
the phrasing of the sentences, which keeps them out a little bit.

231
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.540
It makes, you know,

232
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:27.490
it makes the brain seem a little bit more like a machine. You know,

233
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:31.480
you give the machine the exact same set of inputs every 90 seconds,

234
00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:34.000
give it the same doctor, the same hospital room,

235
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.810
same beeping machines and see if the output ever varies.

236
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.700
And it does,

237
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.020
it almost seems like the patient has no free. Well,

238
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.933
<v 7>uh,</v>

239
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.970
<v 0>and so sometimes in the back of his head he thinks, God,</v>

240
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:54.340
if I had that condition and someone videotape me, I would love to see, uh,

241
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.650
see my own tape. Why, you know, I think, uh,

242
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.170
I want to see, could I somehow escape the loop? Huh? Or,

243
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.590
or would I, would I had to up end up with the rest of us?

244
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.830
Now, thankfully, according to Jonathan,

245
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:12.800
what normally happens in this condition is that as time goes on,

246
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:15.860
that 92nd Luke starts to slowly expand.

247
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.250
It's actually more like two minutes or three minutes. Eventually four minutes.

248
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.050
Now it's five minutes. And for Mary Sue,

249
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.260
after a few hours as her loop got longer and longer,

250
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:27.860
her old memories started to creep back in. By that evening,

251
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.900
she was remembering up until um, like that Sunday, few hours later,

252
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:35.780
her memory began to extend into Monday morning.

253
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:40.610
By the time we left the hospital, she remembered Monday night. And then finally,

254
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.990
so we begin. Okay. Tell me the beginning, how the story starts.

255
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.740
I, it was odd.

256
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:53.360
Christine actually called me Tuesday morning about 10 o'clock and just said, oh,

257
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:57.680
what are you doing mom? And apparently 10 minutes later,

258
00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:59.783
<v 1>hour later,</v>

259
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.110
<v 0>I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Jad Abumrad man, we'll be right back.</v>
