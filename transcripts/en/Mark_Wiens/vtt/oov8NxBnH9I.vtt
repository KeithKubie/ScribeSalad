00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.150
- Hey, everyone, I hope you're
having an amazing evening.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.630
It's Mark Wiens; I'm in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.170
And tonight for dinner
I'm going to a restaurant

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.290
called Lerd Thip, which is
the restaurant of Chef Gigg,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.840
who is the winner of both
Iron Chef and Top Chef.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.620
He's one of the most talented,
one of the most skillful,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.370
one of the most incredibly
entertaining chefs to watch

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.830
that I have ever seen,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.650
and so tonight we're gonna
have dinner at Lerd Thip,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.380
his restaurant, his family restaurant.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.520
I'm waiting for Pe Tan and Pe Tape,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.280
who are gonna arrive soon to join us.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.720
But every time we come here,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.570
things just get a little
bit out of control.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.403
We eat a feast.

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:38.530
It's gonna be a treat to watch
Chef Gigg, and then to eat,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.973
and I can't wait to share all
the food with you right now.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.556
(upbeat music)

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:50.640
Lerd Thip is...

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.480
Chef Gigg, it's his family restaurant,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.810
and so he grew up at this restaurant.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.939
He's been surrounded by the
restaurant his entire life.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.270
It is a Thai-Chinese restaurant

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.180
but since Chef Gigg has developed
some very unique recipes,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.720
some very even like
Western-influenced dishes,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.660
but still with a Thai-Chinese touch.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.220
He has some gourmet dishes on his menu.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm not even totally sure what
he's gonna cook for us today

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.120
but it is guaranteed to just be a show

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.633
and an incredible,
entertaining, memorable meal.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.918
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.710
- It's my new toy.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.680
- [Mark] Pe Tan just got a new toy.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.803
That is awesome.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.296
(upbeat music)

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.915
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.582
(food sizzling)

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:00.150
- Thank you again for holding the light.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.570
Pe Tan is here.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.367
Chef Gigg is starting to cook,

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.180
and he's making a dish called gang som,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.420
which is a sour curry but with crab,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.650
this one's version with crab right now.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.500
It's coming out of the wok right now.

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:16.950
(laughs)

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.363
This is only the beginning.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.010
- [Chef Gigg] Pekoe bamboo, juice bamboo.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.739
- [Mark] Chili.

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:33.767
(chill beats)

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:47.690
It's just amazing to watch
Chef Gigg as he cooks.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.870
He's so fast, he's so talented,
and he has so much skill.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.077
The next dish he's making
- Yellow curry.

00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:55.053
- Oh, yellow curry.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:58.293
Okay, yellow crab curry,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.080
and he is, it's just impressive
to watch him as he cooks.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.747
(chopping food)

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.942
(oil sizzling)

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.930
I've seen vegetables fried like that.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590
I've seen chicken fried like
that, but never in my life

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.554
have I seen a crab go up in
a flame like that in oil.

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.137
(oil sizzling)

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.674
(wok clanking against stove top)

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.050
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.650
Unbelievable to watch on the wok.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.000
You could smell the...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.750
Immediately I'm just drenched in sweat.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.500
You can smell that curry powder.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.479
Another necessary component
of (foreign word),

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.250
or (foreign word) is eggs

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.810
so he added in some
eggs at the last thing.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.560
That kind of like curdles the sauce,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.093
and that's hot and fresh, oh wow.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.370
So paht pong karee, it's a curry,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.300
but it's made especially with...

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.450
There's yellow curry
powder in it, and then...

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.960
Oh, and it is done.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.793
Look (laughs).

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:24.280
So fast.
- So fast.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.210
- I guess our next dish is
gonna be more of a fusion dish.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.210
Red curry with spaghetti, okay.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.330
- And with real prawns.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.060
- [Mark] Red curry with
spaghetti, awesome.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.643
(oil sizzling)

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:40.914
(chill beats)

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.536
- Different and another.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:09.262
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:10.860
- Pe Tan.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.943
- Yes, hello.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.900
- It's just, he just flies on the cooking,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.970
and this is only round one.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.380
Chef Giff said we should start
eating while the food is hot.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.297
- Then the round two is coming later.

00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.870
- That crab is insane; it's massive.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.703
Look at the size of it.

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:28.630
Look at those claws.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.510
Those claws are literally
like the size of a small hand.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.740
Actually a big hand.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.493
You could use that to pick things up with.

00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:38.760
- [Pe Tan] He's the master.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.060
- [Mark] He is the master.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.470
In awe of Chef's skill.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.470
That claw is giganormous.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.570
A mammoth of a crab, of a claw.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.790
This thing is an absolute monster.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.993
It's like the size of a chicken breast.

00:05:57.993 --> 00:06:00.310
(laughs)

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.810
(chill beats)

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:05.455
- It is good?

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:07.468
- Wow.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.230
It's so sweet, and so...

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.393
Flaky.

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:17.080
You can feel the individual
strands of the crab.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.840
Just get a close-up look in there.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.599
That texture is incredible.

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.850
I'm gonna try a little bit
more of that curry, though.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.350
(chill beats)

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.990
That is not a one-biter.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.990
That is not a two-biter.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.130
That's like a four-biter claw.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.630
That has transported me.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.280
Oh, do I have some curry on my...

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.673
To a new world.

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:44.740
Taste the undertone of
that yellow curry powder.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.573
Unbelievable.

00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:48.160
Gonna start with the
(foreign name), the duck.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.070
Dip it into the sauce.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.133
And this is one of their
traditional dishes.

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:54.011
This is the Thai-Chinese dish,
one of the original dishes

00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.010
from Chef Gigg's parents.

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:03.266
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.010
That sauce is amazing,
really nice and sour.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.270
That duck is so tender.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.403
Like, soaks into the duck.

00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:13.955
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.980
A Western Thai-influenced dish.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.980
It's a red curry spaghetti
with a giant river prawn.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.730
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.018
- Oh, wow.

00:07:37.018 --> 00:07:40.935
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:45.210
You taste, like, that
creaminess, but then it's spicy

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.630
because of the red curry paste in there.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.790
- And the smell of the
herbs is very outstanding.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.640
- I thought it was oregano,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.030
but it's actually Thai holy basil.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.030
Okay, so that kind of like
fits with the red curry.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.053
That's amazing.

00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:04.670
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.200
The head of the shrimp,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.450
and it just like blends in with the sauce.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.400
You can see that it's
so buttery and creamy.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.675
Oh, that is unbelievable.

00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:17.258
(upbeat music)

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.483
Wow.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.920
- The flavor's better with the prawn in.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.473
- Yeah, that bitterness
that the prawn had.

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:31.340
And that's just equal
creaminess from both.

00:08:32.598 --> 00:08:34.431
- And quite spicy (laughs).

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.197
- Pretty spicy, yeah.

00:08:36.197 --> 00:08:38.780
(upbeat music)

00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:41.810
(laughs)

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.170
Next I'm gonna try that (foreign word).

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.239
It's so thick, it's so rich
from the amount of curry paste

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.040
that he used in there,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.750
and then he fried the crab
before sticking it in here.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.990
There's bamboo shoots in there.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.333
I can't wait to taste the curry sauce.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.063
(upbeat music)

00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:03.390
Oh, it's like sweet at first.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.170
But then it hits you with spice,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.560
kind of subtly going down your throat,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.690
and then you taste the bamboo shoot,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.130
the flavor of the bamboo shoot.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.190
Oh, man, awesome.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.201
And this is with eggs all over it.

00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:17.784
(upbeat music)

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.520
The roe of the crab is so yolky.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.620
What's amazing about
that kaeng som is how,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.760
it starts off sweet and sour,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.627
and then goes to spicy
while it's in your mouth,

00:09:28.627 --> 00:09:30.946
like in a couple of seconds.

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:33.529
(upbeat music)

00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:35.660
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.620
He is amazing to watch cook.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.140
I've probably said that a
few times already tonight.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.483
It's time for round two.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.160
The next dish he's making
is the (foreign word),

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.900
which is one of their
signature dishes here,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.470
and it's one of the
best versions in Bangkok

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.066
that I've ever had.

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:51.649
(upbeat music)

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.150
I like that Chef, when
he makes your crab here,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.300
he clears out all of the bad stuff.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.880
He clears out all of the dead man fingers

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.740
so that you don't need to worry about

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.200
navigating through those
when you're eating the crab.

00:10:18.027 --> 00:10:20.610
(oil sizzling)

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.781
(chill beats)

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.490
Unlike any other version of (foreign name)

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.560
that I've ever seen.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.040
After the crab was finished,
he took some mung bean noodles,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.620
put them into that sauce that's
almost peanut butter looking

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.340
and thick and brown thick sauce,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.780
and then he assembled it all into the pot,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.800
into that single baking pan,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.040
and that's gonna cook for a little while.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.070
The next dish that he's
making, which is Chef Gigg's,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.117
one of his signature, one of
his ultimate dishes is called

00:11:03.117 --> 00:11:06.150
(foreign name).

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.690
So it's fried rice with holy basil,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.773
and then with a wagyu steak on top.

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:18.149
(chill beats)

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:35.180
Oh, that's how you wash your
pan after you cook a steak.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.679
I'm a little red in the face.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.879
(laughs)

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.796
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:46.413
Ying hid over in the corner.

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:51.600
Oh, that was awesome.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.640
Can you feel that?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.339
Yeah, that's still warm.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.770
That will singe your hairs.

00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:02.628
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:22.049
(metal clinking)

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:56.650
That is the most incredible
fried rice you will ever see.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.070
Just his quickness, his
speed, his forearm muscle.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.240
He has to rock the wok
and it just, oh man.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.817
And then he moves the wok, he
works the wok, he shakes it.

00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:11.290
One of the key ingredients is holy basil,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.240
which is chopped up, fine.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.093
You get that blast of
the aroma, the steam.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.940
Okay, he also fried the wagyu
steak, and that's gonna go...

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.470
He's about to assemble it.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.970
He takes the fried rice
right out of the wok.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.330
He puts it into a flaming
hot earthenware bowl.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.630
And then he slices the steak,
which has been resting,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.900
puts that on top of the rice and then

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.180
a fried egg goes onto that.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.870
That's everything you could
possibly want for comfort food

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.983
but taken to the next ultimate level.

00:13:44.901 --> 00:13:47.484
(upbeat music)

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.440
Chef Gigg just mixed it up.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.540
You gotta mix it up with the
egg, get some of the beef.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.600
That rice is so herbacious.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.780
Toast to Chef Gigg.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:15.402
(upbeat music)

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:19.692
- Hot.

00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:24.627
Thank you.

00:14:24.627 --> 00:14:26.290
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.600
- That is still on fire.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.390
That is some of the
greatest fried rice ever.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.320
You can test the breath of the
wok, that smoke from the wok,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.800
how he just smoked it
out, he fired it out.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.090
Then it's in with this earthenware pot,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.630
so some of the crunchy edges
of the rice get kinda crunchy,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.530
and then you've got that beef,

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.990
which has this amazing pepper crust,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.740
and he literally shallow fried
that steak, also in a flame,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.660
so you've got another layer of smokiness.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.440
And then with that creamy egg.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.700
It literally is your favorite,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.570
well, my favorite comfort food,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.120
maybe your favorite comfort food,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.760
but everything about your
favorite comfort food

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.490
just elevated to extraordinary levels.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.405
What a genius combination.

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:11.768
(chill beats)

00:15:11.768 --> 00:15:13.959
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:16.542
(upbeat music)

00:15:20.918 --> 00:15:23.330
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.740
- [Mark] Next up for the (foreign name).

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.340
Again, this is a version
like I've never had before.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.200
Just that sauce, that rich
sauce that he added into here,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.650
plus herbs, plus all good
things at the bottom.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.415
And you can see how the egg
has kind of curdled into there.

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.998
(upbeat music)

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.950
Just dish after dish.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.000
You really taste the onions in there,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.280
and I believe the green onions,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.280
and there's those slightly
chalky crab roe in there, eggs.

00:15:56.868 --> 00:15:59.583
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:02.440
Pearl of Andaman, that's the dish.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.530
That's the name of the dish.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.320
It's an entire giant oyster
filling an entire Chinese spoon.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.570
I can see (foreign name) in there,

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.920
which is the Thai seafood sauce,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.950
yet at the same time
there's a blog of wasabi

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.430
at the end of your spoon
and (foreign name),

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.930
which is a roasted chilly jam.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.350
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.203
(upbeat music)

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.903
- [Mark] There's so much going on

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:34.391
that we don't know what
to talk about (laughs).

00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:35.890
It's so refreshing and juicy.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.530
- [Chef] Thai Chile
pears and (foreign name).

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.780
- Also (foreign name) in there?

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.130
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.833
- The salmon eggs explode.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.430
The wasabi is awesome.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.010
Okay, the next dish is (foreign name),

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.800
and that is pork with lime.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.210
They deep fry the pork.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.450
He slices it, and it's
all about that sauce.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.600
So he just ladles it on.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.380
You see that marbling of the pork.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.530
Oh, man, this is, yeah.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.430
The pork itself is fatty
and juicy and marbled,

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.720
and then that sauce is unbelievable.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.500
It's so garlicky, perfectly
sour, perfectly sweet.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.400
It's just amazing.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.970
One more, it's a desert crab dish

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.420
that Chef Gigg wants to cook for us

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.223
so he just steamed another massive crab.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.820
So this is just gonna
be a steamed crab dish,

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.239
but he's just showing immense
skill as he cuts that crab.

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.490
And a crab, especially of that size,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.900
is not easy to disconnect,
to disassemble, to chop up.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.350
Do you use all of everything?

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:56.413
- [Chef] This one right
here is very delicious.

00:17:59.987 --> 00:18:02.487
(chill beats)

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.680
- You have to hit it with your cleaver

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.880
just at that perfect amount of pressure

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.240
so that it doesn't break the crab inside.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.790
It breaks the shell and
you can peel it off.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.940
He did it amazingly,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.810
and we have a purely
de-boned crab on a plate,

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.460
disassembled, dismantled
into bite-sized nuggets.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.470
So beautiful.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.140
All of the body meat is within the head.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.995
You've got the claws, you've got the arms.

00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:45.763
He looks like he's about to lift weights.

00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:50.670
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.070
It's like half of your face.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.132
It's huge.

00:18:56.132 --> 00:18:57.465
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.920
- It's actually heavy.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.600
You could almost need two
hands to pick this up,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.450
and eat it like a drumstick.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.630
Look at the size of that.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.143
Into the seafood sauce.

00:19:13.035 --> 00:19:15.535
(chill beats)

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.633
Wow.

00:19:26.962 --> 00:19:27.883
It's so pure.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.143
It's so sweet.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.850
So again, it just flakes
apart in your mouth.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.870
That's an entire amount of crab claw.

00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:40.934
(chill beats)

00:19:40.934 --> 00:19:42.470
The stringiness of that.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.080
This is the greatest possible drumstick

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.730
you could ever have in your life.

00:19:46.995 --> 00:19:49.025
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:51.525
(chill beats)

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.130
Oh, that was an unbelievable meal.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.380
So good I kind of lost track
about how many crabs we ate

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.440
but those are some of the biggest crabs,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.580
some of the best crabs I've had.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.670
The actual meat of the crab
was so sweet and so massive,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.800
and Chef Gigg just completely...

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.330
His expertise, his
knowledge, his experience,

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.323
his speed at which he cooked,
it's so impressive to see.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.112
So I just want to say a
massive thank you to Chef Gigg.

00:20:27.112 --> 00:20:28.090
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.340
And always great to hang
out with Pe Tan and Pe Tape.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.430
I'll have their links in
the description box below.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.280
Check them all out.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.100
And this restaurant is
open until 2:00 a.m.,

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.933
so you can come here.

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:38.770
This is a late-night Bangkok restaurant.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.590
They have a nice indoor
section as well with A/C,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.750
but we chose to sit outside
'cause it's not too hot today.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.240
