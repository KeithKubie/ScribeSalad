00:00:00.783 --> 00:00:02.985
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:05.212
we had seen what would
eventually be called

00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:06.907
The First Crusades,

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.589
and it was, from a European point of view,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.134
seemed successful.

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.232
They were able to take
back much of the Holy Land

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.583
from Muslim rule.

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.179
The Byzantine Empire was able to take back

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.149
a significant chunk of
the Anatolian Peninsula

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.183
from the Seljuk Turks,
who were also Muslim,

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:25.534
and over the next few decades,

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:27.739
this European rule over the Holy Land

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.177
only gets consolidated.

00:00:30.177 --> 00:00:33.534
This is a zoomed in version
of what it looked like,

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.490
and you can see these Crusader states

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.228
that were set up, or
these Crusader kingdoms,

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:40.325
and, as I pointed out in the last video,

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.550
even though the Crusades
were apparently to help

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.537
the Byzantines reclaim
land, as you can see,

00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:47.487
when the Crusaders took the Holy Land,

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:49.819
they, for the most part,
kept it for themselves

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.099
and sat up these kingdoms.

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.932
So, we are about here.

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:57.614
We are about here on our timeline.

00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:00.531
Now, as we fast forward
a little over a decade,

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:03.731
as we get to the middle
of the 12th century,

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:06.769
you do have the Muslims
being able to take back

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:08.365
some of the territory.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:11.115
In particular, Edessa and Aleppo,

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.924
and so this spawns what
will eventually be known

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:18.165
as the Second Crusade,
and it's really the second

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:19.582
of many crusades.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.086
Now, these are what historians
consider the official

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:27.218
numbered crusades, but there
were many other crusades

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:30.362
in this time period, in roughly
this 200 year time period

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.979
during the High Middle Ages.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.578
You had crusades against
Germanic non-Christians

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:35.870
in Northern Europe.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.556
You had crusades in Spain
in order to retake land

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:43.712
from the Muslims, which they
had for several hundred years,

00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:46.311
what's known as the Reconquista.

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.282
So, after Aleppo and Edessa were taken,

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:50.664
you have the Second
Crusades, which end up being

00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:52.925
quite unsuccessful, and
it really doesn't change

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.701
what the Middle East looks like,

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:56.941
but then, as you get to
the end of the 12 century,

00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:59.358
you have a significant event.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.709
In 1187, you have the Sultan Salah ad-Din,

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:10.027
often known as Saladin, being
able to retake Jerusalem

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:12.457
and much of the Holy Land.

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:15.482
Remember, this is after
roughly 90 years of rule

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:18.220
of Jerusalem by the Western Europeans,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.348
by these Crusader kingdoms,

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:23.995
so this really strikes
a chord with the west,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.967
and so they decide to
launch what will be known

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.059
as the Third Crusade.

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.360
The Third Crusade does make some gains.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.174
In fact, this is a crusade
that gets significant buy-in

00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:35.841
from the king of Western Europe.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.885
Philip the Second of France gets involved.

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:41.856
The English king, Richard the First,

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.098
or Richard the Lionheart, gets involved.

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.335
The Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick
Barbarossa gets involved.

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.524
When I say Holy Roman
Emperor and the empire,

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:51.708
you should really think
of medieval Germany.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.198
Now, as they go there,

00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:56.151
Fredrick Barbarossa, he drowns in a river.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.215
This is very dispiriting for his soldiers,

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.084
so many of them turn around,

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:02.624
but Philip the Second
and Richard the Lionheart

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:05.707
are able to engage with Salah ad-Din,

00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:09.202
and they are able to gain some land.

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:12.613
In particular, the region around Acre,

00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:15.850
and they're able to get some
concessions from Salah ad-Din

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.513
for unarmed Christian pilgrims
to visit the Holy Land,

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:21.346
especially Jerusalem.

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.957
Now, Salah ad-Din dies
as we approach the end

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:29.433
of the 12 century, so in the
beginning of the 13th century,

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:32.064
the Fourth Crusades get launched,

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:34.837
and these are interesting
because the Crusaders,

00:03:34.837 --> 00:03:37.324
with the help of Venetian traders,

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:40.404
they actually engage with
the claimant to the throne

00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:43.086
of the Byzantine Empire,
with the hope that

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:45.236
if they can help them
come back to the throne,

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:48.132
then they can provide them
the necessary resources

00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:51.000
in order to continue on with the Crusades.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.073
Well, they are able to put
the claimant on the throne,

00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:56.242
but then an uprising takes that claimant

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:57.791
down from the throne,

00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.653
and so the Crusaders
don't get their payment,

00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:02.074
but they want that payment badly,

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:06.502
and so, they decide to take
Constantinople themselves,

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.280
and as we mention in other videos,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.139
this is really the dagger in the heart

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.055
between the relationship
between the East and the West.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.468
We already talked about
the Great Schism of 1054,

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:20.120
but now, you have the
West, who are followers

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.268
of the Latin Church, which
eventually gets known

00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:23.726
as the Roman Catholic Church.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:26.037
They are sacking Constantinople,

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:29.435
the capital of the Byzantine,
or the Eastern Roman Empire,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.970
the most important city
in Eastern Christiandom,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.582
and once they successfully sack
the city in bloody fashion,

00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:40.117
they break up the Byzantine
Empire amongst themselves,

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:42.022
and you can see how they break it up.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:44.582
So, the Fourth Crusade
had very little effect

00:04:44.582 --> 00:04:46.126
on the actual Holy Land,

00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:50.393
but it does cause a temporary
end to the Byzantine Empire.

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:52.347
As we get to 1261,

00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:55.655
Constantinople is retaken
by the Byzantines,

00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:58.342
but once again, this is
the beginning of the end

00:04:58.342 --> 00:04:59.922
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:02.075
The fact that for half a century,

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:05.077
it was taken over by the West,

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:06.921
so you can imagine, with
Jerusalem still in the hands

00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:09.897
of the Muslims, many in
the West are not satisfied,

00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:14.064
and in 1212, an interesting
event may have occurred.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.537
There are some accounts of what is known

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:20.894
as a Children's Crusade.

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:24.047
The stories of the Children Crusade are

00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:27.015
that a child, and there's
different accounts as to

00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.951
exactly the story, but
something to the effect

00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.683
that Jesus has told them to
go with other pure children

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:37.773
to the Holy Land and convert
the Muslims to Christianity,

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:40.189
and so then, they go on this march,

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.324
and there's tens of thousands of children,

00:05:42.324 --> 00:05:44.402
but they don't make it to the Holy Land.

00:05:44.402 --> 00:05:46.428
They either die of starvation

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:49.056
or they get sold into slavery on the way.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:52.647
Historians today aren't sure
whether it really happened

00:05:52.647 --> 00:05:54.733
as that account implies.

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:56.382
That's why I put these question marks

00:05:56.382 --> 00:05:58.324
next to the Children's Crusade,

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.757
but regardless of the actual facts here,

00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:03.373
as we go into the first
quarter of the 13th century,

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:07.513
Jerusalem remains in the
hands of the Muslims.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.393
A Fifth Crusade is launched
to retake Jerusalem,

00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:12.612
which is a failure.

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:15.406
Eventually, a Sixth Crusade is launched,

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:18.339
and this is reasonably
successful at retaking

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.170
some land in the Holy Land,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.853
but shortly thereafter, you
have a non-numbered crusade,

00:06:23.853 --> 00:06:27.231
the Barrens Crusade, that
rivals the First Crusade

00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.913
in its success in taking territory,

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:32.493
and so you can see,
after the Barrens Crusade

00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:34.743
right over here, they're able to take back

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:37.735
a good amount of territory,

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:41.255
but then, in 1244, Jerusalem
is retaken by the Muslims,

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:42.890
and then you have the Seventh and Eighth

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.191
and Ninth Crusades afterwards,

00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:45.557
and you have these other efforts

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:47.015
that are sometimes called Crusades,

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:49.133
but for the most part,
these are unsuccessful,

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:52.062
and as we get into the end of the 13th

00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:56.635
and early 14th centuries,
the Holy Land falls back

00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:58.385
under Muslim control.

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.749
This is a map of the region

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:05.453
as we enter into the 14th century,

00:07:05.453 --> 00:07:08.135
and you can see that
the Muslims have retaken

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:12.366
not just the Holy Land, but
most of the Anatolian Peninsula,

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:16.099
with only Constantinople being
in control of the Byzantines,

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.426
and that lasts until 1453, when the Turks

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:22.875
finally take Constantinople as well.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.435
When you look at the map at
the beginning of this video

00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:27.995
and look at the map here,
you can see that the Crusades

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:30.606
weren't really successful
at changing the picture

00:07:30.606 --> 00:07:31.939
in the Holy Land.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.730
There were areas where the
Crusades were successful,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.451
or that Crusader mentality was successful.

00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.154
You can see that, now that
we're in the 14th century,

00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:42.854
much of the Iberian
Peninsula has been taken

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:45.362
by Christian kingdoms from the Muslims.

00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:46.697
The Muslims, at this period,

00:07:46.697 --> 00:07:49.542
are left with only Grenada,

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:53.097
so the Reconquista, to some
degree, was successful,

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:55.172
and it's going to continue until 1492,

00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:58.802
when the last Muslims
are expelled from Spain.

00:07:58.802 --> 00:08:01.844
Now, one thing that I felt
when I study the Crusades

00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:04.297
is it's very confusing how
Jerusalem in particular

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:08.010
goes back and forth
between different parties,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.733
and just to get an overview
of what actually happened,

00:08:10.733 --> 00:08:13.044
this timeline might be helpful.

00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.477
Green shows Jerusalem
under Muslim control.

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:17.966
Red shows it under Christian control,

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:21.024
so at the end of the First
Crusades, it switches hands.

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:23.264
The Christians are in control all the way

00:08:23.264 --> 00:08:26.179
until Salah ad-Din takes it back.

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:28.719
Now, the Muslims are
in control all the way

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:31.213
until you get to the Sixth Crusade,

00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:33.610
where they're able to
take some territory back

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.068
and even parts of Jerusalem,

00:08:35.068 --> 00:08:36.866
and especially in the Barrens Crusades,

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:39.775
they're able to take
significant territory back,

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:43.942
but in 1244, Jerusalem is
retaken again by the Muslims.
