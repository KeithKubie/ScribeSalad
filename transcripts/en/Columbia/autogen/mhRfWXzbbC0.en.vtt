what I will do is simply outline very

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:30.420
what I will do is simply outline very
 

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.090
what I will do is simply outline very
quickly my sort of interpretation of

affirmative action in the United States
 

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.040
affirmative action in the United States
which I think falls into nicely into

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.050
which I think falls into nicely into
 

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.290
which I think falls into nicely into
three parts

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:42.300
three parts
 

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.920
three parts
and then of course leave it open to any

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:45.930
and then of course leave it open to any
 

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.550
and then of course leave it open to any
kind of comparisons that we can draw I

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:49.560
kind of comparisons that we can draw I
 

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.630
kind of comparisons that we can draw I
would say just this by way of opening I

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640
would say just this by way of opening I
 

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.650
would say just this by way of opening I
think we all understand how comparative

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:57.660
think we all understand how comparative
 

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.180
think we all understand how comparative
work is very very important but it does

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.190
work is very very important but it does
 

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.730
work is very very important but it does
seem to me that it's important to take

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740
seem to me that it's important to take
 

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.080
seem to me that it's important to take
the next step and that is we're in the

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.090
the next step and that is we're in the
 

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.380
the next step and that is we're in the
process of creating it seems to me a

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:12.390
process of creating it seems to me a
 

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.980
process of creating it seems to me a
kind of global society and even though

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:15.990
kind of global society and even though
 

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.100
kind of global society and even though
it's still very much individual nation

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.110
it's still very much individual nation
 

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.490
it's still very much individual nation

states and all that comes with that and
 

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.980
states and all that comes with that and
even though they're very weak

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:23.990
even though they're very weak
 

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.920
even though they're very weak

the world the fact of the matter is the

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.010
the world the fact of the matter is the

the world the fact of the matter is the
way the world is evolving especially

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.040
way the world is evolving especially
 

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.600
way the world is evolving especially
through capitalism and free markets and

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:38.610
through capitalism and free markets and
 

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.790
through capitalism and free markets and
becoming more and more interdependent

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:40.800
becoming more and more interdependent
 

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.490
becoming more and more interdependent
that the course of the next several

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500
that the course of the next several
 

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.980
that the course of the next several
decades will be to create the kind of

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:45.990
decades will be to create the kind of
 

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.940
decades will be to create the kind of
institutions that will be needed to to

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:49.950
institutions that will be needed to to
 

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.410
institutions that will be needed to to
deal with that world that more

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:51.420
deal with that world that more
 

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.740
deal with that world that more
integrated world the most recent move

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:54.750
integrated world the most recent move
 

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.430
integrated world the most recent move
from a g7 to a g20 is I think just one

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440
from a g7 to a g20 is I think just one
 

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.650
from a g7 to a g20 is I think just one
among many steps along that path and the

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:00.660
among many steps along that path and the
 

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.280
among many steps along that path and the
point is that affirmative action the

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.290
point is that affirmative action the
 

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:09.140
point is that affirmative action the
concept the effort the need for it will

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.150
concept the effort the need for it will
 

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.040
concept the effort the need for it will
be something that we will face globally

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.050
be something that we will face globally
 

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.730
be something that we will face globally
as well as interestingly in individual

as well as interestingly in individual
 

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.490
as well as interestingly in individual
nation states so I think it has that

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500
nation states so I think it has that
 

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.130
nation states so I think it has that
this kind of meeting this kind of

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140
this kind of meeting this kind of
 

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.820
this kind of meeting this kind of
discussion has that extremely important

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:24.830
discussion has that extremely important
 

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.370

sort of forward-looking role there's

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380
sort of forward-looking role there's
 

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.670
sort of forward-looking role there's
great variation in this room I know many

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:31.680
great variation in this room I know many
 

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.600
great variation in this room I know many
of the faces here great variation in the

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:35.610
of the faces here great variation in the
 

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.230
of the faces here great variation in the
degree of knowledge I assume about the

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240
degree of knowledge I assume about the
 

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.760
degree of knowledge I assume about the
u.s. affirmative action issues so I'll

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:43.770
u.s. affirmative action issues so I'll
 

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.770
u.s. affirmative action issues so I'll
try to be both respectful of those who

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:48.780

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.630
try to be both respectful of those who
know just about as much as anyone and

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640
know just about as much as anyone and
 

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.670
know just about as much as anyone and
those who for whom this is a fresh

those who for whom this is a fresh
 

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.580
those who for whom this is a fresh
subject as I said I think it really

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:58.590
subject as I said I think it really
 

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.430
subject as I said I think it really
falls into three sort of periods in the

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440
falls into three sort of periods in the
 

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.400
falls into three sort of periods in the
first period is 1954 to the let's say

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:06.410
first period is 1954 to the let's say
 

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:12.440
first period is 1954 to the let's say
1970 I think then it's 1970 until the

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:12.450
1970 I think then it's 1970 until the
 

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.900
1970 I think then it's 1970 until the
cases that Nick referred to the Grutter

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:17.910
cases that Nick referred to the Grutter
 

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.690

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.300
case the gratz case gritter case again
gratz case which came out at the

a matter of hearts and minds and so the

a matter of hearts and minds and so the
 

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.060
a matter of hearts and minds and so the

this regime of reservation supposed to
be about and if you don't have that

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:48.460
be about and if you don't have that
 

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.440

shared understanding then it is much

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:52.450
shared understanding then it is much
 

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.820

harder to design instruments and

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:55.830
harder to design instruments and
 

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.020
harder to design instruments and
targeting mechanisms so if you ask the

targeting mechanisms so if you ask the
 

01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:59.500
targeting mechanisms so if you ask the

01:03:59.500 --> 01:03:59.510
question of any reservation
 

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.450

why are you targeting somebody I think

in the sense that right and I think what
that has done is that that has closed

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:18.130
that has done is that that has closed
 

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:20.880
that has done is that that has closed
off some very deep questions that need

listening Abdallah to me so what are the
casualties of the reservation discourse

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:26.410
casualties of the reservation discourse
 

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:30.270
casualties of the reservation discourse
in India and Indian institutions is we

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:30.280
in India and Indian institutions is we
 

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.890
in India and Indian institutions is we
have now no language of thinking about

have now no language of thinking about
 

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.290
have now no language of thinking about
discrimination precisely because we have

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:34.300
discrimination precisely because we have
 

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.960
discrimination precisely because we have
granted reservation right I mean so you

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:36.970
granted reservation right I mean so you
 

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.090
granted reservation right I mean so you
know in some senses it's it's it's it's

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:39.100
know in some senses it's it's it's it's
 

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.330
know in some senses it's it's it's it's
right the second thing it has done and

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:42.340
right the second thing it has done and
 

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.070
right the second thing it has done and
and there I think the contrast with the

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:44.080
and there I think the contrast with the
 

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.290
and there I think the contrast with the
u.s. is striking that insofar as the US

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:46.300
u.s. is striking that insofar as the US
 

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.280
u.s. is striking that insofar as the US
has had some success

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:47.290
has had some success
 

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:51.540
has had some success
I think the institutional discourse was

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:51.550
I think the institutional discourse was
 

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:54.180
I think the institutional discourse was
meant to move along with and did manage

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:54.190
meant to move along with and did manage
 

01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:55.980
meant to move along with and did manage
to move what you might call the ethical

discourse around diversity and reserve
 

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.770
discourse around diversity and reserve
in reservation right so that if you

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:01.780
in reservation right so that if you
 

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.930
in reservation right so that if you
wanted an integrated society it's not

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:03.940
wanted an integrated society it's not
 

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.170
wanted an integrated society it's not
simply a question of what social
