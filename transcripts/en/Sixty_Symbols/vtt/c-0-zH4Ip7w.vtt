00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
These are dipping ducks or drinking birds or whatever you like to call them.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.760
We made a film about them about six years ago you can still watch that.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.980
But today I'd like to look at them in a bit more detail, and in particular, we'd like to use a thermal-imaging camera.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.640
First let's have a look at how they're made.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.060
As you can see, when the felt head's removed it's essentially just two glass bulbs connected by a tube.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.700
But it's important to note the tube extends down here and that the liquid inside

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.200
is something like dichloromethane, a liquid that evaporates easily.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.600
It's normally clear but colored here so we can see it better.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.840
Because the liquid is so volatile, it means we have quite a bit of vapor in this area.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.100
And importantly that vapor is sealed here in the upper chamber because, as you can see,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.920
the tube down here is below the liquid level.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.620
Now with the felt head on -- and that's also important -- we wet the bird's beak

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.020
and water spreads through the felt quickly encompassing the whole head.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.280
This water then starts evaporating, cooling the head.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.600
It's a bit like the bird's sweating to keep cool and that's when things get interesting.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.200
Vapor in the upper chamber starts to condense as it cools, and that means the pressure's dropping.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.600
Something called the ideal gas law would show with the temperature and amount of gas falling, the pressure falls too.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.030
Actually because of the gas-liquid phase transitions, this is more accurately described by something called the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.820
Clausius-Clapeyron relation, but that's not quite so easy to pronounce.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.240
You can look into that more later.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.720
Anyway, the important thing is the higher pressure down here where it's not cool, starts forcing liquid up the tube.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:54.660
We can see it and eventually due to the toy's design the bird becomes top-heavy and tips over.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.360
And now because of the clever placement of the tube, it's now above the liquid level.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880
The seal between the head and the tail is momentarily broken.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.600
Warm gas from below can now force it's way up the tube and the liquid drains back down the bottom.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.200
Importantly, the pressure is equalized and because the liquid's drained back down,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.300
the toy tips back to the upright position.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.350
This can go for a long time but even longer if we have a glass of water placed here because the head stays wet for as long as we choose.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.280
Now of course this isn't any kind of perpetual motion.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.890
Heat is constantly being extracted to keep the water evaporating.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.180
But speaking of heat, let's try this another way.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.320
Instead of cooling the head, let's use a hair dryer to warm the tail.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.180
Now first the blow-dryer actually moves the toy into its own position but that's to be expected.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.870
But here now, instead of lowering the pressure up top,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.600
we're increasing the temperature and amount of gas in the bottom bulb,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.720
thereby increasing the pressure down below.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.300
And again liquid is forced up the neck

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.820
and sure enough, this works too.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.020
Here's a comparison: you can see the hot one's almost too hot.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.660
The neck's filled with liquid almost all the time.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.560
Having done this, I then decided well,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.400
maybe we should try a few other things.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.500
First, using this tea light as a source of heat under the bird.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.280
Look how quickly the liquid rises.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.000
And the bird stays sort of permanently tipped.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.960
Trying to force it to the vertical shows the problem: there's just too much heat.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.900
Sort of endless loop of liquid and hot gases being forced up the tube by the high pressure below.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.660
Here you can see just how much the lower section's being heated.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.860
So next I tried putting the tealight here hoping for a gentler application of heat to that bottom bulb.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.020
Just a little bit of liquid creeping up, but never quite enough to tip the bird.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.100
And it was thermal imaging that revealed the problem.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.040
You can see the tea light is actually applying tremendous heat to the top bulb.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.860
The gas pressure up top is increasing, pressing down on the liquid: exactly what you don't want.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.819
Here's something else and I really didn't know what to expect this time.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.540
How will the drinking bird work if you use really hot or freezing cold water?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.960
Before watching, do you have any guesses?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.560
Well, after an initial dunk and letting the water spread, the cool-headed bird pretty much works properly, what you'd expect.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.280
But the hot-headed bird, that's more interesting.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.140
The heat in the head must be keeping the gas pressure in the top bulb too high,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.340
preventing the liquid from being forced up the neck of course.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.100
But watch closely. Evaporative cooling starts to kick in.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.520
The temperature drops. The pressure drops.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.520
The higher pressure below now does its job, forcing liquid up the neck.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.560
The bird starts dipping as it over balances.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.860
It's gradual and actually the mere act of dipping puts more heat into the head, stalling the process - you can see it.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.740
But eventually the back part of the head becomes cold enough and it's business as usual.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.440
In fact, though the beak's been constantly replenished with hot water, as you can see,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.460
the back part of the head stays cold enough.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.900
And soon, you can see the two birds dunking pretty much similar rates.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.680
If you'd like to go back and watch our original video with Professor Phil Moriarty about these dipping birds,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.500
I'll include a link on the screen and in the description.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.380
And thanks to Professor Moriarty for helping me out with this video.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.260
And lastly, also a big thanks to Google's Making &amp; Science team.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.190
If you'd like to see more films with various YouTubers they've supported,
