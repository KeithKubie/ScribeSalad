00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.906
When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this,

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.414
or this, or maybe this.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.017
What do they all have in common?

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:19.456
Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel,

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.758
and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments,

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:26.414
and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers.

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:31.231
But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.403
We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny.

00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:40.708
Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy.

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.215
They could explore 
distant stars and planets

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:46.331
by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:50.027
that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays.

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:51.792
You could deploy thousands of them

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.886
for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission,

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:57.229
exponentially increasing 
the amount of data

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.058
we could collect about the universe.

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:02.364
And they're individually expendable,

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:04.715
meaning that we could send them 
into environments

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.468
that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:13.421
Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.960
taking pictures of outer space,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.436
and collecting data on things,

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:19.868
like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:23.177
and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes.

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:28.477
But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit.

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.393
That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do:

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:36.334
send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:41.161
and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth.

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.924
But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel,

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:48.841
so how would such a vessel propel itself?

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:53.744
For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.602
On really small scales,

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:58.597
some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply,

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:02.934
in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:06.982
and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful.

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:11.089
Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action,

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.698
the phenomena 
that govern other small things.

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:19.412
Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft.

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.636
One example of how this might work

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:26.251
is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.214
It's a type of ion thruster,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:32.686
which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:36.338
One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:39.485
is only a couple centimeters 
on each side.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:40.813
Here's how it works.

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:46.199
That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.631
and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium.

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.589
A metal grid sits above the needles,

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.579
and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.752
When the plate is heated,
the indium melts

00:03:00.752 --> 00:03:04.966
and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:08.116
The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards,

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.910
while surface tension pulls it back,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.210
causing the indium to deform into a cone.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.428
The small radius of the tips 
of the needles

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:21.181
makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension,

00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:22.589
and when that happens,

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:28.790
positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.828
That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction,

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:35.941
thanks to Newton's third law.

00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:38.926
And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle,

00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:42.734
the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:46.339
is enough to generate 
significant acceleration.

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.356
And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine,

00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:53.373
this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient,

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:57.745
which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions.

00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:01.366
These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet,

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.513
but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:07.690
to break small craft out of Earth's orbit.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.707
In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft

00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:14.013
will be launched in the next ten years

00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:18.065
to gather data that today 
we can only dream about.

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:21.402
And that is micro-rocket science.
