00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:08.948
(delightful music)

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:12.144
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:16.144
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.547
lone the master of
fire, tools and language

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:24.964
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:29.040
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.123
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.836
We grow up slowly,

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:37.279
we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:39.862
we empathize and deceive,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.574
we shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:45.157
of the past.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:50.098
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:53.132
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:54.799
and how we got here.

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.915
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.165
like you.

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:17.830
(delightful music)

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:23.087
(techno music)

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.629
- Like many people here ,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.968
ever since I was a graduate
student in David Nelson's lab,

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.519
I've been interested in
the genetic basis of this,

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.898
which is what makes the
human brain so unique

00:01:42.898 --> 00:01:46.698
compared to our most closest
related living relatives.

00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:49.885
And I would argue that and
has already been alluded to

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:52.802
that geneticists have had
a problem for a long time

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.593
and this is partly
recognized by Alan Wilson

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:56.897
and Mary Claire King,

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:59.813
is that the genomes of humans and chimps

00:01:59.813 --> 00:02:01.701
are thought to be virtually identical

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:05.276
with 1.1, 1.2% genetic difference.

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:06.921
And I already alluded to that in fact

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.621
that the amino acid level of the proteins,

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:12.213
they estimated half the number
is closer to about a third

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:15.700
of the proteins are identical
between the chimp and human.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.767
Yet when you compare it to
other organisms, Drosophila

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.206
you can compare it to amphibians,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.613
even lizards that were
compared at that time

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.547
that Mary Claire was working on,

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:26.449
there are species that
have way more difference

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.101
in their amino acid compositions

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.065
and yet look virtually identical
in behavior and morphology

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:34.524
and so this led to kind
of the speculation that,

00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:38.784
it must be regulatory changes
that may make humans unique

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.367
or structural changes that
are actually important

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.383
in terms of shaping our DNA in ways

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:44.826
that couldn't be detected

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:48.896
at the level of amino acid differences.

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:52.162
I've been interested in one
very specific type of mutation

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:55.445
for a very long time,
duplicated sequences.

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:57.915
You might not think of
duplicated sequences as mutations

00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:58.794
but they are.

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.209
They arise as everything
else as a mutation.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.066
The initial duplication
is a mutational event.

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:05.603
They're important for genomes

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.015
for two very fundamental reasons.

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:11.240
Recognized for many years
long before molecular biology

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.225
was even a word.

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:16.655
Susumu Ohno recognized this
and even before him others did

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.970
that duplications are the primary force

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.300
by which new genes are
born within species.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.827
Doesn't matter if you're a
chimp or a fly or a worm,

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:25.834
if you want to create a new
gene, there's ways to do it

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:27.369
that don't involve duplication

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.527
but the primary ways
to make an extra copy,

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:32.075
free it from a selective
constraint, new mutations occur,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:33.917
new function.

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:36.430
The second actually goes back earlier

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.241
from guys named Sturtevant
and Bridges and Muller,

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.210
back into the 1930s, is this idea that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.901
when you duplicate sequence
and you create two sequences

00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:46.567
that are virtually identical,

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:49.442
you've actually made the genome unstable.

00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:51.297
So there's a process called
unequal crossing over

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:54.115
that can lead to unequal
crossing over events

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:55.958
that leads to gains and losses of sequence

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.262
right where the duplications live.

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:02.073
So structurally, dynamic and
the potential to give birth

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:03.756
to new genes.

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:05.250
So I'm going to talk to
you a little bit today

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.808
about duplications, recent duplications,

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.106
things that have evolved over
the last 25 million years,

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:12.421
we call them segmental duplications.

00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.621
There'll be duplications
within a chromosome,

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.643
they're inter-chromosomal duplications

00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:19.488
and duplications within a
chromosome which we'll call,

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.348
intra-chromosomal duplications.

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:23.250
And here's a map that I've often showed.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.745
This is some of the early work that we did

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:26.489
as part of the genome project,

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:28.279
where we actually built
the first duplication map

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.902
of the human genome.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.693
Anything that you see here in blue

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:33.870
is an intra-chromosomal duplication,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.497
so that means it's duplicated
along the chromosome.

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:39.429
So these are your chromosomes
schematically represented,

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.716
the purple represent the
regions that still to this day

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.579
haven't been sequenced
despite what people claim

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:44.792
that the genome is finished.

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.928
These are centromeres and acrocentric

00:04:46.928 --> 00:04:50.514
and some telomeric portions
of the chromosomes.

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:53.760
The blue represent the
intra-chromosomal duplications

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.044
that are greater than 95% identical

00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:58.052
and greater than 10 kilobases in size.

00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:01.300
So these are the biggest
events in our genome.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.324
A couple things I want
you to get from this.

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:05.463
You can run the statistics
but you can see it by eye

00:05:05.463 --> 00:05:07.847
that this distribution
is highly non-random.

00:05:07.847 --> 00:05:11.193
Certain chromosomes,
chromosome seven, 15, 16

00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:13.693
are particularly rich in this.

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.270
The second point I want
you to get from this

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.142
is that if you look at the pattern,

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:20.354
you see that a lot of these
lines actually go over

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.525
what appears to be long distances.

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:25.196
This is called an interspersed
pattern of duplications.

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:28.468
That means duplications are
born but when they are born

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:30.067
they don't actually stay
close to one another

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:33.057
but they in fact distribute,
disperse from one another

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.017
by long distances.

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:37.314
In fact if you do this
measurement, ask the question,

00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:39.998
what fraction of our duplicated sequences

00:05:39.998 --> 00:05:42.155
are actually separated from their ancestor

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:43.702
by at least a Megabase,

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:46.153
are located on completely
different chromosomes,

00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:48.432
the number is something like 60%.

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:52.124
So this is your interchromosomal
pattern overlaid.

00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:53.928
This is actually highly non-random as well

00:05:53.928 --> 00:05:56.740
but it's non-random in terms
of regions of the genomes.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.666
So near the ends of chromosomes
and near these centromeres

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:02.885
are where those predominantly live.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:05.550
Alright so that's the pattern.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.356
Why should you care?

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:09.536
Well the fact that you have
interspersed duplications

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.958
in your genome that are
separated by sometimes dozens,

00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.485
if not many dozens of
genes, means that the genes

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:18.598
that live between those
duplicated sequences

00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:21.602
are prone to be deleted
or duplicated themselves

00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:23.942
because they are now inside
a region of instability

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.866
in our genome.

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:27.288
I'm not going to go into great detail

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.716
but there now about 40 different genomic,

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:32.739
what is called disorders
of which half of them

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:35.454
are mediated by recurrent
deletions primarily

00:06:35.454 --> 00:06:39.290
but sometimes duplications of
the sequences that are these

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.450
recently evolved duplicated
parts of our genome.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.142
So this is an example of
one that we discovered.

00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:45.607
It's called the, with the others,

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:47.567
we discovered this back-to-back-to-back,

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:49.006
a Koolen DeVries syndrome.

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.214
These kids have this region of the genome

00:06:51.214 --> 00:06:54.370
only about a half a million
base pairs but it's deleted

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.617
and so their parents have
two copies of chromosome 17

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:00.154
but the child has inherited
one that actually is missing

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:03.818
about 500 kilobases of sequence
and that's because there are

00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:05.917
human or great ape specific duplications

00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:09.033
located at the boundaries
of this sequence.

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:11.197
Here's another one that
we discovered in 2008.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.563
This is a very specific form of autism.

00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:16.170
These children are born with
the exact same kind of problem,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.661
it's a bit different portion of the genome

00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.588
where there's duplications
that live right here

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:21.914
that cause this piece of DNA to be deleted

00:07:21.914 --> 00:07:26.044
about three megabases of
sequence and about a dozen genes.

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:28.275
Every kid that's been
born that we've identified

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.716
at least thus far has a
form of autism characterizes

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.671
by this frontal bossing of the forehead,

00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:34.183
very characteristic facial feature.

00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:37.361
So it's a very rare form of
autism in the human species

00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:40.657
caused by this duplication architecture.

00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:42.849
This is an example of one
which doesn't actually

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.564
have any clear facial morphology.

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.473
And this is a recurrent micro deletion on

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:48.828
again, chromosome 15.

00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:52.807
Once again mediated by recently
evolved duplicated sequences

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:56.107
these kids can either receive
kind of an inherited form

00:07:56.107 --> 00:07:58.190
but more often they get a
de novo which means that

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.014
it happened in generally
in one of their parents.

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.587
Instead of just having one disease,

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:05.038
these kids are at risk
for multiple diseases.

00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:07.030
So it turns out that we
identified this associated

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.985
with intellectual disability
but relatively high functioning

00:08:09.985 --> 00:08:12.330
later it was found to be
associated with autism

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.734
later it was found to be
associated 1% of epilepsy

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:17.762
so idiopathic generalized epilepsy

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:19.292
and papers from other labs showed that

00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:20.624
it was an important risk factor

00:08:20.624 --> 00:08:22.049
probably one of the biggest ones

00:08:22.049 --> 00:08:25.549
for schizophrenia in the adult population.

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.277
This is our duplication architecture

00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:30.066
and you could ask yourself the question,

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.814
well, why do we have this organization?

00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:36.148
It turns out when we go to the
genomes of Mouse, rats, dogs,

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:39.632
cats, platypus, they don't
have this type of organization.

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:42.285
They keep their duplications
organized in clusters

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:44.735
and little pockets
without being dispersed.

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:48.854
So this dispersal of duplications
has created a bad design,

00:08:48.854 --> 00:08:49.924
pardon the pun.

00:08:49.924 --> 00:08:52.208
It actually makes our
genome fragile essentially

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.405
because of the presence of
these duplicate sequences

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:57.319
that have evolved over the
last 15, 20 million years

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.022
of evolution.

00:08:59.022 --> 00:09:02.091
Humans, chimps, gorillas,
we all share this

00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:03.817
although the exact patterns are different

00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:05.579
between chimps and gorillas.

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:09.277
And to a lesser extent, species
like macaque and marmoset

00:09:09.277 --> 00:09:13.514
have fewer of these compared
to that of the great apes.

00:09:13.514 --> 00:09:16.151
So I'll say the answer, I
won't give you the answer

00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:18.279
but you've actually
heard some of this today

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.290
but just remember that
these are not basically

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.082
gene poor regions of the genome.

00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:26.681
There's about a thousand genes
if you believe your browsers,

00:09:26.681 --> 00:09:29.191
that are out there that are
aren't mapped in these areas

00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:30.490
of the genome.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.578
And Ohno argued that the primary force

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:35.947
by which these new genes
evolve is duplication.

00:09:35.947 --> 00:09:38.548
So before I tell you some stories,

00:09:38.548 --> 00:09:40.316
I want to tell you a couple other features

00:09:40.316 --> 00:09:41.621
of these duplications.

00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:44.050
One, is that their accumulation over time

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.339
has been non-random.

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:48.540
So work that was alluded to,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.934
work that I did with my
former postdoc Thomas Marquez,

00:09:50.934 --> 00:09:52.727
we sequenced about a
hundred great ape genomes

00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:55.550
to try to estimate which
duplications were fixed,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.415
which duplications were polymorphic.

00:09:58.415 --> 00:10:00.944
And this generally accepted phylogeny

00:10:00.944 --> 00:10:02.698
and the thickness of the lines,

00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:06.831
indicate roughly the proportion
of duplicated sequence

00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:09.581
that has been fixed on any branch.

00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:11.902
So the numbers are not that important but,

00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:12.925
for those of you who are interested,

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:15.226
what this means is for every
base that has been fixed

00:10:15.226 --> 00:10:17.412
as a result of single base pair mutation,

00:10:17.412 --> 00:10:20.380
there have been two point six
one bases that have been fixed

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.183
in this branch as a result of duplication.

00:10:23.183 --> 00:10:25.055
But the really important and I think,

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:27.684
relevant to this audience, is that

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:31.025
there is a huge excess, very statistical.

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:34.271
Not in our branch but in
the common branch leading to

00:10:34.271 --> 00:10:36.036
humans, chimps and gorillas.

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.230
This is where we see the biggest excess

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.201
of duplicated sequences and
almost all the duplications

00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:44.188
that are causing disease in our species,

00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:47.832
associated with delay in autism,
are mapping to duplications

00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:51.317
that evolved here and evolved
right around the separation

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.900
of chimps, gorillas and humans.

00:10:55.653 --> 00:10:57.404
Second point.

00:10:57.404 --> 00:11:00.344
What I presented in terms of
the organization was too simple

00:11:00.344 --> 00:11:02.961
so if you actually go and
actually look at the structures

00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:05.139
of these duplications within a chromosome,

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:08.050
here's your chromosome 16
and these little numbers here

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.884
indicate the structures that
are indicated on the right here

00:11:11.884 --> 00:11:13.968
anything that you see in color,

00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:15.253
means that we've been able to determine

00:11:15.253 --> 00:11:17.264
the evolutionary origin of the segment

00:11:17.264 --> 00:11:19.518
so whenever you see the same
color, that means this came

00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:21.092
from the same origin.

00:11:21.092 --> 00:11:23.945
In this case on chromosome 16.

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:26.450
You get this picture of duplications

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.213
that are made up of different
pieces of the genome

00:11:29.213 --> 00:11:32.490
that have stitched together
to build these complex mosaics

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.035
or modular structures
and then they actually,

00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:37.700
some are very similar to one another

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.320
but some are actually very
different to one another.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.025
But the really remarkable thing

00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:44.315
and it's true for every
chromosome that's experienced

00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:46.693
this burst of duplications, is that,

00:11:46.693 --> 00:11:49.821
in those chromosomes you
see a specific sequence,

00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:51.760
this is indicated here by the red,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.971
we call it a core duplicon.

00:11:53.971 --> 00:11:55.376
It is the place of the genome

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:56.899
where it seems to be the focal point

00:11:56.899 --> 00:12:00.162
for the building up of these
more complex architectures.

00:12:00.162 --> 00:12:02.602
This sequence is over-represented,

00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.787
way more than you'd expect by chance

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:07.408
and it seems to actually be
involved somehow inherently

00:12:07.408 --> 00:12:08.705
in this duplication

00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:12.617
and this interspersed
duplication architecture.

00:12:12.617 --> 00:12:15.456
Moreover, most of the
recurrent rearrangements

00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:17.699
that are associated with
disease are mediated

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:21.601
by duplication blocks
that have these cores.

00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:25.307
So we came up with simple
hypothesis back in 2008.

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:26.328
Maybe the disadvantage

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:28.023
of this intersperse
duplication architecture

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:31.215
is offset by the emergence of
new genes with new functions

00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:34.301
which override that actually
select a disadvantage of this

00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.899
which is predisposing us to disease

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:37.499
or our children to disease

00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:39.898
and maybe contributing
to the unique features

00:12:39.898 --> 00:12:44.178
that make us human i.e. the
developing of the human brain.

00:12:44.178 --> 00:12:45.431
So, is there any evidence?

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.659
So you've seen a version of this slide.

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:50.022
This were examples of
the youngest duplications

00:12:50.022 --> 00:12:52.236
that evolved and so are
the genes are listed here

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:53.408
at the bottom.

00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:56.644
This is the copy number that
we estimate in the genome

00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:59.119
of multiple humans from
Asia, Europe and Africa

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:01.191
compared to chimp, orangutan and gorillas

00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:03.425
shown here in gray and black.

00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:06.806
So these are human
specific duplication events

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:09.487
and one of the things that
we and Jim Sequila noticed

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:13.559
early on is that there is
actually a noticeable enrichment,

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.500
it's borderline significant

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.382
because there's not that many genes,

00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:18.579
of genes that have been implicated

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:20.378
in terms of brain development.

00:13:20.378 --> 00:13:22.080
And what's really interesting
is if you actually look

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.827
at the chimpanzee specific

00:13:23.827 --> 00:13:25.806
or the gorilla specific duplications,

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.808
you don't see these types of genes,

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:29.797
you see genes involved in immune response,

00:13:29.797 --> 00:13:31.916
genes involved in drug detoxification

00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:33.831
but you don't see these types of genes

00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:36.120
actually being enriched.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.124
So for example you've heard about SRGAP2

00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:40.455
and ARHGAP11B at this meeting,

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:43.902
GTF2IRD is a transcription factor,

00:13:43.902 --> 00:13:46.117
thought to be important in
terms of visual spacial defects

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.681
associated with the
Williams syndrome disease.

00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:51.328
G pin, GPRN is a G-couple protein inducer

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.025
of neurite outgrowth.

00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:57.192
CHRFAM7A is a related nicotinamide
acetylcholine receptor,

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.509
HYDIN is a gene that's
important in fluid flow

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:02.300
in terms of developing brain.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.378
SMN1, survival motor neuron
protein, incredibly important

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:09.378
in terms of spinal muscular atrophy.

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:13.013
Two stories that you heard here,

00:14:13.013 --> 00:14:15.848
in fact I think rise
above a just so story.

00:14:15.848 --> 00:14:18.985
The one you heard from
Frank about SRGAP2C.

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:21.244
So we were involved in
kind of characterizing

00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:23.084
this duplication.

00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:26.076
It turns out that the actual gene itself

00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:28.247
wasn't in the human genome in 2012,

00:14:28.247 --> 00:14:30.511
so we had to actually go
and clone and sequence it.

00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:32.579
In 2012 it turns out
there was only one copy

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.905
in the human reference and
there are actually four

00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:37.738
of which one is a clear pseudogene.

00:14:37.738 --> 00:14:40.143
Ancestor produced a
daughter called SRGAP2A

00:14:40.143 --> 00:14:43.229
about 3.2 million years ago
with a secondary duplication

00:14:43.229 --> 00:14:45.345
leading to SRGAP2C

00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:48.316
which is this duplicate truncated form

00:14:48.316 --> 00:14:51.162
that antagonizes the function
that's thought to be important

00:14:51.162 --> 00:14:53.490
in terms of altering spine development

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.706
as well as excitatory
and inhibitory synapses.

00:14:56.706 --> 00:14:59.153
The other story you heard
was from Viland Hutner.

00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:02.131
We discovered this released
a duplicated sequence

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:05.380
back in the early 2000s and
actually characterized it

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.448
and reconstructed the
evolutionary history in 2014.

00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:10.782
And this was a gene
that as you heard today

00:15:10.782 --> 00:15:11.988
thought to be important in terms of

00:15:11.988 --> 00:15:14.667
increasing number of basal
radial glial divisions

00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:18.445
or also known as auto
ventricular cell divisions

00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:22.074
that may be important in terms
of increasing neuronal count.

00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:24.307
The common theme about these,

00:15:24.307 --> 00:15:26.629
is that each of them are truncated

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:29.985
with respect to the parent
copies, they're not full-length.

00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:32.888
These genes or these
duplications are also associated

00:15:32.888 --> 00:15:34.173
with genomic instability.

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:35.972
So in the case of 15Q1,3,

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:38.670
that's associated with
that schizophrenia former

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.329
and as well as epilepsy
that I showed you earlier.

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:45.340
And in these particular
cases it looks as if

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.506
the duplication itself may have been,

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:48.898
the incomplete nature of it

00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:51.290
may have been important for the
Neo-functionalisation of it,

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.779
for the actual evolution of new function.

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:57.571
So I'm going to end with
a story on this last one

00:15:57.571 --> 00:15:58.990
which we just recently published

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.083
and we continue to characterize.

00:16:00.083 --> 00:16:03.005
So this is this picture of
chromosome 16 I showed you before

00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.725
and I'm going to zoom in
on these duplication blocks

00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:07.652
that evolved over the
last few million years

00:16:07.652 --> 00:16:09.323
in evolution of our genome.

00:16:09.323 --> 00:16:12.684
And the reason that this
particular duplication pair

00:16:12.684 --> 00:16:17.155
is so important, is that
recurrent rearrangements of it

00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:20.330
actually result in the second
most common cause of autism

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.709
in the human species

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:25.644
that is of a deletion
of chromosome 16P1 1.2

00:16:25.644 --> 00:16:28.989
in the 25 to 28 genes
that map between these.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.850
So this is the second most
common cause of autism

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.397
genetically known in the human population.

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:37.713
Result of duplications
that evolved specifically

00:16:37.713 --> 00:16:41.574
in the last few million
years in our in our species.

00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:43.934
So I convinced a student
about four years ago to go

00:16:43.934 --> 00:16:44.932
and characterize this

00:16:44.932 --> 00:16:47.306
and do a comparative evolutionary study

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:49.402
which almost no one ever seems
to do at the genetic level

00:16:49.402 --> 00:16:52.135
because they think the genomes are done.

00:16:52.135 --> 00:16:53.388
So in a weak moment he agreed.

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:55.473
So the student was named Xander Nuttle

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.165
and this was just showing
you kind of our sequencing.

00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:00.941
So the way he did it was
kind of old-fashioned.

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:02.907
He took large insert
clones and sequenced them

00:17:02.907 --> 00:17:05.097
and reassembled because we
didn't trust the genomes

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:06.430
that were assembled.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.848
And the way I'm going to
show you these pictures,

00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:09.056
I'm just going to show you,

00:17:09.056 --> 00:17:12.134
this is a portion of
chromosome 16 on the orangutan

00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:14.200
where the little ticks represent genes.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.645
So there's 48 genes that
are represented here.

00:17:16.645 --> 00:17:19.095
The color represents
the duplicated sequence,

00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:21.408
at least in my life, I
always put that in color

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:25.455
and then the actual
arrows here indicate the,

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:28.232
what we call synteny, so it's
the order of these segments

00:17:28.232 --> 00:17:31.570
with respect to other mammalian species.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.603
Other than the duplications
this order and these genes

00:17:34.603 --> 00:17:36.335
is completely syntenic with mouse

00:17:36.335 --> 00:17:38.886
which diverged about 80
to 90 million years ago

00:17:38.886 --> 00:17:41.379
so we believe this is the ancestral state.

00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:44.169
So then he repeated the
experiment by looking at gorillas,

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:46.095
chimps and humans.

00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:48.819
So I'm going to show you
two chimps and two humans

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.071
or one human right now
for the exact same region

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.878
of the genome.

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:55.620
So this is the exact
same area of the genome.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.443
In this it's one point four
megabases or million base pairs

00:17:58.443 --> 00:18:01.480
in orangutan and these
are the two chimp versions

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.546
of this particular portion
of chromosome 16 right here

00:18:04.546 --> 00:18:07.297
and there's the human for comparison.

00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:10.412
Now the colors remember,
represent the duplications

00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:13.485
and the arrows represent the segments

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.279
and so the first thing
you should get from this

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:16.847
when you look at it you say,

00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:18.582
"God that doesn't look
even close to the same."

00:18:18.582 --> 00:18:21.611
And you'd be right because
this area of the genome

00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:25.055
has essentially doubled in size
as a result of duplications

00:18:25.055 --> 00:18:26.474
in the chimp and the human lineage,

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:29.286
those are all the color bars.

00:18:29.286 --> 00:18:30.813
The interesting thing is,

00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:32.573
is that the patterns of duplications

00:18:32.573 --> 00:18:35.567
are almost completely different
between chimp and human.

00:18:35.567 --> 00:18:37.172
So remember the different colors represent

00:18:37.172 --> 00:18:39.662
different evolutionary
origins and you can see

00:18:39.662 --> 00:18:42.601
that there are some
things that are similar,

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:44.549
these little red ticks
are those core duplicons

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:47.839
but by and large the structure
is radically different.

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:50.244
More interestingly, if you actually look

00:18:50.244 --> 00:18:52.909
at the actual segments of the DNA itself

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:55.349
you can see that they're
completely ordered differently

00:18:55.349 --> 00:18:57.468
between a chimp and a human.

00:18:57.468 --> 00:18:59.825
These segments, these
six segments of 48 genes

00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:01.041
have been shuffled around

00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:02.334
in completely different combinations.

00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:04.610
In fact my student
estimated parsimoniously

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.241
that you would need 13
large-scale structural changes

00:19:08.241 --> 00:19:12.550
to actually convert a human to
a chimp structure over this.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.503
So the idea that we're
99 percent in this region

00:19:15.503 --> 00:19:18.638
of the genome actually has no meaning.

00:19:18.638 --> 00:19:20.977
We are so radically different

00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:24.366
but over a very focaled
region of our genome.

00:19:24.366 --> 00:19:25.891
Coming back to disease,

00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:29.437
this is the area that
causes autism in our kids

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:31.216
and it's because we
have these duplications

00:19:31.216 --> 00:19:34.353
in a direct orientation of
the same type on either side.

00:19:34.353 --> 00:19:36.720
If you look at the chimp region five,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.545
both haplotypes, they don't have this.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.991
They don't have the
duplication architecture

00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.642
that would predispose the disease.

00:19:42.642 --> 00:19:45.109
In other words, they are not predisposed

00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:46.682
to developing this form of autism

00:19:46.682 --> 00:19:48.307
because they don't actually
have the architecture

00:19:48.307 --> 00:19:50.807
to predispose the instability.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.699
So what do humans look
like if you compare them.

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:55.771
Thankfully we look much
more similar to one another

00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:57.726
so this is three different
human chromosomes

00:19:57.726 --> 00:19:59.338
that are being compared.

00:19:59.338 --> 00:20:03.001
But we do differ and we
differ over only one portion

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:07.168
and this is indicated here by
the orange and green arrows.

00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:09.881
There's a region of
about a hundred kilobases

00:20:09.881 --> 00:20:12.281
that is expanding and
contracting like accordions

00:20:12.281 --> 00:20:15.355
on this region which predisposes to autism

00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:17.284
but on either side we're
expanding and contracting

00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:19.176
this hundred kilobase cassette.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.623
And if you look really
carefully you'll see

00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:24.282
that there are four genes
right over the area of change

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:25.852
and these are genes that are important

00:20:25.852 --> 00:20:27.858
both in drug detoxification we have found

00:20:27.858 --> 00:20:31.390
but also genes important in
terms of iron metabolism.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.326
This gene called BOLA2.

00:20:33.326 --> 00:20:35.594
This is a gene that's actually
been shown biochemically

00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:38.008
both in vitro and in vivo
to be important in terms of

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:42.003
recruiting more iron into
a cell and helping it

00:20:42.003 --> 00:20:44.458
to essentially become stable
in terms of the proteins

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:46.147
that it produces.

00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:49.248
So how do humans vary if you
look at thousands of them?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.770
This is 2500 humans
that we're comparing now

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.246
for copy number of this
hundred kilobase segment

00:20:54.246 --> 00:20:57.581
which in claim contains this BOLA2 gene.

00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:59.593
And here's the interesting part.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.636
You look at humans from all
the different continents

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.411
and they're quite variable
in terms of their copy

00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:07.383
but all of them or I
should say none of them

00:21:07.383 --> 00:21:09.074
go back to the ancestral state

00:21:09.074 --> 00:21:12.438
as what you see in chimps,
gorillas and orangutans.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.710
So every human has at least three,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.986
most of us have five or
six of this duplication.

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.408
A few at three but none go back to two

00:21:21.408 --> 00:21:24.164
as what you see in these species.

00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:26.581
Here's where it gets really cool.

00:21:26.581 --> 00:21:29.387
If you compare to Neanderthal and Denisova

00:21:29.387 --> 00:21:30.463
which you've heard a little bit about,

00:21:30.463 --> 00:21:32.161
they separated from us very recently

00:21:32.161 --> 00:21:34.666
only about 400 to 500,000 years ago.

00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:37.066
They look like chimps and gorillas

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:38.677
in terms of their copy number.

00:21:38.677 --> 00:21:41.515
If we look at archaic hominins

00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:43.632
or I should say archaic
humans not hominins,

00:21:43.632 --> 00:21:44.465
archaic humans.

00:21:44.465 --> 00:21:49.215
So this would be humans that
lived 30 to 40,000 years ago,

00:21:49.215 --> 00:21:50.871
they look like us.

00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:55.424
This is 400,000 years ago,
this is 50,000 years ago.

00:21:55.424 --> 00:21:59.279
What's really remarkable is
that, when we estimate the time

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:01.412
and we can do this with
phylogenetic approaches,

00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:03.827
we estimate the birth of
this duplication to being

00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:06.451
about 282,000 years ago.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.618
This is where most
paleontologists estimate the root

00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:11.902
of the species Homo Sapiens.

00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:14.665
Of course the plus or
minus is 75,000 here.

00:22:14.665 --> 00:22:17.339
(audience laughs)

00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:21.686
One thing we can show
from basically doing,

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:24.904
using methods involving
evolutionary or phylogenetic methods

00:22:24.904 --> 00:22:28.341
is that the rate at which
this expanded is too rapid

00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:31.150
to be explained based on
strictly neutral evolution.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.084
So this is not evolving
neutrally, it's actually the fact

00:22:34.084 --> 00:22:37.378
that we haven't gone back to
the actual ancestral state

00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:40.004
is very unusual specifically
for a duplication

00:22:40.004 --> 00:22:43.541
where copy number variation
is always occurring.

00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:46.033
And copy number of this piece of DNA

00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:47.179
actually correlates expression.

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:48.551
So those of you who have more copies

00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:52.945
actually have more of
this BOLA2 expressed.

00:22:52.945 --> 00:22:54.703
We looked at this in terms
of expression differences

00:22:54.703 --> 00:22:56.290
between chimp and human with rusty.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.052
So he had actually
published this early work

00:22:58.052 --> 00:22:58.983
that he mentioned already looking at

00:22:58.983 --> 00:23:01.405
induced pluripotent stem
cells in chimps, bonobos

00:23:01.405 --> 00:23:02.506
and humans.

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.514
And even though it didn't
make his top 10 list,

00:23:04.514 --> 00:23:08.205
it should've because this
gene was actually expressed

00:23:08.205 --> 00:23:12.097
seven point five fold higher
on average in the chimp

00:23:12.097 --> 00:23:14.351
or I should say the human
compared to the chimp.

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.323
And the reason when we went
back and looked at this

00:23:16.323 --> 00:23:18.006
is because there was variance

00:23:18.006 --> 00:23:19.759
in actually the copy
number estimates in human

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:23.017
because he looked at more than one human.

00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:25.370
So we did these experiments with his group

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.897
and we could show that in
fact there is a big difference

00:23:27.897 --> 00:23:29.886
between humans and chimps and bonobos

00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:32.405
but the biggest different
happens early in development,

00:23:32.405 --> 00:23:34.982
what we consider induced
pluripotent stem cells.

00:23:34.982 --> 00:23:37.649
There's still some difference
between these NPCs,

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:39.155
neuronal progenitor cells

00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:42.198
but that's the biggest
difference that we see.

00:23:42.198 --> 00:23:44.310
The one last point I'll
make is that in fact

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.869
when we actually look at
the actual gene itself

00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:48.630
there is just a simple duplicate gene

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.534
which is entirely represented

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:53.362
but because these
duplications are often mosaic,

00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:55.681
we actually have identified a gene

00:23:55.681 --> 00:23:58.967
which looks like a complete
fusion of part of BOLA2

00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:03.134
with another CHR3 in kinase
which now makes a duplication,

00:24:04.873 --> 00:24:07.869
a fusion duplication that
has an open reading frame.

00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:10.182
This is in fact to my knowledge,

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:14.530
the only Homo Sapien specific
gene that distinguishes chimp

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.878
I should say humans from
Neanderthals and Denisova

00:24:17.878 --> 00:24:20.026
because Denisova and
Neanderthal do not have

00:24:20.026 --> 00:24:22.895
this duplication therefore
do not have the fusion.

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:24.584
Coming back to the disease,

00:24:24.584 --> 00:24:27.223
going back to the kids
that actually have autism

00:24:27.223 --> 00:24:28.899
and mapping the breakpoints of those kids

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:31.231
where did those breakpoints
specifically occur,

00:24:31.231 --> 00:24:33.573
96% of the children that we've looked at

00:24:33.573 --> 00:24:36.098
that have this breakpoint
associated with autism,

00:24:36.098 --> 00:24:39.579
their breakpoint maps to the
Homo Sapien specific segment

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:44.065
that evolved on the order
of about 280,000 years ago.

00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:45.414
And then this is just to show you

00:24:45.414 --> 00:24:47.850
that if we look at those kids
that have low copy number

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.393
because those kids do
have lower copy than most,

00:24:50.393 --> 00:24:52.831
we in fact find out that
in fact half of them

00:24:52.831 --> 00:24:54.317
and the numbers are still small,

00:24:54.317 --> 00:24:56.790
they have problems with
anemia and I require

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.925
iron supplementation compared
to the rest of the kids

00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:00.458
with this particular deletion

00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:03.807
who still have high copies of
BOLA2 which do not have anemia

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:06.069
or they very have low incidence of anemia.

00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:08.704
So we think it's actually
relevant also to disease

00:25:08.704 --> 00:25:11.584
in kids that are anemic with autism.

00:25:11.584 --> 00:25:13.284
So in summary,

00:25:13.284 --> 00:25:15.473
I hope I've convinced
you how cool our genome

00:25:15.473 --> 00:25:17.112
and how absolutely chaotic it is

00:25:17.112 --> 00:25:18.860
with respect to duplications,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.476
that we've had this burst of duplications

00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:22.833
that has occurred on the order of

00:25:22.833 --> 00:25:24.821
eight to 15 million years ago

00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:26.751
before we separated as species

00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:29.185
but as we were separating as species,

00:25:29.185 --> 00:25:31.352
this wired us for disease.

00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:34.169
So we actually have a lot
of additional, recurrent,

00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:36.846
structural changes in our genome

00:25:36.846 --> 00:25:39.329
as a result of this
duplication architecture.

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:42.566
But this has come with
benefits and we think that,

00:25:42.566 --> 00:25:45.457
we hypothesize the core
duplicon hypothesis is that

00:25:45.457 --> 00:25:47.672
the negative result of having these

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.149
interspersed architecture is offset

00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:51.012
by the emergence of new genes.

00:25:51.012 --> 00:25:54.105
We consider SRGAP2C and ARHGAP11B

00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:57.141
to be some of our best
examples of these types

00:25:57.141 --> 00:25:59.475
but we think there'll be others.

00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:02.351
And we also think BOLA2 is
particularly interesting

00:26:02.351 --> 00:26:05.361
because it's a Homo
Sapien specific expansion

00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:08.488
which we think will be
relevant for iron homeostasis

00:26:08.488 --> 00:26:11.570
or improving our ability to recruit iron

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.845
and at the same time it's predisposing us

00:26:13.845 --> 00:26:16.158
to the most common or second
most common cause of autism

00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:18.152
in the human species.

00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:20.406
So when I think about the
evolution of our genome

00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:21.790
and this is the way I think about it,

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.218
I think of actually a balancing act

00:26:23.218 --> 00:26:26.839
between both disease and evolution.

00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:28.726
These are the folks that did all the work

00:26:28.726 --> 00:26:32.580
and I will show you Seattle in the Sun

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.576
because this is just to show you that

00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:37.087
the Sun does shine in Seattle.

00:26:37.087 --> 00:26:38.367
Thank you.

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:41.367
(audience applauds)

00:26:42.464 --> 00:26:45.381
(delightful music)
