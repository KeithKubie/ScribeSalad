00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.730
Part b.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.650
"Determine the x-coordinate
of the point at which g

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
has an absolute maximum
on the interval negative 4

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.760
is less than or equal to x,
is less than or equal to 3.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.564
And justify your answer."

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:15.480
So let's just think about
it in general terms.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.188
If we just think about
a general function

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:20.300
over an interval, where it
could have an absolute maximum.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.750
So let me draw some
axes over here.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.110
And I'm speaking in
general terms first,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.110
and then we can go back
to our function g, which

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.920
is derived from this
function f right over here.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.560
So let's say that these
are my coordinate axes,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.950
and let's say we care
about some interval here.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520
So let's say this is the
interval that I care about.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.480
A function could look
something like this.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.190
And in this case,
its absolute maximum

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.000
is going to occur at the
beginning of the interval.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.840
Or a function could look
something like this.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.430
And then the absolute
maximum could

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.070
occur at the end
point of the interval.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.550
Or the other possibility
is that the function

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.720
looks something like this.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.580
At which point,
the maximum would

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.800
be at this critical point.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.750
And I say critical point, as
opposed to just a point where

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.419
the slope is zero, because
it's possible to the functions

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:17.460
not differentiable there.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.819
You could imagine a function
that looks like this,

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.610
and maybe wouldn't be
differentiable there.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.895
But that point there still
would be the absolute maximum.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.270
So what we really
just have to do

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.510
is evaluate g at the different
endpoints of this interval,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.850
to see how high it gets,
or how large of a value

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.800
we get for the g
at the end points.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.330
And then we have to see if g has
any critical points in between.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.770
And then evaluate
it there to see

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.290
if that's a candidate
for the global maximum.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.820
So let's just evaluate g
of the different points.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.440
So let's start off, let's
evaluate g at negative 4--

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.250
at kind of the lowest
end, or the starting point

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.720
of our interval.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.210
So g of negative 4 is
equal to 2 times negative 4

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.030
plus the integral from 0
to negative 4 f of t dt.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.010
The first part is very easy, 2
times negative 4 is negative 8.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.990
Let me do it over here so
I have some real estate.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.330
So this is equal to negative 8.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.110
And instead of leaving this
as 0 to negative 4 f of t dt,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
let's change the bounds
of integration here.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.910
Especially so that we can get
the lower number as the lower

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.580
bound.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.121
And that way, it
becomes a little bit

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:39.190
more natural to think
of it in terms of areas.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.540
So this expression
right here can

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.460
be rewritten as the
negative of the integral

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
between negative
4 and 0 f of t dt.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.310
And now this expression
right over here

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.860
is the area under f of
t, or in this case, f

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.800
of x-- or the area under f
between negative 4 and 0.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.040
So it's this area
right over here.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.040
And we have to be careful,
because this part over here

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.980
is below the x-axis.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.290
So this we would
consider negative area

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.380
when we think of it
in integration terms.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170
And this would be positive area.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.640
So the total area here is
going to be this positive area

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.050
minus this area right over here.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.180
So let's think
about what this is.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.570
So this area-- This section
over here we did this in part a,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.540
actually, This section--
this is a quarter circle,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.400
so it's 1/4-- so these
are both quarter circles.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.130
So we could multiply 1/4 times
the area of this entire circle,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.580
if we were to draw the entire
thing all the way around.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.340
It has a radius of 3.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.250
So the area of the entire circle
would be pi times 3 squared

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.807
or it would be 9 pi.

00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:53.390
And of course we're
going to divide it

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.440
by 4-- multiply it by 1/4 to
just get this quarter circle

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.700
right over there.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.690
And then this area
right over here,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.780
the area of the entire
circle, we have a radius of 1.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.437
So it's going to be
pi times 1 squared.

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:10.020
So it's going to be
pi, and then we're

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.525
going to divide it
by four, because it's

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:15.630
only one fourth of that circle.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.149
And we're going
to subtract that.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.200
So we have negative pi
and we were multiplying it

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.860
times 1/4 out here,
because it's just

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.750
a quarter circle in either case.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.500
And we're subtracting
it, because the area

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.170
is below the x-axis.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.210
And so this simplifies to--
this is equal to 1/4 times

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.767
8 pi, which is the
same thing as 2 pi.

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:38.600
Did I do that right?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.850
1/4 times 8 pi.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.930
So this all simplifies to 2 pi.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.670
So g of negative 4 is equal
to negative 8 minus 2 pi.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.010
So clearly it is a
negative number here.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.000
More negative than negative 8.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.680
So let's try the other bounds.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.880
So let's see what
g of positive 3 is.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.510
I'll do it over here so
I have some more space.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.290
So g of positive 3,
when x is equal to 3,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.090
that-- we go back to our
definition-- that is 2 times

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.760
3 plus the integral
from 0 to 3 f of t dt.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.220
And this is going to be
equal to 2 times 3 is 6.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.740
And the integral from 0
to 3 f of t dt, that's

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.880
this entire area.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.010
So we have positive
area over here.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.220
And then we have an equal
negative area right over here

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.160
because it's below the x-axis.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.764
So the integral from 0 to
3 is just going to be 0,

00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:36.430
you're going to have
this positive area,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.629
and then this negative
area right over here

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.170
is going to completely
cancel it out.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.220
Because it's symmetric
right over here.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.243
So this thing is going
to evaluate to 0.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.430
So g of 3 is 6.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.360
So we already know that
our starting point, g

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.930
of negative 4-- that when
x is equal to negative 4--

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.825
that is not where g
hits a global maximum.

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:56.200
Because that's a
negative number.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.930
And we already
found the end point,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.040
where g hits a positive value.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.160
So negative 4 is
definitely not a candidate.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.320
x is equal to 3 is still in the
running for the x-coordinate

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.461
where g has a global
absolute maximum.

00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:09.960
Now what we have
to do is figure out

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.130
any critical points
that g has in between.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.530
So points in there where
it's either undifferentiable

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.670
or its derivative is equal to 0.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.680
So let's look at
this derivative.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.910
So g prime of x-- we just take
the derivative of this business

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.410
up here.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.490
Derivative of 2x is 2.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.580
Derivative of this definition
going from 0 to x of f of t

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.640
dt-- we did that in part a, this
is just the fundamental theorem

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.270
of calculus-- this
is just going to be

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.040
plus f of x right over there.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.860
So it actually
turns out that g is

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.190
differentiable over
the entire interval.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.430
You give any x value
over this interval,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.260
we have a value for f of x.
f of x isn't differentiable

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.950
everywhere, but
definitely f of x

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.980
is defined everywhere,
over the interval.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.120
So you'll get a number here,
and obviously two is just two,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.501
and you add two to it, and
you get the derivative of g

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.750
at that point in the interval.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.300
So g is actually differentiable
throughout the interval.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.810
So the only critical
points would

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.100
be where this derivative
is equal to 0.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.850
So let's set this
thing equal to 0.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.230
So we want to solve the
equation-- I'll just rewrite it

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.140
actually-- So we want to solve
the equation g prime of x

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.400
is equal to 0, or 2 plus
f of x is equal to 0.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.150
You can subtract
2 from both sides,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.010
and you get f of x is
equal to negative 2.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.750
So any x that satisfies f
of x is equal to negative 2

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.630
is a point where the
derivative of g is equal to 0.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.290
And let's see if f of x is equal
to negative 2 at any point.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.179
So let me draw a line
over here at negative 2.

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:49.720
We have to look at it visually,
because there's only given us

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.111
this visual
definition of f of x.

00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:54.360
Doesn't equal negative 2,
doesn't equal to negative 2,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.800
only equals negative
2 right over there.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.991
And it looks like we're at about
2 and 1/2, but let's get exact.

00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.990
Let's actually figure out
the slope of the line,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.820
and figure out what
x value actually

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.632
gives f of x equal
to negative 2.

00:08:09.632 --> 00:08:11.840
And we could figure out the
slope of this line fairly

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.020
visually-- or figure out the
equation of this line fairly

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.360
visually, we can
figure out its slope.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.630
If we run 3-- if our
change in x is 3,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.890
then our change in y,
our rise, is negative 6.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.450
Change in y is
equal to negative 6.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.110
Slope is rise over run, or
change in y over change in x.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.992
So negative 6 divided
by 3 is negative 2.

00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:40.200
It has a slope of negative 2.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.033
And actually, I could
have done that easier.

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:45.780
Where if we go forward
one, we go down by 2.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.760
So we could have seen that
the slope is negative 2.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.000
So this part of
f of x, we have y

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.260
is equal to negative
2x plus-- and then

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.200
the y-intercept is
pretty straightforward.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.960
This is at 3-- 1, 2, 3.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.830
Negative 2x plus 3.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.500
So part of f of x
where clearly it

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.450
equals negative 2 at some point
of that-- this part of f of x

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.890
is defined by this line.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.604
Obviously this part of f of x
is not defined by that line.

00:09:12.604 --> 00:09:14.020
But to figure out
the exact value,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.920
we just have to figure
out when this line is

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.100
equal to negative 2.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:26.620
So we have negative 2x plus
3 is equal to negative 2.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.010
And remember, this isn't--
this is what f of x is equal

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.089
to, over the interval
that we care about.

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.880
If we were talking
about f of x over there,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.879
we wouldn't be able to
put a negative 2x plus 3,

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:37.930
we would have to have some form
of equation for these circles.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.910
But right over here, this is
what f of x is, and now we

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.730
can solve this pretty
straightforwardly.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.470
So we can subtract
3 from both sides,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.750
and we get negative 2x
is equal to negative 5.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.670
Divide both sides
by negative 2, you

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.780
get x is equal to negative
5 over negative 2,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.352
which is equal to 5/2.

00:09:58.352 --> 00:09:59.810
Which is exactly
what we thought it

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.160
was when we looked
at it visually.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
It looked like we were
at about 2 and 1/2, which

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.220
is the same thing as 5/2.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.376
Now we don't know what this is.

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:10.250
We don't know if this
is an inflection point.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.260
Is this a maximum?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.280
Is this a minimum?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.970
So really we just
want to evaluate g

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.686
at this point to see if it gets
higher than when we evaluate g

00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:18.600
at 3.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.140
So let's evaluate g at 5/2.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.030
So g at 5/2 is going
to be equal to 2 times

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:42.020
15/2 plus the integral
from 0 to 5/2 of f of t dt.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.830
So this first part right over
here, the 2's cancel out.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.020
So this is going
to be equal to 5.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.402
And then plus the
integral from 0 to 5/2.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.110
Now, you might be able
to do it visually,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.210
but we know what the value is
of f of t over this interval,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.200
we already figured out
the equation for it

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.740
over this interval.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.780
So it's the integral of
negative 2x plus 3 dt.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.714
And then let's
just evaluate this.

00:11:10.714 --> 00:11:11.880
Let me get some real estate.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.463
So this is-- let me
draw a line here.,

00:11:13.463 --> 00:11:14.550
so we don't get confused.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.390
So this is going to
be equal to 5 plus

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.980
and then I take
the antiderivative.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.653
The antiderivative of negative
2x is negative x squared.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.250
So we have negative x squared.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.020
And the antiderivative of
3 is just going to be 3x.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.830
So plus 3x.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.200
And we're going to
evaluate it from 0 to 5/2.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.060
So this is going to
be equal to 5 plus--

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.450
and I'll do all this
stuff right over here.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.380
I'll do this stuff in green.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.200
So when we evaluate
it at 5/2, this

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.560
is going to be
negative 5/2 squared.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.410
So it's going to be
negative 25 over 4

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.139
plus 3 times 5/2,
which is 15 over 2.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:03.930
And then from that,
we're going to subtract

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.170
this evaluated at 0.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:10.040
But negative 0 squared
plus 3 times 0 is just 0.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.140
So this is what
it simplifies to.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.550
And so what do we
have right over here?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.320
So let's get our ourselves
a common denominator.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.730
Looks like a common denominator
right over here could be 4

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.310
So this is equal to--
5 is the same thing

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:34.220
as 20 over 4 minus 25 over
4 and then plus 30 over 4.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.680
So 20 plus 30 is
50 minus 25 is 25.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.850
So this is equal to 25 over 4.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.270
And 25 over 4 is the
same thing as 6 and 1/4.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.170
So when we evaluate our
function at this critical point,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.540
at this thing where the
slope, or the derivative,

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.600
is equal to 0, we
got 6 and 1/4, which

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.480
is higher than six, which is
what g was at this end point.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.540
And it's definitely higher
than what g was a negative 4.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.940
So the x-coordinate
of the point at which

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.210
g has an absolute maximum,
on the interval negative 4

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:14.433
to three is x is equal to 5/2.
