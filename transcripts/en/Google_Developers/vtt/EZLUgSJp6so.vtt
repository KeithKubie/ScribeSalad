00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:03.133
Daniel: Well.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.700
To talk a little about

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.000
what Juan talked about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.233
I think the best comparison

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:15.233
"is the one between, for example,"
a TV network and a movie studio.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.233
Social games are 
the new TV channels;

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.333
they are the new soap operas.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.367
"So, for example,"

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.767
"you have to change the contents every day,"

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:25.467
every new episode.

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:29.133
"So, you have to be more..."

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:33.667
"you have to change the app, the game."

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:39.767
It's very different from the movie industry
where you do a project for a long time;

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.600
you launch a project and
later don't change it.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
"They both have very large audiences,"

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.433
but you have to change
social games.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:52.067
"The hardest part is after the launch,"
not before.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.600
That's a big difference.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700
He also talked about distribution.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.833
Games have wide distribution.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.367
Monetization is different.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.267
"For example, in traditional games"
you have to use a console.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:08.800
"you have to pay each month,"
something like that.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.367
Social games are free.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:16.067
"Generally, there's a premium model"
that some users will pay.

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:19.867
But day-to-day

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:24.333
rather than long-term.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.567
Eduardo: I want to hear a little bit more
about what you said there

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.233
that keeping up with a game
is more work than launching it.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.567
"What are some of the bigger challenges,"

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.600
as much for getting it online
"in its conception,"

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.967
"as to put it on the air, and then"
to keep it on the air?

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.333
What are the main points
that need attention?

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:41.900
Daneil: Well.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.933
"Eduardo: Let's go from there to here, now."

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:43.900
Daniel: Yes.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.533
"Well, I was talking about"
"distribution,"

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.300
viralization of the game is the most difficult.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.600
"For example, you have to choose "
"a platform that you can distribuite,"

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
[inaudible] is a good example of this.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.000
But to create a game where the users
"are going to share it with friends,"

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.333
knowing the mechanisms that will let
the game be distributed is really important.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.167
Lots of time we [inaudible] the market

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:14.100
"good games, but games that don't "
have the social part well defined.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.633
They don't have the viralization that 
allows millions of gamers to share them.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.167
That's one thing.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:26.867
The second thing that is difficult for 
social games is customizing the content.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.833
One thing that we here at Voso
do a lot is

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.800
"customize the content, not only"

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.233
"well, the mathematics of the game,"

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.933
but also the style of the game

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:42.667
that the users are going to respond
to the needs of users.

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.100
"Social games,"

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.700
you have a lot of information about the
"users, and the information"

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.033
"will change each day, so you have to "
respond to the users' needs.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.267
There's not a lot of time 
to respond.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.300
"If you take too much time,"

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.167
the users will leave for the next game.

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:02.500
So these are the real challenges.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.467
"Beyond this, there's also"
the challenge of monetization;

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:10.100
You have to be really aggressive

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.167
to find the most important ways

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.967
that the user will want
to buy credits within the game.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:20.533
I think that's another important challenge.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:27.767
Bruno: The biggest challenge I see
is the scalability of the app.

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:37.667
We've got a very interesting case
in the soccer apps [...Corintians...]

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:43.733
one week it had close to
"a million fans, added users"

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:46.500
and in a month it was up to 
two million.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
So for something to grow
that quickly

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.000
I think that's a big challenge
for those who aren't used to...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.567
"who want to launch a game,"

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.500
the costs are...

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.733
in how things are going to work inside it.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:02.767
But if it doesn't have a good background
it won't work out.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.767
Juan: A summary of what Daniel
"and Bruno talked about,"

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:12.067
I think that there are
two main goals.

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:17.333
"One is scalability, technically"
different from games...

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.733
social games grow very quickly.

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:22.000
If you have a successful app

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.100
it's going to grow quickly.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.167
The architecture of your game
has to be ready for the growth.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:33.667
An example: we worked on [A colheita feliz]
"a very popular game in Brazil,"

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:40.600
"it went fomr 10,000 users to 20 million"
active users in less than a month.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.067
So it's very difficult to be ready 
for that.

00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:50.967
And a daily goal is the 
server achitecture

00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:52.800
and the game architecture.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.533
"So, when you are thinking "
"about a social game,"

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.133
"of a successful game,"

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.833
from the beginning you have to create
a game architecture

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:03.233
that allows scaling.

00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:08.133
"Not only the physical part, the servers, "
but also the software.

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:11.633
And the other part that Daniel talked
about was the monetization.

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:14.100
Social games are free.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.233
We make money when people
pay for premium content.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:21.100
And for those who pay for
premium content

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.967
you need local content
and content every day.

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:31.300
"So to make a game,"
to develop a game is the first part

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.700
but you need to make new items
every day

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.633
"dogs, balloons, flags"
depending on the game

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:44.867
so that people become involved 
"in the game,"

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:46.967
they spend money on the game.

00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:49.200
"So, I think it's an opportunity"

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.100
there are few barriers to entry

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.600
you can be developing
not only for Brazil

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.367
but for the whole world.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:00.933
But you always have to think about
the scalability of the game.

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:04.733
and the structure to monetize the game.

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:05.833
Eduardo: Cool.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.567
"A few times, Daniel quoted a term"
that's in vogue

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:10.367
and that's viralization.

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.900
And I've seen that all of your apps
some very intelligent strategies

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.900
and very creative strategies about how
to make this viralization work.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.833
Can you talk a little about this

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:21.433
some examples of cases in which

00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:24.733
changing the game suddenly
"it was clearly more viral, it"

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:26.000
the growth changed a lot?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.467
What type of change was the most relevant?

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:34.367
Juan: To make a game
you have...

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:37.033
something important is the social platform.

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:39.567
Social games are in social networks.

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:42.633
And social networks have 
social architectures.

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:47.633
The idea is that you maximize
the social platforms

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:49.033
so that the game goes viral.

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:52.200
This is the first thing
the most basic thing.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.333
"Afterwards, to the degree that the users"

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:59.667
play a series of activities

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:03.900
that you can post 
"on social networks,"

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.000
on Twitter

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.133
Not only on social networks
but there are other social channels.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.967
There are important things
when you have other games

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:15.333
or various games
that you can begin to create

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.067
user engagement

00:07:17.067 --> 00:07:20.667
so that the user begins
to migrate to new games

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:24.367
begins to migrate with his friends
to your new games.

00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:30.400
[inaudible] interesting things 
is the social activity within a game

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.967
so that the game is interesting
and the user has to play

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:36.400
but has to share the game
with his friends;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.133
and has to invite his friends to play.

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:41.133
he has to test his friends;

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.067
to collaborate with his friends.

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:47.233
All of these architectures are what
"make the game more social,"

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.500
more viral or less viral.

00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:52.567
Bruno: In our case...

00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:58.067
we have a very interesting case
that was with the apps [dosul]

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:00.667
We noticed that it got
stretched a little...

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:04.367
after changing Orkut
it allowed

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:08.500
before it allowed up to three open apps
"in profile view, and later"

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.167
"it allowed only one,"

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:12.667
we were feeling down.

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:15.400
We were so upset there in

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.767
[inaudible] showed and all to improve this.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:23.067
"Above all, he spoke about maximizing the use"

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:26.500
"that's what it is, you know, if you "
understood where you're dealing with 

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.900
or what it is that becomes possible

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.333
and use the most you can.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:38.067
I think the best thing to use viralization
are the activities there...

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:43.300
that you follow the user's stream
like it was a Twitter feed.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.900
And we had some interesting work
in that

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.733
to keep up the quantitiy
of additional users and such.

00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:52.533
The apps...

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:54.667
there are apps 
"that aren't games,"

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.700
they have a little different profile
"than the games, right?"

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.733
Games today --

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:02.833
if you were to compare the 
number of addtional users

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:08.033
some apps like [A Minha M˙sica] that
"have 9 million manage to easily reach,"

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:11.667
but uses during the week are
much less than the games.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.767
"So, what we tried to do"
is some work on top of that

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:20.233
to try to even out the ranking
and keep on having

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:24.200
cool work against the games

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.033
Daniel: I think it's also important
"for example, within Orkut,"

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:36.533
to exploit the updates and know that
when a person enters the game

00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:39.833
"the app has to invite his friends,"
"too, to play the game."

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:44.900
"So [inaudible] of the examples,"
"for example, in Mini Fazenda,"

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.667
one of our games

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:52.333
the users can create
"a Halloween mansion, now."

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:55.700
So the users have to ask
their friends for materials

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.767
and collect materials from their friends.

00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:02.767
So they viralize the game
through Orkut's resources.

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.900
"And have a list, collect."

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.333
"In another game, for example, "
"[Crack] or [Boustu] Poker, you have to"

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.600
"to compete,"

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.100
a strong incentive for users
to viralize the game.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.467
So in Espacio Desafio
they're going to talk to their friends

00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:21.800
so that they can win the challenge.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.200
So using the tools that
Orkut gives you...

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.033
"and also avenues like email,"
is very important.

00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:34.533
But each game has to follow
all of these avenues.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.833
And you can really reach the users.

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.367
I think the mechanics are the most important.

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:43.267
If you don't have the mechanisms
"for viralization in all parts of the game,"

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.533
"the app,"

00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:50.667
it's really hard to make the users
come back to the game.

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:52.867
Eduardo: I'm a real-live example of that.

00:10:52.867 --> 00:10:56.467
I have a lot of...
from cousins to friends...

00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:58.733
"that work at Orkut,"
so they go there and [inaudible]

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:01.233
so if they're needing some help 
to finish building the farm. You

00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:02.933
don't spend the whole day
surfing Orkut...

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:04.567
"Help me, man!"

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:06.000
The call to...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.433
social I think is a very interesting
piece of the app.

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:11.000
Let me change topics a bit.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.967
How much work is involved in...

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:16.733
in the creation as well as
in the upkeep of the app?

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:20.967
Both from the perspecitve of the number
"of people, as well as the their profiles?"

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:25.800
I know there are several different kinds
"of people involved, from infrastructure"

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.233
to content creation.

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:29.300
Talk a little more 
about this.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.433
Daniel: Good.

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:32.567
Generally we have studio models.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.667
"So, for example, to create a game"

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:37.267
a 4 or 6 month process

00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:39.333
a good game

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.267
"there are more or less 30, 40 people."

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:46.433
And... well...
"there are testing people,"

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:49.633
"people for art and design, and..."

00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:52.100
"technical, there's Java, Flash"

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.133
building the front end.

00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:57.000
"And, well, that's just to create"
a game.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.900
Once a game is launched

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.733
that same team has to do
the maintenance for the game.

00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:06.633
"So, for example,"
one of our games has

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:10.967
"Mini Fazenda, in assets"
this game alone has

00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:14.233
"20,000 transactions per second."

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.500
At the peak

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.467
"40,000 transactions per second"
in the database layer.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:22.600
So you need an infrastructure team

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.600
a payment team

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.267
"support, complaints..."

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:30.600
they didn't get their tokens...

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.967
or the cow isn't moving...
something like that.

00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:37.800
So that kind of support is a very
important part of the community.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.667
So once the game is launched

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:45.100
you need the same team
"the people won't change,"

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.633
but will grow.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:52.467
So the Mini Fazenda team began with
10 people and now there are almost 50.

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.700
It's a long-range process

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.267
depending on the quality of the game.

00:12:56.267 --> 00:12:59.833
But I think that for apps
you don't need that many people.

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:03.167
But it is important to have a good team

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:08.100
and what we also learned in the process
is that it's important to have

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.233
for example

00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:13.667
testing people close to the
art and design people

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.800
because they have a different perspective

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.433
and one person will add in
a cow to Mini Fazenda

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.600
"and it's wrong, and the design people"
will tell them.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.167
So it's a much faster movement

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:31.100
inside the process of
development when you have

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.667
complementary people working together.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.400
I think that it's also important...

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.133
In case you're thinking about 
"creating an app, a game"

00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:46.833
look for help from people who
complement what you know.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:49.900
Bruno: Great.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.667
What he spoke about 
teams working together...

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:57.333
At [inaudible] we work with
a development team

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.767
"as much with development as layout,"

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:01.833
"planning, more or less horizontal"

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.133
So everyone is in the middle of everything
and we try to involve

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:06.767
the interested parties as much as possible.

00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:09.633
Whoever likes soccer
is on top of everything;

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:12.733
in order to colaborate
as much as possible.

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:15.633
"Now, about the team"

00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:17.100
when we think... have ideas

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.700
say something
[inaudible] everyone gets together

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.400
with everything they think is interesting
"there's planning, design"

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.667
programming;

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:26.833
and they do the planning and everything

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.700
from there there's the art team

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.333
there's a separate programming team
and

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:37.300
and we [inaudible] not the sound
today there aren't more than 6 people

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:43.933
"involved, one person who's in charge of"
soccer and who knows everything.

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:46.967
"And there's upkeep, just like he said."

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:49.167
It's not easy to maintain
because of what

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:53.267
he said about the number
of users and such.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.400
So it's not just that there's one layer

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.667
it's not like simple programming
you have to be

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:58.933
everything has to be optimized.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:01.833
You're not going to make direct requests
to the database all the time;

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:02.967
"you're going to use the same cache,"

00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:04.767
"you're going to use recalls,"

00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:07.267
you're going to use a lot of technology

00:15:07.267 --> 00:15:11.933
so you don't go to the database because
of its size and increase the delay

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:14.333
reduce the delay due to

00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:15.667
requests and everything.

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:19.167
The people keep on eating it up.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:26.000
Juan: I think the main challenge
of this market is time-to-market.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.833
It's a fast-paced market.

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:30.467
And if you don't get things
to market quickly

00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:31.667
get to market first

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:34.233
second to market
you're out of the market...

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.033
in the gaming field.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:40.433
"People, the users arent' going to play"
the third Fazenda.

00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:41.333
"They played A Colheita,"

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:42.367
they played another

00:15:42.367 --> 00:15:43.133
they're not going to play any more

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:44.900
they're going to look for a new game.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.967
So time-to-market is very important.

00:15:48.967 --> 00:15:51.633
Another thing is what Daniel talked about

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:55.600
It's complex to make
an successful social game.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.533
and each day it's more complex
because the users

00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:03.467
we and other developers
are educating the user

00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:06.200
and producing games that are
more complex every day.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.467
"So, for you to be successful"

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.700
you have to go to the next level.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.700
"So, there's an interesting opportunity"
that we create.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.500
We are not the developer.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.967
We're the publisher.

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:22.200
"So, we work with developers"
like you

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.867
"in Brazil, in China, in California"

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:29.767
and we facilitate 
your development.

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:32.067
"But, like us, there are people"
who are publishers

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:35.000
"in Russia, in China, in the U.S."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.467
"So it's an interesting market, yes."

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:40.533
"It's a market with a lot of challenges, yes."

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.967
"It's a fast-paced market, yes."

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:44.000
The product cycle

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.867
"product life cycles are short, yes."

00:16:46.867 --> 00:16:48.700
but there's an opportunity.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.567
So I think you should begin to look for

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:55.767
ways to leverage your development
[eskids]

00:16:55.767 --> 00:16:58.767
to have an impact on the Brazillian
market and outside of Brazil.

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:02.800
I think it's a good opportunity for you.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.900
Eduardo: Cool.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.533
"Daniel, I mentioned the strategy  "
for monetization a little bit.

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:08.333
I don't know if you're clear about 
this term.

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.433
I have the impression that it's a very
Google term.

00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:13.233
Monetization is how
you make money.

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.167
So I wanted you to talk a little
about this.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.100
How can you make money
doing what we like to do

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.500
developing cool apps?

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.567
Because the simple use by the user

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:23.800
"the numbers are cool, they've surpassed"

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.500
"a million people, suddenly"

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.233
a lot of costs are generated.

00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:32.467
It's important that you have opportunites
to convert them into receipts.

00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:33.500
I wanted to hear a little from you

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.100
as much about the ideas that worked
"and, including"

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.567
the ideas that you
may have tried

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:40.533
but may not have been 
well executed.

00:17:40.533 --> 00:17:43.100
Juan: Monetization is very important.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.767
"If we, if you don't make money"

00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:47.333
you aren't going to be able to continue
in this market

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:52.267
you're not going to be able to invest and
create interesting studios in the future.

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:55.400
So monetization is very important.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.167
Monetization of these games has changed
a lot and is evolving a lot.

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:03.433
"In the beginning, the people with"
monetziation [inaudible] 

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:06.167
after monetization campaigns with [inaudible]

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:10.700
and now we are in microtransactions
(microtransactions)

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.433
And when you release premium content
to the user

00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:17.700
"the user wants a red dog,"

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.133
they buy a red dog.

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:24.967
I think there are two things important
for monetization.

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:30.467
"Content every day, interesting content"
relevant to the user

00:18:30.467 --> 00:18:33.100
and content every day

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.000
I think being smart about the business.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.867
Measurement is very important.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.733
You have to measure each second.

00:18:41.733 --> 00:18:44.833
"If you release new content,"

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:50.333
within the next 20-30 minutes
you have to evaluate the impact

00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:52.900
of that new content based on the users.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.267
Because this is a fast-paced market
it's day-to-day.

00:18:56.267 --> 00:19:01.067
So measuring user behavior

00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:06.000
on top of the monetization related
to the content you're developing

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.467
is very interesting and important.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.933
Bruno: With monetization strategy

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:18.567
we have not yet used this

00:19:18.567 --> 00:19:21.100
something like Jambool
that type of monetization.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.533
Our monetization
for now is [Banner].

00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:28.133
But I see out there
"that could work, for example,"

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:32.300
today there's a lot in little games [Cash]

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.967
that you pay through PayPal
[mobile] you make a little money.

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:42.600
"And I, then, there's a game that"
"isn't part of my case,"

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.033
"for example, a great case"
is the one of [Bis]

00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:49.733
[Bis] made the app.

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:53.267
So what happens is

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:56.067
we have
we were talking about

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:58.867
it's a good business that 
"let's us put something, for example,"

00:19:58.867 --> 00:20:02.133
"into a social game,"
"for example, in Colheita Feliz,"

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:05.333
you can buy two things
two types of things...

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.167
one functional item you can use
something different

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:11.933
you'll get an experience
or something like that

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:14.833
or some kind of decoration
you can put on.

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:19.333
And where I see potential
for apps expression in general

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:21.267
"like soccer, for example,"

00:20:21.267 --> 00:20:24.833
somebody could be paying
to have a different wallet

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.100
or something like that.

00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:29.133
Daniel: Good.

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.933
I think it's interesting
what Bruno said

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:33.300
about payment options.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.533
I think that for games
for social games

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:39.300
you have to give the users
a lot of payment options.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:49.133
"In our games, we take"
"cash, SMS, PayPal, credit card."

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:54.367
You can go to a LandHouse and pay for
a range of payment methods.

00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:57.033
"This is really important in this market,"

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:59.367
particularly because a lot of users
are young;

00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:01.433
they don't have credit cards.

00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:04.967
So to be able to monetize
you need to give options.

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:08.400
That's one part of monetization.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.467
Another part is what Juan talked a little
about: data mining.

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:16.567
So for example when we launched
a juice machine on CafÈ Mania

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.733
we do tests

00:21:17.733 --> 00:21:22.467
we check the launch at midnight
and we make tests with 3 prices.

00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.800
"5% of the users get one price,"

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.400
"5% another price,"
and 5% another price.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.333
The price that gets the best...

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:34.200
the largest demand is launched
to the rest of the users.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.667
And for the rest it was discounted.

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:39.167
So the idea of making tests
with social games

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:43.733
to better understand monetization
is really important to users.

00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:46.533
So you have to 
"give payment options,"

00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:51.000
and at the same time know
what prices users can pay

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.767
And that way raise the percentage
of the users who pay

00:21:55.767 --> 00:22:00.600
and also raise how much
each user pays.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.900
Those are two ways to think about
monetization.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.300
Eduardo: Really cool.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.533
"In short, I want to open up so that "
you can also ask questions.

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.600
I don't want to monopolize the microphone.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.667
"Before that, I'd like to"
ask just one question...

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.033
What do you see as 
the future of this market?

00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.000
Want are the next steps?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.800
Where is the market going

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.800
"not only for apps,"
but also for social games?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.767
Daniel: Well.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:26.433
The market begins

00:22:26.433 --> 00:22:30.033
I think we still have a lot to do
in the market.

00:22:30.033 --> 00:22:31.500
The market will grow a lot.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.267
"For example, in the most developed"
"market, in my opinion, Japan,"

00:22:37.267 --> 00:22:39.033
"all social gaming,"

00:22:39.033 --> 00:22:40.300
"all mobile,"

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.900
they've got the fever for social games.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.433
I think that's more or less what
will happen in the future.

00:22:49.433 --> 00:22:51.433
"I don't know if it'll be mobile in Brazil,"

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:52.833
"or if it will be other platforms,"

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:56.667
but it's really important to consider
multiplatforms.

00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:59.433
"Android, really interesting..."

00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:02.867
Orkut will continue to grow and be important...

00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:06.600
to follow the users
wherever they are now.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.767
"And also consider other games,"
"other types of games,"

00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:13.500
other ways users interact.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.900
So I think this is just the beginning.

00:23:17.967 --> 00:23:22.400
Bruno: I think the future is also in the
decentralization of the social network itself.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.267
A guy consumes...

00:23:23.267 --> 00:23:24.767
comes to consume the same game

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:27.867
that he consumes with the same
data on the social network.

00:23:27.867 --> 00:23:32.533
"on mobile, or on whatever network."

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:34.300
I think that's it.

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:38.200
Juan: I agree a lot 
with what they said.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.033
It's difficult.

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:41.100
The market is growing.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.833
I think it's a big opportunity.

00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:44.800
It'll keep on growing.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.333
I also think the future is
in multiplatform integration.

00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:52.600
Not only multiplatforms
"for social networks,"

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.367
but multiplatforms for mobile
or outside social [inaudible] 

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:03.233
But the idea is that the user experience
"if it's on Orkut,"

00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:06.433
or if on mobile
or on Facebook

00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:08.500
and he's playing the same game

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.633
that the user experience be the same
and the information be the same;

00:24:12.633 --> 00:24:17.333
that all the user's activity
on Orkut when he plays mobile

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:18.800
has activity there.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.533
And that all the actions that he makes
with mobile will be affected

00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:26.467
on Orkut or in other social [countries].

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:29.133
"So I think it's a big opportunity,"

00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:35.033
but in the future it's more about
"games that are increasingly complex,"

00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:39.433
and multiplatform integration.

00:24:39.433 --> 00:24:40.233
Eduardo: Cool.

00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:41.533
I want to switch to your side now.

00:24:41.533 --> 00:24:44.233
There are two microphones in the back
if you could turn on the lights.

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.233
Thank you.

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:46.767
So anyone who wants
"to ask a question,"

00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:48.967
please raise your hand.

00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:58.033
"Sorry, please introduce yourself"
before asking your question.

00:24:58.033 --> 00:24:59.000
&gt;&gt; My name is Eliane.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.133
I'm the project director for a 
digital agency called [redPepper].

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:07.500
One thing that worries us a lot when
we go to develop something...

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.267
[even] more is that the access speed
"is so high,"

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:12.800
the number of users...

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.867
how are you going to deal with
"for example, with a data center,"

00:25:15.867 --> 00:25:17.333
"where do you begin,"

00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:19.467
"""Look, we're thinking about"
"making a game,"""

00:25:19.467 --> 00:25:22.533
and suddenly you have
20 million accessing the game.

00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:24.467
"That's something I'd like to know,"

00:25:24.467 --> 00:25:26.467
how do you handle that matter?

00:25:26.467 --> 00:25:27.733
The subject of infrastructure.

00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:28.933
How do you...

00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:30.833
how do businesses
negotiate some of this?

00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:33.433
Because what happens a lot is that
you start to be successful

00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:36.133
and then you get a much higher
charge that you have to pay.

00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:39.433
Much larger than you ever planned.

00:25:39.433 --> 00:25:42.367
Juan: Bruno...

00:25:42.367 --> 00:25:46.900
"Burno: In our case, specifically [Sutsol]"
we've partnered with Terra

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.267
so we have 10 desktops
at the telephone data center

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:54.100
that we can use
the way we best understand.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.600
So we have a good option
that we saw there today

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.233
so that you can make the web engine
or some scale change by yourself

00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:07.733
to make it easier to take care of the
growth without a lot of trouble

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:08.567
I imagine.

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:11.067
&gt;&gt; And was that good for you?
Did it work out?

00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:13.033
Was it ever a lot of trouble?
I mean...

00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:16.300
Weren't you charged extra because
of the fact you were there?

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.867
Bruno: We were.

00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:18.633
From the beginning.

00:26:18.633 --> 00:26:20.933
But then it's a question of optimization.

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:22.800
We managed to keep...

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.500
"When we launched A Minha M˙sica,"
"as much as the soccer apps,"

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.133
we didn't expect 
to score a goal.

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.967
"And so, we didn't really have to..."

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.033
we didn't expect it to turn out
one way or the other.

00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:38.533
So this planning is tough work 

00:26:38.533 --> 00:26:40.200
"structuring the database,"

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.367
dealing with requests
is getting less.

00:26:43.367 --> 00:26:47.167
"And as a result, today we use"
"a lot less access,"

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:48.633
we use less...

00:26:48.633 --> 00:26:52.567
fewer resources than we did
at the time of the launch.

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:56.033
&gt;&gt; It was very fast...
Thanks.

00:26:56.033 --> 00:26:58.333
Eduardo: Anyone else?

00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:06.900
Hi. I'm Daniel.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.533
I'm the technology manager at CIT.

00:27:09.533 --> 00:27:12.800
[inaudible] add to the last question a bit.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.500
I want to know if you have ever seriously
evaluated some of the cloud structures

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.500
that are available today on the market
for you to be able to migrate...

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.500
or be interested in migrating...

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.933
the current processing structure
from your server side 

00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:29.167
to one of the cloud architectures
"available on the market, like"

00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:32.733
"for example, App Engine."

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:35.800
"Bruno: In my case, no,"
because we have a partnership;

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:41.300
so we don't pay for transfers
"and such, it's for free."

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.867
So we don't have to worry
about that kind of thing.

00:27:44.867 --> 00:27:46.333
"Daniel: Well, OK."

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.033
"Today for example,"

00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:52.767
we manage about
a petabyte of data each month.

00:27:52.767 --> 00:27:55.767
Two months ago it was a third of that.

00:27:55.767 --> 00:28:01.500
"So with that kind of growth, what we"
"try to do with new games,"

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.733
"and I think it's a good idea for you,"
is to start with Amazon.

00:28:05.733 --> 00:28:11.967
I think Amazon is a good option for a
game whose growth you don't know.

00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:16.667
What we do next is once traffic
"is stabilized in a game,"

00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:19.067
"a month after being launched,"

00:28:19.067 --> 00:28:22.100
we change or make a transfer
to our data center.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.567
We have a data center.

00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:28.933
So I [am] in the United States
but I think that

00:28:28.933 --> 00:28:32.533
this system is good for us.

00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:36.833
Amazon helps with scaling
"so that, OK,"

00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:42.467
in the beginning we don't know if the game
"will have 10 million users in the 1st month,"

00:28:42.467 --> 00:28:44.933
or 15 million in the first month...

00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:48.633
It's possible to add
more and more support later

00:28:48.633 --> 00:28:51.433
once the traffic is stable
you can move to the data center

00:28:51.433 --> 00:28:56.200
or look for more economical options.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.600
Juan: We also work with Amazon.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.433
We have data centers with work with.

00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:06.467
The virtual cloud computing part
with Amazon

00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:09.933
And the physical servers with...

00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:12.367
with another...

00:29:12.367 --> 00:29:15.167
with another data center in the U.S.

00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:17.467
And we use a similar approach.

00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:20.367
Initially we always struggled with Amazon

00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:23.167
Amazon's scalability is very good

00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:26.800
and the cost of the partnership
we have with them is...

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.400
isn't very high.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.567
The cost in the U.S. is 
a lot less than in Brazil;

00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:34.400
data centers in Brazil
are still very expensive.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.633
We all work with them there.

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:44.267
"And when a game needs, and the"
"virtual part requires, more capacity"

00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:48.967
we move things to a data center
where we have physical servers.

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:51.200
But I think that the scalability

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.767
is not only based on the
data center and hardware.

00:29:55.767 --> 00:30:01.067
Scalability is very important in the
software and architecture of the game.

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:02.667
So don't ever forget that.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:04.833
"When you need to scale up,"

00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:08.633
if the architecture isn't ready

00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:12.533
the problem can't be resolved
by physical means.

00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:16.300
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Welington.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.000
"I'm the media director, Orkut digital agency."

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.367
I want to know if...
this idea of viralization of the game.

00:30:22.367 --> 00:30:25.633
When you have some
users within a social game

00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:28.100
the actual mechanics like you talked about

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.833
facilitate the viralization and people play
for the social dynamics themselves.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:38.400
I want to know if you have any strategies
to make that begin to happen.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.467
The first users.

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:42.467
Because nobody plays
a social game alone.

00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:45.400
"So, how do you make the first users"
begin to hand over the game

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.767
to their friends and then
the thing grows exponentially.

00:30:49.767 --> 00:30:52.033
and the game starts with [inaudible]

00:30:52.033 --> 00:30:54.167
How do you attract the first users?

00:30:54.167 --> 00:30:57.467
How do you start it?

00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:58.167
Daniel: Well.

00:30:58.167 --> 00:31:01.367
Speaking a little about
what I said earlier.

00:31:01.367 --> 00:31:04.067
When users come into the game
"for the first time,"

00:31:04.067 --> 00:31:06.067
it's important for them to know 

00:31:06.067 --> 00:31:08.533
that inviting their friends
is important to the game.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:11.633
The game experience will be better
if you invite your friends.

00:31:11.633 --> 00:31:12.467
"So, for example,"

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:18.067
in the first session of our games
users invite their friends

00:31:18.067 --> 00:31:20.333
and get a bonus if they do that.

00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:23.300
"For example,"
"there are updates within Orkut,"

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.233
"so if you do something,"

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:27.467
"an activitiy in the game,"

00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:29.367
it will launch the update.

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:32.333
So their friends will know
that you are playing that game.

00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:35.167
But I think it's important that
in the first experience with the game

00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:38.667
for the users not to depend a lot
"on the social part,"

00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:42.000
give a lot of interaction so that
they come to know the game a little

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.367
and there's a good tutorial and so on.

00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:46.133
"Later, he'll invite others."

00:31:46.133 --> 00:31:49.567
"At Orkut, for example,"
"in the first games,"

00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:53.500
the Orkut communities were
fantastic in inviting friends.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.033
"Users came to the community,"

00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:57.433
talked about the game.

00:31:57.433 --> 00:32:01.133
Later there were thousands 
of players joining the game.

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:04.433
So I think that if you do the...

00:32:04.433 --> 00:32:07.733
"the initial user experience is important,"

00:32:07.733 --> 00:32:11.733
to have all of that...
those viralization mechanisms

00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:15.300
you'll have people joining the game.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.367
Juan: You Brazilians

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:19.733
are the most social people 
in the whole world.

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:23.200
So becoming viral in Brazil
isn't a challenge.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.833
I think the most important thing at the
"beginning is to build up the game,"

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:28.167
offer good content.

00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:29.167
We...

00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:32.067
since we have games with a lot of traffic

00:32:32.067 --> 00:32:34.300
we do cross-promotion campaigns.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.733
We all do the same thing.

00:32:35.733 --> 00:32:38.267
"When we launch a new game,"

00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:41.133
we advertise the games on current games.

00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:45.767
That makes it so that the new game
grows quickly.

00:32:45.767 --> 00:32:48.933
"And after the quality of the game,"

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:50.933
"the social features,"

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:53.833
"you Brazilians, social people,"

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:56.233
"that like to talk with your friends,"

00:32:56.233 --> 00:32:58.367
"compete with your friends,"

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:00.500
only that way will your game grow.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.033
"But the main part,"
"initially, we work with cross promotion."

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.333
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Paulo Camara.

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:13.067
"I work at CIT, too"
on the mobile network.

00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:15.833
I want to explore the topic
that you talked about quickly

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:19.167
that's the situation of businesses
"using games,"

00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:20.567
"for example, your games,"

00:33:20.567 --> 00:33:24.100
as a way of reaching the consumer

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.467
[inaudible] the case of [Bees]

00:33:26.467 --> 00:33:29.267
"uh, [Panner] is an obvious example,"

00:33:29.267 --> 00:33:31.467
"but along the lines of [Bees], really, "

00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:33.833
that used the dynamics of the game

00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:36.633
to get a message
to reach the public.

00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:39.133
Have you seen this grow?

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:41.900
Is this becoming more common?

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.633
Juan: Yes.

00:33:42.633 --> 00:33:46.300
I'll talk first about my first time
which was with Colheita.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.067
I'll explain the campaign a little.

00:33:49.067 --> 00:33:51.533
We work with
digital agencies in Brazil.

00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:55.800
We work with [Krafts] and
they wanted to reach the public.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.933
and engage the public
in a different way.

00:33:59.933 --> 00:34:02.767
"The game was very popular,"
is very popular.

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:07.167
So they wanted to begin communicating
with the public in a different way.

00:34:07.167 --> 00:34:10.767
"But in.. with an ad, or with..."

00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:11.967
"positioning the brand,"

00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:17.200
but give the user an opportunity
"to interact with the brand,"

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.100
with the product
as part of the game.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:25.433
I think that more than 5 million
people on the first day

00:34:25.433 --> 00:34:29.167
grabbed MiniBees cement.

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.033
It was a very successful campaign.

00:34:31.033 --> 00:34:34.133
viral [inaudible] over all channels.

00:34:34.133 --> 00:34:37.833
So I think that the future
integration with brands

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:43.100
is more about the brand or
product interacting with the user

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.133
in a fun and different way.

00:34:46.133 --> 00:34:50.067
We are working with
all digital agencies in Brazil.

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:54.433
Brands are starting to understand
the importance of

00:34:54.433 --> 00:35:00.367
and the opportunity of being able to
interact with users in a different way.

00:35:00.367 --> 00:35:03.767
So I think this is a 
very interesting opportunity.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.567
Eduardo: Let me offer that 
there are two other examples

00:35:06.567 --> 00:35:08.200
that are good for this.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.200
One was the campaign
for the city of Belo Horizonte.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.800
"Today, the whole app was conceived as a"
way to spread the word to prevent dengue 

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.467
So the dynamics of the game were that
you do things to prevent dengue

00:35:19.467 --> 00:35:20.900
"get rid of standing water, and such."

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.900
And this message was fun enough
to be an app in itself.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:30.867
"In my opinion, it more strongly"
reinforces the union of the two things.

00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:32.633
There's another app that I think
that they made really...

00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:37.433
"they're not here, and that's [BaileyPolk]"
where the virtual good that [BaileyPolk] has.

00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:39.867
So the association with the brand
is very strong.

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:43.633
A characterstic of the game 
might be...

00:35:43.633 --> 00:35:45.467
it's a combination of game and app.

00:35:45.467 --> 00:35:50.133
"But I can buy a t-shirt, and whoever makes"
the t-shirt wants to put it on me.

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:53.200
The t-shirt can be for a soccer club
or for specific actions.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.100
There was an action to imitate [inaudible] a
little before the premier of the movie.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.000
"It went pretty well, too."

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.633
I think the union of virtual goods
can represent real goods a little.

00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:09.533
Sold by a brand that has 
a strong potential there.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.467
&gt;&gt; My name is Eduardo.

00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:16.167
I work with [Feelings] on games.

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:19.200
I wanted to produce things for Orkut.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:26.167
I never saw a way to get different [inaudible] 
because it has an API

00:36:26.167 --> 00:36:27.900
that has access to
a very large database.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.067
How is it that you began to find
these things for Orkut that I...

00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:34.967
that we almost... never saw.

00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:35.567
Eduardo: Sorry.

00:36:35.567 --> 00:36:37.033
What are those things?
The developers?

00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:39.500
The apps? or the API?
The resources?

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.733
&gt;&gt; The API itself.

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:43.867
There's a more...

00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:45.533
more specialized database.

00:36:45.533 --> 00:36:47.633
It gives a much bigger structure.

00:36:47.633 --> 00:36:48.200
Eduardo: Cool.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.667
Cool.

00:36:48.667 --> 00:36:50.500
Let me answer that.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.300
"First, we recognize that"
"social network markets, both from"

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.067
the perspective of apps as from
"the infrastructure, is very dynamic;"

00:36:56.067 --> 00:36:57.567
it's growing very fast.

00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:59.833
Today the main resources that we have are

00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:02.700
the OpenSource apps or
the best way to get there is 

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.667
from the menu at Orkut.

00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:05.567
There's a link for developers.

00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:09.867
There you can see the main
developer resources: API

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:13.400
"OpenSource, [inaudible] examples of apps"
[inaudible] tutorials.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.133
Another part is what we
the Client Library

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:19.400
that's an API that you can call up
without being an app directly.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.167
"So, for example, "
you can develop a...

00:37:22.167 --> 00:37:25.633
a client that will access Orkut
"on a Java phone,"

00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:28.667
or you can get your site
to send an activity to Orkut

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:30.600
or recover [inaudible] friends.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.833
There's a whole lot of other new things
"we want to release soon,"

00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:37.267
we understand that this is a market
where contact with developers

00:37:37.267 --> 00:37:38.867
is what makes the social network
have more value.

00:37:38.867 --> 00:37:43.267
So we really understand its value;
we want to move faster and faster.

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:49.533
&gt;&gt; Along the same lines I have
another question.

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:52.633
I think it was that developer who
"tried to work with Orkut,"

00:37:52.633 --> 00:37:54.700
he hit on the question of the API.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.067
Orkut's API is confusing
to work with.

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:02.433
I want to know if you have any
advance notice about the next release

00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:07.167
and if you already have something
planned that you expect to facilitate.

00:38:07.167 --> 00:38:11.567
so I can get into a community
to make an app

00:38:11.567 --> 00:38:14.700
that I want my public to [inaudible] 
like in that community.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.600
I can do what I do on Facebook;

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.367
make a request and search for
those users who offer PayPal

00:38:20.367 --> 00:38:23.533
or an app for them.

00:38:24.533 --> 00:38:25.300
Eduardo: Great.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.100
"Unfortunately, Google doesn't comment"
in any way before a release.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:34.600
So it's our policy to avoid building up
expectations and then disappointing you.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.167
The most I can say here
is the we understand that there's 

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:38.033
still a long way to go

00:38:38.033 --> 00:38:40.533
that we can work harder 
than we're working.

00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:42.600
And we'er providing resources
so that will happen.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600
So there's new things to come

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.667
I just can't make any specific promises.

00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:48.733
Unfortunately. I understand that 
you want a date.

00:38:48.733 --> 00:38:51.733
This is the kind of thing 
we can't answer directly.

00:38:51.733 --> 00:38:53.000
What I can guarantee is that
we're working intensely

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.200
so that that will happen.

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.633
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible].

00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:01.567
I'm [inaudible] developer... 
... for [MultiConnect].

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:02.667
Here's my question:

00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:05.567
Today there are lots of games like 
World of Warcraft

00:39:05.567 --> 00:39:12.800
that have specific items and that
there's a market outside of the game.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:19.667
Does that outside market exist
"for MiniFazenda, too?"

00:39:22.267 --> 00:39:25.333
Daniel: I think so.
I think... Well.

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:28.733
There's a lot of interest in 
"that type of game, too."

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:32.067
But [Havidavi] like I said

00:39:32.067 --> 00:39:37.833
MiniFazenda and that kind of farm
game to attract a lot of users

00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.200
different types of users.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.633
"For example, parents, children,"

00:39:42.633 --> 00:39:46.167
the whole family plays this type of game.

00:39:46.167 --> 00:39:49.600
"Warcraft, that type of game, is "
more niche.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.533
There are a lot of users 
"interested in playing,"

00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:57.500
but I think theres a possibility for them
in the social gaming market.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.567
But now you have to simplify
the game a little

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:06.600
"this kind of game, to get to the"
level of being a social good.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.733
"And now, in the market we see"
more and more games like this.

00:40:10.733 --> 00:40:15.000
"Civilizations, pared down for the "
"more social market,"

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.433
something simpler to...

00:40:16.433 --> 00:40:22.067
users only want to play a few
"minutes, not hours, each day."

00:40:22.067 --> 00:40:24.767
I think that in the future we'll see
more and more games like this.

00:40:24.767 --> 00:40:28.967
I think that now in social gaming
we see the end of the era of...

00:40:28.967 --> 00:40:32.100
OK... really big games.
"general ones, for everyone."

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.367
Now we have the opportunity for games
addressing more specific interests.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:41.467
"For example, Poker, or for example,"
[Betspa] only for children. Yes.

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:45.167
I think that in this category
there's also the possibility for users

00:40:45.167 --> 00:40:48.567
who play a lot of games like
Warcraft. That type.

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:55.367
Juan: I think that... games like
World of Warcraft

00:40:55.367 --> 00:40:59.967
that kind of game is drawing
audiences with another architecture;

00:40:59.967 --> 00:41:04.867
but those developers I'm seeing that
those developers are making

00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:07.100
simpler games for social countries.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.733
"So you'll be seeing that the games,"

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:12.800
the webgame are going to
social networks.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.733
And there are also games
on social networks

00:41:15.733 --> 00:41:18.600
"that won't only be on social networks,"

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.500
but will be outside of the bigger
social network.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.333
So I think the two worlds
are starting to converge.

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:29.033
I think in the future there will be
a platform in which

00:41:29.033 --> 00:41:33.300
games can work
in or out of social networks.

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:35.800
Eduardo: I just got a yellow card here.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.467
So I think that this will have to be
our last question.

00:41:39.467 --> 00:41:41.867
&gt;&gt; I'm Eduardo.
I'm the director of [Silks].

00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:44.100
It's a game producer.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.767
We basically work with
[adware] games.

00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:53.467
I want to know if Google has any
"policy about brands, games,"

00:41:53.467 --> 00:42:00.800
or games associated with brands
that affects [what happens with] Orkut.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.133
Eduardo: Let me answer that directly.

00:42:03.133 --> 00:42:05.500
We have some policies...

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.933
we are pretty specific:

00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:11.633
nothing that is illegal in a country
where the game will operate.

00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:14.833
"And each country, literally, "
has its own laws.

00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:16.200
In some countries...

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.400
"guns might be prohibited,"

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.833
or hate speech; 
there are lots of different laws.

00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:26.067
and Google has to avoid all of that.

00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:29.567
"But there's not much more than that,"
"the idea of the app,"

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:32.467
beyond some few things
like in... focused on...

00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:35.667
"the [SonhaLuz] app, but without"
"user interaction,"

00:42:35.667 --> 00:42:37.400
you can't sell the steps of an app

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.533
there are very few [interventions]
we make.

00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:42.233
And they aren't all available in
the service agreement of the app.

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:43.467
but there are few things beyond

00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:45.733
what I've said that are relevant

00:42:45.733 --> 00:42:47.833
that you have to agree to.

00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:48.833
Everyone.
I think that's all.

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:50.767
I want to thank everyone
for their participation.

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:52.933
I think it was really valuable.
I liked a lot of what I heard.

00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:54.500
"I hope that you also enjoyed everything,"

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.967
and that you enjoy the rest of
the event. Thank you.
00:42:56.967,00:00:00.000
