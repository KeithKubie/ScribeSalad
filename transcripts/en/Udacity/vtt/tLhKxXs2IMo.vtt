00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; I think when people are choosing
between growth or monetization.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.520
They think that decision applies
to every single kind of company.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.740
And I think for

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.580
some companies it makes sense that
you're going to pursue growth.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.410
And I think the way you're thinking
about growth is in terms of people who

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.210
decide to hold off on
monetization until later.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.420
And usually that means that you have
to build some other kind of asset,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.200
that allows you to sell.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.250
So, for example, social networks
are the easiest one, right?

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.529
The thing you ultimately the way you're
going to monetize that is your audience

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.260
or your user base and that
information that you have from there.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650
And the only way you're going to get
that is if you have a large amount of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.620
information.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.705
And so you focus on growth in
regards to getting people and

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.040
getting people engaged and
what have you.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.980
And then the monetization will
happen because you finally have

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.210
product market fit where advertisers
say, this is enough information or

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.480
data, this is enough audience that
we're willing to pay for this.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.510
Most B2B companies or enterprise
companies, you don't think like that.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.328
It's actually far more straightforward.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:58.660
It's a one-to-one relationship.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.930
I'm making something,
I'm making a service.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.200
And on whatever parameters that you
think your paid upgrade trigger is,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.190
whether it's convenience or
it helps you make more money or

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.782
it saves you on time or energy or
people or cost savings.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:17.310
That one-to-one relationship is a lot
more straightforward and you can say oh,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070
that obviously it makes sense.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.910
It's this for that.
