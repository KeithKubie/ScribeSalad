00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:01.813
- [Voiceover] For as long as human

00:00:01.813 --> 00:00:03.693
beings have been around we've

00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:06.003
been counting things, and we've been

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.038
looking for ways to keep track and

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:10.813
represent those things that we counted.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.547
So, for example if you were

00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:14.519
an early human and you were

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.046
trying to keep track of the days

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:17.486
since it last rained you might say

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:20.096
okay let's see it didn't rain today so

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:24.846
one day has gone by, and we now use

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:26.055
the word one, but they might have

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:27.353
not used it back then.

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:29.171
Now another day goes by.

00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:30.861
Then another day goes by.

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:32.635
Then another day goes by.

00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:34.378
Another day goes by.

00:00:34.727 --> 00:00:36.153
Another day goes by.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.276
Another day goes by, then it rained.

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.271
And so when his friend comes

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.296
he says, "Well, how long has it been

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:42.603
since we last rained."

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:45.039
Well you would say, "Well, this is how

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.183
many days it's been."

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:47.326
And your friend would say, "Okay,

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.219
I think I have a general sense of that."

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.555
And at some point they probably

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.040
realized that it's useful to have names

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.962
for these.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.679
So they would call this one, two, three,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709
four, five, six, seven.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.023
Obviously every language in the world

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:00.418
has different names for these.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:01.453
I'm sure there are lost languages

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:03.437
that had other names for them.

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.375
But very quickly you start to

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.246
realize that this is a pretty bulky

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:10.022
way of representing numbers.

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.516
One it takes a long time to write down.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.666
It takes up a lot of space,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:16.336
and then later if someone wants to

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:17.977
read the number they have to sit here

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:18.798
and count.

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:20.587
It's hard enough with seven,

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:21.675
but you could imagine if there were

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:24.932
what we call 27 of it, or 1000 of it.

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:26.959
Then it would take up, possibly, a whole

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.731
page and even when you counted

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:29.968
you might make a mistake.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.944
And to solve this human beings

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:34.935
have invented number systems.

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:37.785
And it's something that
we take for granted.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.261
You might say, "Oh, isn't that just the

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.392
way you've always counted?

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.228
But hopefully over the course

00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:42.787
of this video you'll start to appreciate

00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:44.516
the beauty of a number system

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.363
and to realize our number system isn't

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:49.186
the only number system that is around.

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:51.027
The number system that most

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:54.024
of us are familiar with is the base 10

00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:55.008
number system.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.776
Often called the decimal, the decimal

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:58.725
number system.

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:00.865
And why 10?

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:03.833
Well probably because we have 10 fingers.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.670
Or most of us have 10 fingers.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.944
So, it was very natural to think

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:11.930
in terms of bundles of 10 or to have 10

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.787
symbols.

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:13.944
So however many bundles you have

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:16.340
you can use your fingers and eventually

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.834
your symbols to think
about how many there are.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:20.769
And since we needed 10 symbols

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.452
we came up with zero,
one, two, three, four,

00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:29.750
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.927
These 10 digits, these are our 10 symbols

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:34.482
that we use in the base 10 system.

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:36.609
To just give us a little bit of a reminder

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.609
how we use them imagine the number 231.

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:48.426
So, 231. 231.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:52.673
What does this represent?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.926
Well, what's neat about number systems

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:56.611
is we have place value.

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.943
This place all the way to the right,

00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:00.463
this is the ones place.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:02.335
This is the ones place.

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:03.952
This literally means one, one.

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:05.295
One bundle of one.

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:07.947
So, this is one, one right over here.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.882
This right over here,
this is in the 10s place.

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.050
This is in the 10s place.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:17.435
This three here,
literally means three 10s.

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.472
So this literally means three 10s.

00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.222
And this two here, this two here is in

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:25.323
the 100s place.

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:27.296
It's in the 100s place.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:32.686
So, this represent two 100s.

00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:36.447
You add them together and once again

00:03:36.447 --> 00:03:38.202
I'm still thinking in base 10, you'd

00:03:38.202 --> 00:03:39.698
get 231.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:44.766
This is two 100s plus three 10s plus one.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.681
In our base 10 system notice every

00:03:49.681 --> 00:03:52.117
time we move to the left we're thinking

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:54.569
in bundles of 10 of the space

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.472
to the right.

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:57.828
So, this is the ones place.

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:00.951
You multiply by 10, you
go to the 10s place.

00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:04.114
You want to go to the next place

00:04:04.114 --> 00:04:05.656
you multiply by 10 again.

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.653
You get the 100s place.

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:09.814
If you're familiar with exponents,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.053
one is the same thing
as 10 to the zero power.

00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:18.384
10 is the same thing as
10 to the first power.

00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:22.304
So this is the 10s place. Three tens.

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:24.829
And 100 is the same thing as 10

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.948
to the second power.

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:28.680
Obviously we could keep going on and on

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.696
and on and on and on.

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:31.915
That is the power of the base 10 system.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.272
So, you might be curious now.

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:36.387
"Well, what if this wasn't 10 here?

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.372
What if we did, let's just go as simple

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:39.459
as we can. You can almost view this

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:40.732
as a base one system.

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:43.253
You only have one symbol right over here.

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:46.039
But what if we went to something slightly

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.696
more complex, a base two system.

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:52.907
You'd be happy to know that not only

00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:55.521
can we do this, but the base two system

00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:57.173
often called the binary system.

00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:58.549
This is called the decimal system.

00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:00.329
The base two system often called

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.360
the binary system is the basis of all

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.624
modern computing.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.902
It's the underlying mathematics

00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.617
and operations that computers perform

00:05:07.617 --> 00:05:09.418
are based on binary.

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:12.117
And in binary you have two symbols.

00:05:12.565 --> 00:05:14.791
You have zero and you have one.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:16.929
The reason why this is
useful for computation

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:18.873
is because all the hardware that we use

00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:21.112
to make our modern computers, all

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.994
of the transistors and the logic gates

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:25.839
they either result in
an on or an off state.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.027
On or an off state.

00:05:28.313 --> 00:05:29.850
And so what we do is when you use

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.657
your calculator or whatever you might

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:33.522
be operating in base 10, but underlying

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:35.987
everything it is doing the operations

00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:37.915
in binary.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.351
But you might say well how do we

00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:41.534
actually think in terms of binary?

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.006
Well, we can construct
similar places here,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.545
but instead of them being powers of 10

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.217
they're going to be powers of two.

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.107
So, let's set up some places here.

00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.445
So, all the way on the right

00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:57.658
two to the zero power is still one.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:05:59.664
So we can still call that the ones place.

00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:02.156
Then we can move to the left of that.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:04.309
We can move to the left of that.

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:05.927
That would be two to the first power.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.899
So we could call that the twos place,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.428
and I can even write it out if I want.

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:12.523
Twos place instead of the 10s place.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.234
Then I could keep going.

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.901
Instead of this space being the 10 to

00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:18.578
the second or the 100s place, it will be

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:23.212
the two to the second, or the fours place.

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:25.058
And I can keep going.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:27.793
I encourage you actually to pause

00:06:27.793 --> 00:06:29.151
the video and try to build this out

00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:30.063
for yourself.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.512
What would this be?

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:33.585
Well this would be two to the third,

00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:34.875
or the eights place.

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.241
Notice every time we're doing this

00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:37.770
we're multiplying by two.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.786
Everytime we go to the left,

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:43.602
just like we multiplied by 10 here.

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:45.441
So notice everywhere you see this 10s

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.926
we're now dealing with twos.

00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:48.219
Let's keep going.

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:49.937
Let's keep going and then we can actually

00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:52.656
represent this number using binary.

00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:54.376
So, let's do that.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:56.370
So, this right over here I've already

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.417
used that color.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.221
This right over here, this is two

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:01.949
to the fourth.

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.040
We could call that the 16s place.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.201
Then we could have --

00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:08.329
I'll reuse some of these colors.

00:07:08.342 --> 00:07:09.713
This is two to the fifth.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:13.645
We could call this the 32s place.

00:07:14.163 --> 00:07:18.615
Then we can go two to the sixth.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.133
We can call that, multiply by two again,

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:25.878
or two to the six is 64.

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.520
So this is the 64s place.

00:07:27.923 --> 00:07:31.587
Tells us how many 64s we
have. Zero or one 64s.

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:32.975
We'll see that in a second.

00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:35.287
Then we can go over here.

00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:37.831
This would be two to the seventh.

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:41.343
That would be the 128s place.

00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:47.655
And we can obviously keep going on

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:49.402
and on and on, but this
should be enough for

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.078
me to represent this number.

00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:52.650
In future videos I will show you how

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.771
to do that, but let's actually represent

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:55.555
the number.

00:07:55.555 --> 00:07:56.962
It turns out that this number

00:07:56.962 --> 00:07:58.156
in decimal can be represented

00:07:58.156 --> 00:08:03.156
as 11100111 in binary.

00:08:22.578 --> 00:08:23.433
What does this mean?

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:26.405
This means you have one 128 plus one 64,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.877
plus one 32, plus no 16s, plus no eights,

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:36.043
plus one four, plus one two, plus one one.

00:08:38.324 --> 00:08:39.278
So you can see that these are going

00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:40.640
to be the same thing.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.115
Notice, this is one 128.

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:48.239
So it's 128, plus 64, plus 32.

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:54.338
We have zero 16s, zero eights.

00:08:54.603 --> 00:08:55.666
So we're not going to add those.

00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:59.564
Plus four, one four.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.201
Plus one two.

00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:06.096
Plus one one.

00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:07.653
And add these together,

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:08.811
and once again when we're doing this,

00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:09.873
when I'm writing it this way I'm

00:09:09.873 --> 00:09:11.204
kind of using the number system

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:12.458
that we're most familiar with.

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:14.573
We're most used to
doing the operations in,

00:09:14.614 --> 00:09:16.908
but when you do it you will see that

00:09:16.908 --> 00:09:19.908
this is the exact same number as 231.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.614
This is just another representation.

00:09:21.614 --> 00:09:23.379
One isn't better than the other.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:24.188
The only reason why I converted this

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:27.358
is this is what I'm used to thinking in.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.456
It's what I'm used to doing operations in.

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:31.670
So, hopefully you find
that pretty interesting.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.987
To me, this kind of opened my mind

00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:36.150
to the power of even our decimal system.

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:38.027
In future videos we'll explore other

00:09:38.027 --> 00:09:39.047
number systems.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.736
The most used ones, base 10 is

00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:43.975
used very heavily, binary and there's

00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:45.901
also hexadecimal where you don't have

00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:50.901
two digits or not 10 digits,
but you have 16 digits.

00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:53.579
And we'll explore those in future videos

00:09:53.596 --> 00:09:55.970
and how to convert between or rewrite the

00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.844
the different representations
and different bases.
