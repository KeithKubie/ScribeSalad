Prize Committee for physics and I wonder
if you have talked to the Prize laureate

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500
if you have talked to the Prize laureate
 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
if you have talked to the Prize laureate
before the press conference yes so we we

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010
before the press conference yes so we we
 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.529
before the press conference yes so we we
called them up about 40 minutes ago we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539
called them up about 40 minutes ago we
 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.109
called them up about 40 minutes ago we
reached both both of them and they were

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119
reached both both of them and they were
 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.349
reached both both of them and they were
of course very happy wait where were

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359
of course very happy wait where were
 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.360
of course very happy wait where were
they so Sara Raasch was out on the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370
they so Sara Raasch was out on the
 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.529
they so Sara Raasch was out on the
street somewhere together with his wife

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539
street somewhere together with his wife
 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.139
street somewhere together with his wife
David Wineland we woke up in them it's

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149
David Wineland we woke up in them it's
 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.200
David Wineland we woke up in them it's
half past 4:00 in the morning so he was

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
half past 4:00 in the morning so he was
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.509
half past 4:00 in the morning so he was
asleep so what did they say well I think

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519
asleep so what did they say well I think
 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.950
asleep so what did they say well I think
they were both very happy and and both

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960
they were both very happy and and both
 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.169
they were both very happy and and both
of them expressed that they were very

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179
of them expressed that they were very
 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.689
of them expressed that they were very
happy to share the prize with the other

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699
happy to share the prize with the other
 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.910
happy to share the prize with the other
I just wonder both of them work in the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
I just wonder both of them work in the
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.420
I just wonder both of them work in the
field of physics called quantum optics

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
field of physics called quantum optics
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
field of physics called quantum optics
which has been very active since 30

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440
which has been very active since 30
 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
which has been very active since 30
years ago like since 1980s and both have

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090
years ago like since 1980s and both have
 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.780
years ago like since 1980s and both have
worked in parallel did they work

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790
worked in parallel did they work
 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.950
worked in parallel did they work
together so they they work in slightly

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960
together so they they work in slightly
 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.610
together so they they work in slightly
different disciplines because they are

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620
different disciplines because they are
 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.010
different disciplines because they are
one is looking at photons like particles

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
one is looking at photons like particles
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.680
one is looking at photons like particles
and the other one is looking at ions but

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690
and the other one is looking at ions but
 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.720
and the other one is looking at ions but
they have their methods have very much

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730
they have their methods have very much
 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.110
they have their methods have very much
in common and and of course they know

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120
in common and and of course they know
 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.720
in common and and of course they know
each other from conferences etc so that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730
each other from conferences etc so that
 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.810
each other from conferences etc so that
they are actually good friends this is a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820
they are actually good friends this is a
 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.300
they are actually good friends this is a
very active field of research so what

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310
very active field of research so what
 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.660
very active field of research so what
did they do that the others did not so

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
did they do that the others did not so
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.610
did they do that the others did not so
they have managed to capture and control

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620
they have managed to capture and control
 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.180
they have managed to capture and control
quantum particles in a very precise way

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190
quantum particles in a very precise way
 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.460
quantum particles in a very precise way
so they for instance are or she is using

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470
so they for instance are or she is using
 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.520
so they for instance are or she is using
two mirrors to capture photons in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530
two mirrors to capture photons in
 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.560
two mirrors to capture photons in
between the mirrors and then he's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
between the mirrors and then he's
 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.480
between the mirrors and then he's
sending in atoms between the mirrors

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
sending in atoms between the mirrors
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.880
sending in atoms between the mirrors
like

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
like
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.630
like
this to probe the probe the state of the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640
this to probe the probe the state of the
 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.000
this to probe the probe the state of the
photons David Wineland is is doing a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
photons David Wineland is is doing a
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.620
photons David Wineland is is doing a
little bit the opposite because he's

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630
little bit the opposite because he's
 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.100
little bit the opposite because he's
he's in still at creating a little trap

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
he's in still at creating a little trap
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.970
he's in still at creating a little trap
for ions and then he's shooting laser

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
for ions and then he's shooting laser
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.540
for ions and then he's shooting laser
light in to control the ions though to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
light in to control the ions though to
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.300
light in to control the ions though to
control and to sort of measure the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
control and to sort of measure the
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.080
control and to sort of measure the
system and the trick is to capture just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
system and the trick is to capture just
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.440
system and the trick is to capture just
one particle one photo well yes can

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
one particle one photo well yes can
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.290
one particle one photo well yes can
either capture just one or a few or they

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
either capture just one or a few or they
 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.240
either capture just one or a few or they
can and so on they have such good

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250
can and so on they have such good
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.100
can and so on they have such good
control that they can sort of determine

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
control that they can sort of determine
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.790
control that they can sort of determine
how many particles they trap oh it's so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800
how many particles they trap oh it's so
 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.180
how many particles they trap oh it's so
it's it's hard and it's also very hard

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190
it's it's hard and it's also very hard
 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.759
it's it's hard and it's also very hard
to keep them there so that they don't

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769
to keep them there so that they don't
 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.030
to keep them there so that they don't
fly away so you need enough time to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
fly away so you need enough time to
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.790
fly away so you need enough time to
study these quantum particles it's not

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800
study these quantum particles it's not
 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800
study these quantum particles it's not
just that you need the tools to be able

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810
just that you need the tools to be able
 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.259
just that you need the tools to be able
to measure you also need to have them

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
to measure you also need to have them
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.030
to measure you also need to have them
there for sufficiently long time so that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040
there for sufficiently long time so that
 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280
there for sufficiently long time so that
you can study time evolution of these

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290
you can study time evolution of these
 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.039
you can study time evolution of these
quantum particles at the press

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049
quantum particles at the press
 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.229
quantum particles at the press
conference you mentioned some key words

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239
conference you mentioned some key words
 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.229
conference you mentioned some key words
from quantum physics like superposition

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239
from quantum physics like superposition
 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.819
from quantum physics like superposition
than the coherence something about

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829
than the coherence something about
 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.170
than the coherence something about
superposition is the fact that a quantum

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180
superposition is the fact that a quantum
 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.670
superposition is the fact that a quantum
object can be in two states

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680
object can be in two states
 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.250
object can be in two states
simultaneously this is we call

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
simultaneously this is we call
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.100
simultaneously this is we call
superposition so for instance a particle

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
superposition so for instance a particle
 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.780
superposition so for instance a particle
can be in two places at the same time

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790
can be in two places at the same time
 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.810
can be in two places at the same time
and it's not really until we measure it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
and it's not really until we measure it
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.150
and it's not really until we measure it
that we sort of pin down in which of the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160
that we sort of pin down in which of the
 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520
that we sort of pin down in which of the
two places it is but there's equal there

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
two places it is but there's equal there
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.470
two places it is but there's equal there
can be an equal probability of being in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
can be an equal probability of being in
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.050
can be an equal probability of being in
two places at the same time and then the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060
two places at the same time and then the
 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.440
two places at the same time and then the
coherence is when coherence is when when

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450
coherence is when coherence is when when
 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.720
coherence is when coherence is when when
the quantum system loses this property

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730
the quantum system loses this property
 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.080
the quantum system loses this property
of being in a superposition it's like

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090
of being in a superposition it's like
 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.440
of being in a superposition it's like
being in two places at the same time or

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450
being in two places at the same time or
 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.619
being in two places at the same time or
like the shredding edge can't be

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
like the shredding edge can't be
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.690
like the shredding edge can't be
and and so that this in particular is

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700
and and so that this in particular is
 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.780
and and so that this in particular is
one of the things that has been studied

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
one of the things that has been studied
 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.250
one of the things that has been studied
by the Lord's they have been able to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260
by the Lord's they have been able to
 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.470
by the Lord's they have been able to
produce these kind of Schrodinger cat

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
produce these kind of Schrodinger cat
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.780
produce these kind of Schrodinger cat
states and they've been able to study

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790
states and they've been able to study
 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.920
states and they've been able to study
how it actually decays in time and and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930
how it actually decays in time and and
 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.530
how it actually decays in time and and
what they find is that the decay is

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540
what they find is that the decay is
 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.050
what they find is that the decay is
faster the more different the two states

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060
faster the more different the two states
 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.440
faster the more different the two states
are and of course if you have like in

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
are and of course if you have like in
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.469
are and of course if you have like in
the Schrodinger's cat paradox where the

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479
the Schrodinger's cat paradox where the
 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.200
the Schrodinger's cat paradox where the
issue is whether a cat can be dead or

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210
issue is whether a cat can be dead or
 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.360
issue is whether a cat can be dead or
alive and they dead and alive at the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370
alive and they dead and alive at the
 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.969
alive and they dead and alive at the
same time those two states are of course
