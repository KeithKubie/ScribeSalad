Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, what's going on? Hey, what's going on? Sorry, I didn't know if this thing was on or not. It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January seven, 2018 what's going on? How are Ya? Um, it's fucking three 32 in the morning and uh, I slept a little bit, but just pen, having a motherfucker of a time with this jet lag over here and you know why it is. It's cause I'm not boozing. Okay. This one's for all you alcoholics out there. I'm fucking with you. People keep telling me to go get Melatonin and send natural way to get tired. Um, all I know is the unnatural way to get tired, tired, which was uh, what I always did was just the first night I tried to stay up and then I'd go out and I would just go get, I'd go booze, I didn't have four fucking stiff drinks and just come home and pass out.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And then I'd start to get acclimated to their time. I'd have to do that about three nights in a row and then I was fine. Um, so whatever. I just been a, so I got to do this fucking podcast because today I'm getting on a plane and I'm flying to Estonia to do one show tonight. I'm very excited about it. I googled some pictures. First of all, Astonia Jesus Christ. What a Badass flag. That's one of those things that I collect. I don't buy a lot of touristy shit, so I just get those little flags so I gotta make sure I get the time to go down and pick one of those. Um, then I got lot via the next day. This is the part of the tour where I start going to all these places. I've never been to as far as countries goes. But, um, the last two nights I started in Cologne.

Speaker 1:          01:51          I'd been there before. Um, we did Munich on Saturday and yesterday we did often back often Bach and um, it's just been a fucking great time being over here with [inaudible]. Sorry, my voice is going through, you know, I'm trying to make sure you have good shows and I don't know. I don't know what the fuck I did to it. But, uh, yesterday I should say Saturday and Sunday we had two shows, Munich to and often buck. And the first fucking show was like at 3:30 PM. This is what kills me. I've, I've never in my career that I can really remember ever gone on stage like that. I mean at that time, I think maybe one time I was doing hilarious and Cleveland and I did an afternoon show, but I think that was at like four or five, I dunno, just three 30. It was fucking weird.

Speaker 1:          02:47          But I got to tell you, the crowd was unbelievable. Munich crowds were fucking ridiculous. I mean, they've all been great, but they were just like, we went like this, I swear to God that felt it goes on like a little and um, it was like snowing out and I had to walk from the green room back outside into the snow and then back into the venue. And I was just like, these motherfuckers are trying to get me sick. So my coat on by big stupid palm plum hat that I got in Finland, where back in the day, which has been saving my ass, that the vitamins, seed packets and a bowl shows, the crowds were just crazy good. And, uh, in between shows, I ran around trying to find my diaries, some sneakers, some course sneakers. I have found this store called early, somebody told me about, and uh, we drove over there and I bought a couple pairs of sneakers.

Speaker 1:          03:40          I go to the forest Gump once, you know, the classic Nike Cortez. And I made sure that I got the, uh, the Velcro straps so she can get a little fat fucking toddler feeding their, you know, um, but it's pretty fucking cool because in the middle of the city they had this giant, just giant war going on, you know, and it couldn't see how it could, we just literally drove by and it was the original wall of the city, um, for like back in the day when there was just like, you know, it was a free for all. You just sit in your village and all of a sudden some fucking assholes would just show up and just start murdering the men and rape in the women in Layton, shit on fire. And it was just like, like that's what people did back then. Like that was like a fucking like something that someone aspired to.

Speaker 1:          04:30          They aspired to rape and pillage and he just fucking lunatic shit. So these people, you know, wanted to survive. So they would build these giant walls, I guess around their fucking villages. And then someone's trying to tell me a till the hun used to save the bodies from the previous village and then he'd sneak up on a village he'd liked the body's on fire and then with like a catapult, which starts shooting them into the fucking village, he wanted to attack. Like you just sitting there chilling out, enjoying yourself and like all the sudden, you know, I dunno what was the job back then? Some fucking coppersmith comes through the top of your fucking little hut. They're on fire and lands on your goddamn dinner table. And that that was, that was the first sign that your life was going to fucking change. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 1:          05:29          It's crazy. And I don't know what it is about Europe maybe because I watched all this shit about World War II and it, you know, and a lot of, you know, American history, they don't give a fuck about, um, you know, the whole curriculum was designed by white descendants from Europe. So that's all we fucking talked about. So you just know certain shit. And of course they, you know, they dance around a lot of shit. Um, but as I've been opening, I go, when we took the train from fucking Munich up to often Bach, uh, they were like, next stop, like Nurenberg. And I'm like, Norenberg like Nuremberg trials. For some reason I thought that that was, those trials weren't France. And now that I'm getting exposed a little more to the German language, I'm like, well, obviously that's not a fucking French city. Um, so I'm on the train and I'm texting version to be like, dude, this is where they fucking tried all the Nazis, the SS and the Gestapo.

Speaker 1:          06:30          And Shit after World War II when they like, they'd like fucking put him to death and shit hanging them and everything and uh, um, texted him and he can't fucking, yeah, he's not getting service. So Mike Vaters II and he looks up, you know, he's a couple seats away, you know, but out of the respect for German people, I don't want to be like, hey, this is where they fucking killed all the Nazis have to function in World War Two. I walked over to him and I started to say it, but because I'm speaking English, people just look at you like all these a fucking American, let's judge him. Is he fat? Is he breathing through his mouth? You know, was he loud? So I just literally had to show him the text. Um,

Speaker 2:          07:11          yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:12          And I'm sitting here, you know, like when you go to fucking Berlin, that's where Hitler killed himself in part of his bunker. Still exist. I know they didn't, they fucking destroyed most of it. Soviets did. And then they build just like an apartment building around it. You know, it's like Los Angeles, how they do that shit. Um, they just knocked shit down and they don't give a fuck what happened. And I get it. Cause the guy was so fucking evil. But like, I'm just like, wow, it's so fucking crazy that people, the German people just walk amongst all of this shit. And then I was like, wait a minute. I live in the United States of America. I go down to south all the time. I can't imagine what the fuck happened right where I'm sitting when I'm sitting in a fucking waffle house. Like if that used to be like a plantation or some slave was running away and they got caught and God knows what the fuck happened, forget about the native Americans.

Speaker 1:          08:04          So I was like, well, why the fuck do I only think about that shit you don't like every time I go to Paris, like when I look at this, Sean's Elisa, that fucking street, I just pictured when the Nazis fucking paraded up the damn thing, uh, when they occupied their country and when the allied forces, when they took it back. Um, and then all the French ladies banged a bunch of Americans evidently. Um, how come I don't think of that shit, my own country. It's just cause cause I grew up then it's fucked. I always thought that would be like a weird willow cy five fucking movies slash horror movies that um, I don't know if you just, if you get them because they kind of do what they do it on like light shit. Like if you move into a house and someone got murdered there in the 20s, right?

Speaker 1:          08:54          Like let me tell something. She, I'm going to select you from fucking [inaudible]. Right. Then all of a sudden that place is haunted. They don't wait. Maybe American horror story did it. I don't fucking know. I watch sports, but um, anyway, um, and then, then I'm reading all of this shit and it's like about the Nuremberg trial when I'm on the fucking train and making sure nobody's looking over my shoulder and I'm seeing how like a, they had to decide how they were going to go sort of like the first time I think of World War One, they tried to do it, but this is the first time they were trying to make people pay for their fucking war crimes. So you know, FDR and fucking Churchill and all these guys are trying to figure out how they're going to go about doing it. And FDR balked at something and then he died and then Truman came in and was just like, well wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          09:46          Yeah. Truman came in and was like, no, we're going to do that shit. So he must have still been at war with Japan. And then he goes and he drops to fucking nuclear weapons on fucking Japan. Like it was, it's like they were all fucking world war criminals. We sit in there firebomb and Dresden and shit. It's like women and children down there. It's, it's, so, I don't know. That's why I always say like, to this day, I can't believe that like war is still a legal, you know, slash like glorified and uh, I mean, I understand defending your country and shit like that. If there's a fucking lunatic out there, but like, you know, who's kidding? Hope you know a lot. You know, there's been a lot of iffy decisions made out there for, you know, it's just, it's a fucking land grab. You're going after oil, you know, you, you want, you want that land because it's, it's got some water around it. I mean, that's why people go to fucking war most of the time it seems nowadays. Anyways. Um, but anyways, I don't know. Some of that leads to me

Speaker 2:          10:53          yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:54          To talking about fucking thin privilege. I follow this Guy Yonis Papa's on the Instagram. He's like, fucking genius does all these characters and stuff. So I'm always watching him. Cal Dunnigan uh, Jeff Richards. I like my favorite, like the fucking characters. They do the fucking geniuses, right? So I was watching his end, he posted something about at some going, what the fuck is then privilege? I already know I have white privilege. Evidently I have been privileged to like if it was like monopoly and there was a stretch, a little properties that were the privileged properties. Like I feel like I got some of those little green houses on a lot of them. So evidently it's a privilege to be thin rather than a reward for having the discipline to push yourself away from the fucking table. You know? And I'm not, I'm not talking about when you were a kid and you just, some people have baby fell like I baby fat.

Speaker 1:          11:50          I was a fat fucking kid. I was like 10 pounds. You know, when I was born, I was a big fucking read Charlie Brown looking fucking baby. There's not one cute picture of me till I'm like three in my head was literally almost the size it is right now. When I was at adult. Like I literally from day one look like I could fuck up a Lego city. Right. And, um, you know, by just use that to my advantage that'd be on the playground and people be fucked with me cause my orange hair and I just lean on him, you know, like a, like a boxer that just wear him out in the early rounds. And then I just fucking, you know, bunch of body shots and it would be over me with my big flabby freckled arms.

Speaker 1:          12:39          And then somewhere in like junior high, I just sort of leaned out. My goal was Sunday, grew a little bit and uh, and then I stopped growing and then I was just a small skinny kid. I kind of had it all, you know, when it comes to the bullying, I was a fat kid when I was real young then I was, uh, but I was big and then I became small and I was skinny and you throw it all in there. I had orange hair, so it was kind of inevitable that I was going to end up being some sort of a fucking comedian or something. I don't know what. But, um, anyways, this then privileged shed. It's like they like people who are thin need to fucking acknowledge. You know, it's up to you to realize how privileged you are that, you know, people don't judge you when you eat a cookie in public and blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          13:25          And all the cities like, well, go to the fucking judge me when I put on a pair of shorts and look at our fucking white, my legs are, you know, these fucking people. You know what kills me about shit like that. All right, I get it. Where you shouldn't tease fed people and make them feel bad and all that, you know, it's fucking immature and it's me, I get it. Right? But on the other side, it's like there's no, there's no burden of responsibility. It's something that's totally fucking curable. And I know some people literally have like food addictions and like it's a psychological thing or whatever. But you know, for most people who have fat, it's just, you've just eaten too much fucking food, you know? And considering most of the goddamn world is starving.

Speaker 1:          14:14          You know, it's just like, if, can you underscore believe that with this train of thought, fat white people in a first world nation can literally walk around and call themselves victims? Well, you know, I don't know all of these fucking fatties I swear to God, that's why I did that bid on it at my last special. You need to go to some countries where the people are really have some problems. I mean, you can even go to score on the fucking Internet and read about it. You can fill a hell of a lot fucking better about yourself. You know, I was sitting there, uh, you know, I was getting frustrated with being fucking, uh, jet lagged and Shit in these three 30 in the afternoon show is, I was like, fuck man, now I can't fucking sleep. And I was like feeling like I was a Zombie and I was getting old grumpy and shit.

Speaker 1:          15:05          And then like I go on the Internet and I'm like, wait a minute. Okay. So if Nuremberg is here, where was Auswitch also, I can never say it right. The concentration camp place right. And it turns out it's in Poland and I was like, well I don't have the time, it's going to be too far away. So I kind of googled some fucking pictures of it and shit and I looked at it and I was like, oh my God, I could never fucking go there. I mean literally like you're fucking blood runs cold, like looking at this shit. And then they had like, you know, pictures of like piles of like kids shoes and shit. And I'm literally buying shoes for my kid and I'm just like going, am I really bitching that I have a three 30 fucking show? Kind of a fucking asshole. Am I right?

Speaker 1:          15:44          I think people eat fucking hot fudge Sundaes. I'd do that every once in awhile. You know what I mean? They got to look up a bunch of starve and fucking kids in the middle of nowhere. Not even in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of where the world for whatever reason considers nowhere before you sit there and try to like figure out a new way to try and fuck up somebody's career. Cause that's going to be another thing. This is such a weird fucking time of so many goddamn people like they just keep trying to like, I keep looking at it like a bike race. Like they try to get behind somebody who has like a legitimate complaint. Like I gotta be honest with you, the fact that white women can fucking use the term white male privilege and they're like a white woman in the United States of America.

Speaker 1:          16:32          The fact that they can some out hop on the other side of the fence as some sort of like, you know, um, underprivileged group. And I'm not saying that, you know, they don't get less than white males, but it's just like, should I really be listening to your complaints next? Are you really going to be first in line? You actually have white privilege when it comes to complaining because people are going to pay attention to your shit first even though you're suffering the least. Right. As far as my complete lack of research goes as far as me babbling here fucking four in the goddamn morning in and really help us on that week and somebody up mumbling here. Um, anyways, so I guess that's the latest thing that can get you to not fucking, I dunno, sell some tickets on the road or fucking, you know, host an awards show, like whatever the fuck we're going to do.

Speaker 1:          17:28          You know, you know what blows my mind about that whole ward show scandal is, I just love how whatever was said was said around 2011 and all these adults who were well old enough, well old enough work were plenty old enough to have gotten offended back then and made a big stink. And for some reason it doesn't fucking come out. It's almost like they get you on something. They're like, all right, hold onto that card. You know what I mean? Like they're playing granny fucking water and then they wait till you get something big enough that's going to shine a light in their cars and then they come back and they fucking try and slam it down on the fucking table. Um, I was out of the country, but as far as what I read, Ellen degenerate as cool and my book for the rest of the fucking time, you know, and I thought whatever she was trying to do was a, is, is the way to go about stuff like that where you just don't try to fucking destroy somebody.

Speaker 1:          18:28          You try to get them to see your point, try to get people on your side to be, hey, give this person another chance. You have to be open like that. You open it up to a discussion and then people just watch it and learn some shit rather than just being like, this person said this, now they can't have that. Now let's watch them fucking, you know, lose something. You know who she's just sitting there watching it for the fucking entertainment value. Um, this is one of my favorite things to do. By the way is to get on my fucking high horse here and preach at a quarter to four in the fucking morning, whatever fucking time at is here. Um, all right, let's talk a NFL playoffs. I missed most of them. I was able to watch a little bit of that eagles bears game, um, in German, which was pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          19:17          Um, cause they kept enough for the English words, um, that I was able to, you know, kind of know what the fuck they were talking about. And uh, I know everybody's going to get on the bears kicker, but can somebody please explain to me why the fuck you go for a two point conversion? When the bears did that, why not just fucking kick the Goddamn thing and then you end up losing by one? John Madden my entire fucking life said you take the points, you take the points, you take the points, those extra points come back to haunt. Yet, I know this guy, I missed it. I guess he hit a number of fucking goalposts and hit the CROC goalpost and the crossbar. And the last one, I watched the highlights, but why the fuck are you going for two points there? Makes it just, you know, well choose your only up by two. You're acting like it's the end of the game with the fucking two minutes to go is a whole bunch of time left. And I forget when it happened, the end of the third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter, but there was plenty of fucking time where it's a complete non factor.

Speaker 1:          20:17          Just take that extra fucking point, just take the fucking thing and then see where the fuck you are with the last five minutes. Then you start playing that game. You know everybody's going like Patrick one now. Like pull in the fucking goalie would like 10 minutes left in the game, which for some reason I actually worked for him. So congratulations to uh, to the eagles, to nick falls, man. I, by the way, they'll match matched bisky man out of Trump, Friskies 80 then you had a fucking break game through for over hundred yards. Um, I thought he was like really accurate and he was dealing with like the defending super bowl champions that thought it was great to Nick's falls is that guy, you know, like I just fucking delivers. Um, oh my God. Pete Carroll. Jesus Christ for fucking bastard. The poor fucking bastard man. He's getting a ton of shit in Seattle. I guess they thought he ran the ball too much and uh, I don't know what happened. That field goal kicker got fucking hurts and then they have to punch her there and he has to do an onside kick. Like why didn't he just do what they all do? Just stick it on the tee and then he kicked the ball in a downward motion on the upper third of the fucking ball. So it pops up in the air. Yeah. The guy just, he fucking just fucking basically lobbed it down the field that you know something.

Speaker 2:          21:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:42          If Pete Carroll never won a Superbowl and they were going to make a statue of him, it would be him with his hands on his fucking knees just looking down at the ground in pain. He sort of the urban Meyer of a NFL coaches, you know, and that they both won, but they just have that fucking, they just have that, that's soul crushing. Whenever I see him do that. You don't, it reminds me of, it reminds me of Carl Yastrzemski when he backed me, he's backing up to the wall. When Bucky dent hit that three run homer and you just saw his legs buckle. It just reminds me of that every time I see that shit. So, um, I dunno, my condolences. I don't usually have condolences to Seattle fans, but I dunno, the rivalries kind of died down. You football fans, I feel for you. I've been there and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          22:37          Um, congratulations. San Diego chargers and I forget who played the last game or the colts. I guess the colts look good and Andrew luck is back, which is great. Um, other than that, I haven't been fucking doing anything here. I should probably do some of these reeds here. This podcast might be a little short because I have to get up, go to the airport.

Honey even makes Amazon better with Millie attitude. Fuck Amazon. Who's fucking cons? Those assholes. They throw it over the fence. They consider it delivered. There's no return address. You never can figure out who the fuck's sent it to you. It's a fucking nightmare with millions of sellers on Amazon offering the same products.

Speaker 1:          27:48          How do you know if you're really getting the best price? How the fuck do you know if it was delivered? There's no fucking phone call. You've got to bring it back down to a shop and they're just little, little, little flows we can tell was delivered. We could form it. Uh, that's where honey comes in. What is the fucking driver said it was confirmed. Honey automatically goes to wear to work. Whenever I shop on Amazon, I ordered this other shit on Amazon is fucking, and I never got it. I know what the fuck is. It compares the PR. This is like the worst advertising read ever. It compares the prices of every seller that carries the item. I want honey, even factors in shipping, sales tax and Amazon prime status to make sure I'm getting the lowest price. It shows me the best delivery time, even if Amazon doesn't.

I can't figure out how to turn all the fucking heat, you know. But the one of the things, the only thing I hate more than not being able to turn it on on the fucking heat is having to call down to the front desk and then they got to send somebody up.

Speaker 1:          31:08          I just, I thought I'd rather sit here and get sick. Um, yeah, we go a little bit of fucking often Bach bottled water can be, I can get seltzers on my podcast to advertise a little fun with it. See packet here.

Speaker 1:          32:09          That is a lot of stuff fits it. Um, all right. So anyways, yeah, so we ordered room service as far as I can tell. The top three things on room service in Germany are uh, a hamburger, the inner schnitzel or spaghetti. And I actually, when I was in Munich I got some dean or Schnitzel, which I always thought was like a fucking hot dog, but he's so pork cutlet that's breaded. It was fucking delicious. Um, that's what's killing me about being here in Germany as I haven't had time to get like a proper German meal. I've just been traveling so much and uh, you know, I, I'm never going to do ancestry.com but as far as the names of my family tree, I know I am mostly German.

Speaker 3:          32:59          MMM.

Speaker 1:          33:01          I love this shit. I was fucking sausages and fucking beer and all that. It kills me. I'll tell you the next time I come here to Germany, which I'm definitely going to do because it's been so much fun. I am going to be beyond off the wagon and I'm trying all these fucking be, I'm going to book myself out here in October fest. I wouldn't buy a little BMDS Oktoberfest outfit outfit and I'm going to fucking drink my ass off, but not on this tour. Oh, Billy. No Fun. It's coming up on 50 days. Have just been a fucking douchebag. Um, anyways, so let's plow ahead here. Let's read some of these fucking things for the week. Uh, just another one about Poland. All right. Very excited to go to Poland to very excited to go to bottle Berlin. All that. Like all the rest of this tour is just going to be just a bunch of bar. Just a bunch of shit I'd never seen. I would speaking to that, guess who came out to the show last night? Guess who the fuck showed up? One of my favorite drummers, one of the greatest drummers in the world. Benny grip.

Speaker 3:          34:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:07          Showed up with his lovely girlfriend. I hate naming names and everything, but everybody knows who the fuck he has, right?

Speaker 3:          34:13          MMM.

Speaker 1:          34:14          He fuck, I couldn't believe, you know, I, it's just, it's unbelievable. Uh, if you're a drummer out there and you want to see somebody who possesses one of the rare things in drumming, which is incredible feel passion, playing from the heart combined with ridiculous chops. And the thing that I've found with, with drumming is when you get those chops guys, a lot of times when they play there between their ears, like they're in their head and they have all this really intricate shit, but it's disconnected to who they are as a person. And then if you have like a group player, you know, if they go to take a solo, if they even do, it's uh, you know, it's still good because it's still gurus, but it's not like the crazy, uh, I don't know. I'm just saying those guys that have those fucking insane shops where you would think even buddy rich will be going like, dude, what the fuck are you doing there nowadays?

Speaker 1:          35:12          How far drumming has come because everybody, the Internet's, but basically everybody's watching everybody. Everybody's jamming and learning from each other. Uh, it's just so rare to meet a guide that has his chops and plays the way he does. So he does clinics all around the world and uh, he's got some DVDs out there and all in this no fucking way that you won't be tremendously changed for the better if you start watching his videos. So it's Benny Benny, Grip B andN Y G R E B I believe. I'm not sure if this too and I can't fucking spell anything. Just check them out if you can't. All right. Anyways, just another one about Poland. Uh, Dear Mc run from the sun.

Speaker 1:          35:58          I like that one. Uh, I am honestly thrilled. Done in a few days. You're going to show up in my nuts. So beautiful city of Warsaw. Don't tell me that. Well, they live in and out so beautiful city of La and I love it. I like how it's gritty and grimy and all that shit. You know. Sorry, drinking more phone. Let me see here. Uh, mainly because, um, okay. I'm honestly thrilled that you are going to be in a few days and you're going to show up. It might not so beautiful city of Warsaw, mainly because I'm selling my house and you are so white that you're rising the property value whenever you arrive. Sky's all areas or lady, let's be fair. Um, I don't want to offend shame anybody or whatever the fuck you were talking about now. Um, but since you're kind enough to do one of those pussy ass shows of yours, I will definitely come.

Speaker 1:          36:50          I like this guy. Sprake and fucking balls. Um, you, you are going to love Poland as Yossef. Palecki used to say it's a great nation. Only people are constant. Whole. Wait a minute. Do is everybody is funny as you in Poland, is this going to be another fucking country I go to where I'm just like, oh my God, these guys remind me. The people I grew up with, I felt that in Ireland. I felt it in Scotland. I felt that in India. Just that, that Boston sharps Bobrick and Fuckin thing is mine. It's my favorite thing in the world. Um, anyways, as for the city of Warsaw, well she's not the prettiest of Gals, but let's be fair. That bitch, that bitch went through some shit. Uh, we are watching American shows, so don't worry about making your pop culture references. We're currently watching Alf, and once we figure out why those jokes are funny, we're going to move on to Frazier.

Speaker 1:          37:52          Dude, can you please start doing standup or something? This is just the, Oh, this is just written really fucking funny. Uh, you can also consider renting a helicopter here since it's much cheaper than the u s although Polish helicopter, it's just a horse wearing a windmill hat. Ah, radio had one fucking Polish joke. Doctor, best wishes to your family and break your PC leg on this tour. Our ps, uh, if you're interested in Soviet bloc history, God knows I didn't learn about that when I was growing up. Then you should check a comedian freeze love F R E Z l UV, talking about his military service in Berlin during the Cold War. Um, I will definitely check that out and I'll send out a link to this, uh, podcast episode here. Um, Oh, speaking of which, I've been having the best time with Rosie right at, for z. The one thing I love about [inaudible] is [inaudible] is [inaudible]. Okay. The Way Maddie was going to be, Maddie poverty's Rosie, he's over here wearing his Jordans. You know, he's got his fucking Nike tracksuit on and we were in Cologne, Germany. Uh, did I tell you this yet? I've told them on stage so many times we're living, we're walking over this fucking bridge right

Speaker 1:          39:11          from Cologne. Germany, as I mentioned, was one of the most bomb cities in world war two. So there's not a lot of old stuff there because it just got destroyed. But they have this one beautiful church, right? So we're walking over the bridge. At first he is going like, Dude, look at that building, man. God, it's a beautiful building. And that building beautiful and I'm looking at is these cluster of whatever buildings and in the middle of it is this amazing church. So I'm looking at the buildings going, what the fuck is this guy? See? Like what building is that building right there? Look, it's fucking the architecture's beautiful. And finally figured out, I was like, dude, are you talking about the fucking church? And he's like, yeah, that data. Oh No, I already told this story till the story on Thursday. I'm still giving him shit about that. It's a great building.

Speaker 1:          39:57          Um, all right. Oh, by the way, Versie Versie two Sicilian in Greek. He loved the vianor Schnitzel too. And he's actually really enjoying, uh, Jeremy too, which made me happy. Cause sometimes there's Mediterranean guys, you know, they get all fucking upset about the food and there's no sunshine and shit, you know, but he's been having a great time. All right, Gypsies. Hey there, Billy bloated broths. Uh, I go to Romania. Oh, this is what I was talking about. We're learning that Gypsy's considered a racial slur. All right, listen to this first sentence. He goes, I go to Romania frequently for work and I'm quite versed in Gypsies and why it is a racial slur. Uh, in order to love about that was he still used the word gypsy. That's like if I was in America being like a, hey everybody, uh, for when you traveled to America, I've been to east St Louis and I'm quite versed in and words and why it's a racial slur.

Speaker 1:          40:55          Like I, I wouldn't do that. That's kind of what he just did there. Uh, first Rome Romanians are not Gypsies, Robin people, Romanian people are descendants of Romans. I didn't know that Gypsies are people that came from Egypt. Uh, if you want to insult a Romanian person called him a gypsy, Gypsies stick to themselves and rob slash steal from outsiders. They will fight at the drop of a hat. I saw two old lady, Gypsies fighting over which corner they were selling flowers on in the old city in Bucharest. I hope this clears it up a little. No, it, that didn't clear anything up.

Speaker 1:          41:37          Um, now I know that Romanians are Roman and Gypsies are people are from Egypt. I do know that. And then you went on to fucking trash him in a way that I'm sure there were upset about. I Dunno. Jesus Christ. Did I just get in trouble just by fucking read that. So they've got a lot of fight them. All right. What are you gonna do? I mean, we've, I've seen these videos have to stamp people dressed up like Santa Claus beating the fuck out of each other and my country. Uh, all right. But I didn't realize that Romanians, but almost it says Roman in there, Huh? Did Not know that. All right. I left to look a lot of that up. Double check, which means I'm not going to do it. I'll forget about it. And then the information you just told me, we'll be in my head in one day.

Speaker 1:          42:24          I'm going to spew it out, but I'm probably gonna get in trouble. All right. Recent breakup. Am I the asshole? Well, firstly, first of all, first dilly. What two words did I just, first of all, it's certainly, I don't know what the fuck up. I don't know. Anyways, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me over something. Me and my family thinks is stupid. All right, so right now I'm a little nervous here. You know if families back in you, you know, are you not one of those fucking young kids that can do no wrong, are you anyways? We are both 20 and since last February we've been also, what generation are you, is that generation z? We are both 20th since last February. We've been arguing since we invited her to my birthday dinner and she got upset because she was expected to pay for her own meal. All right. Who? Who, who's, who's her? Is that your girlfriend?

Speaker 1:          43:27          Okay. I didn't tell my parents until months later because they didn't want to start anything. Anyway, around early December, my family asked me to invite her to come up with us to my dad's parents home on the 29th because that's when we could celebrate Christmas with them. When I texted her, she said, am I going to have to pay for my own gas? I have a s d I don't know what that means. So I assumed I was missing something. So I do. Do you have like add to the point that you have? Don't have the fucking time to write add vinegar to look up fucking ASD, all saints disease a s d you are not connected to the, you are not a winner. All right. I don't know what the fuck that is. I don't give a shit. I'll learn about it later. Um, I have ASD, so I assumed I was missing something.

Speaker 1:          44:24          So I asked my dad and he said, of course she flipped out about it. Oh, is as Berger's disease. Would that be abd or is that antilock brakes? I don't fucking know. Uh, let's ABS. She flipped out about it and became, and it became the new thing we could argue about her mom and her sister agree with her that it's Shitty to not pay for someone's gas when you invite them someplace. But my dad's parents didn't pay for our gas, but no one we know ask for that. And all of our family members, we invite to be day dinners. Never complained about paying their own bill. Should I put pun not intended, I'd appreciate your advice or, and I'm a big fan. You seem pretty good with your response. And most cases I should note that after breaking up with me on new years despite, all right, that's how we ended it.

Speaker 1:          45:24          I don't understand what's gone on it. You guys sound like a bunch of cheap fucking assholes greenhouse with him. He takes somebody up for their fucking birthday. You make them pay for their birthday dinner. That's fucking terrible. It's so terrible. It's like, it's hilarious. And I'm sure she didn't give a fuck about paying for gas. She's probably alluding to the fact that you that you've made or pay for our own fucking birthday. That's fucking hilarious then in a lot of ways is sadder than going out to dinner by yourself for your birthday. Cause at least nobody there at the restaurant knows that your birthday now, you sitting there with a table full of people that know what your birthday and how you got to kick in. Wow. Yeah. I should probably stop short of calling you and your whole family a bunch of cheap fucks, but let's just say a little rough around the edges.

Speaker 1:          46:16          Um, but whatever, that's water under the bridge. I guess you need to find your soulmate, the kind of woman that doesn't mind paying for her own birthday dinner. We, you know, maybe you're a feminist, you know, cause most guys who we pay for our own shit on our birthdays, we have to go out and go buy the big fucking fancy gift on Valentine's Day. I don't know. I can't figure that one out. And the fact that you stopped mid sentence, like she fucking showed up your place and club you to death and then he had sand. So the forensics couldn't figure out what time you died while he did send an email. Alright. Lesbian dating with no spark. All right. Whatever the fuck you're dating, if there's no spark and out of it, uh, he built, I was wondering if you were near, could give me some dating advice to a lady listener all, unfortunately, Nia is not here, so you're gonna have to deal with my dumb fucking ideas.

Speaker 1:          47:11          Uh, I've been, I've gone out on seven really good dates with a wonderful woman who was essentially everything I've ever looked for in a partner. She's Hilarious, witty, playful, beautiful, smart. And motivated and good kind hearted person. Um, are you fucking my wife? Sorry. Uh, the way we have ridiculous, Witty Banter reminds me of how you and Nia are on the podcast. Well, that's what reminded me when you said it. Uh, it turns out we even want all the same things in life in terms of a long term relationship. How does this go left? Did you finally get her naked? She had a dick. I mean, what is, what is going on here? Uh, wanting a family, living close to parents and siblings in the same area we grew up. However, in the past few days she's grown a little distant. Uh, Jesus, when I asked her why, she explained that although she really enjoys spending time with me and then I have done nothing wrong, she's never felt strong, passionate feelings toward me. Uh, okay. This is how you got to walk somebody through their feelings. Oh, ahead. This is never fun. I responded honestly that I have not necessarily felt that huge passive spark. Oh, wait a minute. I read it wrong.

Speaker 3:          48:29          Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          48:30          She said she never felt strong, passionate feelings toward me. Oh, I thought you meant she's never felt that before and she was scared that she loves you. So she's saying like, you're cool but I'm not failing. I responded honestly that I have not necessarily Sara's Sara Lee felt that huge past exparte with her either. Well congratulations. What you guys have on your hands is, is your your fuck buddies. Okay. And now where you're in an area of limbo and we don't really know where to go from here. I think it's clear that we are attracted to each other and very compatible, but there is a lack of clear chemistry between us. Uh, she has an decelerated online class for the next two weeks, so we decided to cool things down and meet again after that is finished. I think that's very wise. My question is if you consider an emotional, passionate drive necessarily necessary for two people to be together successfully long term and how it was with you when Nia, I am personally a believer in longterm love growing over time and that put passionate love and my experience generally follows the Newtonian rule of what comes up.

Speaker 1:          49:48          Must always come down lovely wishes to you, Nia, and that your little one and go fuck yourself. Um, I think that the fact that you guys both had that really mature conversation, neither one of you feeling a spark. It's just like, you know, in the beginning, if there's the spark, there's that, that's that euphoria that you kind of chase for the rest of your relationship because you know, you just get used to each other and then when the love comes out, it's usually vacation holiday or if you've been through something together and you survived, it brings you closer together. And then you have like these memories.

Speaker 3:          50:32          MMM.

Speaker 1:          50:35          You know, like I've gone through rough periods, you know, with my wife and like having a kid just upsets the whole apple cart and, uh, you're focusing so much on the kid that you can kind of like forget to check in with each other. And, um, you know, so when I've learned with her as we have to take like these little weekend vacations, you know, in town, just go to a hotel and it's hilarious. And then we instantly fall back in love again. And then spend the rest of the time looking at pictures of our daughter, seeing how we miss her and stuff. So,

Speaker 3:          51:12          um, I dunno, I think

Speaker 1:          51:16          because you guys have, you guys seem like you should be really good friends, but the weirdest thing is you already banged or whatever. So I don't know how that works in the lesbian world, but I know in the a Hetero world that can get weird and it's kind of 50, 50, sometimes the guy gets weird. Sometimes the woman gets weird. It's just kind of weird. So I don't know. I think it's probably a good thing that you guys aren't going to see each other for a couple of weeks and you can kind of be like, you know, cause it's early on. Just see where the fuck you are after two weeks.

Speaker 3:          51:49          But um,

Speaker 1:          51:51          I dunno, I think you're doing it right, but like I know anything about that Shit, you know?

Speaker 3:          51:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          51:58          Which is why he probably asked me to chime in to, um, to be honest with you, the only way that it's going to fucking work is a,

Speaker 1:          52:12          is it, you do have that spark in the beginning because that sparks is what's gonna make you stay. Cause if you don't have that spark and you get married for the fucking reasons or whatever, that it's just like, you know, you see people marry for money in this sitting on a fucking yacht and they're miserable. Uh, all grown man's sitting while pissing, oh Jesus Christ. It's one of the worst images I've ever heard dear. Oh, Billy blue hills. Um, I'm a 40 year old man with three young children. I realized the other day that over the past couple of years I've been sitting down when I piss more off the, the not all right. Now this is funny cause if you're doing it because you're tired, it's just fucking hilarious. I was worried that you were going to, this is going to be some other progressive thing that, you know, standing, Piss, privileged, whatever the fuck they're going to come up with next.

Speaker 1:          53:04          Um, it all started when the kids were babies. My wife would wake up to feed and I would head down to the canned like a Zombie to piss and I was too damn tired to standard aim. Now the kids are a little older and I'm still fucking exhausted most of the time at home that I find myself sitting down to piss all the time. I think of just tired as fuck. Am I crazy to assume this is common among thing among men my age with young children now that you are 50, do you do the same? I can't be the only one. Right. Thanks. Love the podcast and go fuck yourself. No, I don't do that. The only time they ever do that is if my wife's sleeping and where we lived in smaller apartments. I didn't want to wake her up when I was taking a Piss, you know, on a consideration I would sit down and that would always make me laugh and I would always picture all of my friends making fun of me that I was sitting down. Well, well piss it. Uh, I think the fact that you still say pacing rather than paying, which is one of my major pet peeves. Uh, I can meet with a guy says I have to go pee. It just, I can't even tell you my body like microscope of lead, like could torch.

Speaker 3:          54:17          MMM.

Speaker 1:          54:19          Oh by the way, somebody told me it's anyway and not any ways. And I have to tell you, I don't give a shit. I like say it anyways. I say the plural sense. Uh, no you probably not the only one who does it.

Speaker 3:          54:35          Uh,

Speaker 1:          54:37          but I will tell you that what I have learned just having one kid is how important it is to get eight hours of really good sleep. And you shouldn't watch TV and be on your fucking phone. I've actually gone back to reading. If you consider reading sports books, reading, I try to read that my wife, she always watches the fucking real housewives or that tattoo parlors show, you know, any show that involves people. She doesn't care about screaming at each other for some reason. She loves to watch that before she goes to bed. Um, so I just put on these, the, the, the fucking same headphones I wear when I fly in a plane, so I can't hear people and I just read the fucking book. Uh, but anyways, I think maybe if you get eight hours sleep, yeah, you hit the gym a little bit if you have time. But I know how tired I am with one kid. I can't imagine with like three and a good friend of my life, totally. One time when he was talking about being a parent, his kids are older, he's got like two or three kids and three kids and he said, uh, he goes, dude, he goes, I've been tired since the 90s.

Speaker 1:          55:52          So I think that's just what it is.

Speaker 3:          55:56          Uh,

Speaker 1:          55:58          that's just what it is that you know what it is because once your kids get older and they can kind of take care of themselves, meaning they can wake up, brush their teeth, get ready for school and all that, you feel like you're not going to be tired. But I think the thing that makes you tired is the worry because you constantly fucking worried that something's going to happen to him. But whatever. Um, all right, that's the podcast. Apologize for the low volume of talking here. I really want to everybody that's come out to my shows here in Germany, I could not have had a better time. Uh, it was fucking awesome. And, uh, I will definitely be back the next time. Hopefully when I get a new hour, you guys still want to come to see me? I will definitely be back. I think I'll come during the summer months, next time or Octoberfest one or the other. All right. Go fuck yourselves then. I'll check in on yet. Thursday.
