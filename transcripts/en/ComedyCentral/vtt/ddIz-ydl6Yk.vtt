00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.907
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.109
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.345
- COCAINE IS A HELL OF A DRUG.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.113
[chuckles]

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.615
- RICK IS ENCOURAGING ME.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:20.219
YOU KNOW, HE SHOWS UP AT
MY BROTHER'S HOUSE FUCKED UP.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.156
- NICE PLACE, NIGGA.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.826
- SO HE HAD
THESE DIRTY COWBOY BOOTS ON.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.928
PUSHING US OUT OF THE WAY,
BARGED IN THE HOUSE.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.730
MY BROTHER HAD
THESE BRAND-NEW COUCHES.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.231
THEY WERE SUEDE, RIGHT?

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.167
AND HE GETS ON THE COUCH
AND SAYS...

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.768
- WHY DON'T I STRETCH OUT?

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.103
[laughs]

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.139
AND JUST STARTED GRINDING MUD
ALL INTO THE COUCH, MAN.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.874
- YEAH, I REMEMBER
GRINDING MY FEET

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.243
INTO EDDIE'S COUCH.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:45.711
- YOU REMEMBER WHY YOU DID IT?

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.513
- BECAUSE EDDIE
COULD BUY ANOTHER ONE.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.449
- FUCK YOUR COUCH, NIGGA.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.784
BUY ANOTHER ONE,
YOU RICH MOTHERFUCKER.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.453
FUCK YO' COUCH, NIGGA!

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.954
FUCK YO' COUCH!

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.090
DARKNESSES,
DARKNESSES...

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.192
- 'CAUSE OF MY COMPLEXION
HE USED TO CALL ME DARKNESS.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.760
HE CALLS ME
AND MY BROTHER DARKNESS.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.528
HE ALWAYS SAYS,
"DARKNESS BROTHERS."

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.764
SEE, THIS IS LONG BEFORE
WESLEY SNIPES.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:07.767
BACK THEN, WE WAS THE BLACKEST
NIGGAS ON THE PLANET

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.368
ACCORDING TO RICK JAMES.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.737
- EDDIE--BOTH OF THEM WERE
BROTHER DARKNESS.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.639
TWIN BROTHER DARKNESS.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.208
- AND WE STANDING THERE,
LOOKING AT HIM,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.210
AND HE'S LOOKING RIGHT
IN OUR EYES

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.178
AS HE GRINDS HIS MUD.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.147
- SEE, I NEVER JUST DID THINGS
JUST TO DO THEM.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.648
COME ON, I MEAN,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.050
JUST, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.586
JUST JUMP UP AND GRIND MY FEET
ON SOMEBODY'S COUCH

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.121
LIKE IT'S, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING TO DO?

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.189
COME ON, I GOT A LITTLE
MORE SENSE THAN THAT.

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:33.893
YEAH, I REMEMBER GRINDING
MY FEET ON EDDIE'S COUCH.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.829
[tape rewinding]

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:39.065
SEE, I NEVER JUST DID THINGS
JUST TO DO THEM.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.399
COME ON, I MEAN,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:41.801
JUST, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.736
JUST JUMP UP AND GRIND MY FEET
ON SOMEBODY'S COUCH

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.705
LIKE IT'S SOMETHING TO DO?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.840
COME ON, I GOT A LITTLE
MORE SENSE THAN THAT.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:51.644
YEAH, I REMEMBER GRINDING
MY FEET ON EDDIE'S COUCH.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.146
- BUT THEN IT WAS LIKE,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.814
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S HANDLE THIS."

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.082
WE WENT OVER THERE...

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.017
- HEY, CHARLIE MURPHY!

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.952
- AND WE HELD HIM DOWN,

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.588
AND WE JUST WAILED ON HIS LEGS.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.323
- AAHHH!

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.691
AAH, YOU DARKNESS...

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.661
YOU BLACK, MIDNIGHT
EVIL MOTHERFUCKER!

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.130
BLACK MAGIC, DARKNESS!

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.965
YOU'RE ALL DARKNESS!

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:17.103
YOU'RE FUCKIN'...
DELIRIOUS MOTHERFUCKER...

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.604
AAH!

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.107
YOU ARE COLD AS ICE.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.675
- BUT STILL, RICK JAMES,

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.844
EVEN AFTER TAKING
A BEATING LIKE THAT...

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.979
- FUCK YO' COUCH, NIGGA.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.514
- THIS MOTHERFUCKER'S
GOIN' OUT.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.017
HIS LEGS IS LIKE,
LIKE, LINGUINE.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.787
- I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT
OF BETTER HOMES THAN THIS!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.190
I'LL BE BACK,
YOU BLACK MOTHERFUCKERS!

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:41.327
WIDE-NOSE-HAVIN' MOTHERFUCKERS!

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.297
THEY SHOULD'VE NEVER
GAVE YOU NIGGAS MONEY!

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.032
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO APPRECIATE SHIT!

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.967
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
GET ANOTHER COUCH!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.971
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT MY LEGS, EDDIE MURPHY!

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.472
- MY BROTHER, YOU KNOW,

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:57.143
HE'S A LOT MORE COMPASSIONATE
THAN I AM.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.312
HE'S LOOKING AND THE LIMO'S
DRIVIN' OFF, AND HE SAID,

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:03.015
"WOW, MAN,
RICK REALLY NEEDS HELP."

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:05.651
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YO, WE JUST GAVE HIM SOME HELP.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.386
"BUST HIS FUCKIN' ASS AND SHIT.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.788
"I BET YOU
HE WON'T COME OVER HERE

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.323
AND DISRESPECT
LIKE THAT AGAIN."

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.525
WRONG.
WRONG.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.660
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT
RICK JAMES, MAN.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:17.196
- COCAINE'S A HELL OF A DRUG.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.229
[chuckles]
