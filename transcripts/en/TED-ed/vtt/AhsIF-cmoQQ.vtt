00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:11.302
Packed inside every cell in your body
is a set of genetic instructions,

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:14.232
3.2 billion base pairs long.

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:17.346
Deciphering these directions
would be a monumental task

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:22.010
but could offer unprecedented insight
about the human body.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.862
In 1990, a consortium 
of 20 international research centers

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:29.494
embarked on the world's largest
biological collaboration

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:31.682
to accomplish this mission.

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:35.178
The Human Genome Project proposed
to sequence the entire human genome

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:40.217
over 15 years 
with $3 billion of public funds.

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:42.758
Then, seven years 
before its scheduled completion,

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:47.296
a private company called Celera announced
that they could accomplish the same goal

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:51.791
in just three years
and at a fraction of the cost.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:55.477
The two camps discussed a joint venture,
but talks quickly fell apart

00:00:55.477 --> 00:01:00.525
as disagreements arose over legal
and ethical issues of genetic property.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:03.224
And so the race began.

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:07.202
Though both teams used the same technology
to sequence the entire human genome,

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.349
it was their strategies 
that made all the difference.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.934
Their paths diverged 
in the most critical of steps:

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.712
the first one.

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:17.764
In the Human Genome Project's approach,

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:22.365
the genome was first divided into smaller,
more manageable chunks

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.671
about 150,000 base pairs long

00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:28.752
that overlapped each other
a little bit on both ends.

00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:30.265
Each of these fragments of DNA

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:33.473
was inserted inside a bacterial 
artificial chromosome

00:01:33.473 --> 00:01:36.142
where they were cloned and fingerprinted.

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:39.550
The fingerprints showed scientists
where the fragments overlapped

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.674
without knowing the actual sequence.

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:43.791
Using the overlapping bits as a guide,

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.840
the researchers marked 
each fragment's place in the genome

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.349
to create a contiguous map,

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.958
a process that took about six years.

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.641
The cloned fragments were sequenced
in labs around the world

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.107
following one of the project's
two major principles:

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:04.205
that collaboration on our shared heritage
was open to all nations.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.884
In each case, the fragments 
were arbitrarily broken up

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:11.636
into small, overlapping pieces
about 1,000 base pairs long.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:14.305
Then, using a technology 
called the Sanger method,

00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:16.973
each piece was sequenced letter by letter.

00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:22.330
This rigorous map-based approach
called hierarchical shotgun sequencing

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.963
minimized the risk of misassembly,

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:28.972
a huge hazard of sequencing genomes
with many repetitive portions,

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:30.721
like the human genome.

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.118
The consortium's 
"better safe than sorry" approach

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:38.868
contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy
called whole genome shotgun sequencing.

00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:42.523
It hinged on skipping 
the mapping phase entirely,

00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:46.055
a faster, though foolhardy, approach
according to some.

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:48.754
The entire genome was directly chopped up

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:52.547
into a giant heap 
of small, overlapping bits.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.428
Once these bits were sequenced
via the Sanger method,

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:59.507
Celera would take the formidable risk
of reconstructing the genome

00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:02.240
using just the overlaps.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.547
But perhaps their decision
wasn't such a gamble

00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:10.272
because guess whose freshly completed map
was available online for free?

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:11.889
The Human Genome Consortium,

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.537
in accordance with 
the project's second major principle

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:16.660
which held that all of the project's data

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.548
would be shared publicly
within 24 hours of collection.

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:24.090
So in 1998, scientists around the world

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.269
were furiously sequencing 
lines of genetic code

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.347
using the tried and true, yet laborious,
Sanger method.

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:35.685
Finally, after three exhausting years
of continuous sequencing and assembling,

00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:37.360
the verdict was in.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.084
In February 2001, both groups 
simultaneously published

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:45.454
working drafts of more than 90%
of the human genome,

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.246
several years ahead 
of the consortium's schedule.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:50.679
The race ended in a tie.

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:54.824
The Human Genome Project's practice
of immediately sharing its data

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:56.626
was an unusual one.

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:59.675
It is more typical for scientists
to closely guard their data

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:03.487
until they are able to analyze it
and publish their conclusions.

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:07.559
Instead, the Human Genome Project
accelerated the pace of research

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:12.706
and created an international
collaboration on an unprecedented scale.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:16.528
Since then, robust investment in both
the public and private sector

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:20.833
has led to the identification
of many disease related genes

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.681
and remarkable advances 
in sequencing technology.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:29.380
Today, a person's genome can be sequenced
in just a few days.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.619
However, reading the genome 
is only the first step.

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:36.508
We're a long way away from understanding
what most of our genes do

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:38.334
and how they are controlled.

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:39.910
Those are some of the challenges

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.224
for the next generation 
of ambitious research initiatives.
