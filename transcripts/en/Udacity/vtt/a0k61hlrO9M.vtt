00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so the first thing we'd like to do is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
take this form out of the temporary file we were playing with before

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and put it in our application.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to create a new variable

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the top of this file called "form."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We'll use triple quotes, which allows us to enter longer strings,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
paste in our form, close this up, save it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, instead of printing out the string "Hello, webapp World!"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to print out the string of our form, so let's make that change.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're going to just return form instead of that string.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's go to our browser and see how this looks.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Okay, here we are in our browser, and we're going to reload,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we should see probably the form from our little text file.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A-ha, this is not what I was expecting.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was expecting to see the form from our previous HTML,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but instead we've got the HTML itself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Why do we see raw HTML instead of our text box in the browser?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it because Google App Engine can only send raw HTML?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Our browser is misconfigured?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're sending the wrong Content-Type header?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Or our HTML is invalid?
