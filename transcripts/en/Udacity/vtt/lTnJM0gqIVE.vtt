00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.148
Let's take a look at the results. First, 85% of those who thought they were

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:10.258
alone and heard choking tried to help. Next, 62% who thought they were in a

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:16.267
group with others when they heard the person choking tried to help. Now Darley

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:20.362
and Latane did many different variations of the study, and one of the main take

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:24.520
home findings that they found, was that, in all cases, as group size increased,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.105
the number of people trying to help decreased. In this experiment then, when

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:35.070
the participants perceived that there were more people that heard the person

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.151
choking, they were less likely to help. However, when the participant thought

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:43.206
that they were the only one who heard the person choking, they were more likely

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:48.542
to help. This demonstrates the basic principle that as group size increased,

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:51.849
the number of people trying to help decreased.
