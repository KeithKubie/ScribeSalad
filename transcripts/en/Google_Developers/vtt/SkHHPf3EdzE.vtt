00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.100
KOH KIM: Whoa, showtime.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.200
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.750
All right, so I'm Dan Galpin,
and I'm a developer advocate

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.160
with Android Games.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.780
And with--

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.140
KOH KIM: And I'm--

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.330
DAN GALPIN: With me is--

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.780
KOH KIM: With me.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.260
Sorry, sorry.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm Koh Kim.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.870
I'm part of the Google Play
business development team

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.870
focused on games.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.750
(IN UNISON): And we're here to
level up your Android game!

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.530
DAN GALPIN: Oh yeah.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.890
So thank you for joining
us at the very last

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.300
session of the day here.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.060
We'll hopefully keep you awake
until the big party.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.350
So we get a lot of
questions, OK?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.130
And let's go over those first.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.760
You can hear actually--

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.130
I think they're rehearsing next
door, that loud nose.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.660
KOH KIM: So how I
get discovered?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.300
Is one question.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.870
DAN GALPIN: How do
I get featured?

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.350
KOH KIM: How do I
get five stars?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.960
DAN GALPIN: How do I get
rid of bad ratings?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.285
KOH KIM: How do I make
users play my game?

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.470
DAN GALPIN: How do I make
users buy stuff?

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.550
KOH KIM: And that a
lot of questions.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.330
DAN GALPIN: But sometimes
these questions miss a

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.570
fundamental point.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.810
And at that point,
in the center of

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.180
everything, there is a user.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.320
KOH KIM: And we like users.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.590
I mean, they're fascinating.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.920
DAN GALPIN: Baffling.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.450
KOH KIM: They may be quite
baffling creatures.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.310
DAN GALPIN: So instead of
trying to answer those

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.150
questions up there, we're
focused on what's really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.952
important, which is that guy.

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:14.360
KOH KIM: And we'll give you
our not-so-secret formula.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.410
And it's all about what the
odds are, how do you make

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.500
money, or basically help you
increase the probability of

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.840
getting featured
on Google Play.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.360
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.030
Happy users, more users--

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.710
that's the way you're ultimately
going to be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.960
successful.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.240
So let's start by covering
what you already know.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.960
OK, last year, we came out
here-- actually Ian and I came

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.770
out here last year.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.220
And Ian's mysteriously
vanished and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.230
been replaced by Koh.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.450
KOH KIM: Sorry.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.190
He was abducted by aliens, and
they've performed some

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.430
experiments, and out came me.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.090
DAN GALPIN: And we talked about
something we were very

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.580
excited about, 10 things game
developers should know.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.940
And the great thing is between
last year and this year, we've

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.260
actually taken those things
and we've codified them.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.230
We put them up on
developer.android.com.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.050
In fact, I could stop right
here and just say click

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.759
Distribute and click
App Quality.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.190
OK?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.390
It's super, super important,
and here's why.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.080
Because there's a lot of things
game developers are

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.250
still getting wrong, and this
means that our QA team has to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.740
spend more time reviewing stuff,
sending cycles back to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.740
developers, saying, please
change this or

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.140
please change that.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.480
So an example is navigation.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.720
We've been telling developers
for years, make sure the Back

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.550
button works.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120
Don't put on-screen
prompts on there.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.780
But people still do it.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.930
And not only that, if you don't
support the Back button,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.830
it leads to bad reviews.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.690
Users say, wait.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.230
They click, and they
click, and they

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.270
click, and nothing happens.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.510
They're like, I don't
understand.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.560
I've been trained by every other
app to do this, and it

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.510
doesn't work.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.450
And so that's very important.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.750
There's also other buttons
on the phone.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.040
Make sure the volume
controls work.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.840
That's something some
people still miss.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.930
And also, our QA team really
hates seeing that vestigial

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.630
Menu button there
at the bottom.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.590
They'll say, no, no,
take it away.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.380
And it's really, really
easy to take away.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.010
You just say, I'm going to use
the latest version of Android.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.560
And that's really cool
for a lot of reasons.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.390
One, it means you're actually
testing on the latest version

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.370
of Android, which
is really cool.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.180
We like that.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.820
And two, it actually means
that that Menu

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.160
button will go away.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.940
So get rid of it.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.240
If you really, really want to
have it there, make sure that

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.700
it has a really important
function.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.160
But you'll still have to explain
to our review team why

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.530
you really need to have
it there in your game.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.160
All right, so let's go
to our next topic

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.300
everyone gets wrong--

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.000
notifications.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.760
KOH KIM: Oh, geez.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.530
DAN GALPIN: Spammy notifications
are really,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.020
really awful.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.830
And I'm not even going to put
up an example here, because

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.950
everyone knows this.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.660
Notifications should not be
something that's an ad for

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.740
something else, OK?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.100
Notification should be
something that are

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.750
controllable by the user.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.570
In fact, the best thing you can
do is make it-- if you're

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.740
going to do a lot of
notifications--

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.470
give the user precise control.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.670
Say, you know what?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.320
I don't want a notification
between the hours

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.706
that I might be asleep.

00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:53.330
Cool?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.050
KOH KIM: Or when you're in an
important meeting, or when--

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.460
I don't know--

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.580
sometimes, when you're
on a date.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.660
When you hear the whole bing--

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.340
DAN GALPIN: Well not, only that,
a lot of notifications

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.716
say, you know what?

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.260
I'm going to play a
custom sound, OK?

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.670
Well, I want my notifications
from things that are really

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.620
important to play sounds, and
from games actually just make

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.970
it a little bit quieter.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.840
Otherwise, I'm going to turn
them off in the OS, because

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.020
now we allow support for that.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.740
So it actually helps you
out to do this as well.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.339
And you'll get bad reviews.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.220
OK.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.650
Last year, we talked about all
the things that you shouldn't

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.660
ask for in terms of
permissions, OK?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.310
You are a game, OK?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.630
You are not an operating system,
and there's a really,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.480
really good chance that
you don't need to

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.860
know the user's bookmarks.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.980
You don't need to know things
like their fine location.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.260
Unless you are a location-based
game and you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.040
need to know the user is
standing right here, use

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.130
coarse location.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.870
You shouldn't actually
have to--

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.965
KOH KIM: Like call
phone number?

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:48.340
That's kind of creepy.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.330
DAN GALPIN: You can use Intent
to call phone numbers, OK, if

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.296
you really, really need to.

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:53.880
You don't need a permission to
actually-- why would you

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.630
directly call them, OK?

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.930
Displaying system
level alerts.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.390
Unless you absolutely need to
display something on the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.840
screen when you're not running,
and you have to

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.912
justify that to our review team,
you're never going to

00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:06.420
get featured if you have some
of these bad permissions.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.230
And then finally, SMS is just
awful, because you can

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.360
actually bill the user for
things without them knowing it

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.860
potentially.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.280
So don't do it.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.080
KOH KIM: Who uses SMS
anymore, really?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.230
I use Hangouts all the
time, perfectly fine.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.650
DAN GALPIN: Right, exactly.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.740
We've also talked in the past
a lot about audio, OK?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.290
Because audio should not play
when the screen is off.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.960
Audio should not play when
you're on the Home screen.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.140
Audio should not play when
you're not in the game.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.015
And this is really bad.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:32.840
Because you're in a business
meeting, and suddenly you're

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.060
giving this big presentation.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.310
You've got your suit
on, so clearly you

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.360
don't work at Google.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.900
And suddenly, music comes
out of your pants.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.300
And your boss is like, hey, I
know that he's been playing

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.820
around with some kiddie games
in his spare time.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.250
So don't do it, OK?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.050
Our review team will
catch these things.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.410
We've actually made it
a lot easier to do

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.190
this in Jelly Bean.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.770
But unfortunately, our review
team will still test on those

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.560
older devices, so you better
make it work everywhere.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.350
So again, this is a document
that's right online.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.020
I'm just going through the
document and pointing out

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.110
important things to note.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.420
StrictMode is cool.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.340
You should test with it.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.120
Our testers will test
with it, OK?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.570
Make sure there aren't big
red flashes conspicuously

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.720
throughout your game, OK?

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.360
It means that there's a chance
that you're causing the UI

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.260
thread to block.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.050
It means that someone's not
going to be able to hit a

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.880
button and have it be
responsive in the

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.110
middle of your game.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.940
It sucks.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.070
You don't want that, OK?

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.360
Finally, your app needs to
provide high-quality graphics

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.820
for different form
factors, OK?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.110
This is important, because it
turns out that the devices

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.130
that our review team is most
likely to be testing against

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.580
are these guys.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.560
And they have three different
form factors,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.660
three different sizes.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.790
And it turns out if you target
these three sizes, you

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.100
actually are going to get just
about every important device

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.050
that people are spending
money on on Google

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.890
Play in terms of coverage.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.560
So these are three very
important classes of devices.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.090
And if you don't have all three
of these, you're going

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.950
to have to explain why your
game can't run on

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.630
all three of them.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.420
So an example would be
on Nexus 10, OK?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.160
It is a high-DPI device, OK?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.840
A lot of older tablets
weren't.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.970
So if your text is microscopic
and difficult to read and your

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.970
buttons require hands that are
meant for an elf, you probably

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.030
have to go and think about
how you're scaling.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.030
All right.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.860
And of course, if you want to
get featured, you better think

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.760
about your assets.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.410
I'm talking about the
artwork that goes

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.390
along with your game.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.690
Now we've changed things a
lot in Google Play, OK?

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.180
And we'll go over that in
slightly more detail.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.300
But the important thing is that
you need to have a really

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.320
great large icon, because icons
are always important.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.370
They're always the most
important representation of

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.980
your brand within the device
and within Google Play.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.520
But now they're more important,
because now they're

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.100
the only representation in many

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.370
versions of the Play store.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.120
So for example, this icon here?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.640
Great.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.730
It says, I'm going to be
throwing paper into a bucket.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.270
I get exactly what's going on.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.710
It's cool, right?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.290
And that's the way it
appears on a tablet.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.155
And you can put a lot of stuff
into these large icons.

00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:01.740
I mean, look.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.400
I've got a brand.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.020
I've got a name.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.580
I know exactly what's
going on here.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.940
So you actually can get quite
creative with it.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.940
It's a little different
from what we were

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.620
saying a year ago.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.110
But the best part about all of
these the guidelines is in

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.290
addition to the guidelines
themselves, we also give you

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.050
an actual test suite that you
can go and hand to your QA.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.410
Let me just explain.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.740
It's not just, make sure your
app does this, but it's a set

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.780
of steps to actually go and
verify that your app is really

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.410
doing the right thing.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.679
Rotate your device this way.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.549
Click here.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.610
Click the Home button.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.659
Check for this state.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.850
You can actually hand that
to your QA team.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.230
It is actually what our QA
team does when we look at

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.350
every single featured
application that goes into

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.970
Google Play.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.440
So remember--

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.920
KOH KIM: So where was
that again, Dan?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.110
To find everyone.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.600
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yes.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.150
That's a good point.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.770
Here, wait, why don't
you say it?

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.260
It'll have more punch
if you say it.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.780
KOH KIM: Sure.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.990
So remember, it's
developer.android.com.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.310
You go to Distribute and
then App Quality.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.680
And let me repeat this.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.470
You should definitely canvass
your QA team or check this,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.140
because this will definitely
increase your probability that

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.990
our teams will be like, hey,
this is an awesome game.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.000
We should probably
take a look.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.530
And the fact that you've
actually listened to us and

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.950
implemented this in your game
makes us feel really good

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.890
about ourselves.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.200
DAN GALPIN: Well, more
importantly, it means you have

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.490
a lot less work to do.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.710
Because if you don't implement
this and we love your game,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.890
OK, we're going to have
to come back to you.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.430
And we're going to say, you
have to change this

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.190
and this and this.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.990
And then you'll say, well, I
don't really want to change

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.750
that, but OK.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.370
And then well, no, you didn't
get to that one.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.250
And then all of a sudden, a
month has passed, and you

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.690
realize you could have been
featured a month earlier had

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.100
you just done this stuff
to begin with.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.770
So please, look at this stuff.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.410
It's great, and we're going
to keep updating it.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.600
All right.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.740
KOH KIM: So assuming
that you have--

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.570
DAN GALPIN: We're now
at level two.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.840
KOH KIM: Right.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.000
We're now in level two, right?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.790
DAN GALPIN: That was all
level one, guys.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.420
KOH KIM: So now we're
in level two.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.560
Like Dan said, he covered all
the things you should be

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.750
looking at for your core app
quality guidelines, such as

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.025
Back button navigation,
some of the SDKs

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:01.940
and all that stuff.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.910
So let's talk about
doing all of that.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.910
That seems like probably
a lot of work.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.910
So really, why should
you care?

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.460
Ultimately, it's about getting
kind of featured and promoted

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.320
within the Google Play store.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.610
And I mean, it is a lot
of work, but I'm sure

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.650
you guys are like--

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.460
DAN GALPIN: I mean, our
editorial teams, right?

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.830
Actual people go and
look at your game.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.400
KOH KIM: They're not robots.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.080
I mean, Google is kind of
magical in the one sense, but

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.200
our store is not curated
by robots.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.690
DAN GALPIN: Not yet.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.590
KOH KIM: Not yet anyway.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.660
Soon, maybe.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.550
I'm waiting for that "Star
Trek" computer.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.010
Anyway, so why should
you care?

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.940
Because yes, our merchandising
team does look at all these

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.420
games on a weekly basis.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.740
And we have them all
over the world.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.290
Remember, we're a global market,
so there's games that

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.590
could be promoted and featured
all over the place.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.970
So what does that mean?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.120
So getting featured, it
is actually a power

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.110
boost for your game.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.710
So let's take an example
of one game that

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.110
was released recently.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.580
They were launched on day one.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.750
It's pretty good.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.170
500,000 installed.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.950
DAN GALPIN: That's not bad.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.850
KOH KIM: That's pretty solid
for organic growth.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.050
That's where we all
want to go.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.780
But look at what happens when
it gets featured, right?

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.340
Day five.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.180
Remember one week is
a featuring period.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.600
They went from 500K to
almost 3 million by

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.710
the end of that week.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.440
DAN GALPIN: And remember, the
game developer did the most

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.530
important thing to begin with.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.270
This was a game that was very
highly rated to begin with on

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.220
Google Play.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.920
So when we actually did the
featuring period, it just

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.110
powered up their game.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.400
If the game is looking bad and
going downhill in terms of the

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.860
ratings, and we feature it,
this is not what happens.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.910
So this is about an app having
great quality, and in

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.920
addition, getting a boost
through featuring.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.250
KOH KIM: Right.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.340
Featuring doesn't help
bad games, FYI.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.130
DAN GALPIN: Not at all.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.660
It makes it worse.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.080
KOH KIM: Actually, your ratings
will probably take a

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.680
nosedive if we feature
a bad game.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.310
DAN GALPIN: From which you
will never recover.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.710
So yeah.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.860
So it's very important that
the game is awesome.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.120
So that's part of the reason we
really put so much time and

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.070
effort into making sure
users will like it.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.200
KOH KIM: So let's talk about
some other developers and

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.290
their experiences on getting
featured on Google Play and

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.060
why it's important.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.560
And so this is a developer,
anonymous.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.320
He said downloads, installs
increased 10 to 20x.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.260
That's pretty good.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.010
I don't know how many of you
played "Super Hexagon."

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.640
DAN GALPIN: Yah!

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.510
KOH KIM: Yeah, probably the
hardest game alive.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.990
I love hard games, by the way.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.220
Anyway, their sales of their
game has increased by 4x

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.350
during feature week.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.050
And I'm sure a lot
of you have known

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.530
"Sword &amp; Sorcery," hopefully.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.650
I'm sure we're all game
developers here, right?

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.130
Maybe?

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.690
OK, so they been on sale
for four months.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.210
During feature week, 55% of
revenue was made during the

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.353
feature week, which is a
little scary, actually.

00:12:37.353 --> 00:12:37.796
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:40.140
I'm not sure that's a message I
want to send to developers.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.670
KOH KIM: I don't know if it's
a message, but I mean, it

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.530
drives something.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.240
Getting noticed by us
is going to really,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.440
really help your game.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.900
DAN GALPIN: I mean, I think when
you see that number, you

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.680
say, all right.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.370
Perhaps there are things outside
of being featured the

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.220
developer needed to do.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.320
Because clearly, the
game was awesome.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.990
It monetized really,
really well.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.520
But it just wasn't
getting eyeballs.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.430
KOH KIM: Right.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.680
So point proven.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.580
It's pretty important.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.490
But after you get featured,
now what, right?

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.760
Actually, featuring is only
the beginning, right?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.250
I mean, once you get featured,
it's kind of that first step

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.930
that opens doors to a lot of
many other promotions.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.210
We've talked about
Editor's Choice.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.860
That gets updated on
a quarterly basis.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.390
We've talked about some of
the top developer badges.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.050
But how do I get
to that point?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.280
I'm sure many of you are
wondering about that.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.270
So I'm going to let Dan talk
about that, on how you can

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.100
actually use Google to kind of
increase and kind of like

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.750
level up your distribution.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.400
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.180
So we made a little announcement
a few hours ago.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.510
And I've already talked about
it a little bit in another

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.850
talk, but let me just go over.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.630
In case you missed it, OK, we
have now launched Play Games

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.140
platform services,
which is great.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.980
Because we now have a system
for leaderboards and

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.880
achievements and real-time
multiplayer and cloud services

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.830
and even an anti-piracy feature,
which I'm really

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.330
excited about.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.190
So that games that are premium
titles, that are paid titles

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.750
on Google Play, can actually
disable key features to people

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.960
who are not registered as
users of that game.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.140
So it's something we think
is really important.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.780
A lot of times, people
think, all right.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.240
We're actually leaning
everything

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.950
towards non-premium content.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.580
Actually, we really want to
help premium content be

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.310
successful, so we've made it a
very important launch portion

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.130
of Play Games platform
services.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.100
But this is only the beginning,
because Play Games

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.520
platform services is actually
part of Google+.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.480
So it's got simple

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.360
authentication, which is great.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.830
Because people actually prefer
to log in through Google+ than

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.140
through a lot of other means,
especially when they're

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.300
playing games, as
it turns out.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.880
Interactive posts and
app activities.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.010
Now I'm not going to go through
an entire lecture on

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.090
all the ways you can
plusify your game.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.780
But the coolest thing, I think,
is interactive posts,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.520
so that's what I'm going
to talk about.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.430
So when you actually log in to
Play Games services, you get

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:58.690
for free a Google+ enabled
scope, which means you can

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.580
automatically start calling
the Google+ APIs.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.100
And this is what it
could look like.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.050
So here is our awesome game,
"Nostalgic Racer."

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.150
This is a real game.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.130
We actually use this internally
to test the APIs.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.090
And someday, hopefully, we'll
release it to all of you,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.600
because it's awesome.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.180
And as you see, it's got
a G+ Sign In button.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.890
And you can use our graphics.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.000
Once again, we have a whole
bunch of guidelines for how

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.380
you might integrate this
with your game.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.950
And then we get this nice
permission dialog, which has

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.660
tons and tons of stuff about
what you're sharing.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.540
It allows you to say, I don't
want the game to know who my

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.810
friends are, or I only want the
game to know who certain

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.790
friends are, and then I only
want certain friends of mine

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.110
to know that I'm playing the
game all sitting there.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:43.730
But then, even better, we can
create interactive posts.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.950
And these are really,
really cool.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.250
Because right now, I've added
a button in my game saying,

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.490
"Challenge me," OK?

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.200
And it has already gone and
looked at my circles and said,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.260
hey, these are the guys you have
the most affinity with.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.340
It's actually populated my
circles for me, this

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.050
particular post for me, knowing
that these are the

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.150
people that I'm most likely
to be challenging.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.520
And it's created a call to
action with this really,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.430
really cool Challenge button.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.010
So it's targeted sharing, and
it's got notification.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.070
This is sounding very salesy,
but it's really cool.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.380
I like this stuff.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:16.860
KOH KIM: It's kind of cool.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.800
Notice he didn't challenge
me, because he's

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.840
afraid I'd beat him.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.530
DAN GALPIN: No way.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.130
I'm challenging Todd.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.760
Although he's really good at the
game, because he actually

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.780
wrote an entire version of it.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.710
So I'm probably going to lose.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.270
And actually, Bruno will
complete-- well, I don't know.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.670
All right.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.810
So in any case, this is what
they end up getting

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.530
if they're in mobile.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.600
So they end up getting this
fabulous challenge right with

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.510
a call to action.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.760
If the game isn't installed,
it'll allow them to install

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.360
the game right away, OK?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.910
It can either bring them to
the store, or it can bring

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.320
them straight to the game.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.750
And this doesn't just show up
on their mobile device.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.420
This shows up on every Google
property that contains a

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.440
Google bar, right there in
that box in the corner.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.170
So this is a very, very
pervasive notification, which

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.800
is why it is an interactive
post.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.560
The user actually has
to decide they're

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.510
going to send this.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.619
And we have a lot of other verbs
other than challenge.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.720
Challenge is one of the
things we support.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.819
We support things
like gifting.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.040
And these are fully
interactive.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.060
So it cannot just take you back
to launching the game,

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.210
but it can actually contain
data that can take you to

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.990
launch exactly into the point of
the game that you want, or

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.380
actually contain metadata that
could allow you to properly

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.849
gift something to someone.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.160
So this is something
that's cool.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.460
It's on top of all of the stuff
we've already done.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.780
So remember, it takes you
directly to the game, or take

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.980
you directly to Install.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.650
So we think this can
be a great way of

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.020
helping to drive installs.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.040
All right.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.150
Enough with Play services.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.120
Let's talk a little bit about
what's going on in YouTube.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.430
And if you haven't already seen
it, there's a really,

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.290
really cool session about
YouTube and games here at

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.840
Google I/O, so you should
definitely look it up on the

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.450
streaming site.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.700
So a lot of you are already
taking advantage of YouTube

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.220
for your market listings,
which is cool.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.200
Everyone should have video in
their market listings for a

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.540
lot of reasons.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.580
One is, it turns out, gamers
really like video.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.630
In these rather old statistics,
we can see that

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.240
gamers actually found out when
they were looking to buy a

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.590
game watching gameplay videos
was the number one way they

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.540
said that they were actually
looking to buy games.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.850
Watching trailers
is number two.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.520
And then all these other things
that people spent an

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.140
enormous amount of time
working on are

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.860
actually much lower.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.930
So gameplay video is
really important.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.460
And one of the cool things we've
now released are ways in

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.160
which you can actually share
video directly from your game,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.500
actual gameplay video.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.040
So we actually have an
API now for game

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.260
video uploads and playback.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.310
Again, you should really look
at the YouTube stuff.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.320
It's very, very cool.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.540
You can see this is a game that
was built with Unity that

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.920
actually allows you to upload
3D graphics from within the

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.180
game straight to YouTube.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.040
Very, very slick.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.690
And all the source code, I
believe, is going to be

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.550
published for that if
it's not already.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.610
So think about using the
YouTube APIs, OK?

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.910
This costs you nothing, OK?

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.410
Data uploads, OK?

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.680
There's an Android
client library.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.330
It allows you to
make very large

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.350
video uploads to YouTube.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.560
And of course, the Android
Player API.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.870
Because realistically, we know
that when you download a game

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.920
for Google Play, the larger
the game is, the fewer

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.580
downloads you're going to get.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.850
That's just reality.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.900
These guys, they're all on
constrained networks.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.740
They have phones with
limited storage.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.410
So why put in an enormous video
at the beginning of your

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.830
game instead of just streaming
it from YouTube?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.050
So not only can you have the
game on YouTube so that every

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.000
time someone plays the video
within your game, you actually

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.880
get a play within YouTube, which
is kind of cool, but you

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.470
don't actually have to download
that video they're

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.890
only going to want
to watch once.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.420
There was a company who did this
years and years ago that

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.140
made a game about fowl
that were angry.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.240
And very few developers have
actually followed them, but

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.130
it's a really, really
good tactic.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.000
And strangely enough, a lot of
developers would love to be as

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.230
successful as they've been.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.290
So there's a lot more stuff
to talk about this.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.720
It's at youtube.com/dev.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.310
Look into it.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.260
It's very, very cool.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.410
There's tons of other Google
APIs you might want to take

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.310
advantage of, like even Hangouts
APIs and +1 buttons.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.250
You can actually do install
from the web if

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.460
you're using +APIs.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.610
.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.360
It's very, very cool, and I
encourage you to look at all

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.231
of it at developers.google.com.

00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:24.014
All right.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.660
KOH KIM: So the important
part.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.500
DAN GALPIN: Level three.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.920
We made it though
the first two.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.080
KOH KIM: Yes, we made it
through the first two.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.890
So it's all about
making them pay.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.190
DAN GALPIN: Oh, I
think actually

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.870
I'm doing this, right.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.970
KOH KIM: I think you're
doing this anyway.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.820
But money is important.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.150
DAN GALPIN: One of the questions
we often get from

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.350
developers is, how do I make
money on Android games?

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.330
I mean, if you're a developer,
you probably wish there was an

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.250
easy command to do that.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.650
But the truth is, it's
not that simple.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.220
To help, we've introduced
In-App Billing v3.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.090
It's easier to implement
reliably.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.680
Let's make that clear.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.580
So here's the basic idea.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.170
In the old version of In-App
Billing, you actually had to

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.740
maintain a state machine, which
you had to maintain

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.880
across a broadcast
receiver and a

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.180
service and your activity.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.260
And if you're using some game
engines, oftentimes that

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.990
service was actually running
something that wasn't running

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.980
your game engine, so you had
to then provide logic to

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.360
connect everything back.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.020
And if you were doing
managed items--

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.400
let's say you had a premium
mode of your

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.510
game you were selling--

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.740
then you also had to provide a
database to store all those

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.190
managed items.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.190
And you probably encrypted that,
because you were trying

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.070
to be really careful about
making sure that people can't

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.420
just easily hack into that.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.820
And all of these things
are things every

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.990
developer had to do.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.100
But in Billing v3, we've
actually simplified a lot of

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.620
these things.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.080
So you, for example, say, I want
to buy 100 elfberries.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.820
KOH KIM: Elfberries?

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.496
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:50.330
KOH KIM: Really?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.430
DAN GALPIN: Hey, it's fun.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.120
They're blue.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.450
And Google Play responds with
something like, OK.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.860
It's a synchronous API.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.500
It's much, much easier for
people to implement.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.300
Secondly, we now have
local item pricing.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.430
OK, this is something we should
have had from the

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.460
beginning, but we have it now.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.680
And it's really, really awesome,
because you now can

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.520
actually tell your users how
much you're going to charge

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.210
for an item before they actually
go to the Play store.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.780
You can have your entire catalog
sitting there with all

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.360
the actual prices that they're
actually going to get charged

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.390
before you actually
have to go.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.100
It's really, really
cool, right?

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.770
KOH KIM: No, it's cool, because

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.470
it's actually important.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.430
Because it doesn't revolve
around America.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.840
So you take $0.99, right?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.760
If you look at Korea or Japan or
Asia, it comes out as this

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.240
weird number, like 1,058 won.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.820
DAN GALPIN: And you should
definitely know what that

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.900
number is if you're going
to have it in your game.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.220
And you should, of course, fix
it if it is a strange number.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.220
Another thing in v3, as I
mentioned, is restoring

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.730
purchases is really,
really cheap.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.280
So it used to be in the old
days, the only way you could

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.230
possibly deal with a premium
item would be to actually

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.360
store it along with your
games database.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.450
Now with v3, you can query
Google Play as

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.480
often as you like.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.750
And that's great, because one
of the most natural times

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.905
you'd want to do that is when
you launch the game or when

00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:06.180
you come back to the game.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.910
And this also allows you to keep
track very, very easily

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.360
of where Google Play's
state is.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.650
So if they even went on another
device, purchased

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.130
premium content, you can
immediately sync that up to

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.620
your device.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.390
We actually go through and sync
all of that stuff in the

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.990
background across all of your
devices so you don't have to.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.200
And of course, as I mentioned
before, it's easier to

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.630
implement correctly.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.210
And here's the point.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.070
When a customer decides to put
their trust in you as the game

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:38.470
developer and in us as Google,
this is an incredibly

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.110
important singular moment.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.940
Because you have something
very, very valuable.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.015
It's not the $0.99 or percentage
of $0.99 that

00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:49.460
you're about to get.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.400
It's their trust.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.680
They gave you their physical
money, and they expect to get

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.760
something in return.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.250
I mean, nothing is more valuable
to a developer then

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.820
your reputation at this point.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.060
So imagine.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.910
Imagine if at that magical
moment, you take the user's

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.550
money and lose the purchase.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.380
OK, let me reiterate this,
because this may

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.670
not be clear, OK?

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.360
You've taken the user's money,
and they've lost the purchase.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.460
Now what does this mean?

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.710
OK.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.200
This is not something you want
to do, and we work very, very

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.090
hard in In-App Billing v3 to
make sure you don't do that.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.290
And also, as we roll out new
features for developers, we're

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.810
going to be rolling all of them
around In-App Billing v3.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.060
So it's very, very important
that you consider using it.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.980
What we've seen from developers
already is people

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.050
who have switched to In-App
Billing v3 have seen fewer

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.120
problems with customer service,
fewer cancellations.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.020
It is absolutely working.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.760
So please, please, please.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.740
There is a session that has been
recorded here at Google

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.270
I/O. Unfortunately, it is at
the same time as this one,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.040
otherwise I would tell
you go see it.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.560
That you should definitely go
and look up on the streams.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.070
It is a fantastic session, and
it includes this joke.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.870
KOH KIM: So we're going to talk
about other ways that you

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.990
can make money on Google Play
besides virtual coins and

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.250
magic swords and all
this other stuff.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.490
And that's subscriptions.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:15.920
Now wait--

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.480
DAN GALPIN: Well, you can use
subscriptions to buy virtual

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.400
coins and magic swords.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.910
KOH KIM: Sure.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:19.200
DAN GALPIN: OK.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.270
Just want to make that clear.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.190
KOH KIM: I'm just saying,
instead of it being a one-time

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.410
purchase, right, what if this
user is like, hey, I actually

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.600
want to keep this item?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.680
Usually most items only
last a day, right,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.270
those experience boosters.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.130
Now what if you can get a user
to be like, hey, I want to get

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.400
this 50% experience booster
til end of time?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.980
Well, that's where your can use
subscriptions as part of

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.110
your in-app purchases.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.930
So they can actually make a big
difference when done well.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.080
And so we actually had a game
developer, Glu Mobile, that

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.070
has implemented this within
"Eternity Warriors 2." Now if

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.420
you see, what was very
interesting is-- let's say

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.320
subscription is in blue.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.120
In-app purchase, just
like buying items

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.280
individually, is in red--

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.700
so you see, subscription revenue
is actually making

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.860
more revenue than their
in-app purchases.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.940
So I'm not saying you
should do this to

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.950
every one of your games.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.190
It obviously matters.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.610
You've got to look at
your game, make sure

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.870
it's the right thing.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:14.410
But I mean, it is also a
viable way to not even

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.270
increase, but at least continue
and maintain that

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.030
custom relationship you
have with your user.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.250
Because once they open that
wallet, that's actually very,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.030
very important.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.900
It doesn't happen that often.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.640
DAN GALPIN: And another
to thing to consider.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.690
I mean, a lot of the complaints
that people say

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.960
about free-to-play games is
that they don't feel like

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.640
they're getting enough value
for purchases, and

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.590
subscriptions is a way to
kind of close that gap.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.700
For the person who is a hardcore
player who knows

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.560
they're going to be playing this
game a lot in the next

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.810
couple of weeks, months,
years, you can actually

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.990
provide them ways of saying,
look, here's a way in which we

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.630
can give you extra value for
your money in the game.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.000
And so I think it's actually a
very powerful thing for people

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.600
who wouldn't normally be buying
premium games but now

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.270
are actually looking at things
that are premium.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.580
KOH KIM: So it's another
way to think about it.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.760
Let's also talk about other
things, other payment options.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.670
So we, as many of you already
know, we offer direct carrier

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.510
billing to a lot of our users.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.630
They cover nearly 50%
of our user base,

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.350
which is great, right?

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.310
You see all these carriers.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.160
They all have direct
carrier billing

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.120
implemented with the game.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.510
And obviously, we're trying
to expand more as we go.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.370
So if you're interested on what
the update on that is,

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.780
you can also go to this talk
on making money in Google

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.420
Play, which is tomorrow.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.790
But then we also have
gift cards.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.030
And yes, gift cards are only

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.420
available in certain countries.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:21.990
I'm sorry.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.230
We're trying to expand it.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.310
There's many other countries
that would like gift cards,

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.260
because not everyone in the
world has a credit card or

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:28.970
direct carrier billing.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.630
So we're working on it, but it's
just to know that there

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.150
are many options available
to users.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.170
Because we care.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.110
Users like to pay for things
in different ways.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.600
DAN GALPIN: We like
to help users pay.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.740
We do.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.060
KOH KIM: It makes
your job easier.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.360
So level four.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.670
Global empires.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.500
So how many of you have traveled
from outside the

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.000
United States and San Francisco
to get here?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.360
See?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.010
A very significant
portion of you.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.160
Asia, Europe--

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.900
DAN GALPIN: This is a really big
room, by the way, for you

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.010
who are watching this
on the stream.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.530
KOH KIM: And of course, everyone
that's watching our

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.440
livestream right now, right?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.600
Clearly, there's probably a
good portion of them from

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.990
abroad who's not been
in the thing.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.680
Well, what's great is
Android is big all

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.810
over the world, right?

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.830
And also, Google Play is
available in 130 countries, so

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.530
you should probably be doing
business with all of this.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:25.220
So I'm actually living
in Korea right now.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.270
I'm kind of doing some Games
work while in Korea.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.090
DAN GALPIN: I thought
you were here now.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.180
KOH KIM: Yes.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.530
I'm here now, obviously,
but I'm visiting.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.840
But in this case, actually I was
in G-STAR, which is kind

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.480
of this large video game
conference in Korea about in

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.180
November 2012.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.430
And the way to think about it is
100,000 people, all gamers,

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.900
kind of like checking
out what's new.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.370
What was actually really
incredible is that on the show

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.320
floor, 80%--

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.620
literally 80%.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.620
There were some random consoles
that were still

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:58.550
there-- but 80% of the floor was
covered with mobile games.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.940
And what are most of those
games being played on?

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.970
What devices?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.940
Well, I mean, as you've
probably figured,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.990
it's Android devices.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.580
And what's great is because of
this, Google Play is actually

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.520
growing faster than
devices activated.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.480
I don't need to remind you.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.950
It's the 48 billion installs,
and a lot of

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.080
that is actually games.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.450
And so that's great
for your business.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.840
It's a huge opportunity,
right?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.090
What are we talking about?

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.220
So at this point last year, we
didn't really talk about how

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.470
you can make money abroad
or all this stuff.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.910
But I mean, this is probably the
time to think about how to

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.940
expand beyond your own market.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.590
So for one thing is that I was
talking to my Korean cousin

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.750
about a certain game, and
she's was telling me

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.000
[SPEAKING KOREAN].

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.900
So you probably don't
understand

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.510
that, but it's Korean.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.180
They were kind of complaining
the game was only in English,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.470
and they'd like to play it in
Korean if it was available, or

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.880
asking me if I knew the
developer was going

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.380
to launch in Korean.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.440
So what does that mean?

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.420
You actually have a larger
fanbase that could be out

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.770
there, and especially since some
of our fastest growing

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.730
markets are in Asia,
specifically especially Japan,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.760
Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.780
You probably should start
thinking about how I should

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.820
take my game kind of globally
or outside my borders.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.450
So let's take an example of
"Gun Bros 2," which is a

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.930
pretty neat game from
Glu Mobile.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.260
I mean, this is kind of like
what their page looks like

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.260
from the US or any

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.210
English-speaking territory, right?

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.940
So in January, we actually
launched the ability for you

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:38.210
to upload localized assets, so
screenshots, graphics, icons,

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.190
and banners.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.420
And you can change
them by region.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.640
So what does this mean?

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.762
Glu decided to create a Korean
version of their game.

00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:47.680
DAN GALPIN: Oh, now it looks
like I'm going to blow things

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.910
up in Korean.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.730
KOH KIM: Now imagine as
a Korean user how

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.840
excited you could be.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.110
Because this looks pretty
cool, right?

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.050
Look, all the titles
are Korean.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.350
That actually says "Gun
Bros 2" in Korean.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.820
I actually think the title in
Korean looks a lot better than

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.960
the English version.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.000
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
it's awesome.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.660
I want to play the Korean
version more.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.450
There's something cooler
about that.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.940
KOH KIM: So what
does this mean?

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.490
Well, if your user can
understand what this game is

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.610
and what it's about, it's
probably more likely they're

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.630
going to actually download
and install the game.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.840
DAN GALPIN: Probably.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.970
KOH KIM: So is it really
worth it, right?

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.940
I mean, that's a lot
of languages.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.240
DAN GALPIN: Probably?

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.680
I think it's incredibly
more likely.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.170
KOH KIM: Right.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.700
Probably incredibly more
likely, right?

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.940
And so, how much more likely?

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.140
Well, let's talk about
this, right?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.240
So we're talking about two
launches from Glu Mobile.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.910
So they've launched two games.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.080
One was "Eternity Warriors 2,"
and also the next game was

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.470
"Blood &amp; Glory Legend."
They were

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.140
actually only a week apart.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.380
They were launched in
about August 2012.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.330
So the only difference is that
"Eternity Warriors 2" was

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.890
actually localized in
Korean at launch.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.270
Meanwhile, "Blood &amp; Glory Legend
2" was only available

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.020
in English.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.730
DAN GALPIN: The icons
almost look--

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.030
You can't even tell which
game is all that

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:55.850
different from the other.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.320
In one, I guess they wear armor,
and the other one--

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.250
KOH KIM: Has glowing eyes.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.960
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's
pretty close, OK?

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.460
KOH KIM: So let's check
out what happened.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.680
Obviously, a tale
of two launches.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.080
So let's talk about Glu
Mobile downloads.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.730
"Eternity Warriors 2" is the one
in blue, and the "Blood &amp;

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.850
Glory Legend" is in red.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:14.960
This is for Korea.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.290
So you can notice that the
downloads for a game, because

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.600
the game was localized in
Korean, was significantly

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.840
higher than the "Blood
&amp; Glory Legend." Is

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.180
that actually installs?

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.270
DAN GALPIN: Those
are downloads.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.670
That's flatlining there.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.160
That's incredible.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.260
KOH KIM: But yeah, downloads
are great, right?

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.620
It doesn't matter if
they don't pay.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.020
DAN GALPIN: Is this
in Korea then?

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.980
KOH KIM: This is
just in Korea.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.035
DAN GALPIN: Just in Korea, OK.

00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:39.560
I'm like, I hope they got a few
downloads in the rest of

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.480
the world, at least.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:40.810
KOH KIM: Oh, yes.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.720
I'm sure they did in other
English-speaking territories.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.050
But I mean, the thing is, you
can get downloads, right?

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.660
That's great.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.550
But will these users
actually pay?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.240
Well, let's look at revenue.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:52.845
Yeah.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:54.940
So yeah, these users will pay
if the game is actually in

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.030
their local language.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.170
DAN GALPIN: So wait.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.740
So more users and happy users
means more revenue.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:32:59.840
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.606
DAN GALPIN: That sounds like
something we said earlier.

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:01.960
KOH KIM: Right.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.600
Not-so-secret formula, guys.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.080
You always gotta think about
your user, right?

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.700
So it doesn't matter if they're
in Korea, Japan,

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.450
Russia, Brazil.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.110
I mean, it's always nice to have
their game in their local

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.960
language, because then they can
actually enjoy it more.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.980
It's all about the user.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.750
That's what we're here for.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.880
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.410
KOH KIM: So let's talk about
another developer, right?

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.910
You've probably heard
enough about Glu.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.700
We don't really care anymore.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.860
Tell me about some
other developer.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.360
So let's talk about
Gameloft, right?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.690
So they've been enjoying the
whole mobile game revenue,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.530
making lots of money, 190%
year over year growth.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.140
By the way, data not really
reflective, but just to show

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.210
you percentages.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.170
Now they started localizing
in Korean, right?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.420
And so this is what happened.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.100
Korea, all of a sudden, is
increased to 520%, just

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.370
because they started localizing
in Korean.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.080
And now the Korean market
is actually one of their

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.190
fastest-growing markets
by revenue

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.360
within their portfolio.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.130
And this is not just Gameloft
either, right?

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.190
I mean, we have publishers like
EA that have seen very

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.760
similar revenue growth lifts,
about 30% or even higher for

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.900
some territories that don't have
enough English speakers.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.080
And tons of my other developers
as well have noted

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.100
that they're just seeing a lot
higher revenue, especially in

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.560
those markets, just for
being in Korean,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.500
Japanese, or all those.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.340
So what does this mean?

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.850
Well, so localization does
not equal translation.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.340
Let me make that clear.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.199
Localization does not
equal translation.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.150
So what does that mean?

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.210
Well, you can do translated
strings, right?

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.830
That's awesome, but you've
really got to think about your

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.380
game, right?

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.370
Each market is different.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.810
Each user is different.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.219
They're going to be to different
ways of paying.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.239
They're going to be used to
different ways of gameplay,

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:43.840
leveling up.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.940
DAN GALPIN: And not every game
should be localized.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.449
Look, I mean, if you're going to
be talking about the great

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.570
American sport of football, you
should figure out which

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.580
countries are actually
going to like that.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.860
But certainly, there's a lot of
things that will translate

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.270
very, very well to a
global audience.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.730
And that's what we're seeing is
that when developers take

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.680
the time to actually make their
game work for a global

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.770
audience, they get paid
back in spades.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.990
OK, we're going to
move quickly.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.420
We're almost out of time here.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.880
KOH KIM: We've got
to move quickly.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.380
Sorry, moving really quickly.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.050
But if you want to find out
more, we're going to talk

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.040
about Korea.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.770
We'll show it later.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.890
But we also have an
awesome talk.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.782
DAN GALPIN: We have a talk about
building Android apps

00:35:12.782 --> 00:35:14.720
for a global audience tomorrow,
and a Play office

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.733
hours talk on Korea and Japan
Friday afternoon, where you

00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:17.860
get to see more Koh.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.900
KOH KIM: More me.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.600
So next.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.093
Quickly, quickly.

00:35:21.093 --> 00:35:21.920
(IN UNISON): The bonus round!

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.250
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.220
So how many of you have visited
our arcade out there

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.370
that we have out
in the Sandbox?

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.520
Like four of you.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.760
Come on, some of you must
be game developers.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.590
All right, all right,
a few more.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.840
So we've talked a lot about game
controllers in the past.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.730
We added support for standard
HID controllers in Honeycomb,

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.660
and it's been gratifying to see
a lot of games having some

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.610
limited support for them.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.660
But here's the problem, OK?

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:42.950
I'm a gamer.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.630
I've got "Nostalgic Racer"
which, of course is my

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.800
favorite test game that
we used to build

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.460
Google Play game services.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.700
And I was excited to see that it
had support for a nostalgic

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.630
controller-- woo-hoo!--

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.310
so making gamers like me happy.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.780
OK.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.150
What this means is that you
should actually make sure

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.110
you're using defaults for all of
these things in your menus,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.680
especially the Action button.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.670
Because we kind of screwed up,
and I'll go into a bit of

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.950
detail about that.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.240
So here's a generic
controller.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.530
This looks like a controller
from any number of consoles.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.590
In fact it turns out if you plug
in an OEM Xbox or OEM PS3

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.750
controller into an Android
device, it actually maps

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.140
almost exactly like this.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.760
Not every third-party controller
will work this way,

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.590
because these are actually done
using Linux drivers that

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.010
have been contributed
from the community.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.800
So we actually will map both
to the axis hat, which is

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.810
actually an analog axis, for
some bizarre reason, in HID,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.560
and axis-x and axis-y into D-pad
events for you, which is

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.340
really, really cool.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.210
We also map the x and y into
D-pad center, which is really

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.130
cool as well.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.050
And we map A and B both to the
Back button, which kind of

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.220
sucks, because no one really
thinks the A button should go

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.470
back, not even us.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.080
So what you should really do is
make sure that if you are

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.020
going to bother handling these
things, make sure to handle

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.100
the A button explicitly.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.710
That's all this entire
slide was about.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.530
All right, other
common buttons.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.860
Make them do things.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.720
All right, now other
common buttons.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.170
Make them do things too.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.050
And here's the final thing
I want to say.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.180
You also probably want to handle
analog input, a lot of

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.300
you, because it's really
important.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.140
A lot of these games are
designed around touch screens.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.450
Analog input is important.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.050
So we have analog axes, OK?

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.092
As it turns out, most of
these axes are going

00:37:13.092 --> 00:37:14.250
to look like this.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.960
You actually have to be a little
bit careful when you're

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.440
handling the two front triggers,
because they're

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.490
going to come in on
most devices, and

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.580
that's also hat switch.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.790
Let me explain this quickly.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:29.080
So if you're handling analog
axes, and you want to handle

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.220
D-pad events, you actually have
to make sure you handle

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.880
both D-pad events and handle
the hat switch.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.140
Because what we end up doing
is bundling motion events

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.990
together, and if you say that
you're handling all of them,

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.340
we'll never generate D-pad
events for you anymore.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.490
Because we're like, oh,
the game's got it.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.020
We don't need to do those
legacy events for it.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.750
So if you want to handle D-pad,
you also have to handle

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.080
hat switch.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.090
And one more thing to note
on this is that if you're

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.960
handling the triggers, you
actually need make sure you're

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.640
handling both RTrigger
and Throttle and

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.670
LTrigger and Brake.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.210
They will almost always be the
same thing, because it turns

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.660
out that most of the drivers
in the Linux kernel will

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.580
actually map everything to
Throttle and Brake, no matter

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.600
what the device sends out.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.740
And as it turns out, the HID
spec mostly sends out

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.710
Throttle and Brake.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.090
So unless you have an Xbox
controller today with the

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.850
current versions, you're
actually not going to get

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.630
LTrigger and RTrigger--

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.780
or a Shield device, I think,
will do the same thing.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.000
But Throttle and Brake
are things you

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.710
want to handle together.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.510
So think of these as being
synonymous for now.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.800
At least your defaults should
handle them that way.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.040
All right.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.800
That was a lot of information
in a very short time.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.930
But there's a lot of sessions
of interest you should see

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.170
here while you're here at Google
I/O. These are things

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.450
that haven't happened yet.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.400
So we have "Android As Seen On
TV," which is going to have

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.880
some awesome use for
game developers.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.010
We're going to have--

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.610
KOH KIM: "Building Apps for
a Global Audience," where

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.220
they're going to talk about some
of the APIs, some of the

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.890
new features that was announced
in keynote and how

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.860
you can implement that within
your application.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.270
DAN GALPIN: "What's New for Devs
in Google Play," which

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.380
has got some super exciting
stuff going on, as well as--

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.900
KOH KIM: "Getting Discovered
on Google Play,' which I

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.960
actually highly recommend going
to, because it talks

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.140
about how that entire
magic box works.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.230
DAN GALPIN: Finally, "Making
Money on Google Play," and

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.370
then "Make Your Game More Social
Codelab," which is a

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.330
codelab where you can either
bring your own game, or you

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.860
can actually use our game and
implement Google Play services

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.260
in your game.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.730
And that is it.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.560
Thank you very much.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560
KOH KIM: Thank you very much.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.737
[APPLAUSE]
