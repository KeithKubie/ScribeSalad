00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.804
Greg and Lauren have a problem, the changing tides of the ocean causes them

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:08.898
stress. Greg faces a stressful event with his problem focus coping strategy

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:13.980
again. In problem focus coping Greg looks for strategies are ways to change a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.417
situation so the stress is reduced. So Greg spends hours and hours trying to

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:22.357
find a way to stop the changing of the tide so he can enjoy a day at the beach

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:27.782
with his wife and two sons. However, as we know, this is a problem he is not

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:30.870
going to be able to change. Poor Greg.
