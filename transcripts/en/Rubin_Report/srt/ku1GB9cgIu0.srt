1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,550
Bikes
with them.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,981
All right?

3
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:20,981
People were alive on the Youtube and I've
got the sage of the alt right without

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,510
the rain, without the rage. Payroll Age,
without the rate of the Ri. Ben Shapiro,

5
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:29,420
welcome back as gun. All right, we've
got a lot of things to talk about.

6
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,300
I want to cover a ton of new ground.
I read your book over the weekend.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,270
You have a new Prager u video going up.

8
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,150
You're still doing this daily wire
thing and a thousand other things.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,300
So we got a lot to do here, but let,
let's just start with this. All right,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,830
nonsense. Um, I hate that we even have to
talk about it. It's so freaking stupid,

11
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,650
but this happens to be the world
that we live in at the moment.

12
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:52,260
So about two weeks ago or
about 10 days ago or so, uh,

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,190
the economists did an interview with you.
Uh,

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,440
I assume that was by the phone
probably originally. Yeah.

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,980
So you did a phone interview with
them and they, they're really nice.

16
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,020
The interview, by the way, I get
a yes, you read the transcript.

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,510
It's perfectly nice. A little bit
adversarial, but that's good. That's fine.

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,180
They usually are Shapiro.
That's how it works. Right?

19
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,970
Like the interviews themselves and the
thoughts usually stand on their own.

20
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:15,770
Anyway. They, they published this
interview and what was the title?

21
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,700
It was called the [inaudible] Shapiro.
The outright sage without the rage,

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,250
which is wrong.
Then at least a couple of scores.

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,590
Any half the media tries to portray you
as if you've got this evil rage within

24
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,910
you all the time.
But I thought that was funny on it,

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,300
which is weird cause you met me and him.
I'm fairly calm.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,960
This is really all the time. This is about
as rage as it gets right here. Yeah. So,

27
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,920
okay, let's put aside the
rage part. The Ot right.

28
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,440
Parked and just what the media
is constantly doing. So, okay.

29
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:45,880
So after you publicly then shame them
forward and everybody jumped on board to,

30
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,950
to defend you. Um, and you know,

31
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,080
all these things got thousands
and thousands of retweets.

32
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,010
Eventually they did a printer retraction.
They apologized.

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
They apologized and they,
you know,

34
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:57,940
they appreciate [inaudible] where
basically they just said, oh,

35
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:01,060
he's not part of the alt right,
and it's like, well, what
just happened here? Right.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,190
You guys just said he's the sage of the,
all right.

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,890
There's this thing called
the Google machine. Yeah.

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,150
If they had just typed in
my name with all right,

39
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,640
they would have seen probably the
first result is a piece I wrote for The

40
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,060
Washington Post in 2015 talking about
how evil the alt right as if they,

41
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:17,690
I mean it was a review of the book.
I mean in the book which you have read,

42
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,390
I referenced the alt right I think three
or four separate times and talk about

43
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,060
how terrible their ideas are
and how evil their ideology is.

44
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,380
No white supremacy is gross.

45
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,640
The whole point of the book is that
you're trying to show people the clean way

46
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,790
to think there was sort of right way
to think so that you don't fall prey

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,713
correct to those things.

48
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,680
Then Western civilization
is not built on race.

49
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,990
Western civilization is built
on certain immutable principles.

50
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:37,980
That's the basis of the book.

51
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:41,130
It's the basis of conservatism
to a more classical liberalism.

52
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,590
I mean all of this is
built on the same idea,

53
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:47,970
which is that this stuff is not
relegated to race. Like I'm a Jew. Okay.

54
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,640
The Jews weren't part of that
original white people bargain.

55
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,750
If there was a white people bargain and
you're Jewish too. I mean like come on.

56
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,420
I mean this is all, it's all
bullshit but it's it. But,

57
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,190
and I've done open battle with the alt
right for legitimately years. I mean

58
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,160
I always cite the statutes because
it's a useful step, but it's true.

59
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,500
I mean I was attacking more than than
any other Jewish journalists on the line

60
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,360
in 2016 the vast majority of
that crap was from the alt right.

61
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,820
The alt right still hates my guts.

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,910
I have to have significant security
around me nearly all times because of the

63
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,620
number of threats we get
from people on the alt right.

64
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,300
And I'm being called out
right by the economist,

65
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,300
which is supposed to be a center right.
Magazine in Europe.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,090
Is that, that I think is the
question. It's like everyone gets it.

67
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:26,170
This is what the media does. They don't
mind. They lie, they label, they smear,

68
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,720
all of those things. Everyone
understands that. But what is it?

69
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,210
The economist is basically a respectable
as you can center right magazine this,

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,240
these are people who you would think
ideologically basically line up with you.

71
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,280
So what do you think is
truly going on there?

72
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,450
Is it purely just the quest for clicks
put Shapiro's picture? I put, all right,

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
all hell is going to bring it up.

74
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,590
I'm wondering, so what is it
I tend to hold by, you know,

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
the Hanlon's razor idea that it's mostly
ignorance and not malice and I think

76
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,650
for some of these people it is ignorance.

77
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,830
I think that for the economist then they
apologized within a couple of hours.

78
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,060
I think it legitimately was,

79
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,730
there was somebody writing and headline
who doesn't know what the alt right is.

80
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,610
They don't know the difference between
the outright and conservatism in the

81
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,410
United States and in Europe.

82
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,650
The alt right is a lot closer
to European right wing populism.

83
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,890
Then the alright is to American
conservatism and a lot of ways,

84
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,610
and so I think they just figure
anybody who's anti-left is all right.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
I mean they've labeled Jordan outright,
they've labeled you outright right now,

86
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:24,090
like not the economist, but a lot of
people in the media will do this routine.

87
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,520
They'll, they'll say that the
IDW generally is all right.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,490
I believe I'm the only registered
Republican as far as I'm aware in the,

89
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:33,960
in the IDW, it's absurd. People that
voted for Bernie. Yeah, exactly.

90
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,170
The more people who voted for Bernie
than voted for Trump among members of the

91
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:40,590
IDW, I think that's fair to
say. Correct. I'm pretty sure
that's true, right? I mean,

92
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:43,380
I think Brett voted for Bernie. I
think that Eric voted for Bernie. Uh,

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
I know that, uh, Sam voted
for Hillary like that.

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
There are many more members
of the political life voted
for Gary Johnson. Right.

95
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,850
You voted for Gary Johnson Ford.
I didn't vote.

96
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,640
I didn't vote at all in the 2016
election at the top of the ticket.

97
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,970
So I'm not sure if there was one
person who voted for Trump in the IDW,

98
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,060
but we become outright because if
you're a heterodox thinker or if you're

99
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,000
somebody who asks questions and
then comes up with with answers that

100
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,220
specifically are designed
to reject the outright,

101
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,760
then you are suddenly a member of the
outright just by taking the questions

102
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,350
seriously. And this is part of
that's really dangerous, right?

103
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,200
You see this with Steven Pinker, I think
this is the best example that I saw.

104
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,800
You remember Steven pinker gave the
speech a few years back where he said,

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,131
you know,

106
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,800
the problem with the rise of the alt
right is that there are a bunch of people

107
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,980
on the left are rejecting the question
and then they refused to give an answer

108
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:23,581
to the question.

109
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:26,130
And so people go looking for the answer
and the only answer they get is the

110
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:29,280
worst answer. He wasn't defending
the Ansi rats the point,

111
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,200
the whole point of his speech was no.

112
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:34,950
We need to give the correct answers that
people don't fall prey to the stupid

113
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,740
crap that's being said about race and Iq,
for example.

114
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,440
But we can't ignore the questions about
race and Iq because otherwise people are

115
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,120
still going to look for the
answers to these questions.

116
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,680
And what he's saying is effectively the
same thing that people in the religious

117
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,690
community are constantly saying about,
you know,

118
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,970
you see people who go to Sunday
school and then it's like, well,

119
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,940
I asked all my questions and the
rabbi or the pastor or the priest,

120
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,070
they all said, you know, you're
not allowed to ask those questions.

121
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,150
And so I left the religion.

122
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,310
That's what pinker is saying about logic
and reason in western civilized ideas

123
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,220
that people came in and they ask these
questions and instead of the questions

124
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,990
being answered, people like, you're
not allowed to ask that question.

125
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,700
It's a very bad question. And you saw
vodkas did this too to Sam Harris, right?

126
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,270
When Sam was talking about race and Iq.
And when people say that,

127
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,770
when people ask about whether Islam
has a problem with violence right then,

128
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,960
then this is considered
an outright perspective.

129
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,130
And so they'll band Jordan's
book in Christ church from,

130
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:28,340
from with Kohl's briefly based on the
idea that Jordan has suggested that

131
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,670
Islamophobia is an overused term and
is misapplied. Right. That that's,

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,210
that's also took that picture
with the guy in the shirt,

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,590
the human with the human,

134
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,780
and you've done many of these and
I've been on tour with Jordan.

135
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,210
He said he's been taking pictures
with about 30,000 people that, yeah,

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,520
I would imagine that's a low estimate.

137
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:47,690
Probably been there where he's had
lines of hundreds of people course after

138
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,080
giving a two hour lecture after
doing 10 interviews during the day,

139
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,910
after flying into the city that morning.

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,530
The idea that he's investigating what
everyone's wearing or that anyone is

141
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,100
paying any attention to that,
the,

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,160
I forget what you think about
what it would sell it unless,

143
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,610
unless the shirt legitimately as a
giant swastika or giant hammer sickle or

144
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:08,450
something like people are
milled through every 10 seconds.

145
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,370
I mean those generally come up, they
take the picture, they shake your hand,

146
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,520
they leave. I mean, you guys have
done tens of thousands of pictures.

147
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:17,030
I've done tens of thousands. I don't
remember any of the pictures that I took.

148
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,300
I mean legitimately I remember the idea
was that he took a picture with this guy.

149
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:20,950
Now we're going to,

150
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,660
right now we're going to ban his book
because then the Cambridge thing,

151
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,820
which is even worse, right?
That that that was even worse,

152
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,290
but I mean even in the New
Zealand thing where the,

153
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,940
the notion that you are going to be
able to crack down on white supremacy by

154
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,510
banning speech generally is so dangerous.
And listen,

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,010
if white supremacy will crack down on,

156
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,130
I'd be one of the chief beneficiaries
of the crackdowns since,

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,950
I mean they hate me. Right. We'll set it.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,540
I sat on rogue and I'm
not going to do it again.

159
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,780
I'm being really careful about my
f word. Use it. We have one of the,

160
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,570
I mean as you know,
because we're friends,

161
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,330
one of the bizarre things is how little
I on camera and how much I crossed off

162
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,630
camera. That's a lot of f bombs
off a lot of f bombs off camera.

163
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:01,070
But good morning then go fucking
mornings and erect. Exactly. But it's,

164
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,000
but that mean New Zealand legitimately
is now going to prosecute people who

165
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,540
downloaded the manifesto for
the white supremacist. And
I thought to myself, well,

166
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,360
I downloaded it because I wanted to read
what was in there so that I knew how to

167
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,790
rebut it. I mean, the solution to this
stuff is not to crack down on speech.

168
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,480
It was really scary. All right, so
there's so much I want to do here.

169
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:18,860
So just let's go with that for a second.

170
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,710
So in a case of what
happened in Christ church,

171
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,490
do you think actually that reading
it does add value? Because I get,

172
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,020
you want to understand it a little bit,

173
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,990
at least the people that are talking
about, right, but in another way,

174
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,801
it doesn't adjust,

175
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,220
incentivize other people to do crazy
things because that it's like, Holy Shit,

176
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,980
Ben Shapiro, all these,
all these Internet people,

177
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,320
they're going to read what I said,
even if it's complete insanity.

178
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:43,340
And this thing had conflicting, I openly
said, don't mention the guy's name. Don't,

179
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,040
don't repeat his,
his ideas don't guys never publicly,

180
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,290
we don't publish names of
shooters. We won't do it. I,

181
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,960
and I even instructed our people like
only report on the manifesto to the extent

182
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,910
necessary to knock down myths about the
manifesto. And that was the big problem.

183
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,670
The reason that I downloaded it was not
because I originally wanted to read what

184
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,650
the guy said because you don't
want to give that credence.

185
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,010
It's because the media started immediately
misreporting what the guy had said

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,400
and effectively doing exactly
what he told them to do,

187
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,020
which is report on everything that I say.

188
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,380
So to so as to divide people and then
the division itself will create more

189
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,410
polarization in society,
which is what I want.

190
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,650
I mean he says this in the manifesto and,
and the, and the media were like, yeah,

191
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,810
let's, let's do that
thing, which is, you know,

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,830
it's interesting which manifestos they
choose to report on and which ones become

193
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,500
irrelevant nearly as soon
as they are released. I mean

194
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,650
other show really and how
they decide what is relevant.

195
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,710
But I will say regardless of what, like
I don't think it should be distributed.

196
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,800
I don't think people should read it.
But if you do pick it up and read it,

197
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't think that you should
be arrested for that. I mean,

198
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,340
criminalizing people who downloaded
a file seems to me really,

199
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,580
really dangerous stuff because you can
link virtually anything. I mean they,

200
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,410
again, they tried to ban the bestselling
book on planet Earth from the biggest

201
00:09:55,411 --> 00:10:00,000
bookseller in New Zealand because Jordan
was in a picture with a human like,

202
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,960
I don't trust, I don't trust
anybody to regulate speech that way.

203
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,180
Or were they looking to arrest people
that shared the video also? Yeah,

204
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,140
they're doing that too.

205
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:11,310
And now they're saying they want to
hold members of social media hierarchies

206
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,250
personally responsible for
distribution of bad material.

207
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:17,580
This is one of the things that are pushing
in in the UK is that they're trying

208
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,400
to regulate social media to the extent
that they could haul Zuckerberg in the

209
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
court.
And Jaylen,

210
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,200
if certain controversial material
is distributed via via Facebook.

211
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,810
I mean this is not,
it's UNAMERICAN is the easy way to say it,

212
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,660
but it's not on European I guess.
Do you think that's why he's Zuckerberg?

213
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:34,500
Just in the last week has sort of been
hinting off like regulate me please.

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
They actually want
regulation now. Well, yeah,

215
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,780
I think that what's happening
for Zuckerberg will get
them off the hook. Right,

216
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:42,450
exactly. It's a couple
of things. One is the,

217
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,420
he's hoping for regulation from the
United States government because he knows

218
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,130
he's going to get regulated
from the Europeans.

219
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,340
And what he is afraid of is being stuck
in this catch 22 where the Europeans

220
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,980
regulate him on speech.
And then for business reasons,

221
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,690
he starts using those regulations as the
basis for policing stuff in the United

222
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,070
States. And then people in
the United States say, well,

223
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,080
you're policing and policing is not even,

224
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,230
and so you're actually an editorial outlet
now and you should be treated like an

225
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,630
editorial outlet as opposed
to like arguments for that
or I think they should be,

226
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,750
they should do it for,
for a long time.

227
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,970
I think they should be treated like an
editorial outlet if they're going to act

228
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,130
like an editorial outlet. Um, but he,

229
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,110
he stuck sort of between
a rock and a hard place.

230
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,290
Whenever you see a business
that is calling for additional
regulation on itself,

231
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:23,220
you can fairly guarantee that this is
a corporatist attempt to crowd other

232
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,380
people out of the market
and to avoid responsibility.

233
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,960
And it seems to me that that's mainly
what's happening here. All right,

234
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,740
so let's back up for a second.
So after the Christchurch attack,

235
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,590
blue check, Twitter went
completely bananas on you. On me,

236
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,910
on several other people, Sam Jordan,
everybody. Well, it's fun on Sam.

237
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,380
Um, none of us have ever called
for violence obviously. Of course,

238
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,870
single one of us have no
problem condemning this.

239
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:52,080
Want these things to be stopped or I can
see the glossed over and look in your

240
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,070
eyes as I'm saying it, it's,
it's, it's securing and

241
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,170
boring to have to say it.
Um,

242
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,290
what do you think our
responsibility or our,

243
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,380
our duty to respond to some of this is?

244
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,860
Because it seems to me it's getting
haywire, the people that when someone,

245
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,940
when 50 people are killed in a horrific
attack halfway across the world,

246
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,530
when that happens, and then blue check
journalists directly blame you. Let's say,

247
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,940
let's just keep this on you for a second.

248
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,590
It seems to me they're putting more of
a price tag on your head or a more of a

249
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,010
direct threat on your head.
Then anything that you have ever said.

250
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,290
I mean, I think that's true. I think
there's not much I can do about it.

251
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,380
I mean it there,

252
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,790
there's certain material that obviously
is libelous and theoretically you could

253
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,950
take legal action,
but I'm a public figure.

254
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,470
That means I'm going to take plenty of
slings and arrows and that's fine. I mean,

255
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,460
that's,
that's part of the debate.

256
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm the one advocating that we should be
able to speak about this stuff as much

257
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,421
as you want to.

258
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:45,710
It's one thing for the economist to label
me a label that is clearly not true.

259
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,180
It's another thing for people to draw the
attenuated sort of connection between.

260
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:55,130
I've criticized Islams violent tendencies
across the world without saying that

261
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:57,020
every Muslim is violent or,

262
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,930
and certainly not saying that any
Muslims should be treated with violence.

263
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,910
I mean, I've never sent any
of that stuff. But if you want

264
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,290
Jewish theologians and
Catholic theologians,

265
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,110
Christian theologians have been arguing
about what's in the Bible and what it

266
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,450
all means. And all of those
things specifically be insane.

267
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,140
I specifically say, and I've been saying
this for as long as I can remember,

268
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,700
I do not analyze the Quran.

269
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,120
I do not analyze the religion of Islam
because you can go through the religious

270
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,920
tax of virtually any religion,
including my own,

271
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:23,230
and find stuff that is deeply
uncomfortable and ugly.

272
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,020
And that's why I believe in a
reinterpreted structure. I mean,

273
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,690
I talk about that in the book and we'll
get to that, I'm sure, but it's, but the,

274
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:32,290
but the fact is that the balance between
reason and revelation is very key to my

275
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:36,010
thinking. And so I don't look at the Quran
and go looking for versus to take the,

276
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm not an Islamic scholar.
There are many people who are there,

277
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,150
they're moderate and reform Muslims.

278
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:43,120
So I've had routinely on my radio
show to try and talk about the

279
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:46,090
reinterpretation of Islam. They're much
better situated to do that than I am.

280
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,490
All I can do is point
out that by polling data,

281
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,460
there are a lot of Muslims across the
world who believes some really radical

282
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:55,000
things that if any Christian believed
them, the media would immediately say,

283
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,220
this person is a radical
Christian by any definition.

284
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,060
So I point that out and suddenly it's,
I'm saying that what now I'm just,

285
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,070
I'm calling for violence against people
quite don't know. So who do I don't,

286
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,840
I don't know what they, not only,
I don't know what they think,

287
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,190
but they're allowed to think
whatever the hell they want.

288
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,200
You can think what you want without
being subjected to violence.

289
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,990
I don't know how they act. I don't
know any of that stuff. I mean,

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,070
it's its absurdity on its face,
and yet the attempt is of course,

291
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,770
to be, I mean, you and
you saw the media do this,

292
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:25,240
they immediately shifted from what
happened in Christchurch is the result of

293
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,990
people who are critical, particularly of
Ilhan. Omar, you actually saw this, right?

294
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,040
There's this move to say, well, if
you call Ilhan Omar an antisemite,

295
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,960
then you're contributing to just the
kind of Islamophobia that lead's what

296
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,610
happened in Christ. It's
like, wait, hold on a second.

297
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,180
I defended Ilhan Omar being able to
wear he job on the, on the house floor.

298
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,550
I think that's a good thing. I wear
a funny hat all day long, right?

299
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,470
Like that's fine with me. I
don't care. I think that's good.

300
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,270
I W I came out originally against Trump's
originally formulated Muslim ban when

301
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,980
he was like, yeah, no Muslims
coming in. I said, this is,

302
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,380
this is counterproductive and,
and it's intolerant, right?

303
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,470
I said all of those things because
those are true, and then it was,

304
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,470
but if you critique the fact that
Ohana is clearly antisemitic,

305
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,680
then you are leading like this is an
attempt to curve out a to it to carve out

306
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,041
speech,
right?

307
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:08,000
It's an attempt to say you're not allowed
to criticize x because we don't like

308
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,150
you criticizing acts, and if we can
blame this thing over here on you,

309
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,970
then that allows us to silence
you on this particular issue.

310
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,340
So what tactic may be or some of us
missing to clean some of this up because I

311
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,190
agree that basically what's
happening here is there,

312
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,250
there is these people
have been incentivized for
anytime anything bad happens,

313
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,500
you blame a few people
that have some influence.

314
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:29,770
So let's say you blame Peterson and you
and a couple of other people because

315
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:30,251
it's like,
oh,

316
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:33,400
you guys are helping wake up people to
their own thoughts and to how to live

317
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,460
their own lives by their own volition and,

318
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,850
and all the things that are in this book.

319
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,600
So there is every reason to
attack you because this is what

320
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,500
slept.
And it's also,

321
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,100
and it's also an easy game because the
fact is whoever has been very productive

322
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,920
in the public sphere, I'm sure has said
things that they don't like. Yeah, I mean,

323
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,960
I like this.
I keep referring to it because it's true.

324
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:53,360
I have a running list of crap
that I've said over the past.

325
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,690
I've been doing this since I was 17 years
old and now 35 so more than half of my

326
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:00,100
life, I have been doing this. I've
written legitimately millions of voters,

327
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,340
can't remember everything I wrote.

328
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,940
I've written a column a week
since I was 17 years old. Right?

329
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,610
I've written legitimately thousands of
columns at this point and I was writing

330
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,430
like eight pieces a day when I was at
Breitbart and I was writing for pieces a

331
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,860
day for daily wire for years on end.
I don't remember everything.

332
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,620
I remember I had 140,000 tweets.
I remember everything that I've tweeted.

333
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,080
So if somebody points something out
to me, I'm like, yeah, that was bad.

334
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,000
Then I'm just, I'm happy
to say, yeah, that was bad.

335
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,830
[inaudible] you wrote
a piece for daily wire,

336
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,370
the rest here basic and I update it,

337
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,080
I do update it will remind me and
they'll be like, yeah, this is a bad too.

338
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm like, you're right.
That was a bad tweet.

339
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,110
I did it back in 2008 and it was a dumb
thing to do and I'm sorry that that

340
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:33,410
happened. It's like, I don't remember
all that stuff, but uh, but it's,

341
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,500
it's really a bad faith attempt to
take down people who are not like,

342
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,890
this is what Tucker Carlson rightly
pointed out when people were coming after

343
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:42,410
him. This was not an attempt to
make the public space battery.

344
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,620
It was not an attempt to wipe out bad
speech that was happening in the here and

345
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,570
now because we don't have a time machine,
right?

346
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,410
We can call up stuff from 15 years ago
like they're digging up interviews from

347
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,720
John Wayne has been dead for 40 years.
It's like,

348
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,030
well I don't know what you want
from John Wayne. Dude's dead right?

349
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,130
We can't take up a skeleton
and asking for an apology.

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,140
If I say something now
that you don't like,

351
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,820
then we can have a debate over that thing.

352
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,550
But if you are digging up
something I said 15 years ago,

353
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,040
all I can do is either say I disagree
with me from back then or I agree with,

354
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,040
and then we can have a discussion
about what I think now. But I can't,

355
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,450
like I don't have a time machine. So
this is all bad faith, uh, and it's,

356
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,310
and it's really pretty hideous.

357
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,590
It's one thing to dig up something
somebody has said in the past and then say

358
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,350
this fits in with their
generalized worldview, right.

359
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,660
But to take something out
of context and then say,

360
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,930
ignore all contrary evidence
and then just say, well,

361
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,110
this is the world view because I want
this to be the worldview so I can suggest

362
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,390
that they're outside the Overton window
and we don't have to deal with them

363
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,780
anymore. That's, that's how glean
that's, that's what's happening. I mean,

364
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,300
even though there's this video that was
going around and it got a bunch of heads

365
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,590
from some lefty who had taken,
legitimately taken,

366
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,730
I mean openly taken stuff out of context.
Yeah.

367
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,870
And put it into video to suggest that I
was calling for the murder of Muslims.

368
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:52,200
And it is a lie. It is a full on
full stop. Absolute bullshit lie.

369
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,070
I mean he took,

370
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,990
he took a section from an asteroid that
I do for a second amendment group called

371
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:02,250
the u s concealed carry association in
which I say that citizens should be law

372
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:02,491
abiding,

373
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:05,490
citizens should be armed and they should
have concealed carry permits because if

374
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,930
you are going to be victimized by a crime,

375
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,720
the government can't stop that so you
should be able to defend yourself.

376
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,900
He took the part where I say
the government can't stop
this and connected it to

377
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:16,590
my video about how many radical Muslims
that are on earth and then suggested

378
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:19,500
that what I was saying is that you
should arm up and go kill Muslims because

379
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:24,150
there are a lot of violent
thinking Muslims on earth
or extreme Muslims on earth

380
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,090
that now I'm suggesting that you should
preemptively take action because the

381
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,820
government can't protect you. I mean he
was legitimately taking too disconnected.

382
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,500
Thoughts on two separate topics,

383
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,840
cobbling them together and then
suggesting that was my position.

384
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,760
It was just an open line. Was this a
public person? Is this, or, oh yeah,

385
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,620
I know this is a public person than
actual roof. Is it human? Yeah,

386
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:43,140
this is a human. So what do you
do with a case like that? Okay,

387
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,960
you can defend yourself on
yet we've all done this,

388
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,380
but I'm starting to think that that's
not enough. And it's an odd place.

389
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:52,500
And I had Robert Barnes here are a couple
of weeks for the lawyer and it's like,

390
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,620
it's an odd place for the
free speech guys to be going.

391
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,060
We have to figure out what are the legal
protections around speech because it's

392
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:04,380
so not. And I, and I hate it, like in
the worst position for me to possibly be.

393
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,680
Right. And yet here we are. I mean
you just defending herself. Well,

394
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,830
the guy's just going to keep doing it. You
get him clicks. Congratulations. Right?

395
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,620
And that, that is what it is. You know,

396
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,660
I'm loathe to either change libel or
defamation laws in the United States.

397
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,680
I prefer that people say
more rather than less.

398
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,670
I think most people see through this
nonsense. And I if I didn't think that,

399
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,760
that we couldn't really have republic
is the truth. But it's, but yeah,

400
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:29,580
I mean it's, it's obviously deeply
to serving and as a good person,

401
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:32,040
the first thing that happens, you know,
if you're trying to be good, like I'm,

402
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,580
I don't think, I think I'm a person
who trying to be a good person.

403
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,700
And I think most people who are trying to
be good people, when you are critiqued,

404
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,500
the first thing you think
is, okay, is that true?

405
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,800
And your first instinct is
did I do something wrong?

406
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,470
And then the more you think about it,
like, no, I didn't. This is just bullshit.

407
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:50,280
So I mean other than just
calling it out when it occurs,

408
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,710
I'm not sure what else people can do.

409
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,730
And even giving an air time is a problem
because then it just drives them to

410
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:00,120
double down in response and then
suggest, no, no, no. Now he's lying.

411
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,100
Now he's lying because they,
they want to read into what they,

412
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:02,934
what they want to read in.

413
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,220
You can't have a good faith discussion
this way and it's not meant to be a good

414
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:05,750
faith discussion.

415
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,120
How much do you think is just they want
to take you out versus just they want to

416
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,990
scare everybody else?

417
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,660
Like it's pretty clear to me they're
not going to take you out out of fear.

418
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,550
Right? They're not going, I mean, I think
that it's, it's two. It's two things. One,

419
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,300
there's always the pipe dream
that there'll be able to
take somebody like me out,

420
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,730
but I think that it's
about more than that.

421
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:27,330
It's about making sure that people who
are considered inside the Overton window

422
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,220
won't even have a conversation
with people like me.

423
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,940
So Andrew Yang comes on my Sunday
special and it's great. I mean,

424
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,690
it's a really tolerant civil conversation.
I took his ideas seriously.

425
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:40,650
I read his book, I let him speak his
piece. It was really nice, very nice guy.

426
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,460
I've invited every major
democratic candidate and on
a judge had suggested that

427
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,260
he was going to come out at one point
and then he just never has responded yet.

428
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:48,160
I'd love to have them on

429
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,130
and ask him some questions and it would
be very civil because the Sunday special

430
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:53,680
is a very civil place. Uh, and that's,

431
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,570
he got Yang has gotten excoriated by the
left for even coming on the show, right?

432
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,300
Joe Rogan has me on his show and he gets
hit by the left with you're having on

433
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,120
that white supremacists, Shapiro, you're
going to get hit just for having me on.

434
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,200
That's the way this works. Because if
they can alienate enough people by saying,

435
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,840
okay, well we can't give them,
if we can d platform everybody,

436
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,520
then it's an easy way of avoiding
actually having to regulate.

437
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:19,030
What you do is you just make a deeply
uncomfortable and so we sort of, you know,

438
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
do I really want the flack of having on x,
Y or z if that over to the window,

439
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,830
I guess I've got to go this way.

440
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,850
You keep moving it left right to the point
that any that everybody is outside of

441
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,020
it and the truth is that that's an
effective tech specifically because there

442
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,460
isn't Overton window.
I mean it does exist.

443
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,140
There are people I wouldn't
have on my Sunday special.

444
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,230
There are people who I wouldn't,
I wouldn't appear with. Yeah,

445
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,840
I mean I've said that before. And so
because that's a little murkier of a line,

446
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,090
it's easier to manipulate that
line. It's easier to say, okay,

447
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,520
well since we all accept that
there is this Overton window,

448
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,490
then we can use that Overton window
and shift the line here and there.

449
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,420
Now it's interesting that the Overton
window is constantly shifting, as you say,

450
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:56,380
left in every direction.
Meaning that you can express the wildest,

451
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,800
most insane views on the left and still
be considered well inside the Overton

452
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,520
window.
And if you are as Heterodox as Sam Harris,

453
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,660
a Hillary Clinton supporter who has
said a couple of heterodox things like I

454
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,340
like, I want to look at the evidence on
Iq and then analyze how much of that is

455
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:13,990
environmental and how
much of that is genetic.

456
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,630
And I want to look at how much
that affects disparities overall.

457
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,750
Or I'm saying that Islam
has a relationship with
violence globally speaking.

458
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,870
Those heterodox opinions mean they're,
I mean they're,

459
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,800
they'll rule out Sam before they
rule out Maxine waters, right?

460
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,930
That's the way that this works.
So they'll rule out anybody,

461
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,890
Christina Hoff summers is too
far right for them. She's,

462
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,190
she's a white supremacist now,

463
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,410
but they'll keep expanding that all the
way to the point where anybody's wild

464
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:40,090
opinion is acceptable.

465
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,570
Like the right is routinely throwing
people out for expressing opinions that we

466
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:48,310
find unpleasant outside of our
norm. Right. When Steve King came,

467
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,110
finally said kind of openly,

468
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:53,860
the white nationalists comment to the
New York Times, we throw them out.

469
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:56,470
I mean we took away as committee
assignments and I donated the Max to his

470
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,710
opponent. I raised money for Kevin
[inaudible] who's running in his district.

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,610
Right.
And,

472
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,820
and the left's response was why was he
even a part of you wants took a picture.

473
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:07,570
I took a picture with him right before
he said any before he said that stuff

474
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:11,080
that was open. Right, exactly. And
so that's what it becomes is well,

475
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:14,770
were you once nice to this person?
And it's like, well that was before.

476
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:18,580
And also you guys are roots like Louis
Farrakhan is still a person who meets

477
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:22,810
with members of the Democratic Caucus.
Like what, what, why is it the,

478
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,850
the window only shifts in one direction.

479
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,360
I'm not going to listen to people who
tell me about who should be inside the

480
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:32,800
Overton window when they legitimately
refuse to throw anyone outside the Overton

481
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,420
window,
no matter how vile they are.

482
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:38,660
Ilhan Omar just got defended by the entire
Democratic Congress after saying for

483
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,010
three antisemitic things in the
course of seven weeks. Right?

484
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:44,980
She was defended by the Democratic
Caucus and left with our position on the

485
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,823
foreign affairs committee

486
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,670
because they're, they're afraid that their
own tactics will be used against them.

487
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,050
So I would imagine in
Biden's getting it now,

488
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,270
I mean I've been calling this river and
it eventually will happen to Bernie to,

489
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,450
it has to happen. That's,
that's the nature of the beast.

490
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,920
How much of this though
do you think is that bike?

491
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,400
Cause I see this now cause I get a lot
of former former lefties, let's say, uh,

492
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,350
even some who've been on
this show who publicly,

493
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:13,430
they're like this thing the left
is just burned. We get what it is.

494
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:17,720
But publicly they won't say that they've
shifted or that they're evolving or

495
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,160
that if you're an old school liberal you,

496
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,910
you can actually be okay with a lot
of conservative ideas are conservative

497
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,490
people because there's
a protection involved.

498
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,340
If you're basically a
democrat or on the left,

499
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,880
Joe Biden can run around with a gazillion
videos of sniffing girl's hair and

500
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,860
grabbing people in all of that.

501
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,860
And yet the people that were
going crazy over cabinet,

502
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:39,830
I have nothing to say about that,
that there's just a protection.

503
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:43,670
You get as a lefty that you
simply don't get and it's,

504
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,440
and it's comfortable not to raise your
head above the water line. I mean I like,

505
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,890
I like tell the story
of that on my birthday.

506
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:51,890
So I have a lot of a lot of friends in
the media or people find friendly with,

507
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,290
I wouldn't call them
friends because of this,

508
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,650
not because of the people
who I am acquainted.

509
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,150
Question is would they
consider you a friend?

510
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,370
That really is the question
because it's my birthday, right?

511
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,230
I routinely wish people,
I disagree with happy birthday online.

512
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,790
It seems like a basic thing of courtesies.
It's,

513
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,730
it's someone's birthday there on
the left, fine, it's your birthday.

514
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:11,510
Happy Birthday. People will text
me on the left happy birthday.

515
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,680
I can't do this publicly.

516
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,050
They will not tweet happy birthday
because they are afraid that if they tweet

517
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,480
happy birthday, they have then given
me the credence of I was born in,

518
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:20,450
therefore I'm a human being and they're
going to get hit with how dare you wish

519
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:23,660
this terrible person, this,
this orthodox Jewish neo Nazi.

520
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,230
How dare you wish that person
happy birthday, right? The the,

521
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:28,550
the effect of being duped.
Lost is a thing.

522
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:31,310
I mean the d the d plus thing I
thought was so telling and it was so,

523
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,800
and everybody knew gut level that if you
said that a person on the other side is

524
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,450
a human being that you got hit. But it's
funny, I don't get this from the right,

525
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,460
meaning that I say Andrew
Yang is a human right.

526
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:44,120
He's running for the 2020 nomination.
I treated him really well and things,

527
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,860
an intelligent guy.
I think he's a nice guy.

528
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,800
I've said about buddy checks I've never
met. He seems like a nice person. Like I,

529
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,330
I, I will say that about the vast majority
of people who I disagree with on the

530
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,340
left and they're nice
people who I disagree with.

531
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,830
There's some more badly motivated
and those people I tried to avoid,

532
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,980
but the vast majority of them are like
people you'd want to hang out with and

533
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,930
seemed like nice people he
can have a conversation with.

534
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,040
When is the last time somebody has ever
said that about somebody on the right

535
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,160
there a nice PR by Joe Biden. You
Recall? This actually happened to Biden.

536
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,250
So Biden said this about pence, right?
He said pence was a nice person. Yeah.

537
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,000
And then Biden got hit so hard that he
backed off of it and he was like, well,

538
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,340
you know what? No one can hold
the beliefs that Mike pence can.

539
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,360
It has and still be a nice person then.
I'm sorry we can't have a politics.

540
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:26,600
If the idea is that we
are that you are my enemy,

541
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,050
then we are no longer even operating in
the same sphere than my politics make me

542
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,760
evil.
But your politics make you a nice person.

543
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,460
How am I supposed to have a
conversation with you on that basis?

544
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,490
So do you think then that Biden is
the last chance for any Democrat to be

545
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:43,650
somewhat centrist or decent for all the
disagreements you may have with Biden?

546
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,160
I mean,
even

547
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,050
the last one I think is seen
not only with the pen thing,

548
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,230
but he had to dealt double down with
a whole bunch of something as Politics

549
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,000
Hillary yet. But he's on
the apology tour. But,

550
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,390
but when you see how radical the
Democrats have gone, and again,

551
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,450
this is like everything I was
fighting against for all these years,

552
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,830
you know what I mean?
Yeah. This was like, guys,

553
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:02,280
this is going to happen if we
don't start fixing it right now.

554
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,400
I don't even think it's my
job to fix anymore. Right.
It has to just sort of burn.

555
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,920
It's just, it just is.
That's a very unfortunate,

556
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,600
because I think as Jordan would say,

557
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:13,380
you need a certain tension between the
right and the left. It's as equal tension,

558
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,970
let's say. Um, but do you think
Biden's like the last chance for that,

559
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,440
for anything that's sort of,

560
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,930
I think the carver school democrats.
Yeah. Carving out his soul right now.

561
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:24,510
And so we'll see where he stands by the,

562
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,410
I mean they'd taken basically an ice
cream scoop and gone through his innards

563
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,450
with this.
And I just,

564
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:30,430
I don't know how much in Biden is
going to be left at the end of this.

565
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,380
I think Biden's initial instinct,

566
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:35,910
and I really don't like Joe Biden as a
politician. I think he fibbed a lot. I,

567
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,090
I don't like his policies,

568
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,770
but I think his initial instinct before
he gets political is that he can talk

569
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:44,500
with people on the other side
of the beltway was friends
with McCain cane for so

570
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,333
many years in all of this.

571
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,940
I think that this is being beat
out of him in the primaries. Yeah.

572
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,360
Because it's just unacceptable. I was
hoping the same thing was true about,

573
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:53,700
about Buddha judge, right. I was,

574
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,250
I was hoping the Buddhist said
she was going to be that right.

575
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,720
He said something like, you know, I
don't like the position of Dan Cathy,

576
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:01,300
the head of chick fil a, but they
make good chicken, so I'll eat there.

577
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:04,250
And I was like, well that's refreshing.
Isn't that a nice thing like radical.

578
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,530
I know,
but that was the,

579
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,440
that was the only moderate thing I've
heard in the entire Democratic primary and

580
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:11,950
now booty, Trisha switching. And
it's, again, Mike pens hates me,

581
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,110
my pencils out to get me
because he's a bad guy.

582
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,920
And if Mike Pence thinks
that I'm a bad person,

583
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,910
what he's really doing is he's rejecting
God because God made me the way that I

584
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,380
am. It's like whatever. Mike Pence,

585
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,900
his views on the sinfulness
of homosexual activity,

586
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,210
Mike pence has treated
booty guys really well.

587
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:29,230
I mean there's a bunch of records of him
like when Buddhist edge was activated

588
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:30,064
in the military,

589
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,630
pence personally called him up to
wish him best of luck in all of that.

590
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,420
Like he's never said a bad word about
Buddhist Asia. As far as I'm aware,

591
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,300
our friend Rick Grinnell,
who's the ambassador to Germany who's gay,

592
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:44,240
the right has only good things
to say about Mike Pence.

593
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:47,270
I'm not saying that everything Mike
Pence says or believes would line up with

594
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:47,871
everything.
I believe.

595
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:51,230
Of course Trump has also been president
for two plus years or they come in for

596
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,140
the gays, right? It's
a, you bring anyone with

597
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,880
beautiful. Then the fact that [inaudible]
has to make up a fake Mike Pence. Yeah,

598
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,660
right. Where we're pens is now his
enemy and out to get him is just,

599
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,570
it's really telling about the,

600
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:06,210
the polarization of politics
and the attempt to shift
political differences into

601
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,250
character assassination.

602
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,280
This idea that pence disagrees with me
about same sex marriage and therefore he

603
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:12,690
actually hates me and it's like,
well,

604
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,530
you have no evidence whatsoever
that that is the case.

605
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,810
Like you're allowed to hate other people
as long as you don't want laws that are

606
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,900
different for them. Right. And will are
allowed to hate people. It just is right.

607
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,260
I don't have to be me
and her until to know.

608
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,940
I mean I, I, and, and I
think more importantly,

609
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,690
you are allowed to dislike the behavior
in which others engaged as long as you

610
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:33,650
are not attempting to compel them to
either engage or not engage in behavior

611
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:36,800
like this is way I think that there's
a fundamental distinction that every

612
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:39,080
religious person understands and a
lot of nonreligious people don't.

613
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,010
When it comes to issues
like homosexual marriage

614
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,730
or same sex marriage, which is, I don't
like a lot of things that people do.

615
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,930
I'm a religious person,
right?

616
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:49,440
That means that there are a lot of things
that Jews do. Like you don't sell it.

617
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,320
You don't take off Shabbat. Right. And
actually been trying to a little bit more.

618
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,450
Right. Well that's good. That's good.
Cause I want to get off my phone,

619
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,760
but bottom line is you or anybody,
anybody else,

620
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,880
lots of Jews don't celebrate Shabbat.
That's a sin from where I sit. Right?

621
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:04,120
That doesn't mean that I just like you.
Right. And I send all the time, right?

622
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:05,350
I violated Shabbat before,

623
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:08,440
either by accident or a while ago
when I was in front of on purpose.

624
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,260
Like th I do stuff in my daily
life all the time where I think,

625
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:14,530
am I missing the religion? Not a
perfect human being. Well, this is it,

626
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,440
but this is the religious thing. Religious
people understand that nobody is.

627
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,620
And so when we look at somebody engaging
in a behavior that we deem sinful,

628
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,990
it's not like we're sitting there all
day going, oh, I'll look at that center.

629
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:25,330
It's like, well, right. That's,
that's human beings, right?

630
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:26,380
We all sit and that's what we do.

631
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,990
And as long as I'm not trying to
compel you not to engage in the sin,

632
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,940
what do you even care like? It's, it's

633
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,590
confusing to many times.
Have I said to your face,

634
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,650
I actually don't care what your most
personal belief is on gay marriage.

635
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,460
I genuinely don't care.

636
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,070
I know this will be clipped a
zillion ways to sound people.

637
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,370
Now your head's get the tolerant
left, don't have Reuben's. You know,

638
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:49,830
and it's like, but I, I really
mean that. I sit on your shelf.

639
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,960
You were out there right now.

640
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:54,950
If you were campaigning for people
that wanted to flip gay marriage or,

641
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,540
or every day you were doing diatribes
about how evil gay people are and then we

642
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:03,350
would have a problem, right? But by
you taking the libertarian position,

643
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,020
you and your, and maybe from,
from your moral center and we'll,

644
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,350
we'll get into that shortly.
You're not thrilled with it. Okay.

645
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,730
I guess what I live in a country
with people that I don't agree with,

646
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,740
and this has been my perspective. I
mean, I said this on on Rogan show,

647
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,460
this is like they're legitimately millions
of people in this country who believe

648
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,320
that I will go to hell because
I don't believe in Jesus.

649
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,410
And you know what I think about
that. I don't care. I don't care.

650
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:26,440
Like it makes no difference to me.
Fine, you're not coming after me.

651
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,780
That's the best thing that's happened to
Jews and thousands of years that people

652
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:31,270
are coming after.
So like good.

653
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,300
You don't believe what you want as long
as you're nice to me and as long as you

654
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,050
are and as long as you, I don't even
think you have to be nice. Well I know,

655
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,000
I mean, but I mean as long as
you are at, yes. First of all,

656
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,650
you don't have to be right. I mean like
you may civil as long as you're correct.

657
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,860
I mean,
right.

658
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,560
And as long as you're not using the
government to compel me to do things.

659
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,830
And when I say nice to me, I mean
if you're not like people, look,

660
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,650
if we're talking about if I like somebody
or not, if you're overtly mean to me,

661
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:56,050
I'm not going to like you.
But when it comes to politics,

662
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,220
as long as you're not
trying to come help me,

663
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,320
I don't even care whether you like
me or not or I like you or not.

664
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,600
I mean that's a,
this is why in my view,

665
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,940
libertarianism is maybe the only way
we're ever going to be able to be able to

666
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,070
survive this stuff. Because if
we don't leave each other alone,

667
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,810
we're just going to club
each other and to submission.

668
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,440
I mean that's why I've been ranting
and raving about all this. All right,

669
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:14,710
so let's, let's shift to the book a
little bit. So I really enjoyed it.

670
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,540
And then this morning
you put up a or a Prager,

671
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:20,680
you put up a video that basically is in
conjunction with the book. So first off,

672
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:24,640
the title, the right side of history,
that's what the left always saying, right?

673
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,990
When you may not phrase.
So let's talk about that for a second.

674
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,100
Because that's what they always say.

675
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,640
Every time a conservative or any one
on the right remotely says anything.

676
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,370
They always say you're on the
wrong side of history, right?

677
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,470
No Mama most famously used that to
talk about same sex marriage. Right.

678
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,340
If you were anti

679
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,203
same sex marriage,

680
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
then this meant you were in the wrong
side of history and this who was the guy

681
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,190
that ran against games that,
correct.

682
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,690
She was on the wrong side of
history at that point though.

683
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,480
Then it became on the right side of
history. The reason that I use the phrase,

684
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,780
obviously it was a bit of a poke in the
eye to that phrase and it's a play on

685
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,420
words, is the end of the conservative side
of history, the right side of history.

686
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,230
But yeah,
there is,

687
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,730
but there's also this idea that what I
don't like is using history as a club to

688
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,700
beat someone with when it hasn't
unfolded yet. So people will say,

689
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,370
you're on the wrong side.
You don't agree with me on tax policy.

690
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,880
Well that was because in the future
it will be proved that I was right and

691
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,770
you're wrong.
And you were on the wrong side of history.

692
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,590
That's what Obama was saying about same
sex marriage was people who were saying

693
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:17,840
that traditional marriage has
been x for thousands of years.

694
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,450
Those people are on the wrong side of
history because history will justify my

695
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:23,660
position and they will have been shown
to be non progressive and non decent.

696
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,820
Maybe that's right. Maybe that's
wrong. You don't know yet.

697
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:27,980
History hasn't progressed yet.
Right. But there are certain, yeah,

698
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,780
it would be very scary though
if that was true that we would,

699
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:35,290
once things change that you would look
back and think that the thousands of

700
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,820
years before you, and this is
sort of what you're talking about,

701
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:39,670
the book that all of the people that
believe different things were we're

702
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:41,860
backwards or evil or on
the wrong side of things.

703
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:45,020
I mean it takes it no
context of how they live.

704
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,911
Right. And, and again,

705
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:48,640
I think there's a difference between
looking back saying here's a bunch of good

706
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,700
stuff that we have in today's society
and here's all the things that we love.

707
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,400
Where did that come from? That's what
I say, the right side of history.

708
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,070
Here's the stuff that we know that is
right and where did that come from? Okay,

709
00:33:57,071 --> 00:34:00,220
so that's the right side of history
as opposed to here's my politics.

710
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,420
Today is my political position.

711
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,120
I have not a lot of evidence historically
that it's going to work or it's not

712
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:04,630
going to work,

713
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,170
but it will be proved one day that
you are on the wrong side of history.

714
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,630
If you oppose me,
you're not really talking about history,

715
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,330
you're talking about you know,
you're,

716
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,160
you're basically forecasting into the
future something that you can't possibly

717
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:18,460
know. So that that's sort of use of
the phrases is highly irritating to me.

718
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,820
Especially because there are times
when their politics in the ascendancy,

719
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:24,340
they're really ugly and unapproved
later to be completely wrong. I mean,

720
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:27,070
there was a point where Jews were pretty
regular getting murdered in Europe.

721
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,560
They were on the wrong side of
history at that point. Right?

722
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:30,880
And then it turns out
that in the long run,

723
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:31,870
they're not on the wrong side of history.

724
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,250
The Nazis are on the
wrong side of history.

725
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:36,340
If you'd said the opposite in 1934
people would have thought you were crazy.

726
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,010
So you can't really say
where history is going.

727
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,450
Well you can do is look back and say,

728
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:43,810
here's where history has gone and here's
what we like about what history has

729
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,280
been and here's where
we have broad agreement.

730
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,660
And that's really what I'm talking about.

731
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:49,760
Where are the issues where we in
Western civilization should have brought

732
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,310
agreement? And why is that broad
agreement starting to fall apart? Yeah,

733
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:54,820
so you know,
the IDW is a great example of this.

734
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,500
There's not a lot of agreement on
policy in the IDW virtually at all,

735
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,650
but there are certain basic principles
that we all kind of take for granted.

736
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,790
Democracy is better than dictatorship.
Free speech is better than limited speech.

737
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,150
Personal responsibility is better
than shirking personal responsibility.

738
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,970
Like these are things that, that everybody
seems to basically take in common.

739
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,880
And so what I say is, okay,
where do these values come from?

740
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,170
Because they didn't spring up in a vacuum.

741
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,120
And the fact that we have great material,
prosperity and free markets and wealth,

742
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:27,121
and all of this great stuff that did not
happen either by accident or everyone

743
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:29,284
at once.

744
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,040
Magic. It's not just some sort of man
made magic. So let's talk about that.

745
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,360
Let's talk about the two cities
then. Let's, let's start.

746
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Let's start with Jerusalem

747
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,160
to Jerusalem. Okay. So the,

748
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,870
so the basic thesis of the book is a
very [inaudible] view, that thesis.

749
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,380
So Leo Strauss,
famous 20th century philosopher,

750
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,550
he posited that Western civilization
was predicated on these two poles that

751
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,610
we're constantly fighting with. One
another. One was Jerusalem and was Athens.

752
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:54,090
So Jerusalem is the idea
of Judeo Christian values
that under girds our social

753
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:54,660
fabric,

754
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,360
the vast majority of people who are
members of the community or members of the

755
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,460
Judeo Christian community in the West,
obviously.

756
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,760
And there are certain values that are
inherent in the Bible that are different

757
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:07,230
from most pagan cultures. So for
example, the, the Judeo Christian ethic,

758
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,570
and we can discuss where that comes from.
You know,

759
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,440
Jordan would say that it's rooted in,

760
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:14,270
in human nature and then
manifest in the Bible. Uh,

761
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,170
people like Sam would say that it's
sort of an evolutionary hangover. Um,

762
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,610
but you know, we can get to whether the
revelation actually occurred or not,

763
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,090
but the, but the basic premises of
Judaic Christian revelation there,

764
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,953
there are several of them.

765
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,480
One is that there is such a
thing as an orderly universe.

766
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:30,930
So this seems perfectly obvious to us now
that that we can discover the rules of

767
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:33,090
science,
that things are out there that make sense.

768
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,570
But for a huge majority of cultures
over time that was not true.

769
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,630
It was you worshiped various gods because
there are arbitrary that are fighting

770
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,330
with each other and you tried to
appease one at the expense of the other.

771
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,150
There are no discoverable rules to
the universe. He's weird though,

772
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,750
that you have to take a leap of faith
to get to a place that it starts with

773
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,880
order. Isn't that? Yeah, it's, it's
an interesting, it is, and this is,

774
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,680
this is one of the points that I make
is that people see reason and revelation

775
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,640
as intention.

776
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,150
But the point that I keep making two Sam
whenever we discussed this is that Sam

777
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,040
makes a leap of faith to
about these principles.

778
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,420
He and I started at the same principles.

779
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,300
It's just that I acknowledged that I'm
making a leap of faith to get there and

780
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:10,170
he thinks you can reason your way back
using sort of a priori reason to these

781
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,110
fundamental principles like
the orderliness of being
able to discover rules in

782
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:13,944
the universe.

783
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,460
I don't think any of that is perfectly
obvious to the human mind nor do I think

784
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:18,750
that for the vast
majority of human history,

785
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:22,440
people thought that you needed people
tended to think that basically your cork

786
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:27,441
bobbing about on the ids of chaos and
that there was no real way for you to to

787
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,940
discover any logic to the universe.
So the,

788
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:32,370
the idea of the Bible is there is a god,

789
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,220
the God creates a universe using a mind.

790
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,240
That mind is orderly in nature and there
are certain logical rules that that

791
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,970
mind uses and then we are
created in the image of God,

792
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,280
which has a couple of
separate implications.

793
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,360
One is that our mind reflects his to the
extent that we can grasp at a certain

794
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:52,860
level what exactly is the order of that
universe and then the second is the

795
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:55,020
actual meaning of that we
are made in the image of God.

796
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,850
It means that each of us has inestimable
value. Now that is something that, again,

797
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,170
we tend to think of as perfectly obvious
that we are all valuable human beings,

798
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,220
but all was restricted to the tribe
for most of human history and we are

799
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:10,590
reverting back to that now,
which is all,

800
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,500
you know we are all valuable except
for that guy. That guy is not valuable.

801
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,550
Screw that guy,
right?

802
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:18,000
He's a member of an opposing tribe and
so the story of Western civilization is

803
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:21,480
the broadening out of that principle
that we are all made in God's image too.

804
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,580
All right? That's why
when people say, okay,

805
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:26,220
well Western civilization had slavery
in Western civilization had racism.

806
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,390
It's that all that is true.

807
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,440
The question is why Western civilization
got rid of those things where it had

808
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,380
been trying to fight those things.

809
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,890
Whereas other cultures have basically
reinforced those things or have decided

810
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,540
those things are okay. And the
tribalism is, is a, is a good, yeah.

811
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:37,870
Thanks.

812
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,820
So what do we do that again about the
people that always want to focus on the

813
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,100
bad part? Because one of the things
I liked in the Prager u video,

814
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:46,240
you made a point of saying, yeah, a
lot of bad things have happened, right?

815
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,500
The West has made mistakes along the way,

816
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:52,520
but that the arc has bent so that there
is more freedom, there's more wealth,

817
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:54,740
there is more prosperity, all
that. But it seems to me that,

818
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:57,140
and I think this is what's
happening on the left by and large,

819
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,390
is that if they could
step back for a moment,

820
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:03,020
they might see that it's a lot better.
I mean, every college Gig I go to, I go,

821
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,960
I always open it up to the crown.
I say, does anyone have it worse?

822
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:07,910
I say this to the hecklers.
Yeah. And they never respond.

823
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,820
Does anyone in this room have
it worse than their grandkids?

824
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,170
And nobody ever says yes.

825
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:14,470
It's almost impossible if you
live in the United States,

826
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,211
if you're not honest with you,

827
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:17,990
until your grandfather could have been
an oil barren and then lost it. Right.

828
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,921
That's pretty much happy.

829
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,740
They'd be happy for that too because
they don't want inherited wealth to go

830
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:24,200
through the generations.
Right. But the point is,

831
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,840
it's very hard to get them to
look at that. What do you think,

832
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:31,070
what do you make of the type of
mind that always goes to the worst?

833
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,700
Is that because of the
disconnect with Jerusalem? Yes.

834
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,510
I mean, yes, because I think that
to a, to a certain extent you had,

835
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,400
and this is sort of
the thesis of the book,

836
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,730
is that if you're ungrateful for
this society that you've been given,

837
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:44,920
that's because you don't understand
the society that you've been given.

838
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:48,640
So we tend to think of all this stuff
is natural. It is completely unnatural.

839
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,970
There's point the journal Goldberg makes
in his book, right? The prosperity,

840
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,090
the fact that you have a baby, the baby's
will live to 80 in the United States,

841
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:56,680
barring some sort of
cataclysmic health event.

842
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,830
The fact that you are going to live
not only in relative prosperity,

843
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,320
but the greatest prosperity that
any human being has ever known.

844
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,750
You can go on a machine
and click a button.

845
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:07,720
Any product that you like will
arrive at your door in two days,

846
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:11,440
made in 10 different countries for an
affordable price that costs you less than

847
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,370
an hour of labor. Right in there. Like

848
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,780
thank God those people aren't going to
New York, right, with those 25 pounds.

849
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,220
Yeah.
So the,

850
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,380
so I think that one of the great debates
of our society right now is that on one

851
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:22,850
side you have a bunch of people who say,
okay,

852
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:26,300
well that's where things are awesome.
Things are historically awesome.

853
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,420
You wouldn't want to be born in any other
time in any other places in an amazing

854
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:32,630
place.
And all of the problems of history exist.

855
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,500
But what that's about is a struggling to
maximize the principles that were good

856
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,950
in their inception. And
then it's a question of is
fulfilling those principles.

857
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,830
And this is true for the declaration
and the Constitution. And yes,

858
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,030
slavery was contemplated in the
constitution and that was a great evil.

859
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:47,210
And then we find a great civil war.

860
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,360
And then there was racism
that was implicit in American
society than we fought.

861
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,230
We fought ourselves using these
great universal principles.

862
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,930
That's always ongoing, right? Of course,

863
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,521
there,

864
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,440
there is no end point at which all human
sin has been alleviated because we're

865
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:04,350
sinful creatures and we tend to
revert back into all of these things.

866
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:08,080
Tribalism and racism and, and illogic
and all of these, these things. But,

867
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,160
but the fundamental principles at the
root of the civilization are good.

868
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,640
And then you have a bunch of folks who
say, right, we have a lot of prosperity,

869
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,430
but look, there's still racism, there's
still sexism, there's still bigotry.

870
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,930
And that's because the actual natural
state of man would be the prosperity.

871
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,180
It's all this other stuff that
western civilization added.

872
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,170
And that I think comes from just a
complete ignorance of the realities of

873
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,070
history in the world,

874
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:33,380
which is that everything bad that has
happened in Western civilization, yes,

875
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,010
is truly awful and evil and also
has existed in virtually every other

876
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,420
civilization.
The history of the world.

877
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,820
The question is why is the
good stuff happening? Right?

878
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,910
The natural state of Man Hobbes is right
about this is nasty, brutish and short.

879
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,570
The natural state of man is not the
Rousseau's noble savage living out there

880
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,660
enjoying the fruits and the nuts. I mean,
that's not exactly what was going on,

881
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,570
right? This is the point
that that, that as I say,

882
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:58,040
Goldberg makes is that something happened
and suddenly we are all living in

883
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,630
paradise. So what was the
thing that happened? So the,

884
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,060
and this is where on the one hand,

885
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,710
I really accept Goldberg and Pinker
and the enlightenment argument and

886
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:08,060
[inaudible] argument in Michael Shermer,
his argument, I love the enlightenment.

887
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,460
It's so funny, people would characterize
this book is anti enlightenment. No,

888
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,220
it's very anti-friction.
Lightman half of the book is actually,

889
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,710
I mean that portion of this is correct.
It's,

890
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,020
it's funny how people sort
of see what they want to see.

891
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,150
So I've gotten letters from
religious people saying,

892
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,790
I don't think you're taking seriously
enough. The contribution of religion.

893
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,910
And then I got people from the
secular humanist side going,

894
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,610
I don't think you've
taken seriously enough the
contribution of Athens. Like No.

895
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,000
The whole point is that these two things
are intention and not only are they

896
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:33,860
intention,
but that tension is necessary.

897
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,370
I described civilization as effectively
a suspension bridge and on one end you

898
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:40,640
have certain principles you must take
for granted and that are embedded in the

899
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,630
Judeo Christian tradition.

900
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,550
And on the other hand you have all the
reason that must be used in order to not

901
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:47,810
end up in theocracy land.

902
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,900
And these two things are pulling against
each other and pushing against each

903
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,480
other and pulling against. And that's
the history of Western civilization.

904
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,080
And I think the greatest balance was
reached in the American founding and in

905
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:57,800
those principles.

906
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,700
And then those promises were expanded
outward to a broader and broader group of

907
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:01,911
people.

908
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:05,820
And that's the story of the
West as opposed to Western
civilization is the marks.

909
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:09,080
His take is that Western civilization
is effectively a power hierarchy.

910
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,730
All these principles are a lie and that
the principles are a simple gloss on,

911
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,620
on what is a reversion to a
power hierarchy. So for example,

912
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:21,100
there was somebody on the left who got
very upset because in this section,

913
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:24,440
the book I say, you know, we used to
believe that we are brothers and sisters.

914
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,620
We seem to believe that we
have these principles in
common. And people were like,

915
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,250
who's weak? He Hobby? Because a lot of,

916
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,930
cause a lot of black folks were not
included in that bargain. A 100% true.

917
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,500
But if you go back as late as 2006
2007 2008 and look at the poll numbers,

918
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,080
people believe that racism was
receding in the United States.

919
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,500
People believed that effectively. We were
trying to get rid of all of this stuff.

920
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,820
And the reason that we've been
able to curb racism in our society,

921
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:49,550
the reason we've been able to curb sexism
is because we were able to use these

922
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:53,210
principles to overcome the natural
tribalism and sinfulness inherent in human

923
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,940
beings, right? So when I say we used
to believe we were all brothers,

924
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,530
we did believe that we are all brothers.

925
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:00,110
But then we expanded the definition of
brothers. That was the story, right?

926
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,980
The reason that Western civilization has
been effective is because we have these

927
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,510
principles.
The principles are good.

928
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,110
We were too restrictive in the use of
those principles. And then using reason,

929
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,400
we broadened out those principles
to encompass more and more people.

930
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,710
So when I say we used to consider
all of each other brothers,

931
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,410
that was true in theory and not an action,

932
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,790
and then it would was
broadened out to action.

933
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,170
And that's what's made
our world a better place.

934
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,060
So is that part of the problem right now
is that we're in our eating fruits and

935
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:27,650
nuts stage here in the west.

936
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:32,040
We are in such spectacular
wealth and freedom

937
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,630
and all of those things in,
of course,

938
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,920
everybody's not wealthy and we have a
homeless problem in all sorts of things.

939
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:40,170
And there's problems, there's mental
health problems and everything else,

940
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,041
but that we have.

941
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:46,041
So by and large conquered races and we
have so by large conquered all of the

942
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,680
inequities in society. Not
all of them, but we've,

943
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,670
we've done a pretty good job and
we show it, as you're saying,

944
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,910
it's the train is still going right.
But that do,

945
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,000
that then becomes the weakness
that then people, young people,

946
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:00,480
and I mean if you look at the millennials
and now everything that was born out

947
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:04,590
of this new progressive lefty thing,
it's that it's not perfect.

948
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:07,830
So we must burn it down.
So it's almost that that is now,

949
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,260
but it's a symptom of the
success it's suppose to,

950
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,550
it's almost a inevitable symptom.
Okay,

951
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,510
well that's right. I mean this is what
I talk about in the book when I get to,

952
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:15,741
you know,

953
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:19,740
the sort of the philosophy of the 1960s
which was we need to replace the heart

954
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,210
of stone within man with a heart of flesh.
It was a religious concept.

955
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,370
It was from a Marxist idea,

956
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:27,390
which was there is something
fundamentally wrong with the western soul.

957
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,630
And what we need to do is shift the
entire system. This is the Marxist.

958
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,600
The actual market is pro
pro. Uh, promise is not,

959
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,200
you're going to be wealthier and more
spectacular and your living standard.

960
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,860
Then under capitalism, ver very few
marks is actually make this claim.

961
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,870
And if they do their ignorance,
uh, the, the actual match,

962
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:46,290
his claim is that it will fundamentally
change the nature of human beings to

963
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,080
live in different relations with each
other in a certain economic system.

964
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,670
And we will become different in humans.

965
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,840
Now the conservative view
and the religious view is
no, you won't, right? I mean,

966
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:57,840
you're going to be exactly the same
human you were before then the system can

967
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,580
change.
Human beings are always what they are.

968
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,060
You can alleviate certain
material conditions that
make people more likely to be

969
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,480
less stressed, for example. But overall,
human beings are sinful creatures.

970
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,310
We tend toward toward tribalism and anger.
We have to train ourselves to be good.

971
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,390
Anybody who's had kids,

972
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,310
I'm frankly astounded that anyone who
has kids buys into the Marxist, he says,

973
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,440
because the notion that kids are there,
that people are inherently good.

974
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,460
It's such absolute utter crap. That
doesn't mean we don't have good instincts.

975
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,271
We do have a good instinct,

976
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:27,240
but that is balanced for the very
selfish instinct as well. I mean, I,

977
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:30,030
I know there's a, there's a new
book out. I'm trying number who,

978
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,730
who's the author was just reviewed in the
Wall Street Journal talking about sort

979
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:37,390
of the natural goodness of,
of human beings and I, there,

980
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:41,070
there is some of that, I mean look
at as Jordan, let's talk about,

981
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:41,730
if you look at Piaget,

982
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,430
people play games with each other and
they tend to form common rules and all of

983
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:45,180
that is true.

984
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,420
There's also a real selfishness to human
beings that naturally comes out and you

985
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:50,340
see it among kids.
And if that's not trained,

986
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,170
if people aren't cultivated
to become better human beings,

987
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:53,820
they just don't become
better human beings.

988
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,850
And so this is why I say you
need to reexamine what it
is that's good about your

989
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:59,940
life and then ask, why did it get so
good? You didn't build this thing like,

990
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,590
I don't want to, I mean, I
do want to quote Obama care.

991
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:05,160
Obama says you didn't build it. When I
spend my entire life building a business,

992
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,480
but you didn't build the system, the
system you were born into. Right.

993
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:13,140
You think that free speech is something
that just magically exists here and that

994
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:14,670
everybody is entitled to it.
Yeah.

995
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,450
Welcome to a thing that that only exists
for the last couple of hundred years

996
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,850
and legitimately millions of people
had been killed fighting over.

997
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,151
Is this why?

998
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:25,780
What is happening right now with the
Democratic candidates is so dangerous.

999
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,430
I mean,
just in the last couple of weeks,

1000
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,950
so now they're talking about reparations.

1001
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:34,090
They're talking about adding Supreme
Court justices. They're talking about,

1002
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,640
there was a whole slew,
I give me a give me [inaudible]

1003
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,130
electoral college, Electoral College.
I went to the Senate, the Senate,

1004
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:42,410
because it's not represented
my population. Yeah. Yeah.

1005
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,830
These things that these are
now would be, you know, look,

1006
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,020
these ideas were man made ideas,

1007
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,930
but that they think only in their day.

1008
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:53,780
If they can just rejigger the
entire way we look at everything,

1009
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,330
it will be better.
Where I would argue in almost every,

1010
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,510
I can't imagine a case where if we flip
to any of those things, things would,

1011
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,280
would be any,

1012
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,991
yeah, no, I,

1013
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,670
I really have serious doubts that if
you get rid of the Senate that suddenly

1014
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:06,850
people in Montana are going to be like
totally okay with everything. Right.

1015
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,060
Or that people like let, let's not
pretend that people in California

1016
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,070
aggressive in the big cities
would control everybody.

1017
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,030
Right. And, and by the way, the people
in the rural areas, we try to break away.

1018
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:18,700
I mean, they would, that's the, the,
the, I mean people don't want it.

1019
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,450
The civil war was about slavery and
there was also a massive economic gap

1020
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,440
between the south and the north,

1021
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:26,110
which was reflected in a lot of the
tariff fights that existed up until the

1022
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,120
civil war.
That was a rural urban gap.

1023
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,610
And it's one of the reasons why the north
one is because they had so much more

1024
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:34,810
urban power than the south.
But you know that that was about slavery.

1025
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,430
You could see a certain situation in the
United States where the rurals look at

1026
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:41,470
the cities and they say, we don't want
you ruling us. You don't live out here.

1027
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,741
What do you,

1028
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:44,860
why should I listen to a bunch of people
live in San Francisco when I live in

1029
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:47,020
the Central Valley of California?
I'm a farmer out here.

1030
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,720
Why can't you leave me the hell alone and,
and you know,

1031
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,990
I used to at least be able to punch above
my weight in terms of you used to have

1032
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,130
to take my opinion into account.

1033
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,330
Now you can just ignore me
and run rough shot over me.

1034
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,330
Why should I be part of that system?

1035
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:01,300
I don't buy into your majority Terrian
system where you are always the majority.

1036
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:04,270
That's not something I'm interested
in. You know, the, the, the sorta the,

1037
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:06,700
the tracks that the founders did not
trust peer majority hereon doesn't mean

1038
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:09,310
they were right not to trust peer majority
Arianism because majority of people

1039
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:11,590
have often believed incredibly
stupid and dangerous things.

1040
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,390
That's why they want
to checks and balances.

1041
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,120
We've sort of run rough shot over those
over the course of the last century.

1042
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,130
But yeah, I mean the, the,

1043
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,510
the fundamental disconnect
between conservatives and
people on the American left,

1044
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,010
uh,
is summed up by Chesterton in,

1045
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,920
in his very famous fence analogy that
if you're on the left and you're walking

1046
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,020
through a field and you see a fence
in the middle of the field just in the

1047
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:35,740
middle of nowhere, you're first instinct
is, I don't know why this fence is here.

1048
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,290
Let's take down the fence. This fence,
it does not belong here. It's just dumb.

1049
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,210
There's no reason for the funds
to be hurt. Get rid of the fence.

1050
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,210
If you're on the right,
your first instinct is to say,

1051
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,150
I'm not going to remove the fence until
I know why it was here in the first

1052
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,740
place.
Once I figure out why I was here,

1053
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:49,750
then we can talk about removing the fence.

1054
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,070
And that is true right now in politics,
the, the left teams to be saying,

1055
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,600
I don't know why any
of this stuff is here.

1056
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,820
They even ascribe bad history
to these things, right?

1057
00:49:57,821 --> 00:50:00,070
They'll say that the electoral college
has put in place to protect slavery or

1058
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:03,550
some such nonsense, which is just not
true. And then the end and then it's like,

1059
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:05,560
well, we created this false
history. Let's get rid of the thing.

1060
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:08,440
I don't know why it's there in the
first place. No reason. Dump it.

1061
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,990
And people on the right.
Whoa, maybe we should like,

1062
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:15,640
think about what the actual possible down
sides here are because virtually every

1063
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,140
action that we take has some
unintended consequences.

1064
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,260
And maybe we overstate the
unintended consequences.

1065
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:23,970
Like I think that has probably happened
for example with gay marriage, right on.

1066
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:28,040
I used to be anti same sex marriage on
the legal level. I used to say like,

1067
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,620
I think that if the government legalizing
same sex marriage that it's going to

1068
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:35,030
have some pretty dramatic impact on how
people interact with one another. Um,

1069
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:38,480
and then I was,
and then before Obers fell,

1070
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,030
I said we should get out of the business
specifically because I don't want

1071
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,590
anybody imposing their
views on anybody else.

1072
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,660
We can all live how we want and
just leave each other alone.

1073
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,150
And I think the the right
overestimated kind of pushback.

1074
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:48,650
Did you get from religious people on that?

1075
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:50,810
I don't know that we've ever
actually specifically talked about.

1076
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,660
I don't know that I got significantly
heavy pushback specifically because I

1077
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:57,870
wasn't making the case that you have to
overrule your own vision of what's in

1078
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,650
constitutes. I'm just saying you
can't impose that on anybody else.

1079
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:04,520
Meaning that if you want to protect
yourself from the other side using

1080
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,170
government for its argument,

1081
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,110
then you need to stop using
government for your argument.

1082
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,030
I was making the anti
institutional argument, right?

1083
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:14,390
I wasn't making the case that everybody
who's religious has to re shift away

1084
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,530
from their religious orientation.

1085
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,750
I wasn't doing the Hillary Clinton thing
where it's like a certain amount of

1086
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,330
religious people. I get that.
Yeah. That I make obviously,

1087
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:23,630
but I would imagine a certain amount of
religious people if they're viewing this

1088
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:27,870
as sort of a foundational societal belief,
right?

1089
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,930
If you change this institution,
I'll tell you,

1090
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,020
I didn't get a ton of pushback
specifically because I
wasn't coming out against

1091
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:33,681
the institution.

1092
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:37,660
I think a lot of the pushback that
surrounded same sex marriage was a twofold

1093
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,470
idea from the religious community. One
was you must personally in your own life,

1094
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,890
except that same sex marriage is morally
equivalent to a heterosexual marriage.

1095
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,800
And if you don't, you're a bigot. And
that offended a lot of religious people.

1096
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,030
People were like,
I don't that,

1097
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,810
that's not an argument I'm willing
to listen to because you're,

1098
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:56,811
you're immediately labeling me a bigot
based on both my religious views and a

1099
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:57,920
view of natural law,

1100
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:01,970
which is fairly common to most religions
and I'm not going to hear that.

1101
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,030
I think that if the, if the
left had approached it as
you don't get to use power,

1102
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,811
we don't get to use power,

1103
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,030
nobody gets used power the
right is much more receptive.

1104
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:09,950
That's been my argument all along.

1105
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:13,790
So I think libertarianism has a lot
more draw than social leftism two to the

1106
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,540
right.
I think you can make,

1107
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,410
can solve most of those problems by having
the government just not be involved.

1108
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:19,600
This has been my contention,
right?

1109
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:23,180
I could cause what I'll say to religious
people as I may even agree with you on

1110
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:27,290
the nature of sinfulness, a particular
activity, but it's none of my business.

1111
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,570
And not only that, I think that if
you make it the government's business,

1112
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,480
you know you're all happy to use the
government right now for your particular

1113
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:32,811
ends,

1114
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:35,270
but there's gonna be a time when you're
not running the government anymore and

1115
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:37,160
they're going to come for you and
you're not gonna be real happy. Right.

1116
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,020
They don't seem to like this Trump guy.
Right.

1117
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,560
They get their answer is more government.
Exactly. So that's why I didn't,

1118
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,270
I didn't get a lot of pushback when I
suggested that because it wasn't coming

1119
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:47,300
from a place of me trying to castigate
people for their own personal moral views.

1120
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,390
And I think that for, for a lot of the
gay rights movement, it was about that.

1121
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,970
It was about, it was about,
I'm trying to castigate people.

1122
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,620
If you believe that what I do is I send,

1123
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:57,590
that's because you're a non
meritorious intolerant bigot.

1124
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,190
Does that also show you the,
the,

1125
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,700
unfortunately religious people have been
tarred with this idea of intolerance

1126
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:07,310
when it isn't true. I mean, is
that like a really good succinct,

1127
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,370
I mean I think that's a good example
because the fact is that listen,

1128
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,700
has there been religious intolerance
toward people? 100%. I mean, come on,

1129
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,730
I can't pretend that that doesn't
exist in the Jewish community,

1130
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,860
exists in the Christian community,
exist in the Muslim community.

1131
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,720
It's true that there's been intolerance.
I quite like,

1132
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:24,200
I don't want to portray religious people
is all completely innocent in this

1133
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,070
cause obviously that's,
there are people who have been

1134
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,980
excised and treated badly by religious
communities. Of course that's true.

1135
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,200
But this is what I was talking
about earlier with, with,

1136
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,600
with Buddha judge his treatment of pens,
the track,

1137
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,470
the attribution of motive depends as the
pence is sitting there like day in and

1138
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:40,830
day out thinking, oh, that people put a
judge in his, in his sexual proclivities.

1139
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,860
Like that's, mm. I don't know
anybody who thinks that way.

1140
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:46,390
If they do think that way,
there's something wrong with
them, frankly. Yeah. Um,

1141
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,530
and it's, and so that's, and also we did,

1142
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,330
it came out of a of a year of me to
where it was like right before all that

1143
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:53,691
happened.

1144
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:57,200
What was everyone making fun of pence
over that he doesn't go into rooms with

1145
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:02,000
other women and yeah, that may sound
odd to me or you know, all right.

1146
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:05,450
That's what he's decided to do. And
guess what has been not accused of doing,

1147
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,090
some of them are frankly, listen, yeah.

1148
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,960
Spending Jewish religious
law for a very long time.

1149
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:10,370
You're not supposed to be alone with a,

1150
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:12,800
with a woman who is not your
wife with the door closed.

1151
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,160
This is like legitimately part of
Jewish law and it has been for several

1152
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,260
thousand years. It's called the acid.
You're not actually supposed to do it.

1153
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:21,200
So like Mike Pence said that, I was
like, oh, well welcome to the club dude.

1154
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,010
Thank you.

1155
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,090
What do you do in a situation like that
then? So if you're in your office and a,

1156
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:25,700
and a female,

1157
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,860
cool. I mean we've got glass doors, so
it's not as much of an issue, right.

1158
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,320
Meaning like,
you know,

1159
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:34,130
I don't really thought it all through
[inaudible] like I never want to be in a

1160
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:38,990
position where I can be accused
of acting with impropriety.

1161
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,100
And by the way, this is true
for doctors too. Like I'm,

1162
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:43,880
I'm shocked that people took
pens that way. I, my wife,

1163
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:47,640
who is a doctor when she goes into, she
is, it turns out I can't believe when she,

1164
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,760
when she goes in and she
examines a patient when a,

1165
00:54:49,761 --> 00:54:51,530
when a male doctor
examines a female patient,

1166
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,850
the new rule basically is there must be
some third party in the room to ensure

1167
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:57,770
that there is no claim
made against the doctor.

1168
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:01,040
It seems to me if you're a prominent
person then you should be considering

1169
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:03,380
exactly the same thing.
Like this doesn't seem illogical to me.

1170
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:06,800
This just seems like for the same reason
that I like body cameras on cops as a

1171
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:07,461
general matter,

1172
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:12,330
I like evidence and I like people who
are there to debunk or enforce the, the,

1173
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,700
the actual account that happened.

1174
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,060
So is this another one of
those things where they,

1175
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,510
the road to hell is paved with good
intentions. Where the idea of course is,

1176
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:24,460
you know, we're gonna put everybody in
situations where the you, I wouldn't care.

1177
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:27,490
I don't care if the person that I
hire, I don't look at their, I mean,

1178
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,070
when we did our last job posting,
I made a point of saying,

1179
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:33,460
I don't care about your gender.
I don't care about your sexuality.

1180
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't care about your skin color,
et Cetera, et cetera. But in reality,

1181
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:41,530
because the world is so out of whack
right now, the truth, the real truth is,

1182
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:43,990
I don't know that I've ever said this
publicly. When we were looking at resumes,

1183
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:48,760
I was less inclined to hire a
gay man because I thought, well,

1184
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,650
I could be in a room with this person
and then they could just announce that,

1185
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,700
listen, they're writing.
How insane is that?

1186
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:58,660
So now you've created a scene because
you create the system of incentives that

1187
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,250
it doesn't help anybody.

1188
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,350
Right.
[inaudible] you've seen actually this,

1189
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:06,370
this sort of thing materially
speaking in terms of, for example,

1190
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,860
policies that say that you're not allowed
to do criminal background checks on

1191
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:12,610
potential employees because there are
too many black folks who have criminal

1192
00:56:12,611 --> 00:56:14,680
backgrounds and so we want to make
sure more black people are employed.

1193
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,830
You actually end up with a reverse what
you end up with his employers who look

1194
00:56:17,831 --> 00:56:22,000
at resumes and in many cases cannot check
the criminal background of people and

1195
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:22,691
so they say,
okay,

1196
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:25,780
statistically it's more likely that a
black person went to prison than a white

1197
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,680
person went to prison is
not a racial statement.

1198
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,880
That's a statistical statement of fact
and so I'm just not going to hire this

1199
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,460
black person. Well, who gets hurt by that?

1200
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:35,320
That black guy who didn't commit
a crime, right? Yeah. This is,

1201
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:39,070
this is the sort of thing that like there
are dangerous unintended consequences

1202
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:41,620
to public policies that are,
that are well intentioned. Again,

1203
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:44,080
I think it's a well intentioned public
policy, but I think that it's a,

1204
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,280
a bad public policy.

1205
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,700
And to pretend that people aren't
people as stupid people are going to use

1206
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,520
whatever information they have at
hand to make judgments and to protect

1207
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,220
themselves. And this is, this is true if,

1208
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,390
if this is true with regards to employers
and women taking time off from the

1209
00:56:58,391 --> 00:57:02,040
workforce, this is true with
regard to sexual harassment
allegations. Like, listen,

1210
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:06,310
when I was growing up, my mom always said
to me, right, and my mom ran businesses.

1211
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:06,651
I mean she,

1212
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:09,880
she was a higher up at the company that
did hell's kitchen and she did like

1213
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,970
major reality TV shows. So she was
a high powered when my mom worked,

1214
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,120
my dad stayed at home and my mom said
to me, if you ever get a secretary,

1215
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,050
get a 70 year old woman,
right?

1216
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:20,800
Because you're never going to be
accused of anything cause she 70 Riley.

1217
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,960
And that was my mom saying that to me.

1218
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,150
Some people have that fetish,
but

1219
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,540
it as a general rule like this,
but,

1220
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,320
and that's not entirely like human
nature is human nature. In this,

1221
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,650
there's been this willful attempt to blind
ourselves to human nature that I find

1222
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,370
alternatively hilarious
and ridiculous and scary.

1223
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,220
It's like what we're supposed to pretend
that reality doesn't exist because we

1224
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:43,950
wish reality. We're not what
it was. And the truth is the,

1225
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,070
the unhappiest people on Earth are
the people who are constantly fighting

1226
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:49,380
reality. Whether you're talking about
in your dating life where it's like,

1227
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,950
I want to look just exactly as I feel
like looking at everybody else who won't

1228
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:55,140
date me. It's their problem. You
can't get a date. And I said, well,

1229
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:59,570
maybe it's because you haven't worked out
in 10 years. Right. Stink, right? Or Yeah.

1230
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,490
Or, or maybe a or whether it's in
the job market where it's like, well,

1231
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:06,310
I wish that I could get this job and I
deserve to get this job and I'm not going

1232
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:10,470
to do what I need resume wise to get
the job or I'm going to rely on such and

1233
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:13,110
such to get the job that I don't get
your order or I'm going to sit in this

1234
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:13,800
dying town.

1235
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm never going to leave this dying
town because I deserved to have a job in

1236
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:17,400
this tiny town.

1237
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,040
The nice thing about politics is you
can pander to everybody by lying to them

1238
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,130
about these realities.
Right.

1239
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,150
Did you, did you happen to see last
night, I think it was on 60 minutes,

1240
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:28,250
there's a clip going around of this
young, you saw this, this student? Yeah,

1241
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,380
or they, they interviewed several
students and the thrust of it,

1242
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:33,450
I didn't see the full thing.
I just wrote what they tweeted out,

1243
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,190
the videos that they tweet it out,

1244
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,590
but the rest of it with
all these young people,

1245
00:58:37,591 --> 00:58:40,710
but there's this particular
young man saying, you know,

1246
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:44,250
if college was free in medical school was
free and that I wouldn't have to work.

1247
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:48,180
And then because of that, I could study
more. Thus I could be a better dot. Right?

1248
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,190
And it's like,
hey,

1249
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:52,830
there's no proof that that's actually
true and you might learn a lot of things

1250
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:53,641
by working and all that.

1251
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:57,360
Now the idea that med school maybe is
too much money in college is completely

1252
00:58:57,361 --> 00:59:00,600
out of whack. That's a perfectly
legit conversation to have. Right?

1253
00:59:00,601 --> 00:59:01,710
And we can't have that conversation,

1254
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,460
but I just thought the way it was spun
by the Twitter account was like, see,

1255
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:08,900
it's obvious you shouldn't have to work
if you're going to be a doctor. Right?

1256
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,680
And it's like, no, no.

1257
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,140
Right. We're missing
something here. That's the,

1258
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,790
so what was funny about that
story is CBS news covered it as,

1259
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,790
isn't this a great example
of why we should make medical
school for free? Right.

1260
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,010
And what actually happened
is there was a donor

1261
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,330
I believe is Bernie Marcus from,

1262
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,860
from home depot who went to
Nyu and he donated several,

1263
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,550
I believe it's like a hundred million
dollars to Nyu to pay for the medical

1264
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:33,530
education of the kids who went to Nyu.

1265
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,340
So as a private donor doing something
good for these kids and they're like,

1266
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,760
what if we just made a government policy?

1267
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,220
Well then you completely skewed the
incentive structures. What would happen,

1268
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,840
because I'll tell you what would
be the next thing that happened.

1269
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,150
The next thing that happened
is that doctors would be,

1270
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,460
would be granted free tuition presumably.

1271
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,110
And the next thing that would
happen is they would say, okay,

1272
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,230
well now you have to be regulated so
you need to work for 60 grand a year,

1273
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,070
at which point the registration
rates would dramatically drop it.

1274
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:56,930
And you get a completely different crop
of people who are going into medicine in

1275
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:59,390
the first place because you know that
you're going to get free education,

1276
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:01,670
but you're only gonna make 60 grand,
70 grand on the other end.

1277
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,330
All those people who right now are paying
$200,000 to go to medical school so

1278
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,490
they can make $400,000 a year coming out.

1279
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,620
All those people decided to
go work at Mckinsey instead.

1280
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,590
That's all that happens because people
are profit seeking and want to live a

1281
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:14,180
certain lifestyle and guess what?

1282
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,230
After 11 years of this shit like my wife
deserves to be able to earn whatever

1283
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,910
she can earn. I mean, I've been doing
this thing, okay, I've been women,

1284
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,940
like I cannot tell you how many,

1285
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,120
how many things we've had to forego and
I've paid for her medical education,

1286
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,980
right? I mean, I've gone
out of pocket for all of it.

1287
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,050
I've paid for every iota of her medical
education and it's cost us a lot,

1288
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,800
but she's working for below minimum wage
right now because doctors and residency

1289
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,240
effectively worked for below minimum wage.

1290
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:39,680
They're making 40 50 grand a year and
then working 80 hours a week and that's

1291
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,380
what they go through.
And you know what?

1292
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,870
That's because they should
make money on the other end.

1293
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:48,590
The market does have a value
in determining what the
value of these things are.

1294
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,400
The two solutions to that are either the
market or private people like the home

1295
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:56,210
depot guy come in and that that frankly
I think that it's just, it's not perfect,

1296
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,280
but frankly I don't think
that nobody's forced.

1297
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,440
I don't think that there
is a serious, yeah. Okay.

1298
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:03,020
So there are a couple of things you can
do to bring down medical school tuition.

1299
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,510
One, you could stop with the licensure
requirements for things that nurse

1300
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,070
practitioners could do.
Right?

1301
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:09,800
Because that way you have bunch of people
who are going to nursing school or PA

1302
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:13,430
school and they can do a lot of this
stuff and then you don't have to create

1303
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:17,300
this cartel and the cartel charges a
lot of money too for you to get into it

1304
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,630
that that'd be one thing.
But number two, so what,

1305
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,760
so you take out a bunch of loans to go
to medical school and they make a bunch

1306
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:23,361
of money coming out,

1307
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,390
which you should make because you
have spent a lot of money going in.

1308
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,470
Like if you want,

1309
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,500
the question is do you want your doctors
to be people who make a lot of money?

1310
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:34,010
Do you think doctrine is an important
thing as a society such that you want the

1311
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:35,150
smartest people going into it?

1312
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,920
If you want the smartest
people going into any industry,

1313
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:39,920
you have to make sure that the pay
grade is high enough and I'm at,

1314
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:41,720
my problem here is not
free medical school.

1315
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:45,170
My problem is that it will be used as
an incentive to to force doctors to take

1316
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:46,940
less of a cost for Medicare for example,

1317
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:50,030
and then you will get a lesser group of
people intellectually than you otherwise

1318
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:51,980
would. There's an unintended
consequence to this sort of stuff.

1319
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:56,330
So he's this just the fundamental flaw
with almost every argument that comes out

1320
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:59,630
of the progressive these days that if
you give free college that this will

1321
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:01,160
somehow ultimately do good.

1322
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:05,780
Even though we know that there are more
jobs disappearing that you wouldn't need

1323
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:06,950
college,
but that will be the free,

1324
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:10,220
you can go to trade school or or any of
these things where it's like we can or

1325
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:12,560
Medicare and then the free
college education. The,

1326
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,960
the free college education argument is
one of the worst arguments I've ever

1327
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:17,660
heard. It's legitimately a terrible
argument. I mean the idea that look,

1328
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,160
everybody in college is earning more
than people who didn't go to college.

1329
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,850
Therefore if everyone went to college
they would all earn more than that. No,

1330
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,560
I'm sorry.

1331
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,100
The reason people earn more from going
to college is because it is a sorting

1332
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:32,160
mechanism. If you get rid of the sorting
mechanism, you know what will happen.

1333
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:33,420
There'll be another sorting mechanism,

1334
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:37,240
which is exactly what's happened with Grad
schools. The vast, a huge number of it.

1335
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,760
Like as you sort,

1336
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,300
the incomes go up and as you get rid
of the sorting mechanism that our new

1337
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:45,240
sorting mechanisms that are added to
the job market and to the educational

1338
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:47,460
market while you're actually getting,
unless you're actually, you know,

1339
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,130
going there for math or science
or something, but as I said,

1340
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:53,250
if you go to college and I went to
Ucla and then Harvard law school,

1341
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:54,480
so I have plenty of experience with,

1342
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:58,770
with going and majoring in useless things
and major university, you were Ali's,

1343
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,840
I mean I was a poly sci major at Ucla,

1344
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:02,640
which is a useless thing
in a major university.

1345
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:07,500
The all that these things are are twofold.
A sorting mechanism,

1346
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,220
because I went to Ucla and Nazi son and
that means that presumably I'm smarter

1347
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:15,060
because it's a higher sat score to get
into Ucla than it is to get into Csun and

1348
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:15,840
second,

1349
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,410
a an Ersatz social fabric where you
meet a bunch of people who then you can

1350
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:21,130
later on call on his friends.
Right.

1351
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,060
This is what JD man's talks about and
hillbilly elegy coming from Appalachian,

1352
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,871
going to Yale law school.

1353
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:27,570
Suddenly he has a group of people he
can call on and he's part of the social

1354
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,910
fabric and he's operating
in different social circles.

1355
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,570
Neither of those two things are going
to be cured by universal college because

1356
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,660
the social fabric goes away because it's
not selective anymore and the sorting

1357
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:38,820
mechanism goes away because it's
not selective anymore. Right.

1358
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,760
So so do you get free college no
matter what your major is? Well,

1359
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:45,070
this is the other thing, lesbian dance
theory, that Free College, right?

1360
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,990
What did we give to society when you're
not qualified to do anything? By the way,

1361
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,110
Buddhist judge has exactly right about
this. This, he was correct on and he says,

1362
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,560
why are we having middleclass people
subsidizing people who are upperclassmen.

1363
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,900
Totally correct.
Totally correct.

1364
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,190
The people who are going to end up in
college enabled to get into college.

1365
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:02,160
You're going to be the people who would
have been able to go to college anyway.

1366
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,680
We don't need more
people going to college.

1367
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:06,060
When you have fewer people going to
college, we need less useless majors.

1368
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,520
We need people being able to apprentice
directly into law school. We needed it.

1369
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,630
Like why is it that you have to be 23
and you've gone through seven years of

1370
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:15,990
education to go to law school? Why? It
makes no sense. Why couldn't you just,

1371
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,540
when you're hiring right now
because daily wires killing it.

1372
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:19,810
You guys are growing fast.
You're,

1373
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:23,640
you're doing all sorts of stuff over at
the office. Uh, when you look at resume,

1374
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:26,220
I don't know how involved,
yeah, yeah. My best partner,

1375
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,620
Jeremy is much more involved but yeah.

1376
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,260
Do you even care that much work experience
matters more than where you went to

1377
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:32,660
college? For sure. I mean,

1378
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:35,340
Jeremy is a perfect example is my
business partner didn't finish college.

1379
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,640
He went to a music school and dropped
out after two years and people used to

1380
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,451
look down their noses in it.

1381
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:42,750
And I remember there was a very prominent
person whose name everyone would

1382
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,250
recognize who one's called up,

1383
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,820
Jeremy Cursing at him because
he had not gone to college.

1384
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:52,830
And Jeremy was like, why? Like Jared
and Jeremy now runs a company that,

1385
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,870
that, you know, we have close
to 100 employees. We clear
a lot of money every year.

1386
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
We grossed a lot of money and the,

1387
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,690
he knew some of the smartest people I
know never went to college or finish

1388
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,524
college.
Like it's,

1389
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,190
it's good for what it's good for
and it's bad for what it's bad for.

1390
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,570
It's good for premed. It's good
for math. It's good. It would be.

1391
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,510
I got a lot of flack for saying
this about, about kind of the,

1392
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,280
what we call the north campus majors
at Ucla. Uh, the, the, uh, po,

1393
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:17,980
the poly psy

1394
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,020
English history majors.
And I said like,

1395
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:23,830
basically this is effectively
useless and you should, you know,

1396
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,990
unless you're majoring in a hard science,
you should think about going elsewhere.

1397
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,760
Like, well, your whole book is about
Western civilized philosophy look, right?

1398
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,430
We don't learn any of that crap.
Go to college anymore. Well,

1399
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,880
that's the reason I wrote the book is
because none of these people learn any of

1400
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:34,750
this stuff.
Nobody's ever heard of.

1401
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:37,420
A client is when you go like when's
the last time they taught Aquinas at a,

1402
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:41,080
at a major university other than in
sort of religious studies classes.

1403
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:46,260
They don't even mandate
western Civ anymore at these
classes nor I mean like the

1404
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:48,430
stuff should be imbibed with your
mother's milk. I mean they should be,

1405
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:50,950
they should be part of just the
generalized educational curriculum.

1406
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,210
If we want to go down in the
conspiracy road a little bit.

1407
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:57,570
Is that part of it too is that if you
really wanted to keep indoctrinating

1408
01:05:57,571 --> 01:06:02,370
people with lefty ideas and socialist
ideas and big government ideas and all of

1409
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:03,900
those things in collectivist ideas,

1410
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,770
we'll give them free college and then
just teach them those ideas for four years

1411
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,580
and then you've really whacked
them at the knees before they,

1412
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,733
I mean I think there is

1413
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,200
there. To me it would
make sense. Bernie say go,

1414
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,110
everyone's getting free college and what
are we going to do to you at college?

1415
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,063
Teach you postmodern.

1416
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,740
I think. I think it's less
conspiratorial than that,

1417
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:23,290
but I do think that there are a bunch
of people on the left who certainly are

1418
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:26,410
not upset about the fact that colleges
are dominated by the left and who are

1419
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:29,200
very angry every time somebody tries
to break that domination. I mean,

1420
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:33,310
this is why I get banned from colleges
speaking about stuff like this. So it's,

1421
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,390
you know, again, it's, it's a
pretty hardy policy. How do you,

1422
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:41,090
how do you take the ideas
between Jerusalem and Athens
and how do you then just

1423
01:06:41,091 --> 01:06:45,050
beat the easy ideas of the day? Because
that's, to me, that is where we're at.

1424
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,050
So now we're just at a place,
a easy answer.

1425
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,240
Everyone that I disagree with is a racist,
bigot.

1426
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:53,270
Homophobe I know how to do everything.
Everyone before me was evil.

1427
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:55,670
All of those things,
let's change everything.

1428
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,340
The current laws in electoral
college and everything else.

1429
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,550
Let's do all of those things because
we're so good and everyone else so stupid.

1430
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,930
Well, how do you actually
beat that? I mean, that's what

1431
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:08,520
right, trying to do, right? I
mean, I think that the first
thing to do is to, is to,

1432
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,040
you know, get people involved
in reeducating themselves.

1433
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,990
And I think you're taking tremendous
hunger for that. Obviously.

1434
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:16,170
I mean this is a book on
Western philosophy and in
the first two weeks we sold

1435
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:18,970
well over a hundred thousand copies.
It's a book on Western philosophy, right?

1436
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:22,850
And that is not exactly pop reading.
I mean that's not right.

1437
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,390
It's not happy dappy do kind of stuff.

1438
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:26,160
So it's ignored and told
people how to clean their room.

1439
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:29,640
And so 5 million exactly. It. That's
exactly right. That's exactly right.

1440
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:31,310
I mean like there's a market for,

1441
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:34,740
for hard stuff right now because people
are looking for something that means

1442
01:07:34,741 --> 01:07:38,080
something and we haven't created
a much better world with,

1443
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,320
with the Twitter woke police out there.

1444
01:07:40,321 --> 01:07:42,870
I don't think that people are feeling
happy or secure because of all that.

1445
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,260
So do you think it's
fundamentally a crisis of meaning?

1446
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,870
That's really what I took away from
your book yesterday and I really,

1447
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:51,080
I was thinking about it over the weekend.
It's like nut. We listen, you know,

1448
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,670
we fight on Twitter all day long.

1449
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:57,530
We all siphon off into our own little
places and now between fake news and

1450
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:01,810
everything else, it's like nobody really
knows in the secular world lit. Yeah.

1451
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,960
Nobody really knew has this, and this
is the sadness of liberalism right now.

1452
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:06,794
For me,

1453
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:11,830
it's like maybe liberalism didn't give
enough through a secular lens and PR and

1454
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,630
I think maybe you'd argue that's
because he got disconnected from, uh,

1455
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,370
from Jerusalem.

1456
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,960
Uh, people not bet that we're in a
crisis. We're in a crisis of belief.

1457
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,200
I think they are crisis of reality.
Here's what,

1458
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,630
here's night real argument with sort of
the secular version of the enlightenment,

1459
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:28,190
the French German version
of the enlightenment,

1460
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:32,600
which is that by disconnecting the
connection to Judeo Christian values,

1461
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,050
the idea was that we were
going to untether ourselves
to be able to fly to the

1462
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:37,280
stars,
but can make our own meaning.

1463
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:39,980
And I think people suck in making
their own meaning. Frankly.

1464
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,660
I think that generally when
people make their own meaning,

1465
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:45,790
they tend to fall into hedonism or
nihilism. I think that there are,

1466
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,770
some people can do it, right? Yeah,
for sure. Some people can do it,

1467
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,710
some people can do it. Some people can
live with this. I mean I think that Sam,

1468
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:55,020
it seems like a fulfilled guy. Michael
Shermer is a fulfilled guy, right?

1469
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,150
I think there are,
there are people who can,

1470
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,400
who can live with this and
make their own meaning,

1471
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,310
but for the vast majority of people,
the answer is absolutely not.

1472
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,760
You cannot make your own meaning because
if you make your own meaning you tend

1473
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:07,010
toward either selfishness
or meaninglessness.

1474
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,740
You need to be told that your life has
value and that you're in control of your

1475
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:14,600
own life and there needs to be rooted,
rooted philosophy to support that.

1476
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:18,470
And that begins with teaching
these very simple stories.

1477
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,090
I mean I it fundamentally,

1478
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:23,720
I think that religious education begins
with the stuff that is harder to believe

1479
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,910
because that's the most simplest to
understand. Its hardest to believe in,

1480
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:26,930
simplest to understand,
right?

1481
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,630
The stories in genesis are the
hardest to believe on their face,

1482
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,590
but they're also the simplest
to understand like you
get from the idea of Adam

1483
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:36,520
and eve, that you are not the creator
of your own meeting, right? That,

1484
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,060
that the knowledge of good and evil,

1485
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:40,670
your knowledge of good and evil is not
the same as God's knowledge of good and

1486
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,210
evil. And that by attempting to
create your own meaning, it's a,

1487
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:46,410
you're actually egotistically
sending against God. That's,

1488
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:49,490
that's the message for the Adam and Eve
story or the Canine and Cain and Abel

1489
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:49,761
story,

1490
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:54,761
which is that ceaseless jealousy and a
belief in your incapacity to take control

1491
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,100
of your life that that result
in violence and cruelty, right?

1492
01:09:58,101 --> 01:10:02,060
That's the basic issue of can enable
which has god says to Cain, you know,

1493
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,390
Tim Shell, you can do this. And then kids
like, nope, I'm going call my brother.

1494
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,200
And that's it. And you see that down
and it's an aspect of human nature.

1495
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:12,740
You teach these very simple stories to
people, David versus Goliath, right?

1496
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,900
All of this can be the big guy right here,
right there.

1497
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,440
There are plenty of great stories that,
that embed fundamental values.

1498
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,350
Cause this is how you teach
kids. Everybody teaches
kids secular and religious.

1499
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:23,720
You teach kids stories.
Like when I read in my daughter at night,

1500
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,960
I'm not reading her from, from Sam's
book, she wouldn't understand it, right?

1501
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:29,300
Or I'm not going to read
her enlightenment now or,

1502
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:31,220
or how the mind works by pinker like,
Oh,

1503
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,280
you have to start with certain fundamental
values that the fundamental values

1504
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,080
are generally rooted in story.

1505
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:39,170
This is where Jordan is totally correct
and those are deeply embedded in the

1506
01:10:39,171 --> 01:10:40,004
human psyche.

1507
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,680
And so there's an immediate resonance
to a lot of the biblical stories,

1508
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:45,280
which is why the Bible has
staying in selling power. Uh,

1509
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:50,390
and then you use those stories in
coordination with reason to expand those

1510
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,340
stories outward and to develop. Right.
But you have to always stay tethered.

1511
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,780
I mean it's,
you can lengthen the chain,

1512
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:59,690
but at a certain point the chain breaks
and then then you're off and running and

1513
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:03,350
then you got a problem that the point
that I'm making here is that I think the

1514
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:03,890
West has,

1515
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:08,690
has undercut its own allegiance
to fundamental principle
and they thought that

1516
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:11,810
this would allow the rise of reason to
dominate and what it's instead allowed

1517
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:16,770
for is in the worst cases,
some really horrible things.
And in the best cases, yes,

1518
01:11:16,771 --> 01:11:18,480
it continuation material prosperity,

1519
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,020
but also in a crisis of purpose and
meaning that's happening to people where

1520
01:11:22,021 --> 01:11:23,310
they're looking around, okay, okay, I'm a,

1521
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,640
I'm a ball of meat wandering
through the universe, purposeless.

1522
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:29,910
I don't have free will. I don't have
the capacity to, to control my own life.

1523
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,710
What am I supposed to do now?

1524
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,920
So I think basically what you're saying
is you think it could work for awhile

1525
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:37,920
that Athens alone could work
for a certain amount of,

1526
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:41,100
as long as it's living off the
fumes of the Judaeo Christian ethic.

1527
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,310
And this is the point that I made to Sam
when we debated in San Francisco was I

1528
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:47,140
said, Sam, why is it that we hold
the same values? Because we do,

1529
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,040
we have on a fundamental level, we
have basically the same value. So why?

1530
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,840
And he said, well, I've studied
this and I've studied this.

1531
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,420
I've studied eastern philosophy. This is
where I get my value. So that's great,

1532
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,730
but why are ours the same? Right? Because
I haven't studied any of those things.

1533
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:57,600
So why are those the same?

1534
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,120
And I don't think it's because I've
studied deeply in the Bible in Sam hasn't.

1535
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,960
I think it's because we both grew up
on the fumes of this culture, right?

1536
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:06,300
I mean we grew up 10 miles
from each other in Los Angeles.

1537
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:10,440
That seems to me a better kind of
historical explanation of why we believe

1538
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,880
fundamentally the same things.

1539
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,550
Then that he studied one philosophy
and I studied another philosophy.

1540
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,830
So do you think we're in
the fumes stage now? Yeah,

1541
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:20,100
I think the theme is running out. I think
that Jerusalem, the Jerusalem fumes,

1542
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:23,980
and I think that as the Jerusalem
fumes run out, so do the soda,

1543
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,480
the great hopes that were behind
the reason based enlightenment.

1544
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,900
Meaning that one of the points
that I make is that the,

1545
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:36,180
the enlightenment makes fundamental
assumptions that are unsustainable on the

1546
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:37,230
grounds of the enlightenment,

1547
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:42,360
meaning the enlightenment
argue the secular enlightenment
and that non American

1548
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,680
Anglo Enlightenment makes the argument
that basically we are Spinosa this stone

1549
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,080
where bald meet wandering
through the universe. No,

1550
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:50,400
we'll have our own no free will.

1551
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,660
I mean Sam wrote an entire book
about there not being free. Well, um,

1552
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:57,030
and that we don't have the capacity to
choose. And when Sam talks about reason,

1553
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,500
as I asked him before,
like,

1554
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,250
so according to evolutionary biology
reason is just a beneficial firing of the

1555
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:04,800
neurons. But you make a moral
argument in favor of reason.

1556
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,380
So my question is on what basis,

1557
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,760
what if there was a more evolutionarily
beneficial firing of the neurons?

1558
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:14,550
Say genocide, genocide. This is
Hitler's rationale. Effectively

1559
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,990
just apply Darwinism to the social
sphere and we can effectively wipe out

1560
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:19,980
everybody who we don't like.

1561
01:13:19,981 --> 01:13:22,920
And that will better humanity by getting
rid of the weaklings and they can move

1562
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:27,750
on. I have also correct, Dan has had,
Thanos is on board with this by the way.

1563
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,870
Dennis has an infinity songwriters and
you just create more resources anyway. Um,

1564
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,350
if you met a genie with the first
thing you wish for more wishes,

1565
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,150
but in any case, the, the
fundamentals of the enlightenment,

1566
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:40,980
which are reason freewill,

1567
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,760
the capacity to make your own decisions
are actually robbed by scientific

1568
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:46,500
materials.
And if you're a scientific materialist,

1569
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:48,060
I don't know how you sustain the bay.

1570
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,030
Like Sam says he believes in
objective truth. I agree with Sam.

1571
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:52,470
There's objective truth.
It's fascinating.

1572
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,200
Jordan doesn't believe in objective
truth in the same way, right?

1573
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:58,530
Jordan believes in a sort of
Charles Pierce, Charles Purse, um,

1574
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,430
pragmatism with regard to truth.
That truth is whatever works.

1575
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,670
And so there's certain things that have
been proved to work in those are true,

1576
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,300
which is attractively useful
for evolutionary biology.

1577
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,650
Sam believes and objective truth.

1578
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,760
Like there's an truth out
there to be discovered.

1579
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,230
There are things that are true and
there are things that are false.

1580
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,370
I totally agree with him. You believe
that, but not for the same. Well,

1581
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,840
I don't know. Well, as I asked him,
I don't know what his reason is.

1582
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:23,710
Meaning Sam says that stuff, and I don't
mean to rip on somebody, but I mean,

1583
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:25,720
I talk about all this in the book and
I'm sure he can write a really cogent

1584
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:28,150
response cause he has a bright guy.
And I really like his stuff.

1585
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:31,340
I hate doing this when he's not
here. Yeah, no, I know. You know,

1586
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:34,460
we should do it when Sam's here so
we can discuss it, but it, but the,

1587
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,130
the fundamental point that I make is
if you are going to argue in favor of

1588
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,770
reason,
if you're gonna argue in favor of will,

1589
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:44,140
if you're going to argue in
favor of all of these things,

1590
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,050
you need to make some fundamental
assumptions that are simply not objective.

1591
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:47,550
Truth.

1592
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:50,560
W evolutionary biology doesn't speak to
objective truth and speaks to what is

1593
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:54,700
useful to a species that allows
it to survive and thrive.

1594
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:59,050
But it doesn't speak to what's true if
the species didn't exist with two plus

1595
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:02,710
two equals four be true. Sam would
say yes. And I would say, why?

1596
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:06,160
Because the species doesn't exist to use
it. So what, what does that even mean?

1597
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,660
There's the Judeo Christian ethics and
this is where Greek teleology in Judeo

1598
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,940
Christian ethics made, you know,
the Greeks, Aristotle, Plato,

1599
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,770
they believed there was such
a thing as an objective truth.

1600
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:19,030
They believed that there was such a
thing as a universe that a cosmos that is

1601
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,760
understandable,
they believed in the idea of free will,

1602
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:23,260
that you could make a
difference in a cosmos

1603
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,650
leaving in it, you would say is
just not enough. Right, right.

1604
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:31,030
Just believing in the,
in the rational mind is still not enough.

1605
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,760
Right. And the, and when they do
get as a type of belief, right.

1606
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:38,470
And I think that they attempt to, they,
they attempt to prove back to, you know,

1607
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:40,300
the unmoved mover.
And that's a good starting point.

1608
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:44,500
This is why Aquinas is so reliant on
Aristotelian theology at the same thing is

1609
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:47,830
true for my monities. They both, uh,
like the, the, the greatest, I think,

1610
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:52,831
attempt historically to merge
the religious philosophy
of Judeo Christianity and

1611
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:54,640
the,

1612
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,140
and the Greek philosophy of Aristotle
and Plato is simultaneously done in the

1613
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:02,480
Islamic world and the Christian world
and the Judaic world actually, uh,

1614
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,210
it's done by Alpha Robbie in the,

1615
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:07,180
in the Islamic world and it's done
by my monities and the Judaic world.

1616
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:10,150
And it's done by, by Aquinas
in the, in the Christian world.

1617
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,120
And it's an attempt to merge.
But in the merger you,

1618
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,480
you sort of lose the tension that's
necessary I think because when you

1619
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:19,120
completely merge than it,
then you end up in the same place as the,

1620
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:23,170
as the theocrat, which is okay, so natural
law and theology are exactly the same.

1621
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:24,250
So let's just follow the theology.

1622
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,940
My bottom bothering with
this reasoning it out thing.

1623
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:29,230
There is no reason to do that.
I think the tension exists for a reason.

1624
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:33,510
So then getting us back. Then how
do we get out of this thing, this,

1625
01:16:33,511 --> 01:16:36,390
this polarization that we seem to be in?
Which I do think,

1626
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:40,800
I think you got it right
here is the tension between
these two cities right now.

1627
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,780
So how do we break this?

1628
01:16:42,781 --> 01:16:45,480
Because we're all sort of caught in
it and I've also been thinking about

1629
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,030
something that we've talked about a
bunch before that we're running out of

1630
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:52,710
communal spaces or communal events to
have anything left to bring us together.

1631
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:55,260
Nobody really watches
the nightly news anymore.

1632
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:59,010
We're after game of Thrones goes off after
this. Yeah. We're basically out of time

1633
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,510
and, and we're, and we're stuck with it
and we're still with cultural events,

1634
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:04,100
not actual meaning based event.

1635
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,380
Right. We don't have a go into the, we
don't have a moon landing coming up.

1636
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:10,250
You know,
we're really running short on,

1637
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,530
I mean July 4th parade are controversial.

1638
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:16,520
Yeah. Now when you upgrade to it, yeah.
You're parading genocide or something.

1639
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:21,310
I mean it's all nuns. It's,
but as this tension ramps up,

1640
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:25,300
the fact that we're now have
no spaces to let the vents off.

1641
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,920
That seems to me to be the biggest thing.
Yeah,

1642
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,980
I totally agree. And this is not just,
you know, people in the right thing.

1643
01:17:29,981 --> 01:17:32,510
There's people on the left are
recognizing this and Robert Putnam's,

1644
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:33,570
a sociologist at Harvard,

1645
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:36,250
he writes with the scraper called bowling
alone and in it he talks about the,

1646
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,100
the sort of meme diversity is
our strength. And he says, yeah,

1647
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,140
I used to believe this.
Diversity is our strength stuff.

1648
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,810
And then I looked at the social science
and what I found is that as ethnic

1649
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:45,310
diversity in a place increases,

1650
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,490
the only two things that increase our
protest marches and television watching.

1651
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:51,730
Unless unless there's a common purpose,
there's a common purpose,

1652
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:53,740
then diversity is your strength.
So in other words,

1653
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:56,230
if you go to a church and you'll get
the church, a bunch of diverse faces,

1654
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,310
people have different experiences,

1655
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:59,140
but they're all there to
have a common purpose,

1656
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,350
worship God and take care of each other.
Then diversity is great.

1657
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,080
All the experiences, you can tell each
other about it. You have the same goal.

1658
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,660
That's all fantastic.
He said the same thing about the army.

1659
01:18:07,661 --> 01:18:10,870
You go to the army and you
see an incredibly diverse
group of people. I mean,

1660
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:14,230
we know, we both know a lot of people
who serve in the military and the,

1661
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:18,130
the amount of cross racial friendship
in the military is amazing, right?

1662
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:20,950
For people who just grew up in a secular
society and where it's like, yeah,

1663
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:24,070
I have my black friend and but that's
not true in the military and the military

1664
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:28,570
and people legitimately bond across races
because they're forced into proximity

1665
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,880
where they are like sports,
nobody cares.

1666
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:34,090
Corrected sports is another great example,
right? They have the same common goal.

1667
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:37,060
Well, so the question becomes for
our society, what is our common goal?

1668
01:18:37,061 --> 01:18:40,870
And it seems like that common goal is
receding because some of the fundamental

1669
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:43,270
things I think that we are all
supposed to agree on, right?

1670
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:48,220
The free speech democracy, the use of
freewill, the use of responsibility,

1671
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,730
even things as fundamental
as that are dissipating in,

1672
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:55,240
in response to people saying,
you know what? All this is a lie.

1673
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,870
The only way to attain power and
protection for my group is returned to

1674
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:02,140
tribalism, which is intersectionality
on the one hand and,

1675
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,410
and white supremacy on the other.
Uh, or we are going to get rid of,

1676
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,870
of all of this stuff in the name of the
collective because the individual no

1677
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,180
longer matters like the,
I talk in the,

1678
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,800
in the book about this could a fourfold
matrix for human happiness that we all

1679
01:19:14,801 --> 01:19:18,220
exist as human beings on a couple
of levels as members of uh,

1680
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:21,520
as individuals and then as members of
community and we are all these things,

1681
01:19:21,521 --> 01:19:24,880
right? I mean people will
say the communist will say
you're just a member of the

1682
01:19:24,881 --> 01:19:28,840
community basically. And then libertarians
will say you're only in individual.

1683
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,220
And the truth is neither of those things.

1684
01:19:30,221 --> 01:19:32,800
You are a member of a community and
you're an individual and they are

1685
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:36,100
simultaneous and inextricable.
And so you need to,

1686
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,790
so the human happiness in individual
exists when you have the following,

1687
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:42,490
four things in, in a society can exist
when you have the following four things,

1688
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,540
individual, individual purpose.
So you get up in the morning,

1689
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:50,320
you're on a desert island,
what do you do today or you nihilistic.

1690
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,840
Do you have something to do? What
makes, what gives you meaning?

1691
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:57,730
Communal purpose meaning what can we all
get together to do and what's our goal

1692
01:19:57,731 --> 01:19:59,560
together as America?
Are we here to spread liberty?

1693
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:03,190
Are we here to preserve liberty?
Are we here to create economic equality?

1694
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:07,260
What is our goal as a community and how
do we not quash individual purpose in

1695
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:10,620
that there has to be a balance, right?
Cause if communal purpose is too strong,

1696
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,830
you quashed the individual and
then there's individual capacity.

1697
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:16,050
You have to feel like you as a person
are in control of your own life,

1698
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:19,950
capable of forging forth into the kind
of adventure and wilderness which is the

1699
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:22,710
American mentality and you have
to have a communal capacity,

1700
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:24,150
a system that allows me to,

1701
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:27,870
as an individual thrive while allowing
us as a community to mobilize when need

1702
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:28,980
be.
If you have these four things,

1703
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,060
then you can be a happy individual and
you can be have a happy society. Now,

1704
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,460
the way I think this is the best
balance in terms of government is that

1705
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:40,020
government is weak enough not
to attack you as an individual,

1706
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,770
but is strong enough to mobilize when
we really need to mobilize to protect

1707
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:48,210
those individual rights and to protect
the, the system at large. That's,

1708
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:50,070
that's where I think the founders got it.
Exactly right.

1709
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:54,750
It's why I think that I rely to a very
heavy extent on the social fabric as

1710
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:56,820
opposed to the government to
create a fake social fabric.

1711
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:59,730
I think the left relies on the government
to create a sense of community.

1712
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,040
I don't feel a sense of
community in government.

1713
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,010
I don't care about the people
in government. I don't think
they care about me. Uh,

1714
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,800
I think that the people who care about
me or in my family and my community,

1715
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,780
I think the broader,
the more broadly we share values,

1716
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,630
the more I care about people
in the broader community. Um,

1717
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:16,110
but there's a sense on the left that the
way that we created social fabric is by

1718
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:17,280
having a very powerful government.

1719
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:21,900
In 2012 was at the DNC when they
flashed on the overhead screen that the

1720
01:21:21,901 --> 01:21:23,250
government is the only thing that we all,

1721
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,610
the only the government is the only thing
we all share. And I thought to myself,

1722
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:30,300
well that's a big budget lash that
on this. Yay. I was like 1984 right.

1723
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:32,190
It was very, it was, it was
really late. I saw it. I was like,

1724
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:34,650
I can't believe that this is a
thing that's up on the screen.

1725
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:36,360
The only thing we all
share really like that's,

1726
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,010
that's where we were all
participating together.

1727
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,250
Cause it seems to me that we all,

1728
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:42,270
we all share in a bunch of different
things and the fewer things we engage in,

1729
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:45,690
the more we're going to need to
rebuild that capacity from outside in.

1730
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:46,560
I don't like outside in.

1731
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,870
So what do we do then about the nationwide
or navy? It's not even nationwide.

1732
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,920
It's worldwide now.

1733
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:54,860
I mean the things that we're after
this last year of being on tour,

1734
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:57,860
the same things that we're talking about
here all the time within an American

1735
01:21:57,861 --> 01:22:02,060
context or happening in virtually
every western society at some level.

1736
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:07,040
So what do we do to rebuild some of those,
those common public spaces?

1737
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:08,780
Like what?
What is it we should be doing?

1738
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:11,330
So I think that the help, so there,
there are a couple things. One,

1739
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:15,350
the government really
needs to stop tearing down
religious institutions because

1740
01:22:15,351 --> 01:22:16,131
historically speaking,

1741
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:20,240
religious institutions have
been the bulwark of of the
social networks that most

1742
01:22:20,241 --> 01:22:23,570
people rely on. And we living in big
cities don't tend to rely on it as much,

1743
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,300
but out in the sticks,
people really rely on this stuff

1744
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:31,030
push for, for my atheist viewers and my
left is shores that may remain or the

1745
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:33,980
progressive's. Can you give them one
more push on why they should fear that?

1746
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,311
Okay.

1747
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:37,910
You shouldn't fear that because so long
as there is not government compulsion

1748
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,250
from religious people in religious
communities towards others,

1749
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:43,160
the fact that people are belonging
to churches is a wonderful thing.

1750
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,230
They're supporting each other.
They're giving charity do each other.

1751
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:47,750
They're there making sure that
you don't have to pay for them.

1752
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:50,540
They're the ones who are making sure
that there is a social fabric people can

1753
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:53,390
rely upon. You want less
opioid overdoses. You want,

1754
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:56,720
you want less people who are
unemployed and unemployable.

1755
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:59,450
You want less people who are following
and falling into deaths of despair.

1756
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,190
They need a social fabric. You're not
creating it and don't pretend y'all are.

1757
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:04,790
You're sitting in the city far away from
these people and when you rip on their

1758
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:07,690
church, when you suggest that their church
is the obstacle, you're taking away.

1759
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,700
The one connection to social
fabric that people have.

1760
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:13,030
Tim Carney has a new book called alienated
America in which he looks at various

1761
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:15,520
communities when he finds is that
it's not even an economic thing.

1762
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:17,590
People on the left and the
right populous are like, well,

1763
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,150
we can fix all this with
the economy economics.

1764
01:23:19,151 --> 01:23:21,670
We just put some tariffs here
but put some subsidies here.

1765
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,820
We grant universal basic income that's
going to fill this gap for these people.

1766
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,490
The question is not lack of benefits,
their unemployment benefits,

1767
01:23:27,491 --> 01:23:28,990
and there's welfare and food stamps.

1768
01:23:28,991 --> 01:23:31,060
There's plenty of benefits
available for a lot of people.

1769
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,021
That's not the question.

1770
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:34,750
The question is where do you find
connection with other human beings?

1771
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,360
And while you can sit in a place where
you feel like you have connection,

1772
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,130
and especially if you're
a college graduate,

1773
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:43,210
who's watching this show in a big city,
you do have an Ersatz social connection.

1774
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,820
I look at different kinds of their senses
and write a different kind of social

1775
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:48,550
connection with people you went to
college with and people you hang out with

1776
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,980
that doesn't exist in huge swaths of
the country and the for the first place

1777
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:56,980
people go to get connection is their
church. When those churches disappear,

1778
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,490
the communities die and then people there
are left without even the motivation

1779
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:04,180
to move. So that's one thing
that then secular. But again,

1780
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:07,530
this is not restricted to religious
people like me in court saying this there.

1781
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,090
Robert Putnam is a secular guy. He
says, you get rid of the church,

1782
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:11,350
you've got a real problem on your hands.

1783
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,230
There are plenty of sociologists who
are looking at the death of churches and

1784
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:16,120
saying,
what's going to fill this gap?

1785
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,890
Well, I see it now. I mean, I don't come
from that default position necessarily,

1786
01:24:19,891 --> 01:24:23,550
but I do see it now. I mean, after
being with Jordan on this, toward the,

1787
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,560
when he would talk about the
importance of the stories, a religion,

1788
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,830
I could see people there.
There's,

1789
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,260
it's not a coincidence that people could
start thinking about these stories,

1790
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:35,280
the messages in these stories.

1791
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:38,880
And then suddenly there were thousands
of people that I was meeting that were,

1792
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:43,200
they stopped doing drugs and they stopped
drinking and right amends with their

1793
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,310
children. Or, I mean, every
day I saw this, right?

1794
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,490
This is it. Right? And this
is, I can't be a coincidence.

1795
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:52,210
And this is the other element of, of that,
that we really need to reinstall Kate.

1796
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,430
And that is that the smart people
don't have all the solutions.

1797
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:57,910
But the one thing that you can do is
solve your own problems. And this is,

1798
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,840
this is a mindset thing.

1799
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:01,480
So notice that everything that I'm saying
has nothing to do with governmental

1800
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:02,440
compulsion.
It's the opposite.

1801
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:05,230
I want the government out of everything
because I don't think the compulsion is

1802
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:06,064
going to fix any of those.

1803
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,320
The the biggest thing that needs to
change is people need to re embrace the

1804
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:13,360
spirit of adventure in their own lives.

1805
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:15,730
And this is something that I really
believe that this is the thing that makes

1806
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:18,640
Jordan most popular, is that this is
what Jordan says, life is a struggle.

1807
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:21,970
Life is chaotic. Life is difficult. Go
and forge forth in spite of those things.

1808
01:25:21,971 --> 01:25:25,090
And this is what makes you a man, right?
This is what makes you, uh, a woman.

1809
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:28,660
This is what makes you a person worthy
of having freedom. I think that's true.

1810
01:25:28,661 --> 01:25:31,570
I think it's fundamentally a religious
message in nature and it's certainly an

1811
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:35,590
inspirational one. And we have a society
where basically said to people, no,

1812
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:37,630
you know what? You've got a
problem. I can solve it for you.

1813
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:39,580
The smart people will solve it for you.
We'll solve it through.

1814
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:42,190
Ubi will solve it through tariffs,
will solve it through,

1815
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,890
through going after China and Mexico.

1816
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:46,780
You never going to have to
leave your hometown. It was,

1817
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:50,410
I had this conversation with
Tucker Carlson and Tucker's
really interesting dude,

1818
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:55,570
and we were talking about specifically
his sort of anti-tech takes. So He's,

1819
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,260
he's very concerned about self driving
trucks, destroying millions of jobs.

1820
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,970
I'm a little bit more sanguine about that.

1821
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:02,290
I don't think it's going
to happen overnight.

1822
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:05,640
I think that you need drivers behind
the wheels. But in any case he was,

1823
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,330
there's one point during the conversation
where Tucker said something to the

1824
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:09,710
effect of,
yeah,

1825
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,560
so you're going to say to a bunch of
people who are living in the town where

1826
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:15,320
their grandparents are buried that
they need to pick up and move.

1827
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,810
And what I'm saying is they should
be able to stay there and have jobs.

1828
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,100
And I said, right, like
this is the, you said you,

1829
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,660
you want them to leave
the town where their,

1830
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:26,840
where their parents are and where their
grandparents died. And I said, right,

1831
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:27,890
or biblically speaking,

1832
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,530
leave the land of your fathers and go to
a land that you know, not right. I mean,

1833
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:33,110
this is the spirit of
the individual forging.

1834
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,730
Fourth is what made the country fantastic.

1835
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,880
One statistic that is just
utterly astonishing is that
in an era where we have

1836
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:44,120
this rising underclass of folks
who have sort of been left behind,

1837
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:48,530
we have less mobility in the United
States than any time in modern American

1838
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:51,940
history. People are leaving home less
often than they didn't. People are saying,

1839
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,690
well, it's because they're
living with their parents. Fine.

1840
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,480
Why aren't they moving where the jobs are?
I mean,

1841
01:26:56,481 --> 01:26:58,970
this was literally what every one
of our parents did, right? I mean,

1842
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:00,020
I don't know where your parents grew up.

1843
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,230
My parents grew up in Chicago and they
moved to Boston and they moved to La,

1844
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:05,090
Brooklyn. Right, exactly.

1845
01:27:05,091 --> 01:27:08,000
Like everyone in California's original
story was that no one was born in

1846
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:10,250
California. Right? Like
very like I was born in La.

1847
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:14,160
I'm one of the only people I knew who
was born in La, right? This is, and that,

1848
01:27:14,161 --> 01:27:15,320
that sort of movement,
this,

1849
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:19,070
this hunger to go out there and adventure
and take control of your own life.

1850
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:23,860
That needs to be reincarnated and
that comes, we have to try it against.

1851
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,060
Did you move him on that at all? Because
I know that I'm on Tucker tonight. Yay.

1852
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:29,620
I went on all the time and I have
these discussions with him and um, uh,

1853
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:30,590
did you move him on that?

1854
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,590
I'm not sure.
I,

1855
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:34,450
I don't really think so. Right. I mean,

1856
01:27:34,451 --> 01:27:35,960
this is the fact that you
don't care about your feelings.

1857
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,970
Think what he's saying there. It does
feel right. Like if your whole family,

1858
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:44,500
if your family lived in a town mining
town for 100 years, it doesn't feel right.

1859
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,750
I mean, this is what I would
say about the baker and the,

1860
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,190
and the gay wedding cake.
It's like,

1861
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:51,040
it doesn't feel right that
you can't get the kid there,

1862
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:55,180
but that doesn't mean that the government
should fix the problem or can fix it.

1863
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,520
Right. And this is, and again,

1864
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:59,320
I think that there's a
mentality shift that's happened.

1865
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,110
I think it's true of immigration too.
I think it has real policy ramifications.

1866
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,990
This idea that you were born in America,
therefore you're owed a bunch of stuff.

1867
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,050
And I just don't think that that's,
frankly,

1868
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,850
I don't think it's a good perspective.

1869
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,190
I think on a religious level
to not a religious perspective,

1870
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,190
and my perspective is that
you're effectively owed
nothing, right? You're old,

1871
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:16,060
you're owed the adventure,

1872
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:18,820
you're owed the freedom to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

1873
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,180
And then the reason you need the social
fabric is to help the people who can't

1874
01:28:22,181 --> 01:28:23,680
do it without the the hand up.

1875
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,910
And it's funny you talk to people who
live in religious communities and because

1876
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:29,050
they've had the social fabric,

1877
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:32,230
they instinctively feel like the
government has filled a lot of the social

1878
01:28:32,231 --> 01:28:33,460
fabric in a lot of big cities.

1879
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:37,150
But you talk to people who live in
religious communities and everyone has a

1880
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:39,320
story that's like this where it's like
there was somebody in the community who's

1881
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,000
struggling.

1882
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,460
So the rabbi got together a bunch of
people and they give them some money and

1883
01:28:42,461 --> 01:28:45,820
like I knew where the money came from
and he went out and he made a plan and he

1884
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:49,510
fixed it. And, and that was
the way that things got fixed.

1885
01:28:49,511 --> 01:28:51,220
Now is that going to fill
every single gap? No.

1886
01:28:51,221 --> 01:28:53,680
I mean you do need local government.
Sometimes to fill these gaps.

1887
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,410
Local is better than national because
you have more sympathy with people who

1888
01:28:56,411 --> 01:29:00,540
live close to you and you see the impact
of the problem where you live. But the,

1889
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,370
the idea you need a social fabric,

1890
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:06,480
it, it's why I don't consider myself
libertarian even though I'm libertarian on

1891
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:07,800
social,
on government policy.

1892
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,970
Because I think the mistake that some
libertarians make is to suggest that

1893
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:16,971
libertarianism applies on a social level
to limited government in and of itself

1894
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:20,150
is enough to keep everything going.
Right. And I don't think that's,

1895
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,001
I don't think that's correct.

1896
01:29:21,001 --> 01:29:24,250
I mean I think that rights and duties
are two sides of the same coin.

1897
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,110
And as Washington suggested that,
you know,

1898
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,490
you need a moral people
to sustain liberty.

1899
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:34,880
So this is a bit of a non sequitur
sort of. Well maybe not. Um,

1900
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,310
so do you think this is why the left is
going so bananas with the Jews at the

1901
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:43,311
moment that there's some connection
there because Jews did get up and when,

1902
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,370
I mean, when you want me to slugging
that conversation, we're talking,

1903
01:29:45,371 --> 01:29:47,610
I was thinking that's the end of
the fiddler on the roof. Right?

1904
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:52,080
They don't want to leave
when a buy to a Lazar Wolf.

1905
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,480
They don't want to leave. I'm going
to Chicago. You're going wherever.

1906
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,170
But it's like we have to go now.
We have to forge something new.

1907
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,420
And Jews have kind of
been doing that forever.

1908
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:04,320
And that is the antithesis of
what the left is offering now.

1909
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,780
So I think there is truth to that and
I don't think it's restricted to Jews.

1910
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:10,380
I think that you've seen
the intersectional hierarchy
changed radically based on

1911
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:12,600
which minority groups are
perceived to be more successful.

1912
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,490
So what you see is the,

1913
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:18,930
is the left suggesting that Asians are
no longer minorities in the United States

1914
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:20,760
can't get into heart rate. You
can't get into Harvard. You're not,

1915
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:22,830
you're not truly on the
intersectional scale because you're,

1916
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,690
and now they're doing it with gay folks.
Right.

1917
01:30:24,691 --> 01:30:27,090
Gave Asians everything when
they came here. Exactly.

1918
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:29,700
The Asians and Indians just get
everything. They were just, you know,

1919
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,020
work in these hard jobs and,

1920
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,340
and wrote a little hot dog stands at
seven 11 it's just because that was,

1921
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,320
you know why not. Exactly. Exactly.

1922
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:40,320
And then you worked hard and you see
this as happening on the fringe left

1923
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:41,610
already with, with gay folks. Right.

1924
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:44,310
So the idea that you saw that article
at slate where they did this with boot

1925
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,420
with Buddha judge,
where they were like,

1926
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:48,870
well it's intersectional enough cause he
grew up white and he grew up privileged

1927
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:52,320
and he went to good schools. But also
he's gay. So he's a little intersection.

1928
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:56,400
He's not like intersectional to suppress
[inaudible] rectus accounts as a gay

1929
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:59,190
guy. Legitimately. Did he come
in as a gay guy? I think was,

1930
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:02,430
that was sort of the headline was like
he's not fully like, I don't understand.

1931
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:07,260
Well he's married to a man. So
last I checked. Yeah. I mean like,

1932
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,690
well first of all, I'm not even
sure what they're going for their,

1933
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:14,340
except for he doesn't rate high enough on
the, in the, uh, oppression scale. Well,

1934
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:16,470
the craziest one of those that I
ever saw was a couple of years ago,

1935
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,480
I think it was,
it was either out magazine or advocate.

1936
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:19,231
I can't remember which one,

1937
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:24,120
when they said that Peter Teal is no
longer gay because his politics don't line

1938
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:28,110
up with gate. So what would really make
you gay? The physical part? No, no,

1939
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:31,890
that doesn't fact. It doesn't
matter. What matters is how we feel.

1940
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,001
And you're going to have,
by the way,

1941
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,050
they'll come after Camilla
Harris on the same grounds. Her,

1942
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,320
her born parents is Jamaican. One
parent is Indian. I mean, that's,

1943
01:31:37,321 --> 01:31:41,400
that's not traditional. Grew up in
the inner city. I mean, her, her dad,

1944
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:44,020
I think it was a professor at
Stanford or something like they'll,

1945
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,970
they'll come for, for anybody
who doesn't like, we'll,

1946
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,770
we'll pretend intersectionality
applies until it no longer apply.

1947
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,120
Does that make you very hopeful then?

1948
01:31:51,121 --> 01:31:54,420
Because I think we're seeing
minority groups crack.

1949
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,390
We're seeing Asians go, whoa, whoa, Whoa,

1950
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,220
we don't want to be on the
reverse side of Jews are finally

1951
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,400
going, wait, we don't have to vote
80% democrat black people. I mean,

1952
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:07,000
just the fact that now
reparations is becoming, uh,

1953
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:11,200
virtually every Democratic candidates
are talking about reparations to me,

1954
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:11,861
regardless.

1955
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,380
I know you have a little bit of a
love hate thing with Canada's Owens,

1956
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:18,260
but it's like she did. And
just like Hannah said, no,
no, no, no. I don't need this.

1957
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:21,730
Like, but I mean, you guys,
you guys go at it and that,
that's fine. Uh, I think more,

1958
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:25,950
it's like, I just sit here and sometimes
she doesn't baby. I was with them.

1959
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:28,540
They were a couple of days ago. She
likes you. I meant more that you don't,

1960
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:31,000
you just don't agree on everything.
That's correct. Yeah. Point being,

1961
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:33,760
when I see all these
Democrats suddenly going, oh,

1962
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:37,570
we should have a commission to figure
out reparations. It's like, Whoa, they,

1963
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:41,290
Candice really must've done something
here within the black community because

1964
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,870
now all they're going is
all we got left is cash.

1965
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:47,580
Well, I think that they're, you know,
I, I hope that that's true. You know, I,

1966
01:32:47,581 --> 01:32:49,150
I don't know the data bear it out,

1967
01:32:49,151 --> 01:32:52,870
but I certainly hope that there is that
cracking that that is taking place.

1968
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:57,250
But the left has a couple of very
powerful forces in one of them is as we

1969
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:01,570
discussed,
the attempt to make it uncomfortable,

1970
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:04,780
to have different thoughts or to engage
with people who have different thoughts

1971
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:08,770
that you are no longer welcome in
the circle of the, of the woke.

1972
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:11,320
If you have a conversation
with somebody on theirs,

1973
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:14,530
I mean legitimately have a
conversation or watch a video.

1974
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,280
I mean there was a story that was out
of anything was Michigan state two weeks

1975
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:20,500
ago where a student at Michigan
State College fix reported.

1976
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:25,501
This was watching one of my videos on
youtube and the roommate made and it made

1977
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:30,820
a rights violation complaint to the
administration at Michigan State for the

1978
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:34,420
student watching my video.
And the administration was
like, fine, we'll move you.

1979
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:35,290
I mean like,
yeah,

1980
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:38,650
like W it's come to the point where
if you mentioned names like people who

1981
01:33:38,651 --> 01:33:40,750
legitimately don't know anything about
you don't know anything about cannabis,

1982
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:42,130
don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything about Jordan.

1983
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,970
They'll make claims about people they
legitimately cannot back up cause they

1984
01:33:44,971 --> 01:33:46,090
never engaged with their content.

1985
01:33:46,091 --> 01:33:48,280
But the very fact that they
haven't engaged with the content,

1986
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:50,200
is there a credibility on
speaking on the content?

1987
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,940
Because if they ever
engaged on the content,

1988
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:55,900
then they wouldn't believe all these
things but they don't engage and therefore

1989
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:59,940
they are good. Lack of engagement is
good. Right? It's not that you engaged in,

1990
01:33:59,941 --> 01:34:02,840
now you're better because you've had a
better conversation if you didn't engage

1991
01:34:02,841 --> 01:34:04,640
or better. So those are the, the in,

1992
01:34:04,641 --> 01:34:07,210
that's the countervailing
intimidation factor that's,

1993
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:10,180
that's taking place in that I
think is still quite powerful.

1994
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,340
It's why every single
democratic hands in it.

1995
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,020
I mean it really is incredibly powerful.

1996
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:17,870
Every single democratic candidate
effectively skipped Apac this year. Yeah.

1997
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,760
Because Ilhan Omar has impact
and because folks on the end,

1998
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:23,790
because folks on the hard
left hate Israel and,

1999
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,130
and that has impact and then they
all showed up for Al Sharpton who's

2000
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:29,950
legitimately one of the worst
people in modern American politics,

2001
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:32,570
like in modern American
history speed or he,

2002
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:36,850
he ran a Jessie Smollett a
hoax and accused and actual
human being of committing

2003
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:39,370
a rape against a black
girl who was not raped.

2004
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:44,490
He accused even Ponas of raping a black
girl and then scrawling racial slurs on

2005
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:49,330
her body in shit. And he is, it
was not, it was all false. Yeah.

2006
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,160
And he, he was, he called
Jews, diamond merchants. He,

2007
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:56,920
he suggested white interloper is we're
taking over Freddy's fashion Martin there

2008
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,250
and then somebody wouldn't burn

2009
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,740
down the place.
Like he's the worst guy I'll sharpen.

2010
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:04,130
And every Democrat showed up at the
national action network because to be

2011
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,110
welcome means to be in
the club like we don't,

2012
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,110
here's the thing about those of us in the
Idw, people think that we have a club.

2013
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,910
It's not a club,

2014
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:14,570
it's just people who like to talk about
things and anybody is welcome to the

2015
01:35:14,571 --> 01:35:14,820
club,

2016
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:18,020
which is why you see like these weird
videos where people who we've never talked

2017
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:21,110
to her had conversations with our
suddenly quote unquote members of the IDW.

2018
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,630
Like we talk with each other
and there's like a core group.

2019
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:26,750
I think of us who every so often like
really every so often go out and get

2020
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:28,880
drinks or have dinner. But
that's like, that's not a,

2021
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:32,540
that's not the same thing as this.
You're unwelcome in the club if you don't,

2022
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,200
if you don't do acts, like that's,
that's not a weird thing that if the,

2023
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:38,450
if this way, if the Idw,
let's say whatever it is at
the moment, you're right.

2024
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:41,230
It's not a co, we're not walking around
with a card. We don't have a clubhouse.

2025
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,740
But like if this collection, and then
of course it's way wider than just us,

2026
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:48,980
but if this middle collection,
which seemingly,

2027
01:35:48,981 --> 01:35:51,470
it's pretty small and it's kind
of getting smaller because it's,

2028
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,510
it's just getting tougher to
have centrist opinions. Right.

2029
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,830
And also this thing doesn't hold.
Yeah.

2030
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:00,710
I mean that's right after and when you
can see and you can see out viciously

2031
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,120
left is trying to carve it apart by,

2032
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:05,540
what they'll do is they'll come after me
and then they'll ask you for comment or

2033
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:07,940
they'll come after Sam and then they'll
ask me for comment or they'll come after

2034
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:10,700
Jordan and they'll go after it. But
that's why I think it's important. I know,

2035
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:13,160
you know, people attack me. Oh he's
always, he's always shitting on the left.

2036
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:16,850
But it's like this is the perfect example
of what's going on here on the right.

2037
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,770
Does anyone on the right relentlessly,

2038
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:22,910
viciously and dishonestly attack
the Weinstein brothers or, or, or,

2039
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,820
or Sam even or anyone that's on the left.
They don't,

2040
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:28,590
I mean they agree to disagree. If you
read that really is as simple as that.

2041
01:36:28,591 --> 01:36:30,650
I mean it's amazing.
If you read the comments on the,

2042
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,450
I take Yang as an example
cause it just happened.

2043
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:34,660
But if you read the comments on the
Sunday special that I did with Yang,

2044
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,180
there is nothing like,
legitimately, I never read the
comments, but I was curious.

2045
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,080
There is nothing but appreciation
that Yang would even come on the show.

2046
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:43,970
That's the entire thing.
It's like, oh look,

2047
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:46,670
a cordial conversation between
people who disagree. That's so nice.

2048
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:50,450
Like how pathetic is it that
that is considered like the
big win here? There was,

2049
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,680
there wasn't a single comment about like,

2050
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,720
Oh Shapiro destroyed gang there
cause that wasn't the purpose of it.

2051
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,690
Everybody got what it was supposed to be.
It's a conversation and that's great.

2052
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,940
Did he move you on anything like a UBI
situation? Let me, I'd read this book.

2053
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:02,570
I had read his book and I,

2054
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,630
and I didn't find it
utterly convincing on a ubi.

2055
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,240
I think that as I've said before,
when it comes to ubi,

2056
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,500
if we reached the point of absolute
crisis where nothing else like it,

2057
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,180
let's put it this way,

2058
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:18,230
ubi as a negative income tax in lieu of
all of the welfare systems we currently

2059
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:21,470
have, I would sign onto it in a heartbeat,
right? The idea of we get rid of,

2060
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,190
we get rid of real repeal and
replace, right? If your appeal,

2061
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:27,050
all the welfare programs and you replace
it with a single check that is signed

2062
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:31,040
then, but I think the promises of Upr
a little bit too big for his Britches.

2063
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,900
So people are saying, well it'll solve
the opioid epidemic or it'll solve the,

2064
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:36,620
as I say in the book, I think it's a
crisis of meaning not a crisis of money.

2065
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,630
And so I don't think that's
going to solve it. Uh,

2066
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,790
if the idea is that people
are going to be liberated,

2067
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:44,870
as Andrew says in his book to go and
do art and volunteering and charity,

2068
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,680
I don't see any evidence of that.
The part, I don't write that,

2069
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,460
that's the part where I was like, um, no,

2070
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,390
even even if you could get me on the
robots are replacing all our regular job.

2071
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,850
So let's say you could get me on that.

2072
01:37:54,851 --> 01:37:59,851
And the other part is just that it takes
away something about fundamental human

2073
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,760
nature about what you're talking about
before about the individual going out

2074
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:04,330
there and getting theirs.
Right.

2075
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,890
You would just end up having this class
of people that would be given just

2076
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:11,660
enough. I mean I have a
new welfare. Right, right,
exactly. And when he said was,

2077
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,080
well,
it's not enough to actually live on,

2078
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,440
it's just enough to actually
supplement and what I said,

2079
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:16,590
so what's the limiting principle?

2080
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:19,770
Like is it just the 1000
or is it politician going
gonna come around next week

2081
01:38:19,771 --> 01:38:22,340
and say it to be 3000 and then you hit,
what did he say that, cause I haven't,

2082
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:23,370
he didn't,
he didn't really,

2083
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:26,520
I don't even really firmly addressed it
because that's the key question, right?

2084
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:29,270
It's like, well, okay, we can also
in bucks and we're good at, correct.

2085
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:34,310
Literally the next week there will be
somebody who says 1,001 bucks [inaudible]

2086
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:38,040
gonna say about the lefties who won a
thousand, they'll call them racist or,

2087
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,970
that's exactly right. No, I mean there
are some problems and implementation of,

2088
01:38:41,971 --> 01:38:43,980
of Ubi that exists with the welfare state.
Also,

2089
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:47,370
a lot of the studies that suggest that
there's the same level of employment,

2090
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:51,210
those are temporary ubi attempts.
Right.

2091
01:38:51,211 --> 01:38:53,240
If they were a permanent ubi,
uh,

2092
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:57,720
I think that you would see a decline in
employment. But also, as I said to him,

2093
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:01,470
there's a conflict between what ubi says
it's trying to do and what it actually

2094
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:03,420
would do. So I think it would do
the same thing as the welfare state.

2095
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:05,460
And that's why I say like as a
replacement for the welfare state,

2096
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,130
I'm kind of warm to it, but
it's like, let's give it a shot.

2097
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:10,860
Basically saying that's
failing, let's, right.

2098
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:14,850
And also because I'd rather have the
government sign and understandable check

2099
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,110
rather than you have to go through it.

2100
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:20,490
You have to de de incentivize
work or deincentivize fatherhood,

2101
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:22,560
or do you know all of these
incentive based structures?

2102
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:26,280
I'm not a fan and they've been
rather ineffective, but it,

2103
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:29,790
but as a general principle, the idea that
it's going to solve the work of crisis,

2104
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,090
what he talks about in his book is the
crisis of people who don't have jobs and

2105
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:36,360
that crisis is the not having of the job,
not merely the not having of the money,

2106
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:39,330
signing people up, check in lieu
of a job. It doesn't actually,

2107
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,830
like he points out in the book,

2108
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:43,680
number of people on disabilities
been rising dramatically. Right?

2109
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,330
They're all getting a
check and are they happy?

2110
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:46,680
Are they spending their time volunteering?

2111
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:50,220
Are they spending their time down at the
local waystation helping people or are

2112
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:54,810
they, you know, will taken
drugs. It all sounds good.

2113
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,940
Medicare for all it sounds good.

2114
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:59,940
We will have the same thing that we know
that that's not going to be the case

2115
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:00,630
because of course,

2116
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:03,420
well now they're talking about getting
rid of private insurance, which is insane.

2117
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:06,480
I mean that's fully what they have to do
it because otherwise doctors just will

2118
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:09,900
not accept Medicare reimbursement rights.
I mean, that's the reality. Again,

2119
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,260
you know,

2120
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,350
as somebody who works closely with people
in the medical industry and in fact

2121
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:16,650
sleeps with a person in the medical
industry, you know that, you know, the,

2122
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:21,270
the idea that doctors are going to just
accept 60% on the dollar of what they're

2123
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:22,980
making right now is
absolute sheer nonsense.

2124
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:27,060
But also it's such a disconnect of
what, of what I think they view. I mean,

2125
01:40:27,061 --> 01:40:29,730
I get it that they think government is
something that I don't think it should be,

2126
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,530
but it's like,
what right.

2127
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:35,670
Would the government have to tell a
doctor he can't be in the private business

2128
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:38,820
that he wants to be in. Right. And
they actually think that's okay.

2129
01:40:38,821 --> 01:40:41,370
I mean quite literally
Tamala and I think uh,

2130
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:44,280
Cory booker and nothing and said they
think it's good private insurance.

2131
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:45,001
I mean this is another,

2132
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:47,160
this is another thing that I asked Yang
about cause he said he was from Medicare

2133
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:48,630
for all and there's a section
in his book where he says,

2134
01:40:48,631 --> 01:40:51,270
so how are we going to deal with the
fact that doctors are going to just stop

2135
01:40:51,271 --> 01:40:53,500
going to medical school? Cause
that's a real thing that will happen.

2136
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:54,523
I mean already

2137
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:57,430
if you want to see how perverse
incentives work in the medical industry,

2138
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:59,920
look how many people come out of medical
school and going into what are called

2139
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:03,250
the road. And the the, the road
fields is radiology, ophthalmology,

2140
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:06,610
anesthesiology and dermatology. Why?
Those are the least regulated fields.

2141
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:08,950
There's the least Medicare there.
Nobody's taking reimbursement rates.

2142
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:12,040
Those are all areas where people basically
show up with an insurance company or

2143
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:14,770
cash in hand. Yup. That's
where everybody's going.
It's where all the money is.

2144
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:18,490
So that's how per first incentives work.
He says in the book,

2145
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:22,330
what we're going to have
to convince doctors that
basically they need to rethink

2146
01:41:22,331 --> 01:41:24,610
about what the lifestyle
of a doctor is going to be.

2147
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:27,430
That they're not going to live high on
the hog anymore, that they're going to,

2148
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:30,420
you know, be putting out more for
the public service. And I've had,

2149
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:32,740
well you can do that,
but it's not gonna be the same people.

2150
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:37,510
Do you think they how to do that? No, I
mean he, he sort of says that we should,

2151
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:39,310
that we should just,
people will,

2152
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:41,470
will have to be informed that the
incentive structure is different.

2153
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,200
And here's the thing, if you have
a different incentive structure,

2154
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:45,460
you are going to get a different thing.

2155
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,240
My wife would not have gone to medical
school if you were assured of comp for 11

2156
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:49,870
years,

2157
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:54,790
if you were assured of coming out
making $65,000 or $100,000, right?

2158
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:56,980
The, the reality is that you
wanted a certain lifestyle.

2159
01:41:56,981 --> 01:42:00,190
It's why she went to medical school.
You change those incentives.

2160
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:01,390
You think all these guys were going into,

2161
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,200
the surgeons are going to spend years
on end doing this so that they can then

2162
01:42:05,201 --> 01:42:07,000
work for years on end
working for Medicare.

2163
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:10,840
Does that sound the awesome to anyone
like this is the reason that smart people

2164
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:13,330
become doctors is because smart people
would like to make money and be paid for

2165
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:15,190
their work. This is why
smart we'd like, yes,

2166
01:42:15,191 --> 01:42:17,680
there is a self sacrificial
component to all of this.

2167
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:19,750
It's there easier ways to make
money than being a doctor.

2168
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,770
But to eliminate the money factor is to
eliminate half the reason that people

2169
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:24,820
become doctors in the first place.

2170
01:42:24,821 --> 01:42:27,280
You want a lot more people called
a lawyers in Mckinsey associates.

2171
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:27,960
This is the way to do it.

2172
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,890
I have a good friend.

2173
01:42:28,891 --> 01:42:33,360
What pro two or three best friends from
childhood since second grade who was

2174
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:37,800
like my chief sparring political
partner, our our whole lives. Uh,

2175
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:40,770
and he's now become a huge
Trump supporter. And why?

2176
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,150
Because he was a doctor, went to
medical school, raised all the debt,

2177
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,790
realize he could never live
in New York where he grew up.

2178
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:52,230
He's now in Texas and he's often doing
things that have not to make money now

2179
01:42:52,231 --> 01:42:55,350
because it's so hard. And then he became
a Trump supporter because of Obamacare,

2180
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,770
because he was crushed with paperwork
and bureaucracy and nonsense and now to

2181
01:42:58,771 --> 01:43:02,190
make money because it's so much
harder than just doing the procedures.

2182
01:43:02,191 --> 01:43:05,030
He's basically doing like, like
medical real estate things. Yeah,

2183
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:07,770
and it just shows you how the whole
system I, but that's just one guy,

2184
01:43:07,771 --> 01:43:09,750
but it's like, yeah, the
whole system is out of

2185
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,420
factors are going into concierge care
specifically because of this. Yeah,

2186
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:15,190
I mean they're very full apps that exist
where you're paying like 99 bucks a

2187
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:17,530
month and then a doctor
will show up at your door.

2188
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:22,030
Like there's so many ways that we could
make medical care so many online should

2189
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:25,120
be such an asset for medical care.
Right? We should, there's so many weeds.

2190
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:28,570
Getting rid of licensing requirements,
as I suggested it would be a great thing.

2191
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,011
Like there,

2192
01:43:29,011 --> 01:43:32,350
there are things that we can actively do
to do this and the truth is for healthy

2193
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:35,140
people and for people who have
private healthcare insurance.

2194
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:39,400
There really isn't a problem. Like we
like to talk about how it's too expensive.

2195
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,850
Why do you think we have millions and
millions of jobs in the healthcare

2196
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:43,960
industry? Like what do they think happens
when they nationalized this thing?

2197
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:47,170
All those jobs just transfer over to
government or are a lot of those jobs lost

2198
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:50,220
because those people don't
work for anybody anymore?

2199
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:53,900
Why is it that the people ignore
the upsides of Robo? Do they think?

2200
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:55,040
Does anyone answer that question?

2201
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:57,330
What are you going to do with all
those people and not the private? No,

2202
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,500
they can all be hired by the government
to do nothing. Right? And then do they,

2203
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:03,430
and nobody seems to understand that the,

2204
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:06,530
the reason that the majority of new drugs
and procedures are discovered in the

2205
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:08,720
United States is because we are
paying those outsides prices.

2206
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,300
So when Trump says that we are paying
for everybody else, that is true,

2207
01:44:11,301 --> 01:44:14,780
we are paying for everybody else. But
if we stopped paying for everybody else,

2208
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,360
they just will stop producing those
drugs here because why else would they

2209
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:21,500
produce the drugs here? Like
this is, our system is not good.

2210
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:25,820
But to pretend that our system is like
the worst system on planet earth or the

2211
01:44:25,821 --> 01:44:29,090
people are dying. I mean quick
statistic then nobody likes to site.

2212
01:44:29,091 --> 01:44:31,040
But it's true if you get rid of,

2213
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:35,840
of shooting of homicides and car
accident death where people die.

2214
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:37,970
Like at the scene from
the American death rates,

2215
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:40,820
America is the number one life
expectancy in the industrialized world.

2216
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:42,290
Those are not medical issues.

2217
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,630
Those are issues of people shooting each
other and people get in car wrecks a

2218
01:44:44,631 --> 01:44:47,270
lot here in the United States.
So you know,

2219
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:51,200
that's as far as I spending per capita,
like insane amounts of money.

2220
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:53,000
Can we spend more than other countries?

2221
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:56,640
It is relatively in line
with the OACD income. So for,

2222
01:44:56,641 --> 01:44:59,210
for on a per capita income basis,
we spend a lot of money.

2223
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:01,700
We also make a lot of money here in the
United States and the medical industry

2224
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:04,040
here is a huge part of
the American economy.

2225
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:06,980
All of Pittsburgh is basically the medical
industry now as opposed to the steel

2226
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:09,110
industry. And that is a very
good thing for Pittsburgh.

2227
01:45:09,111 --> 01:45:13,730
So the answer to a lot of this is
deregulation. Not reregulation, but again,

2228
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:15,380
those are conversations
I think that can be had,

2229
01:45:15,381 --> 01:45:19,640
but I think that people are not being
realistic about what they expect from the

2230
01:45:19,641 --> 01:45:24,230
system. And they're not realistic about
the downsides of, of systems that are,

2231
01:45:24,231 --> 01:45:26,600
that are completely nationalized.
I mean, in my opinion,

2232
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:27,980
if you're actually gonna get the
government's equally involved,

2233
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:30,410
we've got to have a Swiss system where
basically people are paying a percentage

2234
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:33,620
of their salary into private
insurance and then they are,

2235
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:36,410
and then they are expected to do that,
right? Like the individual mandate,

2236
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,960
if you're gonna get the government
involved is not the world's worst idea.

2237
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,200
It's just that it's now stacked with
enormous amounts of regulation, uh,

2238
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:47,750
and inefficiency and bureaucratic and
efficiency and that. But I think again,

2239
01:45:47,751 --> 01:45:50,000
that a free market is better
than any of that stuff.

2240
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,380
But I also think that you ought to
take responsibility if you are on it.

2241
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:55,010
If you don't buy insurance
and then you get hit by a car,

2242
01:45:55,011 --> 01:45:56,780
I'm sorry that that
would be a you problem.

2243
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,810
Like th th th that's why we need a
social fabric where I care about you.

2244
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,280
But on a governmental level,

2245
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:05,810
this idea that you're not going to
increase the rates of use with government

2246
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,190
care is just a lie. People are going
to pay for those people no matter what,

2247
01:46:10,191 --> 01:46:14,090
right? I mean, right. It's against
the turn them around, right? It's,

2248
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:16,070
you are going to pay for
it. Right. But it getting,

2249
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:18,020
getting hit by the car is
usually not the real issue.

2250
01:46:18,021 --> 01:46:22,070
Usually the real issue is how do you
pay for the person who didn't buy health

2251
01:46:22,071 --> 01:46:25,520
insurance for years and then gets, uh,
it gets hard condition that requires,

2252
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,200
you know,
here's lawn care.

2253
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,300
Like the person who was in the
yard is going to get paid for that.

2254
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:32,240
We all end up paying for it
with an elevated insurance
rates and all the rest of

2255
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:37,220
it. But um, yeah, the, the problem
of the chronically unhealthy,

2256
01:46:37,221 --> 01:46:39,830
which is a very small
percentage of the population,

2257
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,570
but the most expensive percentage,

2258
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:47,210
that is not really a rationale for
overturning healthcare that 90% of people

2259
01:46:47,211 --> 01:46:50,040
seem to enjoy. Like it also is
gonna make you hate people for

2260
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,551
no reason.

2261
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:54,480
You're going to go to in and out or
Mcdonald's and see a table of four obese

2262
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:56,280
people stuffing their faces,

2263
01:46:56,281 --> 01:47:00,030
drinking hi from social and Syrup and
everything else, and you're going to go,

2264
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:04,460
wait a minute. These people are all,
they're living [inaudible] there.

2265
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:06,820
This is horrible. I mean,
this goes to the community.

2266
01:47:06,821 --> 01:47:08,770
It's no one wants to look
at that and think, yeah,

2267
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:12,570
well this is, this is, this is why, you
know, I've said people who try to compare,

2268
01:47:12,571 --> 01:47:14,580
for example, the Nordics,
the Nordic health care model,

2269
01:47:14,581 --> 01:47:17,490
to the US health care model. You're
not comparing equivalent populations.

2270
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:19,170
People eat healthy things in Norway.

2271
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:21,960
People in the United States eating
nothing but crap all the time.

2272
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:25,410
I was just in Norway, Sweden, Finland,
Denmark. These people look good. Yeah,

2273
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:28,640
right. I mean, this is, it's a, it's a
much healthier population and this is why,

2274
01:47:28,641 --> 01:47:31,040
if you actually want to compare
the efficacy of healthcare systems,

2275
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,920
you don't look at the generalized
population of the United States and the

2276
01:47:33,921 --> 01:47:38,690
generalized population
of Norway, certainly tiny
country with 5 million people.

2277
01:47:38,691 --> 01:47:41,300
I mean the La County is 11 million
people or something. Right? Well,

2278
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:45,740
what you do is you compare people who are
Norwegian in America to people who are

2279
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:46,880
Norwegian in Norway,

2280
01:47:46,881 --> 01:47:50,150
and what you find is that people in who
are Norwegian and America outperform on

2281
01:47:50,151 --> 01:47:52,760
nearly every aspect.
People who are Norwegian in Norway,

2282
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:54,350
then you're comparing apples to apples.

2283
01:47:54,351 --> 01:47:56,690
Like we compare apples to oranges
and then we're like, well,

2284
01:47:56,691 --> 01:47:58,760
why doesn't this work over here?
Because they're not the same thing.

2285
01:47:58,761 --> 01:47:59,960
That's why it doesn't work over here.

2286
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:02,550
All right, Shapiro, let's go
dystopian. You're ready? Okay.

2287
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,700
Let's say everything that
you've written about here,

2288
01:48:05,701 --> 01:48:07,910
everything that we're trying to do,
all these conversations,

2289
01:48:07,911 --> 01:48:12,030
we will having it all, it all just
explodes. It does not work. We,

2290
01:48:12,031 --> 01:48:16,620
the ideas that we're fighting for fail
in the face of postmodernism of what's

2291
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:20,520
being taught at this college is of what
the media is throwing at everybody and

2292
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:23,430
we get more and more of these people
in government and all of these things.

2293
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,020
I think about this sometimes that what
will happen to the outlier people like us

2294
01:48:28,021 --> 01:48:29,700
in the future. Do you ever,
do you ever think about that?

2295
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:31,380
But I think that right now,
for example,

2296
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:34,050
for all these people that think
Trump is Hitler and all this stuff,

2297
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:37,020
Trump tweets anything and then a hundred
blue check journalists talent to go

2298
01:48:37,021 --> 01:48:40,890
fuck himself and you're going to be in
jail and a zillion things and Trump does

2299
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:44,670
nothing. That's not even a defensive
anything. Trump says that's just reality,

2300
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:46,230
but now let's do it the other way.

2301
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:50,530
Imagine now we've got one
of these far lefties. Yeah.

2302
01:48:50,531 --> 01:48:54,810
Bernie's Bernie friends who believe
that government is the end all be all to

2303
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:59,190
everything and now the outliers who
have all been called Nazis. All right.

2304
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:02,390
The Ben Shapiro's and everybody else that
had been called the worst things that,

2305
01:49:02,391 --> 01:49:02,880
well now,

2306
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:07,880
now government and tech is against us
and now we're doing the same exact things

2307
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:11,510
that the left these up today are doing.
Yeah. How do you think that's going to go?

2308
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:14,080
Well,
I mean this is why at daily wire,

2309
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:17,110
and I know you've been looking into this
to alternative means of distribution or

2310
01:49:17,111 --> 01:49:18,790
the entire ballgame.
I mean that,

2311
01:49:18,791 --> 01:49:21,730
that we understand that
when it comes to the left,

2312
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:26,760
you cannot live on their large ass and
like forgot taking the beginning of the

2313
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:26,921
year.

2314
01:49:26,921 --> 01:49:29,800
They came after me and tried to boycott
me over making most anidine point on

2315
01:49:29,801 --> 01:49:32,740
abortion I think I've ever made in my
life. Right. They, they, they tried to,

2316
01:49:32,741 --> 01:49:35,040
they legitimately tried to knock
my sponsor's off my show. Yeah.

2317
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:38,080
For suggesting that pro lifers don't
want to kill any baby no matter what that

2318
01:49:38,081 --> 01:49:40,900
baby would turn on to be because we don't
believe that you can kill babies for

2319
01:49:40,901 --> 01:49:43,750
any rationale based on a
minority report reasoning,

2320
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:46,210
and I mentioned baby Hitler in this
context because they'd been a thought

2321
01:49:46,211 --> 01:49:48,160
experiment that was by
people up to an including

2322
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,790
Tom Hanks or legitimately years and they
tried to boycott my show based on that.

2323
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:53,110
I mean it was insane the,

2324
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:57,490
so we're not focusing on living on large
ass of the left when it comes to this

2325
01:49:57,491 --> 01:50:00,100
sort of stuff. We're building a
subscription system at daily wire.

2326
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,260
This is why we encourage people to
subscribe because then you can get our

2327
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:05,620
content no matter what you do. Cause
we, it's all vertically integrated.

2328
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:09,080
I know that you're looking at stuff
like that as well. Um, you know, on,

2329
01:50:09,081 --> 01:50:11,980
on a tech level we're building
alternatives and that's
what we ought to be doing.

2330
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:16,540
A, on a generalized level, I think what
we're watching and it's really pretty sad,

2331
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:20,800
is that people like us are going to end
up in places with people who agree with

2332
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:21,634
people like us.

2333
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:24,910
Meaning that I live in a Jewish community
where I'm pretty popular because it's

2334
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:25,950
an orthodox community.
I'm more,

2335
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:29,390
I went to lunch with you at a kosher place
and if I had to take one more picture

2336
01:50:29,391 --> 01:50:30,040
of you,
I was gonna.

2337
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,840
Yeah, exactly. I mean that's,
that's the, those are my folks,

2338
01:50:32,841 --> 01:50:35,870
but I've spent my entire
life living in Los Angeles,

2339
01:50:35,871 --> 01:50:38,540
a place where the vast majority people
disagree with me or in Cambridge where

2340
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:41,900
everyone disagrees with me. And that's,
and I like that. I think it's nice.

2341
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:45,470
I think like I think it's good that there
are conversations happening across the

2342
01:50:45,471 --> 01:50:50,471
aisle as the left seeks to basically
censor or destroy anyone who even engages

2343
01:50:50,661 --> 01:50:53,450
in those conversations where
Joe Rogan becomes an outright,

2344
01:50:53,451 --> 01:50:57,170
cause he has a conversation with me
because I once had a conversation with you

2345
01:50:57,171 --> 01:50:59,600
and you once had a conversation
with Alex Jones, right?

2346
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:00,440
Like this is the way that it works.

2347
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:04,180
Clearly we've all pushed
people to the next,

2348
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:07,030
right? I mean, but the, the, and
this is, and so once that happens,

2349
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:10,420
all it's going to happen is it's going
to make places like this on livable for

2350
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:11,440
people like us.

2351
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:14,080
And I mean even people who just want to
have conversations and then you do end

2352
01:51:14,081 --> 01:51:16,840
up with a real gap in the country that
is almost unbridgeable where it's like

2353
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:19,750
everyone agrees in one place and
nobody agrees in another place.

2354
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:22,840
And that's where the, if
the, that's why honestly,

2355
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:24,430
the checks and balances
system is so vital.

2356
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:27,460
We mentioned before because of people
in Texas feel like they're running being

2357
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:30,940
run roughshod over by people in California
and the national government or the

2358
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:34,690
other way around. That's not going to
last. That's not, that's not sustainable.

2359
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,740
Right?
So that's why it's like I don't really,

2360
01:51:36,741 --> 01:51:39,920
I like doing this as a thought experiment
more than like what could potentially

2361
01:51:39,921 --> 01:51:40,251
happen.

2362
01:51:40,251 --> 01:51:44,300
But it seems to me that if we have been
no code spaces that we were talking

2363
01:51:44,301 --> 01:51:49,100
about before and we all do have to get
siphoned off into our own thing just

2364
01:51:49,101 --> 01:51:52,580
because that's the way the tech landscape
is going to work. That it's like, yeah,

2365
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:56,030
we got the checks and balances in
our system is, is pretty damn good.

2366
01:51:56,031 --> 01:51:57,040
I would say probably,

2367
01:51:57,110 --> 01:52:01,550
I would say it's the best man made thing
set of ideas probably in the history of,

2368
01:52:01,551 --> 01:52:03,220
of all time.
Um,

2369
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:07,580
but how can it survive in an
information war? You know what I mean?

2370
01:52:07,581 --> 01:52:11,090
How can it survive in a
time when for all we know,

2371
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:14,600
the next w whoever runs for president
isn't going to accept the results of the

2372
01:52:14,601 --> 01:52:17,480
election. Stacey Abrams still not
accepting the results. Like they're,

2373
01:52:17,481 --> 01:52:18,320
they're underminded,

2374
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,290
they claim Trump wasn't going to accept
the results of the election and now it's

2375
01:52:21,291 --> 01:52:23,540
like that's what they're doing.
They're trying to undermine everything.

2376
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:28,030
And if we don't have enough coast
spaces to work it out, this is is why

2377
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:32,360
we have a very short window right now
to pour resources into grabbing as many

2378
01:52:32,361 --> 01:52:35,420
eyeballs as possible and ensuring
that as many people see countervailing

2379
01:52:35,421 --> 01:52:37,780
material as possible because you just
don't know when that window is going to

2380
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:39,710
slam shot. Yeah. I mean that really was,

2381
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,980
you have to grab as many people as
possible and let them know that there are

2382
01:52:42,981 --> 01:52:46,490
alternative places where they can
get your stuff. Because you know,

2383
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:49,370
here's what I'm concerned about mostly
when I'm concerned about is that you're

2384
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:53,420
going to see a move by Democrats in
Congress and from the presidency to do

2385
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:55,550
exactly what Mark Zuckerberg wants.
Right.

2386
01:52:55,551 --> 01:53:00,110
Where are the FCC is suddenly regulating
speech on Facebook and to relieve the

2387
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:05,090
obligations of Facebook
to do it themselves and
suddenly if you are labeled,

2388
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:07,970
not outright, but outright adjacent. Yeah.

2389
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:11,030
Based on the fact that you want
to interview the person who wants,

2390
01:53:11,031 --> 01:53:14,600
interviewed a person who wants stood
next to a person who was once wearing a

2391
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:19,290
shirt, then you know, then you're
screwed. So that, that, that's where I,

2392
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:21,970
I don't think that the,
the, this is why, you know,

2393
01:53:21,971 --> 01:53:22,940
you and I make the same distinction.

2394
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:25,790
I've made a distinction for years and
years between the Liberals and the left.

2395
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,760
If the left continues
to conquer the liberals,

2396
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,880
I think that it's gonna be a rough
time ahead and we better have these

2397
01:53:31,881 --> 01:53:34,910
alternative methods of distribution
are we're screwed at that point.

2398
01:53:35,230 --> 01:53:37,960
All right, so let's
finish with this then. Um,

2399
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:42,270
when I was on canvas and show a week
or two ago, I said to her, you know,

2400
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:46,080
I see something, it's so obvious
to me that if you care about ideas,

2401
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,470
if you want to live in a tolerant,
pluralistic society, all of those things,

2402
01:53:49,471 --> 01:53:53,370
it's very obvious. The center, right
basically is where is where that's at. It,

2403
01:53:53,371 --> 01:53:54,204
it just is.

2404
01:53:55,140 --> 01:54:00,140
Do you think there is room for Pete for
the center writes a conservatives tab a

2405
01:54:00,301 --> 01:54:02,520
little more openness when
it comes to like, you know,

2406
01:54:02,521 --> 01:54:04,860
we've had the abortion
discussion tied to I'm,

2407
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:08,310
I mean I'm really struggling with it
and the further that the left goes on,

2408
01:54:08,311 --> 01:54:12,980
eight month abortions and and all of that
and post life abortions and cool post

2409
01:54:12,981 --> 01:54:14,760
life abortion,
then this crazy stuff.

2410
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:18,690
It's making my position incredibly
difficult and I think a lot of,

2411
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:22,170
I think a lot of decent liberals
are struggling with this. How,

2412
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,120
what do you think the right should do?

2413
01:54:24,121 --> 01:54:27,270
If you guys want to be a little more
opening, a little more welcoming,

2414
01:54:27,271 --> 01:54:29,040
let's say for people that are,

2415
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,770
or seeing where tolerance
actually lives right now,

2416
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:34,230
what do you think you can do on,
on issues like that?

2417
01:54:34,231 --> 01:54:35,790
Cause I'm not saying that
the right has to be told,

2418
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:39,180
the only choice partier or a pro choice
set of ideas or anything like that.

2419
01:54:39,181 --> 01:54:41,240
But what, what do you
think is, is your job?

2420
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,380
Well, I mean one of the, that is one,

2421
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:47,970
maybe the only issue that I can think
of where the right generally and I think

2422
01:54:47,971 --> 01:54:51,220
correctly believes in government
compulsion, meaning that the,

2423
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,060
the basic thesis of the right is that
when a life is threatened than the

2424
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:56,130
government has a right to step in.
And this is a life that is threatened,

2425
01:54:56,131 --> 01:54:57,250
the government has rights to step in.

2426
01:54:57,251 --> 01:55:01,480
And so this I'm not sure as a bridgeable
gap, what I mean by that is that the,

2427
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:04,030
the right can continue to make the case,
uh,

2428
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:08,610
the right to continue to make the case.
I'm going to case I agree with. Um, but I,

2429
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:09,151
I can't,

2430
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:11,860
I'm not libertarian on this issue because
I don't think it's a libertarian issue.

2431
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:12,760
So here there's a national

2432
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,650
seen that the right has to modify its
position. I actually don't mean that.

2433
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:18,830
What I mean is just that for the things
that might be the differences if you

2434
01:55:18,831 --> 01:55:21,620
were, if you were just looking to
collect x lefties right now, right.

2435
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,900
But here's the toddler group
like w how do you welcome,

2436
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:26,680
well, I mean here's, here's where I was

2437
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,480
cause I think they're afraid. I think
that I think most of them have PTSD.

2438
01:55:29,481 --> 01:55:30,600
I realize this is what I really did.

2439
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:31,231
I mean the,

2440
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:33,660
the first place to start is why don't
we start with the stuff where we agree

2441
01:55:33,661 --> 01:55:37,530
because the truth is that the
checks and balances of the system,

2442
01:55:37,531 --> 01:55:38,580
just on a practical level,

2443
01:55:38,581 --> 01:55:42,720
the checks and balances of the system are
not going to allow for full protection

2444
01:55:42,721 --> 01:55:43,950
of life anytime soon.

2445
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,000
The,

2446
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,870
the sort of attempts that have been made
on the right to move in a more pro life

2447
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:53,790
direction have been incremental
at best. And so if it, listen,

2448
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,440
if that's the issue that's going to,
you know,

2449
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,340
bar you from joining the
right than the CSU should,

2450
01:55:57,341 --> 01:55:59,280
it's going to borrow from joining the
writers. Not much I can do about that.

2451
01:55:59,281 --> 01:56:00,240
But you know,

2452
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:03,570
we're w I'm happy to welcome anybody to
the conversation and you don't have to

2453
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:07,200
agree with me on abortion to be part
of the conversation. Like, I, we,

2454
01:56:07,201 --> 01:56:08,760
you and I don't agree on this and we,

2455
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:12,600
we have this conversation on a pretty
routine basis. I do it all the time. So,

2456
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:16,140
you know, I, I don't think
that there's in it, as I say,

2457
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:19,050
there are certain issues where
the right is not going to move.

2458
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:20,670
And frankly I don't think
the right should move.

2459
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:25,620
This is one of those the only issues.
Um, but can I make a bold prediction?

2460
01:56:25,621 --> 01:56:28,170
Sure. 30 years from now we're going
to be sitting here doing this,

2461
01:56:28,171 --> 01:56:33,171
hopefully in that bigger girl in Texas
probably may well have moved me on the,

2462
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:40,800
uh, on the abortion issue and I think
I may have moved you oncoming to an

2463
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:44,610
anniversary party. W what do you think
about that? I think there's possibility.

2464
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,230
I mean, I, I'd have to, I'd have
to think about that again. The,

2465
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,740
the issue as you know, you
know, not to get back. Well
Trod territory. Uh, you know,

2466
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,160
I think it would be unlikely
that you'd moved me, but I,

2467
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:59,790
I can never rule out the possibility
being moved on anything. Obviously. Um,

2468
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:03,810
and again, this is, this
comes back down to, you know,

2469
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:08,160
the difference between
approving of activity and
approving of, of human beings.

2470
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:11,820
And they, yeah, I wouldn't, if you
invited me to a party on Friday night,

2471
01:57:11,821 --> 01:57:15,840
I also wouldn't go right.
I mean like definitely not a Shabbat.

2472
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:20,560
A I Shabaka anniversary I think
probably is. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

2473
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:22,200
Sunday afternoon,

2474
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:27,560
a Sunday afternoon gayish anniversary.
Like, or, or maybe just, it's not about,

2475
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,740
you sound like a fricking barbecue dude.

2476
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:31,650
Like does everything have to be going
with the party's not going to be gay.

2477
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,570
It's just, yeah, we'll
have a barbecue. Okay.

2478
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:36,870
Just be gay is going to happen there
when I wasn't where he was going to turn

2479
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:38,460
into an orgy back there
or something like that.

2480
01:57:38,461 --> 01:57:40,940
So I wasn't worried you're going to
bring out the village people or something

2481
01:57:40,941 --> 01:57:44,230
like that. We'll have parties just to
say, well wait, why, what does that,

2482
01:57:44,231 --> 01:57:48,330
that's crazy. Yeah, no, I was,
I was pretty well aware of
that, in fact. And in fact,

2483
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:52,950
as I've said a thousand times, you
happy to go out to dinner? My wife,

2484
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:56,580
your husband, happy to go out to
dinner and do any of that stuff.

2485
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:01,020
As long as it's not like,
you know, Rah Rah, here's the
thing you think is in full,

2486
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:04,590
join me in celebrating it.
But again, that appeals,

2487
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:08,670
that applies to a wide variety of
settings that it, I mean, listen,

2488
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:12,090
it's harder on it. It's harder on
members of my family than anybody else.

2489
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:12,811
Like I've said before,

2490
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:15,540
I wouldn't attended intermarriage
Ratika jewelries and Andrea,

2491
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:20,160
I want to tend intermarriage. Yeah. So
this is exactly the same issue. Shapiro,

2492
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,380
they're giving me the signal
that you [inaudible] out.

2493
01:58:22,381 --> 01:58:25,240
I feel like we just had a radio show
doing like five minutes. Yeah, exactly.

2494
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:29,760
All right. That's Ben Shapiro daily

01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:33,220
The book is the right side of history.
Is it number one on Amazon right now? Uh,

2496
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,920
well it was, it was number one on the New
York Times list in his first week. Nice.

2497
01:58:35,921 --> 01:58:38,500
And so we knocked off Michelle Obama for
all week and then she took revenge and,

2498
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,940
and knock us back to number three.
But, but for a week, for a week.

2499
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:45,930
That's the battle of the left and the
right. That's data right there. All right.
