00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.930
 There are four billion hours of travel delays in the United States every year, contributing to pollution, 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.379
 Waste fossil fuels cost us all the money. An estimated $ 87.2 million dollars! No 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.130
 Male traffic is just annoying! But there is a solution to your traffic problems? 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.170
 It is often due to construction, accident, or bottlenecks created by ladders on traffic tunnels. 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.380
 But do you ever feel like congestion seems to appear for no reason? You do not imagine 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 that! In the 2008 experience, the drivers were instructed to drive along the ring road after 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.670
 The car is in front of them while trying to maintain a constant speed. Where participants, 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.530
 They began to fluctuate in speed. These fluctuations increased, eventually causing 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.870
 The cars stopped completely which broke free flow and led to traffic jams without any addition 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.969
 Factors. Researchers compared traffic jams to molecules in liquid and solids. 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.040
 Moving cars are like free particles that flow into liquid, but can undergo a "transition" 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.880
 To solidify the capsule. Once the particle / motor reaches critical density, inertia occurs. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.870
 One of the main causes of choking occurs is our inability to maintain a constant speed. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.130
 When the traffic interruption occurs, the most accelerated to catch the car forward, resulting 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.050
 When braking in the end, it imposes on the drivers behind to slow down, causing congestion to grow. 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.780
 When you're in traffic jam, you're part of the problem. Studies show that 80-90% of the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 Drivers think they are better than average driver, which is ... impossible. In addition to, 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.910
 As humans selectively our attention, we tend to forget that other drivers are people 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.100
 Also - kind of like its online comment, we can humiliate other drivers in ways we did not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 face to face. This leads to tremors on the road - yet very closely or constantly changing 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.410
 Lanes - which contributes directly to the congestion that creates traffic jams. 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.270
 Fortunately, a good driver, you can make a difference! Pay attention to the car of the future 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.400
 And behind you to keep a reserve of space around you. That way, if the driver in front of you 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.060
 Brake, your room to slow down and will not pass the braking tension along the chain 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.730
 traffic movement. Drive slower. Set your car to cruise control or try driving at a constant speed. 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.640
 In Belgium and the Netherlands, there is a technique carried out in times of high volume 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.319
 Known as "driving block" where a series of fixed speed propulsion vehicles to help 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.030
 Others keep up. The police have also used this strategy for 15 years, and leadership in the proper 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.500
 Speed ​​in groups to maintain traffic flow. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.269
 Of course, the advent of self-driving independent cars sees cars that are able to 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.190
 Communication and communication with each other, vehicle to vehicle, is expected to reduce 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.030
 Great traffic jams. In addition, researchers use biologically inspired 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.170
 Algorithms to reduce travel time. In one study, researchers apply a model based on 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.519
 Ant travel behavior as a means of directing traffic. Changes in infrastructure work too. Recently 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.739
 Los Angeles became the first city to synchronize every street light, causing automatic lights 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.599
 Adjustments based on flow, resulting in reduced travel time by 14%. 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.060
 Traffic aside, another solution is to take public transport when possible. MIT study 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.260
 From Boston traffic was found that if 1% of existing drivers took transit, would ease everyone 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.629
 Is reduced by 18%. 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.420
 Of course, companies like Toyota - who have supported this episode - are finding new ways to meet 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.090
 Motor challenges, and the development of future technologies to connect drivers and vehicles with 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 Road infrastructure. Toyota Launches New Corolla Im Hatchback With Toyota Safety 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.670
 Feeling techniques such as pre-collision systems, high automatic beams, Lane departure alarm 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.959
 - all of which will be standard and launch all over Canada in September. They also have 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.370
 A goal to produce zero emissions cars by 2050 which we really support! 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.060
 Therefore, special thanks to Toyota for supporting our channels and being a leader in science 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.370
 And space technology!
