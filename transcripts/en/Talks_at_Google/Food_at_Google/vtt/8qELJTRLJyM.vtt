RACHAEL O'MEARA:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.380
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.641
How's everyone doing?

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.141
Good.

00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:06.550
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.175
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Are
you ready to learn

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:13.000
how to make your brain expand
and have more capacity?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.510
I am.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.170
I am.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.010
Thanks for coming.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.040
So I'm Rachel O'Meara.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.370
I'm based in San Francisco.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.890
And I'm a volunteer for
the internal mindfulness

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.115
program, gPause.

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.550
My contribution is to
help bring in speakers

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.290
who I think have helped us
raise our own awareness,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.450
and emotional capacity,
and facilities.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.950
So today, I'm really excited
to bring in Dr. Brant

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.260
Cortright, who wrote the
book, "The Neurogenesis Diet

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460
and Lifestyle, Upgrade Your
Brain, Upgrade your Life."

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.350
And just a few words about
Brant before he jumps in.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.840
Brant is a clinical
psychologist and professor

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.770
of psychology at California
Institute of Integral Studies,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470
right in San Francisco.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.420
And he works full-time
on this, where

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.760
he's working on
cutting-edge brain

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.040
health and neuroscience-informed
depth therapy.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.880
So today, we're going
to learn about how

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.620
our lifestyle and our
choices help influence

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.770
what our brain is capable of.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.660
So without further ado,
please welcome Brant.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.470
And we'll take
questions at the end.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.358
Thanks.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:17.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.730
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Hi, everybody.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.200
Thank you for coming.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.800
And thank you, Rachel,
for organizing this.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.330
I'd like to talk to you
about neurogenesis today.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.910
And neurogenesis is one of
these pretty rare actual game

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.040
changers in neuroscience.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.750
It's really upending many of
the conventional views of how

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
we thought about the
brain, and brain growth,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.900
brain development, aging.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.130
So it was considered
as established fact,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.400
up until the late 1990s, that
the brain stopped growing

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.070
once we hit our early 20s.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.070
And after that, it was just one
slow die-off into decrepitude.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.669
And then in the late 1990s,
they realized that's not true.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.170
Actually, the brain
makes new brain cells

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.400
throughout our entire life.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.290
So that's what neurogenesis is.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.380
It's the process of
making new brain cells.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.766
It's the genesis of new neurons.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.690
So we've known about brain
plasticity for 50, 60 years.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.750
But this is very, very new.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.240
It's less than 20 years old.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.310
And when they discovered this,
that actually the brain does

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.190
make new brain cells
throughout the entire lifespan,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.900
up until we die, they didn't
know the meaning of it.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.930
They thought initially,
just, well, OK, we thought

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.110
the brain stopped growing.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.810
And now, it does grow.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.220
But in the last two
years, it's become clear

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.020
that actually our
rate of neurogenesis

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.330
has a huge impact on the
whole quality of our life,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.010
at every level.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.340
So it turns out that a
low rate of neurogenesis,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.750
that is a low rate at which
your brain is making new brain

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.720
cells, is associated
with cognitive decline,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.440
with memory problems,
with anxiety and stress,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.920
and with depression, even
with lowered immunity.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.110
And a high rate of
neurogenesis, that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.280
is a high rate at which the
brain is making new brain

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.890
cells, is associated
with the opposite,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.360
with cognitive enhancement,
with rapid learning,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.810
rapid problem solving, and
robust emotional resilience,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.160
protection against stress,
anxiety, and depression.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.880
And so your rate of neurogenesis
is the most important biomarker

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.050
for brain health and probably
other types of health

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.410
that most people
have never heard of.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.210
And it turns out
just about everybody

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.960
can increase their
rate of neurogenesis

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.180
by five times, probably
even more than that,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.272
with quite profound changes
in every level of your life,

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:25.480
every level of consciousness.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.660
They did this one
experiment with mice,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.420
where they gave them a
holistic treatment, that

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.960
was their word for it.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960
They called it an
enriched environment.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.370
But things like a great
diet, running wheels

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.610
to exercise on, lots of
materials to explore,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.880
lots of other friendly mice
to play with and mate with.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.600
And they found out that
they increased their rate

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.560
of neurogenesis by five times.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.450
And that these mice had
big cognitive advantages

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.550
over their normal
neurogenesis-ranked peers.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.530
Again, they learned faster.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.470
They were smarter.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.360
They figured things out faster.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.880
And although they
weren't totally

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.500
immune to stress--
scientists have gotten really

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.470
good at stressing mice
in these experiments--

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.320
they had protection from it.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.990
They weren't quite
supermice, but almost.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.690
They had one sixth more
neurons in the part

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.750
of the brain that
produces new brain

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.230
cells, in the hippocampus.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.645
That's a lot of computing power.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.380
So this is a holistic approach.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.940
The book is really a holistic
approach to brain health

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.270
and to increasing our
rate of neurogenesis.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.410
Because it turns out that
when we approach this

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.460
from a multi-dimensional
perspective,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.060
from many different facets,
it's much more powerful

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.110
than doing one or
two things alone.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.630
So every level of
our consciousness

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.470
comes to us through the brain,
body, heart, mind, spirit.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.550
Every level of our
consciousness we

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.890
experience through the brain.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.920
So the quality of
our brain really

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.830
determines the
quality of our life.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.580
And it turns out that we live
in a really neurotoxic world.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.170
To go through a day without
experiencing and doing

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.400
things that are
pretty neurotoxic

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.480
and would slow down your rate
of neurogenesis is difficult.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.930
It's like an obstacle course.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.610
It's like you need to just
duck bullets all the time.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.490
And we've all just kind of
stumbled into this innocently.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.870
Nobody knew this up until
just very, very recently.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.320
We didn't know neurogenesis
existed, let alone

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.670
that it could be
enhanced or slowed down.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.180
So this is really a
two-fold approach,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.600
a two-pronged strategy.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.290
We want to do those
things that increase

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.200
our rate of neurogenesis.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.050
And we want to stop doing
those things that slow down

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.950
our rate of neurogenesis.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.120
Otherwise, it's like stepping
on the gas and the brakes

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.850
at the same time.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.770
We don't get much
benefit from it.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.290
So there's a chapter on
each of these things.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.970
There's a chapter on the body
and physical things we can do.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.260
There's a chapter on the
heart and emotional factors,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.820
of which there are many,
for increasing or decreasing

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.210
neurogenesis.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.230
There's a chapter on mind
and mental things we can do.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.000
There's a chapter on spirit and
different spiritual practices

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.990
that seem to have an
effect, actually quite

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.830
a powerful effect, on this.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.860
But there is one chapter
just devoted to diet.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.960
Because diet is
incredibly important

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.140
when it comes to this.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:10.220
So the book goes
into a lot of detail

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.570
about particular nutrients that
we can do, that we can ingest,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.020
that increase our
rate of neurogenesis.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:27.730
So things like certain
bioflavonoids, like chrysin,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:33.330
or apigenin, or luteolin,
things that most people haven't

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.870
heard of or it doesn't roll
off the tongue for most people.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.539
Also hesperidin is another
one, a bioflavonoid.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.510
And then there's other
foods that increase it,

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:51.570
like turmeric; or curcumin,
the curry spice; green tea;

00:08:51.570 --> 00:09:01.720
mulberry; red sage; or salvia;
goji berries; things like that.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:09.360
But what is huge in this are
omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.800
So to build a beautiful
high-end house,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.210
we need to use
high-quality materials.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.250
We don't use rotting
wood or old lumber.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.090
We use good quality materials.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.350
And it's the same
with the brain.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.030
To build a
high-quality brain, we

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.410
need to use good
building materials.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.800
And the best are
omega-3 fatty acids.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.290
So the brain is made
up of about 2/3 fat.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.740
And of this fat, one
third of it is DHA.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.210
Now, DHA is one of the
three omega-3 fatty acids

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.290
and the most important
in terms of the brain.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:10:02.140
So we need a diet that is high
in good fats, healthy fats,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.225
and low in bad, unhealthy fats.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.880
So let's talk a little
more about the omega-3's.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.750
So they did one
experiment with monkeys

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.750
where they raised
a group of monkeys

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.890
on a low omega-3 diet, an
omega-3 deficient diet.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.160
And they raised another group of
monkeys on a high omega-3 diet.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.970
And then they looked at
their brains afterwards.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.510
And the monkeys on
the low omega-3 diet

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.780
had very simple,
undifferentiated brains.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.420
But the monkeys on
the high omega-3 diet

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.640
had very complex, richly
differentiated brains,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.940
almost like human beings.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.955
Complexity is good when
it comes to the brain.

00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:50.038
We want to see complexity.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:11:01.020
So doing probably between 1,000
and 1,500 milligrams of DHA

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.610
every day is something
probably just about everybody

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.750
in the world should be doing.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.040
It's probably the
single most powerful way

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.960
to increase your
rate of neurogenesis.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.410
You increase the rate
of neurogenesis 40%.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.620
And you're giving your
brain these building blocks

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.855
to build complexity.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.030
Now, good healthy
fats are unoxidized

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:37.460
fats and bad unhealthy
fats, are oxidized fats.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.300
So there's a lot
of talk these days,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.120
as we kind of switch from an
American high-carb, low-fat

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.570
diet to increasingly seeing
that that is actually

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.680
a disaster for the brain
and for many other things.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.130
That diet, as probably many
of you know by this point,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.790
is coming under a lot
of attack and was really

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.560
based on some flawed
science back in the '50s.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.620
And that high
carb, low-fat diet,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.710
it seems like it's more and more
behind the obesity epidemic,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.680
the diabetes epidemic, the
heart disease epidemic,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.550
probably partly the
Alzheimer's epidemic as well.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.260
It's a disaster for health.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.380
So more and more,
the conversation

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.740
is switching to
fats versus carbs.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.350
But that's really
not quite it either.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.170
It needs to be
what kinds of fats?

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.860
Because some kinds of
fats are not good for you.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.710
They're terrible for you.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.110
So oxidized fats are
really bad for you.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.340
They're really
bad for the brain.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.950
So an oxidized fat
means its gone rancid,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.820
either through heat, or
light, or exposure to oxygen.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.640
So, for example, cooking with
vegetable oil, terrible idea.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.200
Nobody should be doing it.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.910
What happens is that
the fats oxidize

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.630
almost immediately
when they're cooked,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.630
at very low temperatures.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.450
And when those oxidized fats
get into your bloodstream, what

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.990
they do is they
oxidize the cholesterol

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.930
in your bloodstream.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.050
And that oxidized cholesterol
produces heart disease,

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.070
produces atherosclerosis,
and inflammation.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.580
And inflammation is a
disaster for the brain

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.050
and for neurogenesis.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.260
It just almost shuts off
the process of neurogenesis.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:40.880
So eating burned foods,
like burned meat,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.440
cooking with vegetable
oils, terrible ideas.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.460
What we want to be doing is
cooking with saturated fats.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.090
We want to be cooking
with things like butter,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.106
or ghee, or coconut
oil, even lard.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.880
We want to be eating a
lot of good healthy fats,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.820
things like avocados,
nuts, wild-caught fish,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:14.660
grass-fed beef, grass-fed dairy,
milk, cheese, things like this,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.260
pastured eggs, Pastured eggs
are one of the very best things

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.666
you can do for your brain.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.650
When you look at
pastured eggs, or you

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.000
look at grass-fed meat
versus conventional meat,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.580
you look at the
fatty acid profile.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.900
So evolutionarily,
humans evolved

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:40.160
with a ratio of, like, 1
to 1 or 1 or 2 of omega-3

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.150
to omega-6s in the diet.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.910
But the contemporary modern
diet, it's more like 1 to 20,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.890
or 1 to 30, or 1 to 40, which
is a very highly inflammatory

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.670
diet.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:15:00.970
So with grass fed beef, we get
a 1 to 1.65 ratio, almost ideal.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.400
With conventional beef,
it's closer to 1 to 5,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.870
very inflammatory.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.720
We don't want that.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.870
Another thing that we
want to avoid is sugar.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.120
And again, everybody
probably knows this.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.240
But it goes along with
this high-carb diet.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.890
Because carbohydrates eventually
get converted into sugar.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.620
So it went off with sugar.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:32.460
But most people want to cut down
on their carbohydrate intake

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.560
because a high carbohydrate
intake produces

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.210
insulin resistance and
high glucose levels.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.430
And right now, 80% of
America, it's estimated,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.350
has some degree of
insulin resistance.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.620
Insulin resistance is not good.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.610
In fact, it's very
bad for the brain.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.890
So you need insulin to
make use of the glucose.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.190
And when we have a
lot of carbohydrate

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.200
over the years, a lot of
sugar and carbohydrate,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.890
eventually the cells stop
producing insulin receptors.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.670
That's called
insulin resistance.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.650
So you need more insulin.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:15.160
And insulin is damaging to just
about every organ of the body.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.230
That's why people who
have diabetes often

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.130
have complications
and die earlier.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.860
It produces glycation.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.560
And glycation
cross-links proteins

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.740
in all different
systems of the body.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.740
When we have a high blood
sugar and high insulin levels,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.730
this high degree of glycation
is like a faster kind of aging.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.840
And it also is a
disaster for the brain.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.790
If you look at
blood sugar levels

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.470
and you look at
cognitive decline,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.920
they track each other
just about perfectly.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.960
High blood sugar levels
and high insulin levels

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.870
and cognitive decline, they
track each other almost 1 to 1.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.760
It's quite amazing.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.810
So anybody who's
getting a physical, when

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.079
you go for your yearly
physical, a good test to get

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:12.270
is called the hemoglobin
A1c, the hemoglobin A1c.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.630
And what that does, it's like a
snapshot of your glucose levels

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.190
over the last three months.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.599
And if it's elevated, which
I would bet that 80% of just

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:28.490
about any room, it's going to be
elevated, you would be advised,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.960
well I think, to try to reduce
your carbohydrate intake

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.880
and try to regain insulin
sensitivity, which

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.450
means switching away
from those yummy carbs

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.860
into more of a
high, good fat diet.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.420
Some people think this is hard.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.744
And I found it hard
over the years.

00:17:50.744 --> 00:17:51.910
I've made numerous attempts.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.540
And at certain times it was,
oh, my God, I got to do this.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.480
And as you do it,
after a while you

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.790
realize my eating
habits are just habits.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.480
And I can learn new habits.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.480
And actually, there's
a whole new world

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.790
of eating that opens up
when we give up things

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.600
that we are quite attached to.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.970
It turns out that
a high sugar diet

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.760
will cut your rate of
neurogenesis in two.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.960
That's pretty
astonishing in itself.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.860
When you think about
the average diet,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.530
of like the American
child, it starts out

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.230
with, I don't know,
like sugar Frosted

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.240
Flakes and orange juice.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.500
I mean it's all
sugar and bad fat.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.800
Like, you can't grow a
very good brain with that.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.400
It's just not possible.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.760
There's one other
part about diet

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.950
that I am hesitant
to mention, just

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.350
because it's such a
big bummer that I hate

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.446
to be the bearer of bad news.

00:18:56.446 --> 00:18:57.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.990
When we look at
wanting to cut out

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.130
things that reduce neurogenesis,
two of the big ones

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.160
are alcohol and caffeine.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.700
I know.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.660
There's a groan that just takes
place throughout the room.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.470
This has been investigated
by a whole generation

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.070
of neuroscience graduate
students at this point.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.310
Neuroscience labs basically
run on the stuff, on caffeine.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.530
And there's been experiment,
after experiment,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.290
after experiment trying to
show that caffeine is actually

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.650
good for neurogenesis.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.920
And it's all shown the opposite.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.440
What they've
discovered is that even

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.200
under the minimal
biologically active dose,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.790
there's a reduction
in neurogenesis.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.760
That means anything you
can feel is slowing down

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.320
your rate of neurogenesis.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.220
Now, caffeine and coffee
are these mixed bags

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.850
when it comes to the brain.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.080
On the one hand, the
polyphenols in coffee

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.380
are really good for your brain.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.310
They're antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.250
They're good.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.010
And caffeine produces
some short term gains.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.370
Some short-term
memory is increased.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.160
But over the long
run, you're actually

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.510
decreasing cognitive
function with caffeine.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.200
I'm sorry.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.730
Getting off caffeine actually is
not that difficult. It's again,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.530
a habit.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.080
Your body is in the habit of
using that to wake itself up.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.720
But when you stop, you go
through a little bit of a low.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.320
And then pretty soon, your
body learns to wake itself up.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.960
And it's like you
don't even miss it.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.490
You also might want to
do things like extra B12

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.280
or B6, pantothenic acid.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.205
These are psychic energizers.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.100
If you drink a lot of coffee,
you might to just reduce it.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.230
I'm not saying you need to be
as pure as the driven snow here.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.390
Hardly anybody is.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.820
But just in looking
at all of this,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.100
that's one thing to just
factor in to all of this.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.190
OK.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.775
So in terms of the body--
let's switch to the body.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.920
Again, this comes
out of a number

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.270
of experiments, where they
try intervening on one level,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.310
with one particular
nutrient or one

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:42.030
particular form of environmental
enrichment, and then two.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.530
And they discover that
really all of these things

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.730
work together, body,
heart, mind, spirit.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.130
It's synergistic.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.040
There's a kind of a
multiplicative effect

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.900
that happens.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.880
So one of the most
powerful things

00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.240
you can do to increase your rate
of neurogenesis is exercise.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.440
Now, all kinds of exercise
are good for your brain,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.480
yoga, strength training,
aerobic exercise.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.970
But when it comes
to neurogenesis,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.610
there's only one kind
that's effective.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.020
And that is aerobic exercise.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.330
Aerobic exercise
is anything that

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.380
gets your heart beating fast
and gets you breathing quickly.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.710
Aerobic means living on air.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:32.060
So running, biking, walking
quickly, fast dancing,

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.470
swimming, anything that
gets you breathing hard

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.120
is really good for neurogenesis.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.300
It's the single
most powerful thing

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.660
you can do to increase
your rate of neurogenesis.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.180
When they do lab experiments,
they just put a running mill

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.460
on there, to get them up.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.250
Now, the problem with
running, some people

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.650
ask, well, what about interval
training or this high intensity

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.050
training that is
very popular now?

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:04.290
It turns out that's not
effective for neurogenesis.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.710
It only seems to be
sustained if, like, you have

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.710
a 20, 30, 40-minute workout.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:16.020
The brain just explodes
with new neurons.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.270
Now, the problem with
just doing running though

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.290
is that about half of those
neurons die off pretty quickly.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.040
The brain is always
pruning for new connections

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.830
that aren't being
used immediately.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.660
So that's why we need to
do other things to keep

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.070
those new brain cells alive.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:42.680
So the bioflavonoid herperidin,
for example, what it does

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.280
is it keeps new
brain cells alive.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.090
So if we're doing omega-3 fatty
acids, if we're working out,

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.940
we're getting a lot
of new brain cells.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.150
If we also do hesperidin,
we're getting an almost 100%

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.700
survival rate of
these new brain cells.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:10.150
Another really important driver
of a neurogenesis is sleep.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:16.210
And sleep has been one of
these underestimated things

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.900
in health for a long time.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.760
So when you don't
get enough sleep,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.870
you have lower
rates of melatonin.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.230
And melatonin
increases neurogenesis.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.756
And the rate of neurogenesis
slides off very quickly.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:42.940
Sleep is important, not only
because it helps cognition,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.590
like if you have one
hour less sleep in a day,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.960
there is measurable
cognitive decline.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.415
You don't remember things
as well, measurably.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.810
But also sleep cleans the brain.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.420
They didn't understand how the
brain cleans itself of toxins

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.480
very recently, just a
couple of years ago.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.990
The lymph system cleans
out toxins in the body.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.360
But the brain is its own thing.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.330
And the lymph system didn't
seem to interact with the brain,

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.250
to cross the
blood/brain barrier.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.320
When they discovered something
called the glymphatic system

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.210
in the brain.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.930
And the glial cells in the
brain, which are connective

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.540
neurons and also have
housekeeping functions

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.070
in the brain, when we sleep,
the neurons actually shrink

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.310
by about a third or to a half.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.570
And the brain is flooded
with cerebral spinal fluid,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.950
that just cleans it.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.860
And the glial cells go
and they just pick up,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.070
particularly the beta amyloid.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.230
Now, beta amyloid plaque is
what accumulates in Alzheimer's.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.430
It's something we want to
get rid of in the brain.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.780
It's not something we
want to accumulate.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.377
So when we sleep, and we
have a full night's sleep,

00:25:57.377 --> 00:25:59.210
and this comes towards
the end of the night,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.510
so a little bit of
sleep isn't so good.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.060
In fact, if you only
sleep, like, three or four

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.662
hours a night, you
wake up the next day,

00:26:08.662 --> 00:26:09.620
you feel kind of yucky.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.572
You take a shower.

00:26:10.572 --> 00:26:12.030
And you still kind
of feel like you

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.840
haven't had a shower, that
kind of yucky feeling?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.520
Well, you're clean.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.590
But that dirty feeling
affects your brain.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.460
That's toxins in your brain
that haven't been washed out

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.010
during the night.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.570
And that beta amyloid is
something that, it also

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.900
reduces neurogenesis.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.550
How are we doing on time?

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.100
Let's go for about
another 15 minutes

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.932
and take some questions.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.350
There's a number of
things that the book

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.600
talks-- but there's many
different physical practices

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.560
that are helpful to
integrate into our lives,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.480
and a number of things
to avoid as well.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.270
When it comes to
the emotional level,

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:02.610
it turns out that our
emotions are a big player

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.950
in how the brain regenerates.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:13.130
So it turns out that
stress slows neurogenesis

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.380
to a crawl and particularly
the sort of stress

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.510
that most people are dealing
with, which is chronic stress.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.860
Now when we talk
about stress, it's

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.460
easy to talk about stress
as just a bad thing.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.610
But actually there's good
stress and there's bad stress.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:35.340
Good stress is short
term and moderate stress.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.510
We need short-term,
moderate stress.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.930
When we're stressed
in that way, we're

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.070
challenged by the universe.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.510
And we have to come up with
a new way of responding.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.310
So new capacities come
forth, new abilities.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.990
When we're challenged
in this way,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.880
we become ourselves more fully.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.380
We need a kind of
moderate ideal stress

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.290
or challenge in our lives
because that engages the brain.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.960
And when it's engaged
in an optimal way,

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.870
neurogenesis is enhanced.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.770
But that's not
the kind of stress

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.990
that most people
are suffering from.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.900
It's like working
out with weights.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.440
When you stop working out,
the muscle breaks down

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.620
and then it builds up stronger.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.340
If you keep working
out, you just wear down.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.352
It's not good.

00:28:31.352 --> 00:28:33.630
The type of stress that most
people are suffering from

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.730
is chronic stress, and
sometimes just extreme stress,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.990
but particularly chronic stress.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:45.095
And chronic stress
degrades the brain.

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:47.830
It turns down the
rate of neurogenesis.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.440
And it actually
produces glucocorticoids

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.780
that are neurotoxic,
that actually

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.920
begin to kill some of the
cells in the hippocampus.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.160
So where neurogenesis happens
is in the hippocampus.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.680
And the hippocampus is this
really interesting structure

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.320
in the brain.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.350
It's this crescent
moon-shaped structure.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.370
Actually, we have
two hippocampi,

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.470
one on each side of the
brain, right and left.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.400
But it's usually
referred in the single.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.940
And one end of
the hippocampus is

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.560
involved in emotion regulation,
particularly the regulation

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.200
of anxiety, stress,
and depression.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.920
And the other end
of the hippocampus

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.440
goes into the cognitive
areas of the brain

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.310
and also are involved in
body awareness and spatial

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.190
relationships.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.615
So involved with the body,
involved with cognition,

00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:43.250
and involved in the
processing of new memories.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.020
Now, the hippocampus
doesn't store memories.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.970
But it processes new memories.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.020
So that our ability
to make new memories

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.300
is dependent on the hippocampus.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.860
So in Alzheimer's, for example,
which massively attacks

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.850
the hippocampus, you
see that the capacity

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.180
to form new memories
isn't there.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.760
And the person isn't there.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.000
Memory is sort of a
linchpin of the whole self.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.962
When memory goes, you
can see-- if you've

00:30:07.962 --> 00:30:09.670
been around somebody
who has Alzheimer's,

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.400
a parent or a grandparent, you
see their whole sense of self--

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.444
it's like the rug has
been pulled out from it.

00:30:17.444 --> 00:30:19.735
It's like the self is full
of-- it's like Swiss cheese.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.443
It's like there's
holes in it everywhere.

00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:24.730
The person isn't who they were.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.030
So the ability to
process new memories,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.190
and to deal with memories,
to process memories,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.420
is critical for everything.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.320
It's critical for
executive function.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.390
It's critical for the
higher mental centers.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.940
It's critical for
a sense of self.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.990
So the hippocampus is this
very critical structure

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.730
that is involved body, heart,
mind, and spirit as well.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.229
Spiritual practices have
a very robust effect

00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:54.270
on the whole hippocampus.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:02.610
So what stress does is it
slows down neurogenesis

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.520
and it actually attacks the
cells of the hippocampus.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.580
It's neurotoxic.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:16.900
And Alzheimer's is an
epidemic at this point.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.590
Right now, one third
of seniors who die,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.820
dies with either Alzheimer's
or some other form of dementia.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.790
And right now, 42% of people
who reach the age of 85 have

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.990
Alzheimer's.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.950
And pretty soon, it's going
to be 50% of the people who

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.370
reach the age of 85.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.910
Since most of us are
expected to live to be 85,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.850
that's a pretty
alarming statistic.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.050
And right now, according to
the Alzheimer's Association,

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:49.070
according to their website,
Alzheimer's is the one disease

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.930
for which there is no drug.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.220
There is no treatment.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.270
There is no cure.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.030
There is no prevention.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.160
We have some drugs which
help with the symptoms

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.520
for a few months.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.720
But that's all.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.310
And the pharmaceutical companies
have spent billions of dollars

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.830
right now on hundreds
of drug trials,

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.980
trying to come up with the next
new billion-dollar drug to help

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.650
with Alzheimer's.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:19.090
And so far, it's been a complete
failure, a total failure,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.840
abject, zero, zip, nothing.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.600
There's nothing right now.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.964
So this is a pretty discouraging
picture at the moment.

00:32:28.964 --> 00:32:30.630
But in the last couple
of years, there's

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.450
actually been some research
done from a holistic perspective

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.520
that shows promise; in fact,
shows incredible promise.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.420
So there isn't a
lot of research done

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.050
from a holistic perspective
because most of the research

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.540
agenda is driven by
pharmaceutical companies

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.540
or academic researchers looking
to discover the next big drug,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.950
patentable drug.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.656
And holistic research,
it's like most

00:32:55.656 --> 00:32:56.780
of the stuff there is free.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.740
There's nothing that
can be made money from.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.500
But about a year and a half
ago, the Buck Foundation,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.470
up in Marin County,
published a study

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.690
that showed that
they actually were

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:14.580
able to reverse the
cognitive decline associated

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.350
with Alzheimer's using
a holistic approach.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.191
So it's basically a kind
of simplified version

00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.190
of what was in the book.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.814
The study came out
just a couple months

00:33:24.814 --> 00:33:26.240
before the book came out.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.450
So I mentioned it in there.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.930
But it's body,
heart, mind, spirit.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.910
So there's physical
dimensions to this.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.760
There's dietary
dimensions to this,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.870
emotional, mental,
and also practicing

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.040
certain kinds of
spiritual practice.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.950
And what they found
is that people

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.580
who have had to stop working
because of memory loss

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.730
were able to go back to
work for the two years

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.660
that they followed
them on the study.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.840
And then in the
middle of last year,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.420
there was a Finnish
study, which was

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.960
the first randomized
control study,

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.980
of 1,200 Finnish and Swedish
at-risk people, seniors,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.929
at risk for cognitive
decline, that also showed

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:18.300
they were able to prevent
cognitive decline with a very

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.530
simplified version of this body,
heart, mind, spirit approach.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.500
So right now, it looks as if
that this kind of holistic

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.520
approach is the only
evidence-based approach

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.850
to preventing and even reversing
the cognitive decline that we

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:36.647
see in Alzheimer's.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:47.760
So that was a long
detour around stress

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.489
because Alzheimer's is
party caused by stress,

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.820
partly caused by
inflammation, partly

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.930
caused by a dysregulation
of sugar metabolism.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.600
It's been called type 3
diabetes by many people.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.890
So if we have chronic
stress in our lives,

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.870
and many, many
people do, one thing

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:15.590
we need to make sure to do
is to take breaks from it.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.730
We need to exercise.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.640
We need to meditate.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.350
We need to laugh with friends.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.800
We need to get downtime.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.300
We need to do something
that gets our body back

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.470
to a homeostatic balance,
where we can go, ah.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.500
We can relax.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.420
We can reset the
internal chemistry,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.990
so we're not just recycling
stress hormones all day long.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.520
That's hugely
damaging to the brain.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.290
We need to have
some kind of break.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.420
We need to get
offline occasionally.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.140
We need to just not be
always on, always available.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.260
So stress is huge in this.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.440
And there are certain kinds of
relationships that are helpful

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.060
and certain kinds
that are hurtful.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.950
Obviously, broken
relationships are not fun.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.270
And it turns out they
also are very damaging

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.010
in terms of the brain.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.520
Neurogenesis slows way down.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.740
Chronic anger slows
neurogenesis way down.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.010
And loving, supportive
relationships

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.820
increases our rate
of neurogenesis.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.370
We secrete certain
hormones, like oxytocin,

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.430
which have a very strong
stimulating effect

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.936
on the rate of neurogenesis.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.580
In terms of the mind, what
we need to do to stimulate

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.770
neurogenesis is to
learn new things.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.590
We need to be ongoing
lifelong learners.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.990
There's two times in life when
there's a measurable cognitive

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.800
decline.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.340
One is graduation from college
and the other is retirement.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:58.950
Unless, after you graduate from
college, you get into a career

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.370
where you are a
knowledge worker,

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.600
or where you're a
teacher, or you're

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.766
something where you're using
your brain in some way.

00:37:03.766 --> 00:37:06.860
And maybe you're using it
in business in some way.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.190
And maybe you're a
professional of some sort.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.290
Then there is no
cognitive decline.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.160
Same with retirement,
often people

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.270
just go and play golf, a
rapid fall-off of brain

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.930
functioning after that.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.190
But if you're a
lifelong learner,

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.600
if you're learning new
things, if you're reading,

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.515
if you're writing, even
if it's just email,

00:37:29.515 --> 00:37:32.080
even if you're just reading
stuff on the internet,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.440
if you're keeping
your brain active,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.530
that's what is important.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:41.120
And in your earlier years,
if you're using your brain,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.050
you're building something
called cognitive reserve.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.620
And cognitive reserve,
then when beta

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.780
amyloid, if it does
begin to accumulate,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.280
you are protected from it,
for a very, very long time.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.060
So teachers have the lowest rate
of Alzheimer's as a profession.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.300
They're using their brains.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.290
As knowledge workers, you
guys are using your brains.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.710
And that's going to be
very helpful keeping it up.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.370
And also learning new things,
not doing just the same thing,

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.650
but learning new things.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.320
And the last thing,
in terms of spirit.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.190
So it turns out that there are a
couple spiritual practices that

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:27.050
appear to increase neurogenesis
along the entire axis

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.020
of the hippocampus.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.600
So there are certain things
that only increase neurogenesis

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.230
along one end or the other end.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:39.920
For example,
antidepressants-- you know,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.230
when you take
antidepressants-- actually,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.920
this is how they really began
to understand that neurogenesis

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.575
was important.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:57.290
There's been this belief,
that's been marketed really

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.250
by the pharmaceutical
companies, that depression

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:05.200
means you've got low serotonin,
low serotonin transmitter

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.440
levels.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.870
And it turns out
that's not true.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.630
That the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.020
work not by
increasing serotonin,

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.420
but by increasing your
rate of neurogenesis.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.430
So the pharmaceutical
companies right now

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.290
are making $16
billion a year off

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:31.450
of the different SSRIs, the most
widely prescribed psychoactive

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.660
drug in the world.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.000
They've got a good thing going.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.620
The cartels have a
good thing going here.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.050
And they know it.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.100
They're looking to
sell more product.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:45.250
But they also know that
this serotonin deficiency

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.550
myth is that.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.980
It's a myth.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.750
That actually when you
start taking SSRIs,

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.210
your serontonin levels go up
immediately, within hours.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.560
But there's no change in
mood for three to four weeks.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.120
Well, that's how long
it takes new brain cells

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.100
to mature and to come online.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.770
So the cartels know this.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:09.450
They are madly at work
on drugs to increase

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:10.852
the rate of neurogenesis.

00:40:10.852 --> 00:40:12.310
And when they come
up with them, we

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.540
will hear about them
nonstop, no doubt.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.880
But there are a lot
of natural things,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.000
that are very
inexpensive, that increase

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.140
your rate of neurogenesis
way more than SSRIs do.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.490
I would love to do a
study around depression

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.360
and compare SSRIs with
a holistic approach

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.720
like this, if
anybody's interested.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:44.150
So what SSRIs do is they
increase neurogenesis

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:48.620
along the emotional side
of the hippocampus, which

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.920
is why you don't get a cognitive
boost when you do SSRIs.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.060
But certain types of meditation
and spiritual practice

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.190
appear to increase neurogenesis
along the entire length

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.030
of the hippocampus.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.980
And the two types that
appear to have this effect

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:11.610
are A, mindfulness practices;
and B, heart-opening practices,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.710
devotional practices.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:21.400
So devotional prayer,
Bhakti practices,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.180
Christian practices
of surrender,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.355
different practices of
opening to the divine,

00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:32.830
of calling on the divine,
heart-opening practices,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:38.370
meta-practices also,
compassion practices, these

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:41.870
have a very powerful effect
on the rate of neurogenesis,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.220
and also mindfulness practices.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.530
So mindfulness, as
you all know, is

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.960
the process of coming into the
here and now, more and more,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.210
sometimes focusing on
one particular thing

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:57.100
like the breath, or hearing,
or a particular sense

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.980
or a feeling; sometimes
focusing on just whatever

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:04.420
arises in consciousness, but
coming into the present moment

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.360
more and more.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.730
This also, after as
little as eight weeks,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.475
seems to have a
very powerful effect

00:42:12.475 --> 00:42:14.025
on our rate of neurogenesis.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.680
So when your rate of
neurogenesis is low,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.380
it's like paddling upstream.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.570
It's a lot of effort
for very little result.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.470
And sometimes even, it's like
we're still moving backwards.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.580
When your rate of
neurogenesis is high,

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.260
it's like paddling downstream.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.260
It's not that there's no effort.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.230
But the effort is
so readily available

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.460
that it's almost like
an effortless effort.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.480
We still have bad
things happen to us.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.680
But we bounce back
much more quickly.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.270
There's more resilience.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.800
Resilience is this
capacity to bounce back.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.070
And we're not thrown as much.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.460
We feel more on top of it.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.600
So I would just
encourage you all

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.240
to think about
modifying, not just

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.990
your diet, but your
whole lifestyle,

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:14.540
so that it's a more
neurohealthy, neurogenic way

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.190
of living in the world.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.820
And I'd make just one
suggestion for Google,

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.880
which is the different
restaurants in your food court.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.650
I think it would be great to
have one that just focused

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.970
on brain health, that
didn't serve anything

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.070
that would be neurotoxic
or which would lower

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.220
your rate of neurogenesis.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.960
And would only serve things
that are neurohealthy

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.200
and increase your
rate of neurogenesis.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.770
It would make it
very easy, rather

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:47.160
than to have to navigate all of
these very complex food marts.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.046
So let me just open
it up to questions.

00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:52.522
Thank you.

00:43:52.522 --> 00:43:54.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:59.564 --> 00:44:00.480
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:00.979
Questions?

00:44:00.979 --> 00:44:02.781
I'll pass the mic around.

00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:04.530
AUDIENCE: Man, I've
got so many questions.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:05.030
OK.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.830
First, can you comment on
the multitude of studies

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.170
that show that drinking
coffee correlates

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.370
to a lowered rate of
Alzheimer's, stabilized

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.650
blood sugar, et cetera.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.557
That's one question.

00:44:17.557 --> 00:44:18.390
BRANT CORTRIGHT: OK.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.890
Yeah.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.350
The polyphenols in coffee
are really good for you.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.172
It's the caffeine part
that's bad for neurogenesis.

00:44:25.172 --> 00:44:27.380
AUDIENCE: So does that
suggest drinking decaf coffee?

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.421
BRANT CORTRIGHT: If you're
going to drink coffee,

00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:30.630
drink decaf, absolutely.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:34.480
Or you can do like an extract.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.480
Like, you can green tea
extracts that are caffeine-free.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.890
Those polyphenols are
fantastic for your brain.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.630
They stimulate neurogenesis.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.790
And you want, like
with green tea,

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:49.890
you want like the equivalent
of 10, 15 cups a day.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.000
But you don't want
that caffeine.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.770
So you want caffeine-free.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.420
And the same with coffee.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.547
The coffee polyphenyls
are great for the brain.

00:44:58.547 --> 00:44:59.630
They're anti-inflammatory.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.710
They're good for many things.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.994
But it's the caffeine that turns
down the rate of neurogenesis.

00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.660
I'm afraid we're going to have a
lot of questions about caffeine

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:08.399
here.

00:45:08.399 --> 00:45:10.440
RACHAEL O'MEARA: I'll just
take one more quickly.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.540
AUDIENCE: Can you comment
on intermittent fasting

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.270
and neurogenesis?

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.990
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Yeah.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.000
Intermittent
fasting also appears

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.960
to also be one of those
things that increases

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.500
the rate of neurogenesis.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.440
Yeah, it's helpful.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.490
It's helpful for bringing
down your blood sugar levels,

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.170
your hemoglobin A1c levels,
for increasing your insulin

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.910
resistance.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.890
And it also is one of
these like mild stressors

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.647
that is good for neurogenesis.

00:45:40.647 --> 00:45:41.730
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Question?

00:45:44.515 --> 00:45:46.160
AUDIENCE: I have three things.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.701
And I'll try to keep
them very short.

00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:51.080
The first is do you
know of any research

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.720
into theobromine, as opposed
to caffeine, as a stimulant?

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.080
Just for the audience,
that's what's in chocolate.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:04.350
The second is it possible for us
to measure our own neurogenesis

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.620
or is this like
self-surgery on our brains?

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.160
And the third, I've forgotten.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.693
So I guess it's just two.

00:46:11.693 --> 00:46:12.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.376
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Good.

00:46:13.376 --> 00:46:14.240
Two good questions.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.790
So the first one was
are there any studies

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:20.260
done on theobromine and the
effects on neurogenesis?

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.310
So theobromine is the
stimulant that's in chocolate.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.160
People think of caffeine
being in chocolate.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.230
But there's very, very
little, almost none.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.800
There's something
called theobromine.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.660
And theobromine is actually
very similar to caffeine.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.240
But it's different and it has
a slightly different effect.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.270
There are no studies
that I know of.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:45.000
But just given that
caffeine has that effect,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.160
I would bet, 99 to 1, that
it also lowers neurogenesis.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:55.070
I wish they would make
a theobromine-free dark

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.390
chocolate.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.250
But they don't.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.360
So I don't know.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.340
But I would bet that
it also lowers it.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.727
And the second question was?

00:47:06.727 --> 00:47:08.185
AUDIENCE: Ah, how
do we measure it?

00:47:08.185 --> 00:47:09.934
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Oh,
how do we measure it?

00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:13.580
So there are a number of
neuroimaging possibilities

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.710
for looking at
neurogenesis in the brain.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:22.120
But the definitive way
to tell is on autopsy.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.104
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.104 --> 00:47:26.770
That's why in human
beings, they weren't

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:28.720
able to confirm this
for a long time.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.970
They knew it happened in mice.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.345
They knew it
happened in monkeys.

00:47:31.345 --> 00:47:32.590
They knew it for a long time.

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:34.820
But they couldn't confirm
it in human beings

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.830
until the late 1990s.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.430
But there are a lot
of other measures

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.820
that-- like looking
at blood flow,

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:46.330
looking at the use of glucose,
looking at synaptic growth.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.830
There are other
things that go along

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:49.540
with it that often indicate it.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.900
But they aren't absolutely
definitive for it.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.300
So we really know
by how we feel,

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.950
I think, probably
more than anything.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.810
If you're feeling depressed,
if you're feeling anxious,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.740
if you're feeling
stressed, you probably

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.946
have a low rate of neurogenesis.

00:48:07.946 --> 00:48:09.786
Yeah?

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:11.160
AUDIENCE: Is there
any difference

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:16.660
or what is the difference
between sources of DHA algae

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.620
versus fish-based?

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.440
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Good
question, really good question.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.629
So I mentioned fish oil.

00:48:25.629 --> 00:48:27.670
And that's what we usually
think of when we think

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.450
of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:35.140
There are vegetarian
sources of omega-3.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.240
There's flax oil.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.730
There's chia seeds.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.390
There's algae.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.160
So there's three fatty acids.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.350
There's ALA, EPA, and DHA.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.650
DHA is the one we're after here.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:54.470
EPA is also really
good, anti-inflammatory.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:55.940
ALA, it's nice.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:02.550
But it turns out that
flax oil and chia seeds,

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.620
they have a lot of ALA.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.080
And the brain
converts that to DHA

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.826
at a very inefficient level,
something like 3% or 5%

00:49:12.826 --> 00:49:13.825
in healthy 18-year-olds.

00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:15.820
And it goes down from there.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.520
So they've tried to raise
DHA levels with flax oil,

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.510
with chia seeds.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:21.560
You can't do it.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.760
They see no increase
in rise in DHA levels.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.910
However, with algae,
they have seen a rise.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.150
So algae has EPA in it.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.110
And EPA converts to
DHA much more readily.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.960
So they've seen a
rise in DHA levels

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.990
from people who just
supplement with algae.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.950
So if you're a
vegetarian or vegan,

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:47.450
be sure to do the
algae form of omega-3s

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.170
because the others
are not going to have

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:50.430
an effect on your brain.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.580
And being a vegetarian, it's
going to hard on your brain.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.510
And I was a vegetarian
for a period of time.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.402
And I think it was
hard on my brain.

00:49:58.402 --> 00:49:59.860
I think you've got
to really go out

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.810
of your way to get the
kind of supplementation

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.120
that you need, that
your brain needs,

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.300
if you're going to be a
vegetarian or a vegan.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.100
AUDIENCE: The bottle says
DHA on the-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.904
It says the algae-based.

00:50:12.904 --> 00:50:13.820
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Yeah.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.700
It has some.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.869
But also, it gets
converted into DHA.

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:17.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.450
So most of that DHA is coming
from the conversion, and not

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.712
necessarily outright?

00:50:22.712 --> 00:50:24.420
BRANT CORTRIGHT: That's
my understanding.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:24.920
Yes.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.930
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:26.846
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Yeah.

00:50:28.669 --> 00:50:29.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:30.700
Thank you so much.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.220
I have a question
about in those studies,

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.289
is there a difference between
genders, female versus male

00:50:36.289 --> 00:50:37.330
in terms of neurogenesis?

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.656
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Mostly, no.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.800
There's some studies
done showing that sex is

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.110
really good for neurogenesis.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:54.450
However, there's a difference
between males and females here.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.540
So for males, it doesn't
make any difference

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.050
how the sex happens.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.410
Neurogenesis increases.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:50:59.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:03.320
But for females, it
turns out that the female

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.950
needs to control the
timing of the sex in order

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.770
for neurogenesis to occur.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.540
Women probably
already know this.

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.510
If the woman is not
in control, it's

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:18.940
not going to have the same
effect in terms of your brain.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.710
If the woman has a
say in the rhythm

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.680
and has some control
in the process,

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.790
then, again, it's
a robust effect.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.210
So men, take note.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.910
RACHAEL O'MEARA: A question
over here, somewhere?

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.017
AUDIENCE: I think the food
cafe is a really good idea.

00:51:41.017 --> 00:51:42.850
Would you be willing
to collaborate on that?

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.590
BRANT CORTRIGHT: I'd
be happy to help.

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:44.423
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:44.423 --> 00:51:46.430
BRANT CORTRIGHT: It'd be fun.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:47.880
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:53.460
This was really great and
very, very interesting.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.666
Especially because a lot of
things that you mentioned,

00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:58.040
I've been practicing
for a while.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.560
And I could really
relate to a lot of things

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.830
that you were saying in myself.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.820
And I'm also very glad
that you mentioned

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.560
the heartfulness
and the mindfulness

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.940
because I seldom hear that.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.980
And I've been practicing the
Sufi meditation for the past 10

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.840
years.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.900
And it actually includes
those two elements.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.660
So that's really
great to see that.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:25.690
My question now is
probably more geared

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:29.490
at the molecular
level in the brain.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.330
Because we know that
the oxygen and glucose

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:39.340
are the only type of sources
for the brain to feed on.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.390
I'm interested in
whether we know

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:47.440
what happens at the molecular
level, that the brain says,

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.520
OK, for example, if I'm
consuming omega-3, that OK,

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.540
this omega-3 now
is coming into me.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:58.980
Now, I know I am
going to, for example,

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.210
create this neuron, where
it's going to be created,

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.760
and what the functionality
of it would be?

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.390
Because obviously
there are many things

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:09.380
with the brain
that we don't know.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.570
And at that level,
how does that happen?

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.495
Do we know that or are we
still in the research process?

00:53:16.495 --> 00:53:18.620
BRANT CORTRIGHT: You're
right at one of the cutting

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.530
edges of brain science here.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.970
The brain can not
only use glucose,

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:29.330
but it can also
use ketone bodies.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:35.020
In fact, neurons burn cleaner
and better on fat, on ketones.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.240
So actually in
terms of brain fuel,

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.930
things like medium-chain
triglycerides, coconut oil,

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.410
is better for the
brain than sugar.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.630
Sugar produces a lot of
other toxic byproducts

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.220
that are not so good.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.570
But when, say, omega-3 comes
in or when the hippocampus

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.090
is producing new brain
cells, along which

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.840
end of the hippocampus
it's being-- it partly

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.980
depends on what is needed,
what is being stimulated.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.426
But also they really
don't know this.

00:54:05.426 --> 00:54:07.550
There's way more that we
don't know about the brain

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:08.690
than we know.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.750
The brain is so complex,
the most complex thing

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.270
in the known universe.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:15.710
And although
neuroscience is kind

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:20.870
of like bursting with new
knowledge at this point,

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:24.430
it's still oversold in
many ways, what we know.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.070
There's kind of a
feeling that neuroscience

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:32.500
is being used to justify just
about any new theory du jour--

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.100
any new-- people can take
neuroscience and kind of run

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:36.960
with it.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.420
So I think we need a very
sort of humble attitude

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.230
when it comes to
looking at this.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.590
And right now, we know that
these new cells, these neurons,

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.330
as they mature,
they get integrated

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:51.150
into the existing circuitry
where they are needed.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:54.620
So it really depends on what is
happening in the environment,

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.770
for the person.

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:57.780
But exactly how it's
happening, that's

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.110
being explored right now.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.110
There's a lot to know about it.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.610
Yeah.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:03.470
It's a great question.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.159
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about sleep.

00:55:05.159 --> 00:55:06.700
So you mentioned
seven or eight hours

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.970
minimum, sleep is important.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.880
Can you talk a little
bit about naps and what

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.970
if I got four hours of sleep
and then I had a couple naps,

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:19.680
or if I had-- oh, up for an
hour and then I go back to bed?

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.450
Is that the same?

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.090
BRANT CORTRIGHT: That's good
for getting through the day.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.220
But it's not going to make up in
terms of the lost neurogenesis.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.680
For that, you really need
more sustained sleep.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.334
Yeah.

00:55:30.334 --> 00:55:31.875
RACHAEL O'MEARA:
Any other questions?

00:55:31.875 --> 00:55:33.861
We got about two more
questions, probably.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.350
AUDIENCE: Another
sleep-related question.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:43.530
So are there any studies that
show the actual dream time

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:46.480
that you have during your sleep
time is affecting neurogenesis

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.450
or not?

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.210
Because for mental
health, dream time

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.560
seems to be very important.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.500
And there's lots of,
like, alcohol or lots

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.610
of chemicals that actually
reduce your dream time.

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.400
And you might think
you sleep enough time.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.900
But actually, it's
not good for you.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.410
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Yeah.

00:55:59.410 --> 00:55:59.910
Yeah.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:01.380
It's a good question.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:05.410
I don't think they know
exactly which parts of sleep

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:07.080
are most critical.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.410
Clearly, dreaming
is hugely important

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:14.910
for memory consolidation, hugely
important just for functioning.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:19.540
We go psychotic if we
don't have enough dreams.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:24.860
But it seems like this
deep cleansing of the brain

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.045
happens both during REM sleep,
as well as non-REM sleep

00:56:29.045 --> 00:56:31.372
as well.

00:56:31.372 --> 00:56:32.330
That's a good question.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:33.919
I'm not entirely sure.

00:56:33.919 --> 00:56:34.835
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:35.640
One more question?

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.650
Anyone have one, one more?

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.580
AUDIENCE: So more of a
physiological question.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.940
So you talk about
having two hippocampi.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.560
Is there a reason
why people usually

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.960
refer to the hippocampus as a
single section of the brain?

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.840
Are there any studies as far
as symmetry is concerned?

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.162
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Yeah.

00:56:56.162 --> 00:56:56.870
I don't know why.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.620
You'd think that to be more
precise, they would say both.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.740
But it's just the tradition is
to talk about the hippocampus.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.500
And they each interface,
like with emotion differently

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.050
because the right and the
left brain process emotion

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:11.720
differently.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.470
So they have slightly
different functions.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:15.220
But they're basically
doing the same thing

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.752
in the right and left
versions of those things.

00:57:18.752 --> 00:57:19.585
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:21.812 --> 00:57:22.770
RACHAEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.444
Well, thanks Dr. Cortright.

00:57:24.444 --> 00:57:25.110
It's been great.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.401
BRANT CORTRIGHT: Thank you all.

00:57:26.401 --> 00:57:27.270
I appreciate this.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.270
RACHAEL O'MEARA: And there
are still some books.

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:30.020
[APPLAUSE]
