PRESENTER: Hello.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome to Google Los Angeles.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.410
And for those of you watching
on our Talks at Google

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.280
channel, welcome.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.730
We're very pleased to welcome
Jeff Potter, author of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.430
"Cooking for Geeks," who will
be running some experiments

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.480
today that will involve
all of you.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.890
A little bit about Jeff.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.240
Jeff's background is computer
science and art.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.620
He's working as a software
engineer, or has worked as a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.890
software engineer, and--

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.750
JEFF POTTER: Still am.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.700
PRESENTER: Still are.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.680
And is currently working for a
startup, which I learned is

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.820
based here in West Hollywood,
or the LA area, even though

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.700
Jeff lives on the East Coast.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.050
He'll tell us a bit more
about the connection

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.900
between geeks and food.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.170
But I'll hand the floor over
to him, and I ask you to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.350
please welcome Jeff Potter.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.490
JEFF POTTER: So thanks so
much for that very kind

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.730
introduction.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.000
So yeah.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.050
My background is computer
science, and I ended up

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.670
writing this book a few years
ago after being at

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.880
one of the Foo Camps.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.280
Not food, but Foo,
as in O'Reilly.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.960
And one thing led to another,
and here I am, still geeking

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.180
out over food and having
a good time with it.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.660
So today, I'm going to
really talk about

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.650
two different things.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.960
The first half of this is going
to be basic food models,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.900
and the second half is
going to involve that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.780
tray in front of you.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.370
So when it comes to food, it's
always fun to ask people what

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.150
they think happens
when they cook.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.950
So given a lump of cookie dough,
you put in your oven,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.570
what happens?

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.200
You get fatter.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.020
That is perhaps true.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.620
What else happens?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.092
AUDIENCE: Heat it applied to
it and it changes the--

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:43.350
AUDIENCE: There's a change
in molecular structure.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.720
JEFF POTTER: Heat is applied
to it, and the molecular

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.600
structure changes
a little bit.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600
Definitely something happens.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.360
I've had people say magic, but
there's a little bit more

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.000
going on here than just cookie
going from raw dough to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.670
magically baked cookie.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.710
So the thing I love about
doing this particular

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.780
experiment is you can do this
at home with a probe

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.290
thermometer really easy.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.030
There's actually a little white
line on the left there.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.850
That's a probe that I stuck into
a lump of cookie dough,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.919
threw it into an oven, and just
started watching what

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.150
happened to the internal
temperature as

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.400
it started to bake.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.160
And around 92 degrees
Fahrenheit,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.180
this begins to happen.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.600
The edge of it begins to
kind of spread out.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.610
And this also is the temperature
at which butter

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.560
begins to melt.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.450
So that's actually kind
of insightful.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.830
You begin to think about the
fact that the food is heating

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.215
up, and certain reactions
are occurring.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:28.180
In this case, butter
is melting.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.520
Then a little bit higher up,
around 212 degrees, the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.000
moisture from the butter and the
egg in it begin to steam

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.030
out and obviously evaporate.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.780
But also, certain starches in
the flours begin to actually

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.790
melt and change their
structure as well.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.950
A little bit hotter, around
310 degrees, the outside

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.970
begins to start turning
light brown.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.395
Any guesses as to what's
happening at this temperature?

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:52.345
AUDIENCE: The sugar
is burning.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:53.300
AUDIENCE: Carmelization.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.220
JEFF POTTER: Caramelization.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.025
It's actually a good guess, but
it's not actually what's

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:56.710
going on here.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.000
This is the Maillard
reaction, which

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.810
begins around 300 degrees.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.750
The Maillard reaction
is a breakdown of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.880
proteins and sugars.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.790
Basically the proteins and the
sugars combine and then break

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.770
and form hundreds of compounds,
some of which are

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.170
brown, some of which taste
really good, and some of

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.240
which, unfortunately,
cause cancer.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.990
And then a little bit hotter,
continuing on the cookie ride

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.760
here, around 350, 360 degrees,
this is where caramelization

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.380
of sucrose begins to really
noticeably occur.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.060
Now, with both of these
temperatures, they're

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.390
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.915
reactions, so it's not like the
water temperature, where

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:30.690
at 212, without anything
else in that water,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.040
it begins to boil.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.500
These reactions kind of pick up
slowly over time, and the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.200
hotter it gets, the
more quickly those

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.080
reactions will occur.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.955
So here's the nice little
visual proof of this.

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.420
This is just a batch of sugar
cookie dough that you just

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.200
bake at various different
temperatures.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.570
And you can actually see there's
this kind of distinct

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.180
point between that 325 degree
temperature and that 375

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.700
degree temperature where the
outside of that cookie begins

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.710
to really turn brown
pretty quickly.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.320
So this is a little more
complicated model than maybe

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.450
you had a minute ago about
cookies making you fat or

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.970
going through molecular
changes.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.180
But it's useful, because you now
know how to set your oven.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.360
You now know if you want those
nice, brown reactions on the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.380
outside, that your environment
has to be at these

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.290
temperatures and be this hot for
those reactions to occur.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.050
And if you don't want those
reactions, you now know you

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.190
need to make sure your
environment does

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.230
not get that hot.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.770
So what does this have to do
with three dead white guys?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.170
In this case, it's Aristotle,
Newton, and Einstein.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.610
And all three of these people
came up with theories and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.840
models about how
gravity works.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.570
Now, the original model,
Aristotle's, was

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.410
really pretty basic.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.090
It just said, things
like to go to their

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.750
natural resting place.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.570
Simple model, but it gives you
some predictive power.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.450
Same way you get up to Newton
and Galileo, and they came up

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.780
with this set of equations that
are still taught in high

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.670
school physics today
about gravity.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.110
But famously, those sets of
equations don't work for

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.680
predicting things like Mercury's
orbit around the sun

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.390
or for GPS calculations.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.810
You really have to get into an
even more advanced model-- in

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.140
this case, Einstein's theory
of general relativity--

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.230
to get a model that's actually
predictive enough to be useful

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.630
for those cases.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.710
So the point here is that you
get better models, you get

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.880
better predictions.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.890
Now, they're also more
complicated models.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.930
The second part of thinking
about science, whether in the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.460
kitchen or elsewhere, is really
understanding that

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.410
science relies on both
data and theory.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.630
So you can have a bunch of
equations, but without some

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.280
data to actually back it up, you
don't really know if those

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.510
equations are particularly
predictive.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.630
And on the flip side of the
pile of data, without any

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.350
equations or model to kind of
explain what the general thing

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.850
is happening there, it's
just the pile of data.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.170
This is definitely
true in cooking.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.630
The example I gave you with the
cookie dough was empirical

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.400
data gathered with the probe
thermometer, but there are

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.670
equations in food as well.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.690
This is how to tell when your
meat is done cooking.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.130
I confess, I don't know
how to read this.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.880
I do know it's a tensor equation
with four different

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.070
variables, and I figure there's
somebody here who can

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.770
explain this to me.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.570
Come up afterward.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.830
Let me know.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.240
But for me, it really is much
more about the empirical side,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.320
which kind of makes
the cooking fun.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.680
Because you can go into the
kitchen and think about what's

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.150
going on here.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.940
What's the model?

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.950
What's happening?

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.910
And a half hour later, gather
enough empirical data to kind

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.760
of fit to see if it actually
makes sense with what you're

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.130
thinking or if you can reject
your hypothesis.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.630
So I'm going to run through a
couple different models over

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.640
the next 10, 15 minutes and
kind of give you a simple

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.820
version and then a more
complicated version, so

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.900
hopefully that the next time you
go into your kitchen, you

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.720
can think to yourself, hey,
what's going on here?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.170
How can make this better?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.900
So in the case of meat, what
happens when you cook meat?

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.740
There's various levels of
doneness, everything from rare

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.870
to well done.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.490
Most people actually prefer
their meat medium rare,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.820
although there are some cultural
biases if you grew up

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.540
in the Midwest and have older
populations in the Midwest,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.100
they'll prefer their meat
more well done.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.960
But in general, people
prefer the texture

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.090
of medium rare meat.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.990
This comes down to actually
different protein structures

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.400
in that meat going through
different reactions at

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.040
different points when
you cook them.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.570
So when you think about cooking
a piece of steak--

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.680
in this case, it's just a steak
tip that I dropped onto

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.340
a really hot cast iron pan--

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.290
you can see there's this
gradient of doneness, and the

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.030
middle of this is completely
rare, and the outside--

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.000
well, the outside,
you can actually

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.250
see, is kind of brown.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.590
That lets you know that that's
the Maillard reaction-- the

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.620
proteins in the meat and
some of the sugars--

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.140
breaking down and
turning brown.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.080
So you know that the outside of
this meat actually got up

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.160
above that 310, 320 degree
temperature.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.030
So in that meat, when it cooks,
different proteins are

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.390
going to denature and change
their structure, change their

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.460
texture, and basically cook
at various different

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.240
temperatures.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.790
And there's really two proteins
that seem to be

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.720
responsible for this.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.900
In the case of something like
steak tip, it's going to be

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.950
myosin and actin, and we happen
to prefer meats where

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.190
one of these--

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.700
myosin--

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.980
is actually cooked and
denatured, and the actin is

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.670
actually still in its
native structure.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.880
There's about maybe a 10 to
20 degree window where

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.800
this seems to occur.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.820
It's between 130 to 150 degrees
Fahrenheit that these

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.690
temperature ranges really end
up being ideal for getting

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.330
that right texture that people
generally prefer.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.800
Now, if you look at other cuts
of meat, there is another

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.890
molecule, another kind of
protein that comes into play.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.880
Any guesses as to what
this would be?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.410
This is collagen.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.430
It's essentially the equivalent

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.850
of steel and concrete.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.980
It gives the muscle
tissue structure.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.590
It's almost like
reinforcement.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.810
If you think about animals like
octopus and squid, they

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.840
don't really have a skeletal
structure.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.659
They have a lot of collagen,
and that's what gives them

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.370
their structure.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.520
Which also, when it comes to
cooking, makes it tough.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.840
So if you think of something
like calamari, where you cook

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.140
it and it's tough, it's because
this particular

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.370
protein is in a state
that, well, is

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.410
technically like a rubber.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.470
And in fact, if you talk to a
material scientist, they'll

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.080
tell you it is a rubber.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.210
Collagen itself, when it
breaks down, is kind of

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:52.690
fascinating.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.210
It's this triple helix structure
that's got lots of

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.100
different bonds holding
the three different

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.800
twisted bits together.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.480
And in its native structure
like this, it's actually

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.320
pretty tender.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.940
When it begins to unwind, the
cross links between the

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.260
different helixes are still
holding it intact, and it's

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.370
like a rubber at that point.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.740
And if you cook it even longer,
it will then hydrolyze

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.520
and completely break down
into little chunks.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.990
So if you think about squid, you
can either cook it really

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.410
quickly or for a really
long time.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.150
But if you get it somewhere in
the middle, it'll be in this

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.300
middle state where it's
denatured, but not actually

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.400
hydrolyzed, and that
makes it tough.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.840
So if you're cooking something
like short ribs or a duck leg,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.490
and it's tough, the
secret to it is

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.760
actually to cook it longer--

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.920
long enough to let it break
down that protein.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.590
So this is a really easy
proof of this.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.050
Grab some short ribs, grab some
barbecue sauce, throw it

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.520
in a slow cooker, and if you
come back two or three hours

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.750
later, it'll be at
temperature.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.640
The myosin and actin will have
gone through their reactions,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.070
but the actual collagen, which
is a much tougher molecule to

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.220
actually go through the chemical
process of breaking

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.120
down, will still be
basically tough.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.580
So throw it in, cover it up with
some sauce, come back a

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.920
few hours later, and you'll
actually have, if you wait

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.060
long enough, an amazing, really
tender beef short rib.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.460
So here's a simple model, and
here's the better model.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.160
The simple model is, well,
follow a recipe.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.506
Cook it to 165.

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:17.970
The better model says, hey,
think about what kind

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.870
of meat this is.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.780
Is it high in collagen?

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.490
Well then, you probably need to
cook it in a cooking method

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.780
that either keeps that collagen
native and not

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.960
denatured at all, in which case,
really fast cooking,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.500
high heat, or you need
to cook it for a long

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.770
time to break it down.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.170
And if it's a low collagen cut
of meat, well, make sure you

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.680
think about the myosin and the
actin and the temperature

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.700
ranges that you're
trying to hit.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.540
Why 165?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.520
Everyone kind of has
heard this forever.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.030
Make sure your chicken or your
turkey is cooked to 165.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.990
AUDIENCE: Kill the bacteria.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.040
JEFF POTTER: Kill
the bacteria.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.400
Yeah.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.660
These guys are not fun.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.040
But unfortunately, the 165
point is higher than the

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.610
temperature point at which the
myosin protein is denatured.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.640
So now you have this
tough problem.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.580
You can either have it be
literally tough, because the

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.870
myosins denature and change the
texture, or you can have

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.600
it be cold enough, but
potentially have a

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.880
problem with this.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.800
This is salmonella.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.960
Bacillus cereus is actually the
highest common pathogen

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.520
that is found in food.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.060
It actually doesn't really live
much above 122 degrees,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.820
but of course, you can be
exposed to high temperatures

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.860
for a short period of time and
still manage to survive.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.210
Same thing with some
of these guys.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.160
So the standard rule that's
actually given in food safety

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.020
stuff is something called the
danger zone rule, and it says,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.570
don't hold foods between 40 and
140 for more than two to

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.360
four hours.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.470
It actually depends on what
state you live in.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.830
The guidelines for Food Safety
are state by state.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.150
I'm not sure about California,
but back on the East Coast, I

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.890
think it's two hours
where I am.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:46.490
So why 140 degrees if the
highest temperature that we

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.970
know from Bacillus cereus
is around 122?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.470
It has a lot to do with the
time at temperature, which

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.970
we'll get into in
a little bit.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.920
Now, you don't have to take
my word for that 140

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.030
degree being OK.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.530
This is actually from the Food
Safety Inspectual Services

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.180
division of the USDA.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.670
They publish charts that say,
hey, if you hold this piece of

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.260
turkey or chicken at this
temperature for this length of

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.030
time, it's sufficiently
pasteurized to be safe.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.060
So this is really actually a
fascinating thing, because it

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.350
means you don't have to cook
your food to 165 if you hold

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.040
your food at whatever
temperature for long enough.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.970
So a little more of a
complicated model.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.420
The complicated model is,
hey, cook it to 165.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.370
This is basically the instant
kill temperature.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.250
At this point, anything that's
there is going to be dead.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.290
But if you want to get a better
texture and really

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.180
think about it, then you need
to hold it at time at

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.810
temperature and properly
pasteurize it.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.250
Eggs.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.210
Eggs are fascinating.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.410
Eggs are actually one of the
best ways to think about food

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.770
science, and I can geek out over
them for quite a while.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.050
There's dozens of different
proteins in eggs, and there's

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.240
this really, really narrow
range between 144 and 158

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.560
where eggs are cooked, but not
hard boiled overcooked.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.990
And when you throw an egg into
a pot of boiling water, it's

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.610
basically going to follow that
blue line in terms of its

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.100
internal temperature.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.160
The blue line is
kind of simple.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.170
There's actually some step
functions where different

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.410
proteins absorb heat and energy,
and it kind of pauses.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.410
But work with me here.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.830
This is the general idea.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.110
You put an egg into boiling
water, it comes from fridge

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.780
temperature, and eventually
reaches that too hot

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.760
temperature.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.190
So what we do is we pull
it out at some point.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.910
We go, hey, I'm going to
poach this egg for

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.210
five to seven minutes.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.930
You pull it out, and there's a
little bit of carryover as the

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.050
outside of the egg is hotter,
and the heat kind of

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.280
penetrates in towards
the center.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.180
But hopefully, you hit it
right, and you get your

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.120
perfect egg.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.630
But what would you do if you
want to cook a perfect egg?

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.100
This is an egg cooked
for two minutes.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.740
Definitely not cooked.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.110
Three minutes, four minutes,
five minutes.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.160
At six or seven minutes, maybe
it's a little bit runny.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.630
Around eight minutes,
that looks like a

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.500
pretty good egg to me.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.780
I personally would
go for that.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.910
You might get a little bit
more well cooked, and

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.080
eventually, around, in this
case, 11 minutes, it's a

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.060
sufficiently hard boiled egg.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.570
But what we're really going
for is something that's in

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.580
that ideal range.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.130
Something that's got the right
texture, where the right

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.230
proteins are denatured and
cooked, and the other ones

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.890
above that aren't actually
set yet.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.570
And there is a way to do this.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.720
And when you do this, you get an
egg that actually has this

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.140
amazing texture, where the white
and the yolk are kind of

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.780
roughly the same texture, and
you can take the egg and just

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.210
crack it, and it kind of falls
out of the shell like that,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.570
which is amazing when you're
cooking brunch for like 100

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.610
people, or doing a demo for 100
people who have eggs in

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.050
front of them that might
be cooked this way.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.280
And as I said, you get
an egg where the

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.300
texture is kind of amazing--

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.850
where the yolk and the white
are just set in a way that,

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.630
after dozens of years of eating
eggs, it's like, wow, a

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.780
new way to cook an egg.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.170
Who would have thought?

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.740
So this is done via a technique
called sous vide,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.130
which is a horrible name.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.360
It means under vacuum in French,
which refers to one

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.540
step when you're cooking
other food this way.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.580
Really, it's ultra precise,
low temperature poaching.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.900
In this case, there's actually
one of these water baths set

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.400
up around the corner for you
guys to look at afterward.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.790
All it is is a water heater with
a little agitator that

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.720
keeps the water moving around
and a thermostat and

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.830
controller that keeps the
water at a very precise

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.040
temperature.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.940
So if you think about that
graph, where I said there was

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.710
that really, really narrow
range, this basically keeps

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.290
the water at that range.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.250
So there's commercial equipment
to do this.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.200
Lab equipment.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.150
This is $1,000 territory.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.950
I bought mine on eBay.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.000
Who knows?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.250
I hope it was clean.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.930
There's consumer stuff,
$400-ish.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.480
It matches the rest of
your stainless steel

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.630
appliance, and it's nice.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.020
You plug in, and it works.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.090
If you're handy, a pair of
wire cutters and a slow

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.980
cooker, you too can MacGyver
your own set up

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.710
for less than $50.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.940
And there are some amazing
reasons you

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.220
might want to do this.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.450
So here's a piece of meat that's
been cooked this way.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.000
You see the piece on the left,
which I showed you a photo of

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.660
earlier, where you have that
center being rare, and as you

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.420
went to the outside,
it got well done.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.310
And then there's a piece on the
right, which is completely

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.860
medium rare, center to edge.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.690
It's just kind of texturally
perfect, the whole thing.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.450
Not this little narrow band,
not the middle-- the whole

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.090
thing is just perfect.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.140
You'll also notice that the
outside has no branding

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.160
reaction on it.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.810
So you know the outside didn't
get up above that 320ish

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.355
degree temperature.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.580
There's no Maillard reaction on
it, which is another clue

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.680
that it's actually
cooked this way.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.900
When you do cook this way, by
the way, what you normally do

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.510
is separate the two steps of
internal temperature and

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.360
external temperature.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.320
You would cook it sous vide,
then you would take it and

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.910
drop in the pan for just a few
seconds to get the outside

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.590
nice and browned without cooking
it that much further.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.800
So the simple cooking model,
A, cook food for a certain

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.810
amount of time.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.120
But the better cooking model
is, hey, think about what

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.900
temperature you're trying to
get to, think about the

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.800
reactions that occur at those
temperatures, and then figure

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.150
out how to get an environment
where the food is going to

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.220
come up to that temperature or
down to that temperature in a

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.010
controlled way that's safe.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.550
Really, here, though, the key
insight is that temperature is

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.930
way more important than time.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.400
Time is just a proxy
for temperature.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.579
So here's a handy dandy chart
of almost everything I just

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.830
threw at you in terms
of temperatures.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.740
It's kind of amazing that most
things happen in what's

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.670
actually a relatively narrow
range of temperatures.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.310
If you think about wet
cooking methods--

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.319
these are things like steaming,
boiling, anything

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.859
that really involves water--
they're all things that

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.790
happen, obviously, below the
temperature at which water is

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.560
able to turn to steam, and those
reactions, those cooking

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.750
methods, will not get the
reactions that occur at higher

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.880
temperatures on this graph.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.070
So these are better models.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.100
They're not perfect models.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.070
And the reason for this is that,
in theory, the model

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.490
describes a perfect world, but
in reality, it's got some sort

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.770
of error bar on it.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.920
Our better model's got a smaller
error bar, but it's

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.750
still a model, and so take
everything I said with some

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.850
small grain of salt, pardon
the food pun.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.940
There are exceptions to all
these rules, but at the same

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.520
time, all models are wrong,
some models are useful.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.660
Having a better model at this
point will hopefully help you

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.120
when you go into the kitchen
to actually cook something.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.040
So I showed you this
graph a minute ago.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.530
It's always fun to think
about the extremes--

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.240
what happens if you
go way, way hot?

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.600
Of course, this is where my
background in computer

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.320
science comes out.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.740
It's like, well, what happens
if we go this high?

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.630
AUDIENCE: Pizza.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.840
JEFF POTTER: Pizza.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.160
Yeah.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.540
Exactly.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.770
Actually, pizza works incredibly
well, because it's

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.500
very, very thin, and so you
don't have to wait a very long

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.930
for the whole thing to
come to temperature.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.770
This is my old oven back
on the East Coast.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.510
I just followed somebody else's
advice and clipped the

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.450
lock so I could open it while
on cleaning cycle.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.020
Let me tell you that 800 degrees
is substantially

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.370
different than 700 degrees.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.830
I cannot put my hand into an 800
degree oven for more than

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.330
like half a second, maybe.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.830
700 degrees, you can
kind of pick up

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.420
the casserole, whatever.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.910
800 degrees is just an
impenetrable wall of hot.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.180
So yeah, you can easily get your
oven up to insanely hot

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.860
temperatures, and you can make
amazingly delicious pizza in

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.440
like 45 seconds.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.980
It's ridiculous.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.210
The downside of it is your
oven is really not

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.830
designed for this.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.930
One of these is the original
pane of glass

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:16.770
on the double wall.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.080
The second piece of material
there is actually something

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.980
called Pyroceram III.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.960
It's quartz crystal.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.510
It's what they used to
use on missile nose

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.810
cones in the 1950s.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.920
It's heat rated to a much
higher temperature.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.210
My oven broke, basically.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.790
I was putting the pizza in one
day, and a little bit of sauce

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.180
fell off the edge of the pizza
and hit the glass, and the

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.990
glass basically went
[EXPLOSION NOISE]

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.790
and broke.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.860
It's truly amazing what you
can buy on the internet.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.000
And thank you guys for making
it really easy for me to go

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.630
and search for Pyroceram
III and get someone

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.570
to custom cut it.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.640
And the irony is, it was cheaper
than the replacement

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.040
part from the manufacturer
of the oven.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.290
What happens if you go
the other direction?

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.820
Ice cream, yeah.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.810
Negative 320 is about the
temperature at which liquid

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.240
nitrogen boils.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.470
I will point out that when you
make ice cream this way, you

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.370
can make delicious ice cream
that you can't make other

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.570
ways, because ethanol doesn't
freeze at standard ice cream

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.180
temperatures.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.820
If you get it cold enough, it
does, and there's enough

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.950
hysteresis in the system where
once it sets, you can then

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:15.900
bring it back up to
a temperature

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.920
that's safe to eat--

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.230
around, say, negative
20 Fahrenheit.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.690
It's kind of amazing when you
can do with a little bit of

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.090
ingenuity and thinking
about what happens.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.440
Some milk, a bottle of Bailey's,
some sugar, throw

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.720
some liquid nitrogen in
it, wait 30 seconds,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.080
and call it a day.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.190
So unfortunately, I don't have
any liquid nitrogen on hand

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.150
today to make you guys some
of this ice cream.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.940
Just take my word for it.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.610
It's really delicious.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.990
I think it's page 349
or something.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.670
There are instructions
in the book.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.680
And I'm in LA every couple of
weeks, so if some people

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.800
wanted to get together and have
some liquid nitrogen,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.780
this could be done.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.460
It is delicious.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.690
Just make sure it's not too
cold, because you actually

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.660
will freeze your mouth,
which is not fun.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.890
The first half of the
talk ends here.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.280
This is the standard, hey, here
are some models of how

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.910
stuff works in the kitchen.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.210
Simple models, simple
predictions, better models,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.810
better predictions.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.960
I would say that three key
takeaways, if you really want

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.010
to remember these three things,
is temperature is more

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.000
important than time.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.400
Think about what the
temperatures are.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.400
310 for Maillard, 350
for caramelization.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.950
Now you know how to set
your oven or pick

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.080
your cooking method.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.440
And then finally, don't overcook
and don't undercook

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.780
your meats.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.120
Getting the right temperature
is actually really important

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.220
to getting really good flavor
and really good texture.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.470
So now we could do the fun
experiments that are in front

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.370
of you guys.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.650
And this is the bit that I have
not had the opportunity

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.910
to do this way in the past,
because Chef Bill here has

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.540
done an amazing job at actually
creating these

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.480
wonderful trays which, for
people who are watching

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.980
online, I'm terribly sorry.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.750
It's not even really easy to set
this up, because you need

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.400
someone else to do it for you.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.510
Otherwise, you know what
the experiments are.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:10.180
So we've got, I think, four
different things here, and

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.930
we're going to start
with the wine one.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.080
So don't actually do any of
these steps until I tell you.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.450
But in the white cup is
this nice blend of

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.220
Syrah Merlot, 2011.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:31.060
It has no description on the
back, but it looks pretty.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.100
Reserve, de--

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.310
I'm sorry, I'm not going to try
to butcher French while

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.580
being recorded.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.380
And in the small plastic up
is a 2012 that's actually

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.480
substantially similar.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.260
And let's see here.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:50.290
It says on the back, "Philosophy
of farming small

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.380
Hillside vineyard sites and
naturally and harmoniously

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.400
with nature.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.570
Made from 25 to 50 year old
vines on the sunny and stony

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.970
slopes of Languedoc." Sorry.
"This wine captures the

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.050
essence of Southern France." So
that's in the plastic cup.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.310
So the question for you is
just to think about what

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.500
you're tasting when you
taste these two, and

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.920
which one you prefer.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.010
So go ahead.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.260
Take a sip.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.670
Maybe let the first one kind of
sit around your mouth for a

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.060
minute and think about
what you're tasting.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.720
And after you've had a chance
to taste the first one, and

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.220
kind of make your mental notes
about it, taste the second one

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.640
and think about what
you're tasting.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.630
Out of curiosity here, can
I get a show of hands?

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.970
And think about which
one you prefer.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.300
Can I get a show of hands of
people who preferred the first

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.380
one in the white cup?

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.722
So I'm going to count
these out.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:55.438
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:23:55.438 --> 00:23:56.880
14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.880
And who preferred
the second one?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.500
The plastic cup?

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.250
Raise your hands high.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:02.950
Don't be shy.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.790
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.160
So what was it?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.850
18 to 11?

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.650
OK, I've been horribly rude.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.820
I've tricked you all.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.650
A few hands are [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.610
Who here couldn't make
their mind up?

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.440
One person.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.320
Oh, that is sad.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.790
So Chef Bill very kindly--

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.550
it was my fault.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.700
He followed my instructions.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.300
I told him to take the two
bottles of wine, pour them

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.890
into a bucket, mix them,
and then pour them

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.700
back into the bottles.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.370
So the two cups are identical.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.360
So what just happened, besides
a whole bunch of really smart

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.790
Google engineers--

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.060
yeah, fell for it.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.380
Sorry.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.040
I'm an engineer, too.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.992
I fell for it, too, the first
time this was done to me.

00:24:45.992 --> 00:24:47.230
AUDIENCE: Smell them.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.310
JEFF POTTER: You can smell
the paper cup.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.950
I have done this with plastic
cups that are red and blue,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.270
where there's no smell
difference.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.700
And people were like, oh,
but things that are

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.120
in red taste better.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.330
There's certainly something
going on here.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.210
Probably the best explanation
I have is actually something

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.300
called taste adaptation.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.040
Your first taste of something
influences what you taste

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.130
after that.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:11.050
So your perception of it is also
not just based on what

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.910
you think going in based on how
I read it, but the fact

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.890
that you hadn't had any
wine before that.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.110
So if you're thinking about
sensory analysis, it's

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.630
actually a lot like thinking
about data

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.710
analysis in any context.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.960
You have to do a proper, good,
controlled experiment.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.720
In the case of something like
this, what would normally be

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.800
done is something called a
triangle test, where you're

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.610
given three samples where one
is different and two are the

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.760
same, and you're asked to pick
out which one of these is

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.000
different from the other two.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.350
At that point, you can do
some pretty good stats.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.930
But if you're just given two
samples and say which one do

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.070
you like better, it's really
hard to figure out, because

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.180
you don't really know based even
on just taste adaptation

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.250
or whatever else is going on
that day why you picked one

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:45.770
over the other.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.870
You can't really describe it
in any sort of quantitative

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.450
way that's useful.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.890
So I find that it's kind of a
fun thing to do to get people

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.730
to think about what you're
sensing, what you're tasting,

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.330
how much of it's actually in the
food, and how much of it

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.220
is in your perception
of the food.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.850
And there's a whole bunch of
studies that have looked at

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.520
red wine versus white wine, or
people who are told that

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.280
they're given a white wine and
a red wine, and the red wine

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.370
is actually the white one
that's been dyed red.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.220
And this study actually comes up
time after time, and it's a

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.050
fascinating one.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.330
Not for the reason that you
might think here in terms of,

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.440
hey, you're being fooled, that
it's white wine versus red

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.530
wine, but the participants are
asked to describe the wine.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.370
And it turns out that what they
found was that people

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.430
describe white wines with
different attitudes than they

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.590
describe red wines.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.840
They actually will taste
them as different.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.650
And I've done this.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.330
You can blindfold people and
give them white wine versus

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.490
red wine, and unless you're out
to really trick them by

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.980
really carefully picking your
wines, you actually can really

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.220
tell white wine versus
red wines.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.030
It's not that hard.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.190
The tannins in red wine
are pretty distinct.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.510
You will pick up on it.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.510
But the way you describe the
wines, we seem to use color as

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.320
part of how we describe flavor,
which is really

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.230
fascinating, actually.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:00.240
So let's go on to the
second one here.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.010
What should we do?

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.100
Well, I guess I was talking
about the eggs.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.550
So we'll go ahead and do
the sous vide egg.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.320
You should all have a cup.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.260
And I promise that's the
last trick, really.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.950
I won't do any more tricks.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.970
And I say that to everybody,
and then I do it again.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.770
But really, that is
the last one.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:21.190
So Chef Bill has kindly cooked
eggs at 63 degrees Celsius for

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.820
an hour, and that's what's
in these guys.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.390
You saw the video earlier of
me cracking an egg on the

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.320
counter, and then basically, it
falling out of the shell.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.670
So basically, just crack
it on your tray.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.860
And feel free to
dump it into--

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.913
I'd probably dump it
into this cup.

00:27:38.913 --> 00:27:41.710
But you'll get a sense of what
one of these eggs looks like.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.840
And there's also some garlic
toast to go along with it, so

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.880
should you like-- kind
of an awesome sound.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.820
The sound of dozens of Google
engineers cracking eggs.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.190
So think about what you're
experiencing here.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.910
I mean, you've got an egg where
the yolk is almost like

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.230
mayonnaise, where it's
kind of pliable.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.500
You can move it around, but
it holds its shape.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.290
The white itself has a couple
of different layers.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.940
Eggs actually have about seven
layers in them, so one of the

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.510
outermost layers has more of a
certain protein that doesn't

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.550
set until a higher temperature,
which is why the

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.980
egg falls out of the shell
when cooked this way.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.870
Maybe some salt and pepper would
be, if you were cooking

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.350
for a bunch of people.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.240
But it's kind of neat to
actually experience an egg

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.980
that's been done in
a different way.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.200
What do you guys think?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.760
I got a thumbs up, and somebody
said it's great.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.010
Another thumbs up.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.910
So there are more of these eggs
cooking out in a water

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.450
bath out there.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.550
You guys are welcome to poke at
it later, and kind of take

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.790
a look, and we'll stand around
and chat about it.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.120
Then let's go on to the
third experiment.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.490
This is a basic fun
taste test.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.000
It's the sort of thing that I
wish someone had done with me

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.850
when I was in sixth grade,
because it was kind of cool to

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.470
do when I was in my 20s.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.690
You'll see that there are 10
different cups in front of

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.340
you, and you also have post
it notes and a pen.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.480
The challenge is to figure out
what those 10 different

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.470
ingredients are.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.960
Now, I will say here if you have
any sort of allergy, you

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.350
should opt out, just
because there are

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.600
potential allergens here.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.850
But if you guys want to poke
through them and write down

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.510
your guesses for
a few minutes--

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.300
and while we're doing that, I'd
be actually happy to take

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.010
questions on anything so far.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.400
So feel free to basically
run through them.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.930
The little cups aren't actually
laid out exactly the

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.880
same on everybody's tray,
so I would start with

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.565
the white cube ones.

00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:58.940
There's two that are kind
of white and cube.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.960
And work your way up a
line and down a line.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.390
And when we go through them,
I'll try to keep it in order,

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.210
but you'll figure out if you've
got them mixed up.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.180
So while you guys are tasting
stuff and writing down your

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.240
guesses, feel free to throw any
questions you've got at me

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.090
so far from all the various
temperatures.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.650
And feel free to consult
your neighbors.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.800
I see a very puzzled look
here in the front.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.160
Which one are you looking at?

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:26.990
That one.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.370
Oh.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.640
That's usually people's
favorite.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.400
It's really good.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.040
We'll come back to this.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.230
So he's referring to the
one that's a kind of

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.440
powdery black stuff.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.615
He's saying, it's really good.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.850
I promise, it's completely
legal.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.225
It is not dirt.

00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:48.750
At least, I wouldn't
characterize it as dirt.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.610
Hey, hush there.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.500
You might think that.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.910
It might not be missing
anything.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.270
That's the real catch.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.660
That's actually a question
for Chef Bill.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.420
Is it the whole product?

00:30:59.420 --> 00:30:59.800
It is.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.770
OK.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.660
Yeah, no, it's not
missing anything.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.060
So it's probably been enough
time you've probably got at

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.020
least a few of them written
down and guessed.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.210
So let's go with
the first one.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.775
These are the large
white squares.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.360
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
actually guessing that.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.270
So it's this one.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:22.970
I don't know if you can see.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.480
It's kind of the large
white cubes.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.554
What did people guess
for this one?

00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:28.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.920
JEFF POTTER: The soft one.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.910
Radishes, one person says.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.430
OK.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.490
Zucchini.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.160
What else do we have?

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.326
Daikon.

00:31:37.326 --> 00:31:39.100
Any other guesses?

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.800
Turnip?

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.406
Did anybody else guess turnip?

00:31:44.406 --> 00:31:45.540
You've got to raise
your hands.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.050
Like, seriously raise
your hands.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.105
So we've got, let's see--

00:31:48.105 --> 00:31:51.212
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:31:51.212 --> 00:31:53.140
Radish is not the same as
turnip, unfortunately.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.480
So six of you got it.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.430
It is indeed turnip.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.760
It's a little more bitter than
I thought turnip would be.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.770
OK, let's go on to
the second one.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.700
This is the smaller
white cubed stuff.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.240
OK, jicama and radish.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.620
What else do we have?

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.210
Watercress?

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.260
Daikon?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.510
It is indeed jicama.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.150
OK, so there's this kind
of white powdery stuff

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.880
that looks like that.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.050
It's almost--

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.000
almonds, macadamia nuts,
what else do we have?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.210
Walnuts?

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.460
Almonds?

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.330
So this is a fascinating
thing.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.430
I'm going to suggest that you
taste this right now and get

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.660
the taste in your mouth.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.280
I had the same thing
happen to me with a

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.060
completely different food.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.260
It was hot dogs versus ham.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.940
And at that point, what I was
tasting was very clearly one,

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.705
and then someone told me what
it was, and as soon as they

00:33:03.705 --> 00:33:05.140
said it, the flavor was there.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.170
It was really interesting.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:07.420
This is actually hazelnut.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.060
And as soon as you hear
that, it's like, yeah.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.530
There's a flavor there, and
you can actually taste.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.780
It takes maybe two or three
seconds in from when you put

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.290
it in your mouth, and then
suddenly, it's hazelnut.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.130
OK, the green one.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.810
Leaves of celery.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.010
Basil, cilantro.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.410
Who here tastes this
as Ivory soap?

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.570
One, two, anyone else?

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.930
Three?

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.870
AUDIENCE: As soon as I tasted
it, I knew what it was.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.630
JEFF POTTER: You knew
what it was.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.880
OK, so it's cilantro.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.940
And cilantro is fascinating,
because about 11% of the

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.220
population, Julia Child actually
included, taste it

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.820
like Ivory soap.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.770
So the three of you that taste
it like Ivory soap, if you

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.610
didn't know before, you now
know that you really don't

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.170
like cilantro.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.150
You probably already
knew, I'm guessing.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.160
And I've got to say, this is the
most green cilantro sample

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.380
I've ever seen.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.160
And I actually asked Chef
Bill, is that natural?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.170
He's like, yeah.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.100
He blanched it, little bit of
salt water, and did an amazing

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.820
job with it.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.780
So, I mean, I'd buy this.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:15.540
OK, then there is this small
little piece of--

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.560
how would you describe that?

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.429
It just kind of looks like
a little smear of--

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.140
so I've got tamarind,
this one.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.183
JEFF POTTER: Yeah.

00:34:26.183 --> 00:34:28.722
You can almost pick
it up and--

00:34:28.722 --> 00:34:30.992
AUDIENCE: It's a little like
beef jerky and [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:30.992 --> 00:34:32.730
JEFF POTTER: Beef
jerky and soft.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.980
Yeah.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.630
Sun dried tomatoes?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.670
Fish paste?

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.639
Raspberry fruit bar?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:51.659
It's really sour, now that I've
eaten the whole thing.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.679
It's tamarind paste.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:54.920
Just tamarind.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.130
OK, there's one that's got a
couple of cubes of this thing.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:04.270
Any guesses?

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.270
I've got one person just
shaking his head.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.520
Corn meal.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.180
Say what?

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.430
Millet?

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.100
Oats?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.230
It's actually polenta.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.080
So whoever guessed corn
meal was pretty close.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.090
I mean, I'd give it to you.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.120
Chef Bill, can you remind me?

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.630
You said there was something
special about where the

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.880
polenta for this came from.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.130
Red flint corn.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.250
OK.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.850
So you've got one that's
got little seeds in it.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.930
Yep, that's caraway.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.510
Chef and I were talking
beforehand, like, he was

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.730
wondering if he should
have ground them up.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.946
And I was like, nah, people
won't necessarily know, but.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.310
It's definitely got
a strong taste.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.300
No mistaking it.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.850
Then let's go for this one.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.650
Almond butter, peanut butter,
cashew butter, sunflower

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.000
seeds, tahini.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.700
It's sunflower seeds.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.515
Now, maybe I should have
suggested you get the taste in

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:21.820
your mouth and then tell you,
but isn't that amazing?

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.130
It's like, you don't know it
beforehand, you have one

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.340
taste, and then you're
told what it is,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.590
and it suddenly becomes--

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.060
OK, two more to go.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.680
This guy.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.930
Kind of the purpleish.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.530
Cherry?

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.780
Did someone say banana?

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.830
Somebody's guessing currant.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.510
Raspberry.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.030
Blackberries.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.280
It is blackberry.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.030
Looks like blood?

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.560
Wow.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.810
Hemoglobin.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.710
I've clearly not been thinking
creatively enough.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.960
Next time I'm here--

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.060
OK, the last one
in these little

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.000
cups, this black powder.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.130
This black powder that somebody

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.930
said was really delicious.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.180
Chocolate cake?

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.660
It is Oreo cookie.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.360
This is Oreo cookie.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.890
It's the whole cookie, cream
filling and all.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:29.910
Yep, the whole thing.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.110
Whole cookie.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.175
Just straight blended.

00:37:31.175 --> 00:37:33.520
Comes out like this.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.980
The amazing thing is, most
people, when I do this taste

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.030
test, they will leave most
of the cups empty,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.370
with food in them.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.220
This cup will be empty, which
is a little scary, if you

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.910
think about it, because it's
the only thing in this list

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.250
that's actually completely
artificial in the sense that

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.460
it's not something you can go
out and pick or dig up.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.965
It's engineered.

00:37:53.965 --> 00:37:58.410
It's engineered for you to like
it, and it works, and

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.390
it's delicious, and it's
not so good for you in

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.050
the sense of health.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.090
I mena, a little bit's fine,
but I wouldn't want to eat

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.520
that every day.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.590
So hopefully, you learned
something about the way that

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.700
you are perceiving flavors
and tastes by not

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.060
knowing what they are.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.980
And we didn't do any
tricks here.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.440
We didn't dye anything.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.150
There was no blindfold.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.540
You actually had a lot of visual
clues about what you

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.610
were experiencing.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:24.325
Imagine if you were blindfolded,
and imagine if

00:38:24.325 --> 00:38:26.360
these things are completely
pureed, and you didn't have

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.190
anything but just odor, and
then after you smelled it,

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.135
were also given a taste
of it and were

00:38:32.135 --> 00:38:33.620
allowed to guess again.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.150
So even without that layer of
information removed, it's

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.640
still kind of fun, and
surprisingly difficult to

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.890
figure out what it
is you're eating.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.690
Two down, two to go.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.910
So let's go for this guy.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.210
There's a little cup that's
got a strip of paper and a

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.270
peppermint candy.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.030
This is a genetic test.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.700
Some of you will taste this one
way, some of you will not

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.280
taste it that way.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.096
Technically, I should tell
you it's a carcinogen.

00:39:05.096 --> 00:39:06.740
It's a really small dosage.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.030
It's fine.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.440
But if you really get freaked
out by that, don't do it.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.460
That's fine.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.140
The peppermint candy is
for if you need it.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.540
You'll know.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.160
So the way this works is
basically, you just put it on

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.680
your tongue and see
what happens.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.030
Whoa, look at all
the colors now.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.418
What's it taste like?

00:39:29.418 --> 00:39:30.730
AUDIENCE: Bitter.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.980
JEFF POTTER: Bitter.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.640
So if it tastes bitter to you,
you're probably going to want

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.140
the peppermint.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:37.590
AUDIENCE: Is it aspirin?

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.460
JEFF POTTER: It's not aspirin.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.640
So what's on here is
a compound called

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.600
phenylthiocarbamide.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.530
PTC for short.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.970
A chemist by the name of Arthur
Fox in the 1930s,

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.440
DuPont researcher, spilled this
on his lab bench, and he

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.110
didn't notice.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.290
And one of his colleagues was
like, whoa, what's that really

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.515
bitter flavor?

00:39:54.515 --> 00:39:57.880
This was way back in the
days before OSHA.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.400
So Fox, like all good
researchers, started giving it

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.970
to people and seeing what
the reaction was.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.260
And what he found is that some
people taste it as really

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.640
bitter, which I'm guessing
was you.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.475
Who actually tasted this as
super bitter and wants to

00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:11.200
punch me right now?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.300
1, 2--

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:12.630
really?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.910
That many?

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.360
Raise your hands high so I
can really get a count.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.480
This is for science.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.570
AUDIENCE: How bitter?

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.530
JEFF POTTER: Like,
really bitter.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.470
There's a middle ground where
it's bitter-ish, but

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.720
you don't hate me.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:30.430
Great.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:34.800
And who just had it taste
like wet news strip?

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.930
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.370
That's actually--

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.030
OK.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:41.632
So the general population, just
on average, 25% taste it

00:40:41.632 --> 00:40:45.440
as really bitter, 50% taste it
as moderately bitter, and 25%

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.396
taste it like me, like
it's a sheet of

00:40:47.396 --> 00:40:48.190
newspaper or something.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.390
Just tastes like nothing.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.790
It turns out phenylthiocarbamide
doesn't

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.310
actually exist naturally, but
it's similar enough to

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.270
compounds that do occur
naturally that if you taste

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.250
this as bitter, you're going to
find things like nicotine

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:02.850
to be more bitter.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.380
Caffeine will be more
bitter to you.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.390
There's classic compounds in
green vegetables called

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.760
glucosolinates that will
taste more bitter.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.445
So if you taste this as bitter,
you're less likely to

00:41:11.445 --> 00:41:12.682
eat green veggies.

00:41:12.682 --> 00:41:13.930
You're laughing here.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.340
You had a question?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.410
AUDIENCE: Is it related
to age at all?

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.270
JEFF POTTER: Is it
related to age?

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.280
JEFF POTTER: There's a
preference for bitterness that

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.720
we actually develop
as we get older.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.010
Younger kids actually prefer
sweeter foods.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.740
There's actually some
correlation with bone growth

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.010
and preference for
sweet stuff.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.350
So if you've got kids,
and they say I want

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.430
desserts, it's science.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.850
I need that.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:38.800
But no, there's nothing
age related to--

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.000
this particular thing is called
super tasting, which is

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.130
kind of a misnomer.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.820
It's just one particular genetic
discriminator that we

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.610
know of in taste.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.240
But it does mean that different
people actually

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.950
taste some kind of foods
in different ways.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:55.230
So if you think about what you
cook, if you think about, say,

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.770
Brussels sprouts, we use salt
to cancel out bitterness.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.846
So if you have something that
tastes bitter to you, you can

00:42:00.846 --> 00:42:01.370
put salt on it.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.510
It actually literally barely
masks the bitterness.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.920
If you taste something that's
more bitter than somebody

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.650
else, you're going to
put more salt on it.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:08.970
So you're actually going
to oversalt it to their

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.020
preference.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.370
So the idea of having a salt
shaker on your table is

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.460
actually not so crazy, because
some people are actually going

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.220
to taste some things as more
bitter than others.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:18.460
Let's see.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.420
The last thing we've got here,
and actually, I might invite

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.010
Chef Bill if he is up for it
to come up and describe a

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.380
little bit more about the
watermelon stuff we've got

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:30.080
going on here, if he
feels like it.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.890
While he's coming up here,
you'll also see you've got two

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:35.250
small cups that have pieces of
beef, and he can actually tell

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.080
us the exact cut of muscle.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.850
One of these is cooked
traditionally, and one of

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:39.850
these is cooked sous vide.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:43.375
So this is really an opportunity
to kind of poke,

00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.990
chew, taste, and see what you
think of the differences of

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.150
the two of them.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.580
CHEF BILL: Yes, so the steak we
have here is teres major,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.540
which is a muscle under
the shoulder group.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.260
JEFF POTTER: Hold the
mic right up.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.170
CHEF BILL: I'm sorry.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.050
It's beef.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.780
So the one that is a
lighter pink color,

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.340
we've cooked sous vide.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.590
134 degrees for 24 hours.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.320
Then just toasted it lightly on
the outside on the grill to

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.360
kind of give it that
grilled flavor.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.690
What it should yield is a nice
tender result, but kind of

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.800
like Jeff was talking about
before, you don't get that

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.590
bull's eye effect.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.030
You don't get the different
layers of color change.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.900
We've got one solid temperature
all the way

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.980
throughout.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.990
So that meat is just the same
from the outside to the

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:23.000
inside, and the only thing we've
done is just grilled the

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.900
outside a little bit.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.530
JEFF POTTER: The flavor of
both of them is amazing.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.480
I'm noticing that the one that's
sous vide cooked is

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.205
definitely more tender.

00:43:29.205 --> 00:43:31.290
I mean, just biting into it
and kind of tugging it.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.570
I mean, we can get a little
more scientific and get a

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.880
spring loaded clamp and start
tearing it apart, but--

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.190
CHEF BILL: Right.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.590
You're doing a good job
with the science.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.290
There's the collagen factor,
we were talking

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.010
about before as well.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.770
The longer we're letting that
go, kind of like the short

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.410
ribs, it gets to a point.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.380
If you taste the other one, it's
gotten to a point quicker

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.940
where you can eat it, like you
were saying, because we've

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.810
just done it on the grill.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.090
We brought it up to the exact
same temperature inside.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.540
But you can see how the color's

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.650
changed all the way through.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.715
And it's oxidized
a little bit.

00:43:56.715 --> 00:43:58.400
It's been sitting
out in the room.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.600
It was just a little bit pink in
the center for our 134, and

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.490
then it got darker on the way
out, because it was cooked all

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.080
the way on the grill.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.910
Again, done enough to eat, but
not necessarily as tender as

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.460
something that's cooked at that
optimal temperature for a

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.770
long period of time.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:13.560
And the watermelon.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.840
JEFF POTTER: Yes, and
the watermelon.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.410
Actually, let's grab the
pack behind you.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.420
So this is--

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.820
we were emailing back and forth
before I showed up here,

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.280
and kind of thinking of what
are some fun things that we

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.240
might be able to show you that
are done, tools and techniques

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.840
that the pros have that are
actually really difficult to

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.880
do at home?

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.770
And compressed watermelon
definitely is.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.720
I actually tried driving
over slices of

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.160
watermelon with a car.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.750
It doesn't work.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.360
CHEF BILL: Jeez, you are hacking
things up, aren't you?

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.940
JEFF POTTER: Well, I didn't have
one of your really handy

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.300
ultra-vacs.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.196
CHEF BILL: I never even
thought about that.

00:44:43.196 --> 00:44:43.470
It's a good idea.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.900
JEFF POTTER: It's pressure,
but it's the wrong kind.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.460
So I don't suggest driving
over watermelons.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.960
Doesn't work out so well.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.400
CHEF BILL: So, yeah.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.860
So the darker one is the one
that we've compressed like

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.380
this in our vacuum
sealer machine.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.290
What we do then is we're drawing
the oxygen out of the

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.190
bag itself and away from the
product, and atmospheric

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.710
pressure, when we seal the
bag, will compress it.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.120
We've gone at 100% vacuum.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.290
So this has taken all
of the oxygen out.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.510
And this is what it looks
like before we cut it.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.590
JEFF POTTER: How thick
was this before?

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:13.680
So right now it's maybe--

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.200
CHEF BILL: That's the
same thickness.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.780
That's the great thing.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.610
We're just drawing out the
oxygen and really compressing

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.476
around the outside.

00:45:19.476 --> 00:45:21.210
The atmosphere is now
pressing on it.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:21.430
You can feel that.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.930
We can pass it around.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.780
JEFF POTTER: Yeah, we'll
pass it around for--

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.760
It's kind of cool.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.560
I mean, I want one
of those at home.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:27.850
CHEF BILL: It is.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.480
So you see it's changed
the composition and

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.390
the texture a bit.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.810
It's burst all the cells inside,
all the oxygen's drawn

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.470
out, but yet, you can
still handle it.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.330
You can still cut it.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.630
It's still the same
shape and size.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.400
Some say that it gets a
little bit sweeter.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.110
I don't know if that's the
color perception thing.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:42.870
I find that it does.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.430
It'll make fruit that's
not quite ripe

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.160
a little bit sweeter.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:46.890
But just kind of fun.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.190
It's a technique we use
around here a lot.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.520
It just really draws
your eye to it.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.960
The traditional one tastes
delicious as well, but you'll

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.820
notice it's got a lot
more water inside.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.570
It's still got all that oxygen,
so it's a very, very

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.222
pale pink instead of
that dark red.

00:46:00.222 --> 00:46:00.720
JEFF POTTER: Awesome.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.050
Thank you.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.400
CHEF BILL: Thank you.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.410
Pleasure.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.860
JEFF POTTER: So I think we've
gone through all the

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.130
experiments that we had
set up for today.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:15.280
I'm totally happy to hang out,
answer questions, eat lunch.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.660
Hopefully it's been fun for you
guys just to think about

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.426
what's going on in food from a
little bit of a science point

00:46:19.426 --> 00:46:22.480
of view, and then think about
the perception of food.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.360
And thank you for
having me here.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.330
So with that, questions,
and whatever else.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.230
AUDIENCE: How did you go about
learning all of these things?

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.420
Because I'm guessing you didn't
know all these things

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.030
at the beginning, so you
decided that you became

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.690
interested in food and kind
of different models.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.240
And how did you go about
discovering all of this stuff?

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.190
I mean, I like to cook,
and like I've never

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.160
seen any of, like--

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.700
I mean, some of this stuff I've
heard of before, but it

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.560
doesn't seem like there's a
wealth of information out

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.630
there about this.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.480
JEFF POTTER: I have a one word
answer, and it's really funny.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.140
AUDIENCE: Google?

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.400
JEFF POTTER: Google.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.250
Thank you.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:00.290
A lot of it comes down to
sitting down and trying to

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.290
understand what's going on.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.030
It might be something as
simple-- and actually, I

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.260
Tweeted out a photo that
someone else took

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.240
earlier this week.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.230
They had made eight different
chocolate chip cookies.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.050
Eggs and chocolate
chip cookies.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.010
They're just easy things
to talk about.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.580
They had made batches of cookies
with too much flour,

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.060
or too much brown sugar versus
white sugar, and they just had

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.250
a visual chart of what happens
if you make cookies with too

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.430
much of any particular
variable thrown off?

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.860
And you just look at it, and
it's a visual proof.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.850
You look and go, oh righ.t my
cookie matches that one.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.560
I now know I'm doing
that bit wrong.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.570
It's a thousand little details
like that you just try to pick

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.080
up and start understanding
what's going on.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.350
For me, my background
is computer science.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.550
It's not food science.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.700
But there's still that science
curiosity in there.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.450
So I approached it with all
the same questions that

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.050
anybody who's not professionally
trained would

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.230
approach it with.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.210
So I don't know, chocolate.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.125
Chocolate's actually
really fascinating.

00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:50.740
Chocolate's incredibly
complicated,

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.860
and people love chocolate.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.810
There's six different point
polymorphs of the cocoa fats

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.760
in chocolate, and they melt
at various temperatures.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.450
You start unwrapping this and
trying to understand what it

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:02.640
means to temper chocolate, and
you look up stuff, and you

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.900
start saying, oh, well, then
this makes sense, but now I

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.360
have this question.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.450
OK, I answered that question,
but then I have this question.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.300
And it just kind of becomes
this journey of trying to

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.770
figure out how does
this thing work?

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.460
How does this thing called,
whether it's making a

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.720
chocolate chip cookie or cooking
a perfect steak.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.080
Like, each little step actually
makes sense, but you

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.030
really have to sit down
and say, what do I

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.790
think is going on here?

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.120
And do either some research on
it and try to figure out what

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.130
other people have
found, or really

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.460
just go into the kitchen.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.360
I mean, a really good
thermometer and a notepad will

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.830
actually get you a lot of
data really easily.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.890
So yeah.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.480
Was that a question or a
scratch of the head?

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:39.780
It's a question.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.280
OK.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.490
Both.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:43.250
And I'm going to grab one thing
out of my bag while you

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.780
do the mic.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.350
AUDIENCE: So I recently
discovered something called

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:49.540
the miracle berry.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.650
JEFF POTTER: Yes, miraculin.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:54.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and I was
curious if you've used it in

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.380
the kitchen.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.760
JEFF POTTER: Yeah, so the
name is definitely--

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.970
they had good PR, right?

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.640
Calling something a miracle
berry is like,

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.340
oh, that sounds amazing.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.580
There's a compound in a
particular berry that's an

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.470
African bush.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.300
The compound's called
miraculin.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.710
It binds to receptors on your
tongue, and it causes sour

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.340
things to register as sweet.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.350
So if you actually just take a
miracle berry and chomp down

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.980
on it and get some of the juices
is on your tongue, they

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.540
make tablets which are actually
a little bit easier

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.660
to work with, because you
don't have to deal with

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.480
shipping berries that go bad,
and tablets, whatever.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.090
So you can then put the
miraculin on your tongue and

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.160
then bite into a lemon, and
it will taste sweet.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.170
I've had friends that had roast
beef, and they said it

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.320
tasted like honey glazed roast
beef, like in a sandwich.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.650
It basically is kind of a neat
trick, if that makes sense.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.690
It's kind of like the cilantro
tasting like

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.320
Ivory soap to you.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.220
There are things in taste and
how we perceive things that,

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.960
genetically, are, how to put--

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.740
kind of cool.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.780
I don't know if miraculin is
anything more than kind of a

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.280
fun thing to do once.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.390
I mean, it's neat to do.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.520
I encourage you to have a little
miracle berry party, as

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.050
they kind of jokingly
call them.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:07.770
Go grab some foods.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.350
There's actually a page
in the book--

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.860
I can send it to you via email--
that has a bunch of

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.760
foods that are just fun
to try it with.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.880
It also alters a little bit of
things-- like Tabasco sauce,

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.830
for example, will taste oddly
sweet, and there's

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.800
some other fun ones.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.810
Keep in mind, thought, that it
doesn't actually the pH of

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.400
whatever you're eating.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.290
So if you just sat down and ate
two whole lemons, you're

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.680
probably not going
to be too happy.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.930
This isn't going to change that,
so don't go off and go,

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.435
oh, lemon, lemon, lemon,
because it's

00:50:33.435 --> 00:50:35.600
not going to be fun.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.400
But yeah, it's a neat
thing to do.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.330
AUDIENCE: So with the natural
food movement, and kind of

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.740
moving toward organicness and
other things like that, have

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:52.010
you, going away from that,
had pushback from anyone?

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.020
Using your scientific method in
a traditional industry, is

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.260
it odd for people to see
this kind of stuff?

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.470
JEFF POTTER: No, I don't
really think so.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.120
I mean, there's a difference
between--

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.170
look, science really is about
building models and

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:08.590
understanding how
things work, and

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.270
that's extremely important.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:12.620
Especially important
in organic farming.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.850
You have to understand how
the system is working.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.250
So if you're looking
at anything like--

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.300
take Polyface farm.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.510
You have to really understand,
if you're in that environment,

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.490
how the ecosystem is working.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:25.280
And the science is
fundamental and

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.020
paramount for that to work.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.080
It is a tool.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.760
Whether you take that tool and
use it to figure out how to

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.520
make a sustainable organic
system, or if you take it to

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:40.230
go and figure out how to make
black powder from the sample,

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.340
one of these things might be
good for you and one of these

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.310
things might not be so good,
depending on how

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.680
much you eat of it.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.025
But from a science point
of view, no.

00:51:48.025 --> 00:51:51.780
There's really zero
tension there.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.810
I mean, you certainly get into
dogma and beliefs about, oh,

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.060
this is what you're
supposed to do.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.760
This is what's really
good for you.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.840
I believe this.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.660
And my response to that is,
well, what's your model?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.020
Let's see the data.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.580
And if the data supports
it, then hey, we've

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.380
both learned something.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.970
If the data disproves it, well,
then I might challenge

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:13.940
the person to think about why
are they believing that?

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.530
And that's, shall we
say, outside the

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:16.850
domain of food science.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.780
PRESENTER: OK, no
more questions.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.850
So thank you, Jeff, very
much for coming.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:22.320
JEFF POTTER: My pleasure.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.570
Thanks.
