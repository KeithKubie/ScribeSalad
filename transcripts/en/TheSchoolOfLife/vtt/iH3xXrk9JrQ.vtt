00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.069
We are never as shy and gauche as we are when
attempting to seduce someone we deeply like.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.240
The thought of someone this perfect coming
to take an interest in us seems at once tantalizing

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.870
and entirely implausible. We develop vertigo
and, too often, fall. Behind our insecurity

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:28.360
lie two conjoined fears: that we are exceptionally
awful. And that the beloved is exceptionally

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.440
perfect. Both ideas are hugely destructive
– and false. However, the road to greater

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.050
confidence about our own nature is not to
start to tell ourselves that we are, after

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.000
all, brilliant. It is to examine more carefully
how brilliant any other human being can plausibly

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.050
be – and conclude that we are no more awful
than the next soul. We are so closely in contact

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.140
with our own ridiculous sides, we cannot – from
within, if we are halfway honest – have

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.400
many illusions about ourselves: every day,
we are made aware of our inherent clumsiness,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.860
error and absurdity. By contrast, we only
ever see the carefully constructed facades

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.970
of everyone else, which is what can make them
seem – quite unfairly – more impressive

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.240
than they in fact are. We shouldn’t try
to reassure ourselves of our own dignity;

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.119
we should grow at peace with the inevitable
nature of our but also everybody else’s

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have
been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.590
again in the future – and that is entirely
normal. There aren’t any other available

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.410
options for a human being. Once we learn to
see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.250
it really doesn’t matter so much if we do
one more thing that might look quite stupid.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.680
The person we try to kiss could indeed think
us ridiculous. But if they did so, it wouldn’t

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.460
be news to us; they would only be confirming
what we had already gracefully accepted in

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.850
our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and
every other person on the earth – are something

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.689
of a nitwit. The risk of trying and failing
would have its sting substantially removed.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:14.629
The fear of humiliation would no longer stalk
us in the shadows. Furthermore, it is properly

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.120
unhelpful ever to think of someone we want
to seduce as particularly special. It is normal,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.209
of course, to be momentarily dazzled by beauty
or intelligence, but we should quickly recover

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.329
our poise and remember that our beloved is,
after all, only human. In other words, that

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.329
behind the alluring facade, once we know them
better, they will have a litany of irritating

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.129
habits, insecurities, obsessions and flaws.
To give us further confidence, if we did kiss

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.670
and even one day marry this person, we’d
almost certainly be quite unhappy a lot of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.909
the time. Our intimidated feelings before
a prospective lover stem from a melodramatic

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.459
sense of how much is at stake. This paragon
will, with time, prove to be a lot more complicated

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.400
than they appear and will at points be plain
heart-wrenchingly maddening. This dark knowledge

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.370
should relax us as we struggle to cross the
room and speak to them: we are not, in fact,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.810
faced with a divine being balancing our fate
entirely in their well-formed hands. They

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.279
are an ordinary creature beset with all the
tensions, compromises and blind spots we know

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:29.029
from our own selves – who will, if everything
goes really well, in substantial ways eventually

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:35.919
ruin our lives. We can approach our date with
the down-to-earth confidence of one misery-inducing

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.019
human reaching out to another to start a relationship
that will, in time, at many points, feel like

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.059
an enormous mistake. We can import into the
seduction phase some of the (usefully relaxing)

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:53.979
ingratitude that we naturally experience once
a relationship has started – and use it

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:59.120
to get love going. We should, before heading
out for the evening, tell oneself that one

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.049
is of course something of a cretin and an
imbecile, but then so are they, and everyone

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.370
else we will meet. One or two more acts of
folly should, thereafter, not seem like they

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.280
matter very much at all

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.960
