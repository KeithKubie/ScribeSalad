DANIEL SIEBURG: Good
afternoon, or good morning,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.387
depending on where
you're joining us from.

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:06.470
My name is Daniel Sieburg.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.459
I work on the Google News Lab.

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.750
We're a team that cares a
lot about the future of media

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.230
and news, fostering
innovation within newsrooms

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.935
around the world.

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:17.310
We have a site
you can check out,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.400
g.co/newslab if you're
interested in more,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
how we work with journalists
and collaborate with them

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.412
on innovative
ideas, and projects,

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:27.370
and all kinds of stuff.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.729
So we're thrilled today to host
a person who probably doesn't

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.460
need an introduction, but I'm
gonna do my best to do that.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.490
And before I do that, I wanna
thank the Talks at Google folks

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.900
for helping put this
together, and for all

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.410
of you for coming to
spend some time today,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.690
and watching on the live stream.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.170
Please start thinking
of some good questions.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.340
And I warn you, they
better be good questions,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.990
because this is a man who
knows what a good question.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.630
But I'm not worried, because I
know that in past experience,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.290
Googlers have some
fantastic questions.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.392
So I encourage you to
start thinking about that.

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:03.600
Maybe you've already got one.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.766
And we'll have folks come
up to the microphones here

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.220
and an ask those as we go on.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.160
So I'm gonna try to
get this right in terms

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.820
of your early days in broadcast.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.966
And as I understand it--

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.840
TED KOPPEL: Historic.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.350
DANIEL SIEBURG: Historic.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.022
OK, sure.

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:21.160
Yes.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.835
As I understand it, you
started in radio with WABC?

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.372
TED KOPPEL: No, it was ABC.

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:28.590
DANIEL SIEBURG: ABC, OK.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
You spent time in Vietnam
as a radio correspondent.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.484
TED KOPPEL: No, I spent time in
Vietnam as a TV correspondent.

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:38.025
DANIEL SIEBURG: TV
correspondent, OK.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:38.990
TED KOPPEL: I spent three years.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.073
DANIEL SIEBURG: Already
getting it wrong, so we'll

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:42.650
try to get that back on track.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.560
You did travel with
Richard Nixon, correct?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.470
TED KOPPEL: I did.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.015
DANIEL SIEBURG: In '72?

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:47.890
TED KOPPEL: To China.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.342
DANIEL SIEBURG: To China.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.490
TED KOPPEL: I actually covered
his campaign for president

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.920
in '68.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.040
DANIEL SIEBURG: OK.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.667
And then "Nightline" was born
in 1980, ran for 25 years.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:04.750
TED KOPPEL: Still running.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.000
DANIEL SIEBURG: Still running.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120
With you at the helm for 25
years out of Washington DC.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.910
You had a chance to interview
I don't know how many

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.110
thousands of guests.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.550
And in the reading
that I was doing,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.510
it grew out of the Iran
hostage crisis, the show did.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.114
So talk to me about the
early stages of what

00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:26.280
the premise of the show was.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.190
I think I wrote down,
when you created the show,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.760
it was all about bringing people
together who were worlds apart.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.250
TED KOPPEL: That was
actually a promotional line

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.080
that someone at ABC
advertising came up with.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.970
And every once in awhile,
someone in promotion

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.070
comes up with a line
that is just perfect.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.470
And the idea, this is back
in the very early days

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.390
of satellite technology.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.620
We're talking about 1979.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.990
Satellites back then
were terribly expensive.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.020
If you wanted to buy 10 minutes
worth of satellite time,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.420
it cost $10,000.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.900
So the idea of bringing people
together who were worlds apart

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.930
is something that
"Nightline" specialized in,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.710
because during the
hostage crisis,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.600
we would have guessed
from Tehran, Moscow,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.020
Washington talking to one
another on live television.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.440
That is so customary and
mundane today that you all

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.600
take it for granted.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.330
We did not.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.070
When I was in Vietnam--
just to give you

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.200
a sense of how far we had come
along-- when I was in Vietnam,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.690
we still used film cameras.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.445
Which meant that when we
shot a story in the field,

00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:56.640
I would write the script for
the piece out in the field.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.950
Then we would have to send
the unprocessed together

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.170
with my script from wherever
we were out in the field back

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.570
to Saigon.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.670
In Saigon, they would put
it on a plane to Tokyo.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.020
Tokyo, it would be trans-shipped
to Los Angeles, Los Angeles

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.660
to New York.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.200
A motorcycle courier
would pick it up at JFK,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.130
and would take it into 7 West
66th Street here in Manhattan.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.100
The film would
then be processed.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.980
The processed film
would then be edited,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.620
married with the narration
that I have done in the field,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.410
and the piece would get on the
air 2 and 1/2 to three days

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.995
after I had done it.

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.620
DANIEL SIEBURG:
Thanks to steam power.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.786
TED KOPPEL: Just about, yes.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.810
So in my professional
lifetime alone,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.160
we have come from
being out in the field

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.830
with a cameraman, a sound
man, film, shipping it back

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.520
to the United States,
having to wait

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.350
two to three days before
you could get it on the air,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.760
to where we are today,
where everything

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.570
is essentially instantaneous.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.600
And when we ultimately
get to the book,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.280
that instantaneous
nature and the manner

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.530
in which it opens
up worlds, but also

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.680
makes us terribly vulnerable
to certain things, that's

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.181
something that we will in a
little while be getting to.

00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.680
DANIEL SIEBURG:
Yeah, and I will get

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.714
into your book, and the
idea that the internet could

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:33.880
be used as a weapon of mass
destruction essentially.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.805
TED KOPPEL: Right.

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:36.680
DANIEL SIEBURG: The book
does come out today.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.350
It's out today.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.695
TED KOPPEL: It is out.

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:40.610
DANIEL SIEBURG: It's available
on Amazon or any other book

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.120
retailer.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.830
And I would love to know,
what got you thinking about it

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.990
that much, because
it's a topic that has

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.307
been talked about quite a bit.

00:05:51.307 --> 00:05:53.640
I would say that obviously
federal and state authorities

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.440
are aware of
something happening,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.280
but this really feels
like the first time

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.950
it's been dug into this deeply,
and perhaps scared people

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.210
as much as it does.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.940
TED KOPPEL: Well, we are
treated almost every day

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.930
to one account or another of
a successful hacking attack.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.120
Whether that's a
hack into a bank,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.800
or into a chain of
stores like Target,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.200
or whether it's hacking
into the personal email

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.020
account of the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.800
as happened just a short
time ago, all of these things

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.060
are either grand larceny,
or in the case of backing

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.840
of the records of 21 and a
half or 22.1 million members

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.280
of the federal workforce going
back any number of years,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.450
a huge vacuuming
our intelligence.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.440
However bad that may be,
and however dangerous

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.140
that may be to the security
of the United States,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:09.140
it doesn't begin to match
the danger of a cyber attack

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.540
against one of our
power grids, which

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.580
has the capability
of taking down

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.580
the electric power for tens
of millions of Americans

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.580
over a period of weeks, months.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.860
One estimate by a group
of 10 former officials,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.540
senior officials, among them
two Secretaries of Defense,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.260
to Directors of Central
Intelligence, two

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.520
of the White House advisers,
national security advisers.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.980
They sent a letter to a
congressional committee warning

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.500
back in 2010 that a cyber
attack on the power grid

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.470
could take out the power
for millions of Americans

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.300
for up to two years.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.610
Imagine for a moment what the
consequences of that would be.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.070
You asked in your
question what it

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.960
was that got me
started on the book.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.910
What got me started on
the book is the fact

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.390
that the President
has been warning

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.890
about this in two of his
State of the Union addresses.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.160
Former Secretary of Defense
Leon Panetta warned about it,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.700
and referred to as potentially
a cyber Pearl Harbor.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.049
Janet Napolitano, as she
retired from her post

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:40.270
as Secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.250
after five years in that
job, warned about it.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.374
And the bottom line was,
nobody has paid any attention.

00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:50.290
DANIEL SIEBURG: Now, why
do you think that is?

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.380
I mean, is it a
bit of human nature

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.759
of waiting until there's some
sort of disaster to respond

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:56.300
to something?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.174
Is it that people don't
understand it enough?

00:08:58.174 --> 00:09:02.800
TED KOPPEL: As a former director
of the NSA, Keither Alexander,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.380
put it to me, he said everybody,
deals with the alligators

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.140
that they're fighting
at the moment.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.790
You got the ISIS alligator.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.060
You got the economy alligator.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.030
You've got the national
debt alligator.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.460
You've got the Syrian
refugees alligator.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.760
So somebody comes along and
says, you know, sir, pardon me,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.400
but it's entirely possible that
a cyber attack on the power

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.850
grid, not only
possible, it's likely.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.950
The chairman of CENTCOM,
the commander of CENTCOM,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.900
a 4 star general by the name
of Lloyd Austin said to me,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.540
it's not a question of if,
it's a question of when.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.190
Once you accept
that-- forgive me.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.380
I'll stop in a moment.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.600
Once you accept that, then you
have to come up with answers.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.360
You have to come
up with solutions.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.440
And quite frankly,
at the moment,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.570
the federal government does
not have either answers

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.195
or solutions.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.150
The great internet
theorist Peter Neumann

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.070
said the internet was never
designed to be defended.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:25.270
And you cannot put defensive
measures on to something like

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.920
the internet, which was
never designed to be defended

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.330
in the first place.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.860
The internet is vulnerable.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.815
And we can get into vulnerable
from whom, if you want to.

00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:38.940
DANIEL SIEBURG: Yeah, I
absolute wanted to do that.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.610
I just wanna dive
into the probability,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.031
and why is there still debate
around whether this is possible

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:45.530
or not?

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.946
Because it seems
like in the book,

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:49.380
you reference a number of
fairly high level officials

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.052
who still say,
well, no, we don't

00:10:51.052 --> 00:10:52.760
think this is possible
because of the way

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.240
the electrical
grid is structured,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.750
and the way that
it's not connected

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.340
to the internet in certain
places of the world.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.970
I just would love to
know your sense of that.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.840
TED KOPPEL: Let me put
it to you this way.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.840
In a large survey that was
done a couple years ago,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.280
the question was raised,
are you absolutely sure

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.960
that President Obama was born
outside the United States?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.160
And I believe it was
39% of respondents

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.790
said they were absolutely
sure that Obama was

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.960
born outside the United States.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.430
My contention is that
in the kind of divided,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.200
partisan country that
we live in today,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.600
convincing all people
of any one thing

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.420
is almost impossible,
no matter how simple.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.120
Take a look at the
issue of climate change.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.840
And again, in a survey they
found that 92% of Democrats

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.630
believe in climate change,
and something like only 17%

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.170
of Republicans believe it.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.280
Well, this shouldn't be
a partisan issue, right?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.480
DANIEL SIEBURG: You make
reference to this in the book,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.780
because you talked about
the media and their role

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.990
in all of this.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.490
What do you think
the responsibility

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.434
is of the media on
an issue like this?

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.350
TED KOPPEL: I think the
media these days-- let

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.570
me put it to you very simply.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.830
When I was young a foreign
correspondent with ABC News,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.290
ABC News had about 35
foreign correspondents

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.200
based around the world.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.760
And when I say based, I
mean living in countries

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.370
that we covered.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.220
Many of us were
required to learn

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.170
the languages of the
country's that we covered.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.190
Over the course of
the past 20 years,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.000
almost all of those
bureaus have been shut down

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.710
for reasons of economy.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.360
Maintaining a foreign bureau
costs a great deal of money,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.620
and the networks, for
example, have discovered

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.220
that the public would
much rather have

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:04.530
news on the Kardashians, on
the state of the weather,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.980
on the state of any number
of things that they can cover

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.080
far less expensively than
sending foreign correspondents

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.480
overseas.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.630
The end result has been that,
I think, the American public,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.080
despite the fact that we have
more information out there

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.210
today than has
ever been available

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.650
before, the degree of certainty
that the consuming public has

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.130
about that information is
frequently guided by whatever

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.790
their partisan point
of view happens to be,

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.770
rather than the kind of
objectivity which existed

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.610
far more about 40 years
ago when you only had three

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.560
networks, and
essentially Americans

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.000
gathered around the flickering
hearth of television

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.960
every evening
about 6:30 or 7:00,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.910
and people like Walter Cronkite,
and David Brinkley, and Chet

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.270
Huntley, and Frank Reynolds,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:05.380
and Howard K Smith were accepted
as being more or less objective

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.240
arbiters of what was
important out there.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.190
Now, for all the
benefits of information

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.370
coming from 1,000
different sources,

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.080
you also have the
attendant uncertainty

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.300
of conflicting
information, and not

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.350
for people not being sure as
to whom to whom they should

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.550
believe, and that belief
factor frequently being

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.710
tied more to the partisan
credentials of the person

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.870
delivering the information
than to their objectivity

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.390
as a journalist.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.090
DANIEL SIEBURG: I
can't promise that we

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.690
can do what you've
asked, but I would

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.000
love you to turn your sights
on Google for a minute,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.870
and think about what should
Google do, or any other tech

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:56.007
company for that matter, as
pertains to this kind of issue?

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.132
TED KOPPEL: Can't help you.

00:14:57.132 --> 00:14:57.923
DANIEL SIEBURG: OK.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.940
TED KOPPEL: I don't know if the
name Will Rogers means anything

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.540
to you.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.910
Any of you remember Will Rogers?

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:13.200
Will Rogers was the Oklahoma
cowboy in the 1920s and '30s.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.580
He was the Jon
Stewart of his day.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.780
He was a very witty,
very wise man.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.770
And one of my favorite quotes
is an old Will Rogers quote

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:28.620
that we are all ignorant,
just about different things.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.580
You're a very smart
bunch of people.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.930
You wouldn't be working
for Google if you weren't.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.150
But there are any number of
things that you know absolutely

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.040
nothing about, and
I am frank to admit

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.130
that I know next to nothing
about what you do here

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.930
at Google.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.740
So I won't presume to tell you.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.823
DANIEL SIEBURG: All right.

00:15:49.022 --> 00:15:54.010
So the book is broken out into
different parts, if you will.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.880
So there's the actual
attack, and what

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.520
might happen in a situation of
trying to retaliate or discover

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.780
where it originated,
and that kind of thing.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.950
There's the idea
of the country not

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.930
at all being prepared for this,
and what is either being done,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:07.764
or not being done.

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:09.680
And then there's the
aftermath, and so as soon

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.940
as the title suggests, it's
very much laid out in that way.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.100
Which pieces of
that were perhaps

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.620
the most shocking or surprising
in terms of what you discovered

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.380
with all of this research?

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.560
TED KOPPEL: Well, I realized
that there was no point

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.020
in writing the book if I
couldn't-- and let me just back

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.090
off and explain to you something
about the nature of being

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.420
a reporter.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.950
Almost by definition,
all the people

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.810
that I tend to cover
on stories that I cover

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.690
know more about that
particular issue than I do.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.980
They are specialists.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.710
I'm a generalist.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.140
And I began the story by
knowing next to nothing

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.040
about the power grid,
knowing next to nothing

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.370
about the manner in which the
power grid could be attacked.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.180
But one of the advantages of
being a journalist in America

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.480
is it gives you the privilege
of going to the smartest

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.670
people in the country
on any given area,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.329
and talking to them at
length about these issues.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.130
So the first thing
that I set out to do

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:20.180
was satisfy myself that the
danger that Leon Panetta had

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.430
spoken of, the danger that
the President referenced,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.650
the danger that those 10
national security leaders had

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.040
referenced in their
letter to Congress,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.210
that was a real danger,
that genuinely existed.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.970
And all I can tell you is
there comes a certain point

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.780
in reporting a story when
you've talked to 20, 30,

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.090
50, 60 people on
the same subject.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.800
And yes, as Daniel
pointed out, there

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.280
was some disagreement,
but not much.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.540
By and large, there is
almost unanimity on the fact

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.270
that the power
grid is vulnerable,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.960
that at least the Chinese
and the Russians have already

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.390
penetrated the power
grid, that they

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:14.590
have what amounts to cyber
landmines planted in the power

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.090
grid, and that they
could, essentially

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.630
with the stroke of
a key, shut down all

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.410
or at least part
of a power grid.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.160
We only have three in the
United States, the Eastern

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.710
Interconnect, which covers
the entire East Coast all

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.600
the way to the Midwest.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.560
Texas has its own power
grid, and then there's

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.810
the West Coast.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.780
If you could knock out
any one of those three,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.310
or even a major portion
of one of those three,

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.200
you would be affecting the
lives of tens of millions

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.870
of Americans.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.560
And the estimate
is that the power

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.850
could be out for weeks, months,
up to a couple of years.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.730
That, it seems to me,
is a significant story.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.500
And so I set out to find
out the other half of that.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.900
What, if anything, has the
federal government done?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.115
And the answer is
essentially nothing.

00:19:15.115 --> 00:19:16.990
DANIEL SIEBURG: And
there's that piece of it.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.989
So there's what the federal
government has done,

00:19:18.989 --> 00:19:21.650
and then on the other side,
the surviving or the aftermath

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.410
part, which is very much in
the hands of the individuals,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.120
in many ways decide
what they would

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.570
choose to do on their own.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.530
And you talk about
what the Mormon

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.291
community has done to prepare
for some scenario like this.

00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:34.790
TED KOPPEL: Yeah,
I spent three days

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.110
in Salt Lake City talking to
the leadership of the Mormon

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.040
Church.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.420
And then they arranged
for me to be shown around

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.070
to make me aware
of the preparations

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.310
that they have made
as individual families

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.710
and as an organized church.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.710
It is amazing.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.440
I don't want to suggest to
you that they've done it

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.250
because they think there's gonna
be an attack on the power grid.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.400
They've done it because Mormons
have been driven from pillar

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.370
to post for the past
200 years, being driven

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:13.720
from New York to Pennsylvania
to Ohio to Illinois, and finally

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.430
out to Salt Lake City.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.660
And it is simply a
part of their ethos

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.860
that they prepare for disaster,
whatever that disaster may be.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.510
Well, they've done it
at the family level.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.130
They have done it at
the community level.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.820
They have done it at
the national level.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.340
They have warehouses
in Salt Lake City that

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.020
would put Walmart to shame.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.150
They have, just to
give you a sense,

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.890
they have their own
trucking company,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:51.350
the Deseret Trucking Company,
all driven by Mormon drivers.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:56.390
And to keep that
trucking company going,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:02.560
they have got reserves of
250,000 gallons of diesel fuel.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.310
They are ready.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.960
I am not saying that what
the Mormon Church has done

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.120
can be duplicated by
other organizations

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.720
around the United States,
but there are some things

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.760
they have done that can be.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:21.330
Every Mormon family is advised,
even instructed-- I mean,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.760
it's not a matter of faith.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.510
You don't have to do it.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.655
But most Mormon
families keep a supply

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:33.410
of three months worth of
food and water in the house,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.550
three months worth.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.030
It's easier to do,
obviously, when

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.130
you live in a rural community.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.840
That kind of thing is very
difficult to do if you live,

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.317
for example, here in New York.

00:21:45.317 --> 00:21:46.900
DANIEL SIEBURG: Well,
I think that was

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.280
exposed most recently with super
storm Sandy, which came ashore.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.750
The power went out, especially
in this neighborhood and south.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.030
And even though it
was only for-- I

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.200
think it was like a day
or a day and a half,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.514
it really shined a light
on how people couldn't

00:22:02.514 --> 00:22:03.930
charge their phones,
couldn't talk

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.597
to anybody they needed to
talk to, get coffee, I mean,

00:22:06.597 --> 00:22:08.930
all these sort of day to day
things we take for granted.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.490
TED KOPPEL: And little things,
for example, like, all right,

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.920
so you're gonna hop in your car.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.336
You're gonna gas
it up, and you're

00:22:14.336 --> 00:22:18.900
gonna drive to the next state
where the electricity is still

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.930
on.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.770
What happened during
super storm Sandy

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.510
is they found that a
lot of gas stations

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.590
couldn't run their
pumps, because there

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.130
was no electricity.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.710
Well, they can turn on the
emergency power generator,

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.380
right?

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.290
Most of them didn't
have generators.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.330
Most of them, to this day,
don't have generators.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.340
I went to my local gas station
in Potomac Maryland, talked

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.793
to the owner, said did
you buy a power generator?

00:22:47.793 --> 00:22:48.292
He said no.

00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:53.060
He said, they're
about 40, $50,000.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.050
And frankly, my lease is
only for another eight years,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.290
and there's no way
that I can envision

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.860
earning all of that money back.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.580
Well, I said, but what
happens if the power goes out?

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.150
Well, if the power goes
out, the power goes out.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.830
I'm out of business.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.220
There is this fatalism about it.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.530
But many of the
assumptions that we

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.480
make, the assumption
that we can just

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.470
drive to a nearby rural state,
and they'll take us in, well,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.510
imagine if what we're
talking about is Manhattan.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:30.180
And you're talking about five,
or six, or 8 million people

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:38.020
leaving Manhattan, and looking
for shelter, food, water,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.540
and it may be that Connecticut
is out, and New Jersey is out,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.580
and Pennsylvania is out,
so you keep on driving.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.420
But when a community is suddenly
inundated by tens of thousands,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.750
hundreds of thousands
of domestic refugees,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.110
if you are just
assuming that they're

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.470
gonna be taken in, I can
tell you-- I can't tell you

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.360
the name of the state,
because the person who

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.230
told me is terrified that the
governor is gonna find out,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:12.840
but a rural state I know of,
not too far from Washington DC,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.770
the Governor called in
the police, the state

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.180
police, the National Guard,
and they set up a plan.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.010
And the plan is when those
refugees from Washington

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.180
come streaming in our direction,
we have them a sandwich,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.790
bottle of water, and a map
to the nearest gas station,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.780
but keep them going.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.072
Tell them they can't stay here.

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.280
DANIEL SIEBURG: This is
analogous to what's happening

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.200
in Syria, I feel like.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.880
It's not quite the
same way, obviously.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.320
TED KOPPEL: You hate to think
that we would have scenes

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:48.010
like that, but if you're dealing
with 5, 10, 15 million people

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.010
who need food, if
your assumption

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.380
is that the state of
New York, for example,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.540
the state of New
York does have meals

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.520
ready to eat by the million.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.640
I don't know how many
million they have,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.200
but I talked to the head of the
Department of Homeland Security

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.610
for the state of New York.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.110
I think he told me
it was something

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.820
like 18 or 20 million.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.030
So let's assume
you're just taking

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.730
care of the residents of
New York City, Manhattan.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.760
8 million people,
18 million MREs.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.260
OK, you're good for
the first three days.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.160
Then what are you gonna do?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.000
And you cannot replace
MRE as quickly.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.950
I mean, the food
has to be grown,

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.550
the food has to be
harvested, and MREs

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.190
expire after five years.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:43.840
So governments are reluctant
to buy large quantities of MREs

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.820
in advance of a
disaster, because they

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.130
figure the MREs are goonna go
past their expiration date.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.550
So there are problems that
very few people have even

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.790
begun to think
about that I believe

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.314
we really need to confront,
and need to deal with.

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:02.980
DANIEL SIEBURG: It
sounds like admitting

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.590
this is an issue is perhaps the
first step, or addressing it.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:11.090
What do you hope would
be the response to this?

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.840
I mean, I'm sure people
will read the book

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.850
and think, oh my gosh.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.022
I can't build a safe house.

00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:17.230
I don't know if I can store
three months of supplies.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.896
And then you've got
government officials

00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:21.120
that seem to be a little
bit all over the place.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.905
What do you hope at least starts
out of something like this?

00:26:23.905 --> 00:26:25.530
TED KOPPEL: Well, I
mean, you're right.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.920
You can't just from
day one to day three

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.830
get three months
worth of supplies.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.830
But you can begin every time
you go shopping every week,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.630
buying a little bit
more than you need.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.675
You can begin to put
enough water into the house

00:26:42.675 --> 00:26:44.300
that least you've
got something that'll

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.020
take you through the
first couple of weeks.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.710
You can begin by looking.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.320
I mean, we have wonderful
portable filtration systems

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.130
right now that would
quite literally allow

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.850
you to take water out of the
East River, or the Hudson

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.020
River, and process
it, and drink it.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.540
If you don't have water,
if the power goes out

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.030
in a place like
Manhattan, it's not

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.520
just that the lights go out.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.610
It's not just that the
heating or cooling goes out.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:18.110
It's not just that you have
no refrigeration or heating

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.290
in the winter.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.880
It's also that you
can't flush the toilets,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.110
because the water
is being pumped,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.700
and the pumps are being
run by electricity.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.980
When the water goes out,
all of a sudden, you've

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.710
got a community of 6,
7, 8 million people,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.040
and there's no waste disposal.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.720
That is a huge health crisis.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.152
These are all issues that
need to be confronted.

00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:46.510
And I'm simply saying
until we acknowledge

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.050
the likelihood of something
like this happening,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.110
we're not gonna begin
coming up with solutions.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.100
And that, if I
understand correctly,

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.560
what people at Google do, coming
up with solutions for problems

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.480
is one of the things
you specialize in.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:05.790
So I would be thrilled
if even a few of you

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.330
took the danger seriously, and
began to approach it, and come

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.662
up with solutions.

00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:14.120
DANIEL SIEBURG: As a society,
we've gotten very comfortable

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.290
in the 21st century.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.541
We don't really think about
all of those convenience.

00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:21.290
We can come back to
the book at any point.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.846
If you'd like, I would
love to just steer you

00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:23.870
in a slightly
different direction.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.710
TED KOPPEL: Any
direction whatsover.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.860
DANIEL SIEBURG: This is a
very open ended question,

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.550
and I apologize.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:33.560
But I would just love to get
your sense of the challenges

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.864
and opportunities for
the future of news.

00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:38.280
I mean, how you see it, both
from a production standpoint,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.220
but from a consumer standpoint.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.900
Are we better informed?

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.320
Do we have more opportunities?

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.620
Is it more confusing?

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.702
Where do you see the
future of news going?

00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:48.410
TED KOPPEL: I think
it is more confusing.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:54.020
I mean, it's almost quaint
today to look back 20 years

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.910
and say, there was a time when
Walter Cronkite, the anchor

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.970
of the CBS Evening News, was
considered to be the most

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.440
trusted man in America.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.780
If I were to say
to you today, just

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.480
yell out the name of
a trusted news figure,

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.590
you'd probably come
up with Jon Stewart

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.260
before you'd come
up with anybody

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.730
who's doing the network news.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:26.040
And the problem when you have
quite literally thousands

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.490
of sources of news is
being able to establish

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:39.050
the veracity of what any one of
these sources is putting out.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.800
And when the way that we tend
to judge these different outlets

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:49.800
is as often not, on a basis
of what their ideology is,

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.840
that's a very iffy way of
establishing what's accurate

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.630
and what's not accurate, what's
reliable and what's unreliable.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.920
It is, I think, one of the
great paradoxes of our time

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:12.750
that we live in an era where
there is more information being

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.620
communicated more quickly
across greater distances

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.960
than ever before in
the history of mankind,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.150
and yet, the American
public as a whole

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.110
does not appear to be
increasingly well informed

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.300
as a consequence of that.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:43.030
In fact, the tendency to hold
onto-- to be so attached to Fox

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.480
on the right or MSNBC on
the left, or Rush Limbaugh,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.950
or whoever it may be
that is putting out

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.590
something that
resonates to the biases

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.290
that the listener or
viewer already harbors.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.900
That's unhealthy.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.770
And I wish I could see the way
clear to finding a path back

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.570
to having some
generally accepted

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.860
sources of objective news.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.170
That's hard to find these days.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.920
DANIEL SIEBURG: I wanna mention
a few people who have either

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.290
been a guest on your show
or in your life in some way,

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.112
and just get your
reaction to them.

00:31:23.112 --> 00:31:25.320
I don't know how you would
describe your relationship

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.860
with this person,
but Henry Kissinger.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.730
What's a conversation
like with him?

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.040
TED KOPPEL: We're friends.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:36.720
I mean, I have known Doctor
Kissinger for 40 years.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.440
I covered his shuttle diplomacy.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.960
I understand the rap on him.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:50.890
I believe him to be a
genuine patriot with some

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.120
of whose policies
I may disagree,

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.800
but I think he tried very hard
to do what he believed to be

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.480
best for the United States.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:05.330
He is to this day-- and I think
he's now 93 or 94 years old.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.660
There are some people,
when you sit down and talk

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.750
to them after about 20 minutes,
your head begins to ache,

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.190
because they're so
far ahead of you.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.520
That is still true of Kissinger.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.530
He is one of the very
smartest people I know.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.819
DANIEL SIEBURG: Morrie Schwartz.

00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:24.985
You can tell the story for
folks who don't know him.

00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:26.359
TED KOPPEL: Sure,
Morrie Schwartz

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:29.670
was a sociology professor
at Brandeis who came down

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.520
with Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.050
And someone in the
Boston Globe did a piece

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.710
on Professor
Schwartz, and the fact

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:43.790
that he had invited his
former students and friends

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.240
to come back and see
him on a regular basis,

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.280
because he just wanted
to talk to them.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.680
And I did a "Nightline" program
on Morrie Schwartz, which

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.460
was seen by a sports
columnist for the-- I

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.420
think it's the
Detroit Free Press.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.950
And he suddenly
realized that I was

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.060
talking about his old sociology
professor at Brandeis.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.720
And he proceeded
to contact Morrie,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.150
and went back to see
him, and then proceeded

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.310
for the rest of Morrie's life
to go to see him every Tuesday.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.720
And that book by Mitch
Albom was known as "Tuesdays

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.800
with Morrie."

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.890
I loved Morrie Schwartz.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.910
I mean, he was just
an extraordinary man.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.370
I'll give you one insight
into Morrie Schwartz.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.010
He was dying, dying of this
terrible, terrible disease,

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:46.280
where all the muscles
atrophy so that first you

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.380
can't move your legs.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.880
Then you can't move your hands,
and then you can't swallow.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.400
And ultimately, you die.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.690
And Morrie said, look.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.360
I know you're gonna have
a memorial service for me

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.700
after I die.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.050
And he said, I won't be here
to see it, so what I wanna do

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.370
is I wanna have a
memorial service for me

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.040
while I'm still alive.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.090
And all of my friends
and relatives can come.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.710
And he did.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.850
He had himself laid down
on the kitchen table

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.830
with a bunch of
lilies on his chest.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:22.210
And his friends just got up, and
started saying wonderful things

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.396
about him.

00:34:23.396 --> 00:34:24.770
And when you think
about it, it's

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.239
actually a hell of a lot nicer.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:30.080
I mean, one of the terrible
things about your funeral

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.719
is you're not gonna be
able to enjoy it, right?

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.850
And Morrie actually
enjoyed his own funeral.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.190
But that book has
now been translated

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.760
into dozens of languages.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.510
It's been turned into
a theater production.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.659
It's been turned into a movie.

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:52.560
And I'm privileged
to have known him.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.230
He was a remarkable man.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.120
DANIEL SIEBURG: Nelson Mandela.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.700
There's a particular interview
you did with him after he

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.970
was released from prison.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.855
TED KOPPEL: It is a matter
of some dispute between Dan

00:35:08.855 --> 00:35:12.170
Rather and me as to which of
us got the first interview

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.960
with Morrie.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.537
But let's say Dan got it, and
I got the second interview.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.720
He is Nelson Mandela.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.360
He is, in some respects
when you think about it,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:33.616
a perfect example of why it
is so hard-- let me back off--

00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:35.490
DANIEL SIEBURG: You can
set the stage of what

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.019
that interview was like too.

00:35:37.019 --> 00:35:39.310
TED KOPPEL: I will, and I'll
tell you in just a moment.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:44.290
If I were to say to you, let's
go back to the 1930s and '40s,

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:49.350
and shout out the names of
some great men and women

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:55.250
without regard to whether it
was a great good or great evil,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.230
you could come up with
Churchill, and Roosevelt,

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.290
and Stalin, and Mao, and Gandhi.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.480
I mean, you can just keep going.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.530
If I were to say to
you today, shout out

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:13.610
the name of the two
or three great people,

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.420
one of the only
names a few years ago

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.000
that you might
have come up with--

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.750
and I'm ready to be astonished
if you start yelling out

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:22.770
some names right now.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:28.120
Please feel free to do so--
one of the few people who

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.610
met that definition
was Nelson Mandela.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.990
And I have a theory about that.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:39.670
Part one of the theory is, yes,
he was a genuinely great man.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:46.000
Anyone who can survive 26
years in a South African prison

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.530
under the worst
days of Apartheid,

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:53.120
and to come out with such
generosity of spirit,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.250
is a truly great man.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.460
But there is another
aspect of that.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:04.020
And that is for 26 years, you
did not see Nelson Mandela.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.560
You did not hear Nelson Mandela.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.600
You did not know what
Nelson Mandela was thinking.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.760
Nelson Mandela was
removed from public view.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.880
And I'm convinced that
one of the reasons

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.760
that we have such a
hard time these days

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.750
coming up with the
name of anybody great

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.210
is that as soon
as someone begins

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.300
to rise to the
level of greatness,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.040
somebody out there does a blog.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.290
Somebody out there you know
reveals some piece of nastiness

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.070
about that man or woman.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.370
And being able to
rise to greatness

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:44.140
in the current atmosphere
of constant 24 hour a day

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.960
surveillance is
almost impossible.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.370
So I think Nelson Mandela--
I believe Nelson Mandela was

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.080
a great man, but I
also think that being

00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.880
out of sight, in prison,
actually helped his

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.890
being perceived as a great man.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.265
DANIEL SIEBURG:
Sure, and I would

00:38:04.265 --> 00:38:06.737
love for you to talk about
that particular interview too.

00:38:06.737 --> 00:38:08.695
I mean, I wouldn't say
that it was contentious.

00:38:08.695 --> 00:38:10.500
That's probably
not the right word.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.169
But it was--

00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:11.960
TED KOPPEL: Or, no.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.580
I think you're thinking
about another--

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.630
I interviewed Nelson Mandela
in William Mandela's backyard

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.414
in Soweto just after he
had come out of prison.

00:38:20.414 --> 00:38:21.830
DANIEL SIEBURG:
Yeah, I'm thinking

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.270
in front of this crowd.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.640
TED KOPPEL: The
contentious interview

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.410
that I did with
Nelson Mandela was

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:32.780
done about 100 blocks uptown.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.310
And I did a town meeting
with Nelson Mandela

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:42.140
here in New York in front of a
largely African-American crowd.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.600
And I started pressing
in on the issue of some

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.300
of his friendships
with the Cubans,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:54.640
and with communists in
Vietnam, and asking him

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.640
about the
appropriateness of that.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.440
And he began by saying,
I think I know better

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.320
than you, Mr. Koppel.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.600
And the crowd erupted.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.690
I mean, people
standing, and cheering,

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.340
and whistling, and
absolutely loving watching

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.586
Nelson Mandela crush me.

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:13.420
I mean, it was a great moment.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.340
DANIEL SIEBURG: It
was a bit of a-- yeah,

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.548
like a bit of a boxing match.

00:39:15.548 --> 00:39:16.740
TED KOPPEL: Absolutey.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.240
He was.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.096
He was a great man.

00:39:18.096 --> 00:39:20.220
DANIEL SIEBURG: I wanna
encourage people to come up

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:20.990
to the microphones too.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.880
If you have questions,
we've got about another--

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.838
TED KOPPEL: And listen,
it's been my experience

00:39:24.838 --> 00:39:26.686
that nobody wants to
ask the first question.

00:39:26.686 --> 00:39:28.060
So let's skip the
first question,

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.690
go right to the second question.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.050
DANIEL SIEBURG: I just
have a couple more for you.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.350
One, I would love to
get a sense of what

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.790
it was like seeing your
daughter Andrea as a journalist.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.430
She was at CNN for many years.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.680
TED KOPPEL: Many years.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.138
DANIEL SIEBURG:
What was that like,

00:39:46.138 --> 00:39:47.470
seeing her too come up from--

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.178
TED KOPPEL: I have to
tell you, my oldest

00:39:49.178 --> 00:39:52.550
daughter Andrea, who now
works for Mercy Corps,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.980
and is now on the side of the
angels, worked for many years

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.300
for CNN.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.120
She speaks fluent
Chinese, so she

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.750
was the Beijing bureau
chief for a while,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.230
and then went to the
State Department,

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.700
and then covered the House.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.970
She wanted desperately to
avoid becoming a journalist.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.500
She hated the idea of
being a journalist.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.490
She went to Beijing
as a business woman,

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.534
and had a miserable time, and
finally came back one day,

00:40:25.534 --> 00:40:27.200
and said, you know,
Dad, the only people

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.240
who seem to be having
any good time at all

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.080
are the journalists.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.920
And I wanna start--
I'm gonna start over.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.740
I wanna be a journalist.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.580
And so I said to her, well,
you gotta learn the trade.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.420
And so she spent a year in South
Carolina working for a National

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.400
Public Radio station.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.370
Then she worked in Baltimore for
about a year, year and a half,

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.200
then went down to Miami.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.380
And then one day,
CNN called and said,

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.620
you know, our
Beijing bureau chief

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.080
is resigning or
moving on, and we need

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.300
someone who speaks Chinese.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.960
And we understand
you speak Chinese.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.340
And so that was the
beginning of that.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.862
And to answer your question,
enormously proud is how I feel.

00:41:08.862 --> 00:41:10.070
DANIEL SIEBURG: That's great.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.736
TED KOPPEL: Sir.

00:41:10.736 --> 00:41:11.916
DANIEL SIEBURG: Yes, please.

00:41:11.916 --> 00:41:13.540
AUDIENCE: First
question is, how do you

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.110
know if the people you talk
to are not exaggerating?

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.260
Because everybody has an agenda.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.140
TED KOPPEL: Yes.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.940
AUDIENCE: And saying
the power grid will

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.970
be down for two years assumes
that everybody will just

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.860
start crying instead of
trying to solve things.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.010
But there are many
technical way of solving

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.260
any technical problem, and
this is a technical problem

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.051
if it would happen.

00:41:34.051 --> 00:41:36.400
So how do you know
that we are not--

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.240
You wrote a book on an
exaggerated disaster.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.230
I'm not saying the
disaster will not

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.700
happen, but maybe to
exaggerated by the situation.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.120
TED KOPPEL: Maybe.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.160
And if that turns out to be
the case, then mea culpa.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:58.820
But I would rather be in a
position of-- first of all,

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.540
I've been a reporter now
for well over 50 years.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.590
If you'll pardon
my crude language,

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.415
I have an excellent
bullshit detector.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.810
It is one of the things
you learn as a journalist.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:19.550
I can usually tell
when I'm being spun.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.350
And when the number
of people that I

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:29.690
talk to at the level of the
people that I spoke to-- I

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.980
mean, you're gonna have
to explain to me what

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.090
possible advantage at
the moment Barack Obama

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.360
can derive from speaking
about the danger of a cyber

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.150
attack against the power grid.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.600
What's his motive
for doing that?

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.290
What advantage does he
derive from doing that?

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.830
Yes, and I write
about it in the book,

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.200
it is possible that people
bring their expertise

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.180
from government, and then they
open up a cyber consulting

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.090
firm, and make a
great deal of money.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:09.850
But you cannot deny the fact
that every single day hundreds

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:15.310
if not thousands of
organizations are being hacked.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.820
That's a reality.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.170
That's not something
that's being made up.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.310
Why do you think that of all
the industries out there,

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.590
the only one that
is immune to hacking

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.650
is the power industry,
particularly when

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.790
the power industry
has been deregulated,

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.100
so that it is not
subject to a great deal

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.470
of federal regulation.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:43.370
Parts of it are not subject
to any federal regulation.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:48.510
There are 3,200
electric power companies

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.250
in this country today.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:55.700
The biggest and the wealthiest
have extraordinary protections

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.140
against hacking.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.050
The smallest and
the poorest do not.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.860
They are all interconnected.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.780
If you hack into one, eventually
if you know what you're doing,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.130
you can get into
the biggest ones.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.100
That's what I spent the
better part of a year doing,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.120
is trying to answer
exactly that question.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.240
You may be right.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.180
I may be wrong.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.110
I don't think so.

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:22.947
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:22.947 --> 00:44:24.030
DANIEL SIEBURG: All right.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.180
We'll go to this side.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.513
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being
here, Mr. Koppel, by the way.

00:44:27.513 --> 00:44:28.810
TED KOPPEL: Thank you.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.780
AUDIENCE: Just concerning
the landscape of journalism,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.450
as you referenced earlier, do
you see any newer outlets that

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:41.650
are a little bit of a light?

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.260
Just for example, anything like
the Young Turks organization

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.620
or Vice News, or anything
that's relatively new,

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.110
do you see any of
that as positive

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.150
and maybe going in
the right direction

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.834
as far as integrity goes?

00:44:55.834 --> 00:44:57.500
TED KOPPEL: Look, I
must confess to you.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.820
I'm not a bit of an old fogey.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.360
I'm an old fogey.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.590
AUDIENCE: You're
the man, Mr. Koppel.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:09.390
TED KOPPEL: I still read
three newspapers a day.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.680
I listen to NPR in the morning.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:19.220
I watch BBC, and CBS,
NBC in the evening.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.820
I do not spend a great
deal of time scanning

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.737
the internet for some
of these smaller outfits

00:45:25.737 --> 00:45:26.820
that you're talking about.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.140
So I'm one of the
least qualified people

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.970
around to comment on
how viable they are.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.530
What is absent in
this country today--

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:44.200
and you see it reflected
in this wild political year

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.110
that we're going
through-- is a sense

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.490
that there are
half a dozen people

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.240
out there, 10 people
out there, 20 people out

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.140
there, in the whom we can have
a little bit of confidence

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:01.390
that they are trying very hard
to be objective reporters.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.240
I don't doubt for
a moment that there

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.030
are some of these
organizations out there.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.840
How many people do they reach?

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.200
Is there anybody
left in America today

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.260
of whom we can
say, yes, Americans

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.510
of all stripes, Republicans
Democrats, liberals,

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.620
conservatives, all turn
to this man or woman,

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.070
and say we have
confidence in that person?

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.030
I don't see those people
out there anymore.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.166
Do you?

00:46:32.166 --> 00:46:33.096
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:46:33.096 --> 00:46:33.720
TED KOPPEL: OK.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.665
AUDIENCE: Hence the question.

00:46:35.665 --> 00:46:36.540
TED KOPPEL: Yes, sir.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.140
DANIEL SIEBURG: Yeah, please.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.110
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious in knowing

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:44.140
what brought this particular
interest in the power grid

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:44.640
to you.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.010
Because I've never heard
about those power grids.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.760
And certainly we all talk
about hacking banks and things

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.990
like that, but what caused
that particular interest

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.625
in investigating more
about a possible attack

00:46:58.625 --> 00:47:00.950
into power grids.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.030
TED KOPPEL: I'll tell you
the whole dirty story.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.970
First of all, I had, as
I said at the outset,

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.700
I had read some of these
extraordinary statements.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.010
I mean, when a sitting
Secretary of Defense

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.200
warns a group of,
I think they were,

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:22.360
defense contractors in a speech
here in New York about a cyber

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:28.820
Pearl Harbor, there is
no more dramatic image

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.390
that an American
official can call up.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.450
So I heard that.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.640
I heard what Janet
Napolitano had to say.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.450
And I saw nothing happening
as a consequence of that.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:44.010
So I was sitting on my porch one
afternoon, looking out, saying,

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:48.760
what the hell would I do if the
power went out, and stayed out?

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.550
We live on a beautiful
piece of property.

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:53.680
We have deer.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.360
We have wild turkey.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.180
So I thought, well, I
could always shoot a deer.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.217
And then I thought,
well, I don't have a gun.

00:48:04.217 --> 00:48:06.050
And then I thought,
well, I could get a gun.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.660
All right, well, would I
get lucky and shoot a deer?

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.970
Fine, let's assume
I can shoot a deer.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.320
Now I have to gut it, and
skin it, and prepare it.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.260
And the more I thought
about it, the more

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.570
I realized that I was
totally unprepared to deal

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.890
without the comforts
of an electric grid.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.590
That's when I got on
the phone and started

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:30.550
calling the Department of
Homeland Security, the Red

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.927
Cross, FEMA, and
saying, well, actually I

00:48:34.927 --> 00:48:36.510
wasn't able to say
anything, because I

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.120
couldn't talk to anyone.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.160
Try it one of these
days, just for fun.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.450
Pick up the phone, and
call the Red Cross,

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.200
and say this idiot Koppel has
just scared the crap out of me,

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.550
and told me that
there's a chance that we

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.110
will be without power
for weeks or even months.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.640
What do I do?

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.410
See if you get an answer.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:59.260
See if you get any
kind of an answer.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.840
I predict you won't.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.194
So that's how it came to be.

00:49:03.194 --> 00:49:04.110
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.760
Did you change your
behavior as a result of--

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.140
did you buy a gun, by the way?

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.780
TED KOPPEL: No, I did not.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.390
I mean, my wife-- somehow I have
a hard time envisioning my wife

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:17.090
and me cradling a
couple of shotguns,

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.930
waiting for the starving
hordes to come up and--

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:24.070
AUDIENCE: But did you yourself
find ways in your life

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.570
to accommodate something?

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.320
TED KOPPEL: Yes.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.950
I mean, as I say,
we live in an area

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.950
where the power goes out a
lot, so we have generators.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.200
We have a couple of
large generators.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.760
I did, because of what I told
you about meals ready to eat,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.450
and the fact that they're only
good for, like, five years,

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:46.160
I have now bought
for my wife and me,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.990
and for our children
and grandchildren,

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:53.530
freeze dried food sufficient
to last for a couple of months.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.160
And we will have
water in the house

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.720
sufficient to last for
a couple of months.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.740
Am I putting up barbed wire
fences or hiring some ex-SEALs?

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:07.680
No.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.390
But I will tell you, there
are people here in New York

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.610
who have done just that.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.590
I know of one family
that hired a SEAL.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:19.700
They have a boat that is moored
in somewhere on the Hudson.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.660
And if and when this happens,
they plan to get on that boat,

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.760
take it out to a larger boat
that is moored away offshore,

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.300
and then go to one
of the islands.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.840
But that's the kind of
thing that only the very

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.200
wealthy and psychotic can do.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.116
DANIEL SIEBURG: That's
a lethal combination,

00:50:39.116 --> 00:50:40.070
wealthy and psychotic.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.514
Yes, sir.

00:50:41.514 --> 00:50:42.680
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.013
Going back to the state of
journalism, I was wondering--

00:50:45.013 --> 00:50:45.970
TED KOPPEL: I'm sorry.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.510
AUDIENCE: Going back to
the state of journalism,

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.320
I was wondering if
you could give us

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.340
your perspective on the
perception I have and I think

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:59.640
a lot of people have that the
media has come to not challenge

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.590
public figures as much as they
used to about things they say

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.970
in the interest of
being balanced, instead

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:11.800
of challenging what
sometimes are fairly obvious

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.711
mistakes of fact.

00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:13.586
So what do you think?

00:51:13.586 --> 00:51:14.660
Have you seen that transition?

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.700
Is that something
you agree with?

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.616
TED KOPPEL: What you're
saying is interesting,

00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:20.160
because on the one
hand, you're right.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.910
And I think your
perception is right.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:28.340
On the other hand, everybody
is being challenged

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:34.280
with a level of vitriol that
has never existed-- well,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.910
I don't want to
say never existed,

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:40.300
but hasn't existed, for example,
in my lifetime experience,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:43.220
by the opposition.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.160
So that when you're listening
to the extreme right talking

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.070
about a Democrat,
or the extreme left

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:54.320
talking about a Republican,
particularly a Tea Party

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.300
Republican-- I mean, you
talk about challenging,

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.570
they challenge every
word that is being said.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.340
But it's dismissed because
it's the political position.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.780
What is missing in journalism
today, I would argue,

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.340
is the sense of
finding people who

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:17.800
are generally accepted
as reasonable people

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.070
with objectivity.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.280
Excuse me.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.700
People who are
reasonably objective,

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:30.640
and whose objectivity
is widely accepted.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:36.450
That, I find, all
but disappearing now.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:39.720
I mean, the only time that
people on the far right

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.800
will accept something
that's in the New York

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.760
Times, for example, is if
it confirms some suspicion

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.180
that they've had to begin with.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.660
But the notion that
there are still

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:56.570
generally acceptable pillars
of journalism out there,

00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:01.760
whose writing or whose
narration is accepted?

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.992
I'm sorry, I think it's missing.

00:53:03.992 --> 00:53:06.200
DANIEL SIEBURG: I will--
just go back to the question

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.987
previously about where
journalism is headed,

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.570
I'll push back a
little bit, and say I

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:16.800
think we've seen some exciting
entities come up, whether it's

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.032
Vice Media, or Vox, or
data driven journalism,

00:53:21.032 --> 00:53:21.990
and that kind of thing.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:25.860
I mean, pushing some of the
ways of telling stories.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.880
TED KOPPEL: Let's take
Vice as an example.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.760
And I agree with you.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.530
And I watch Vice.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.660
And I think Vice has
done some really superb

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.070
investigative journalism.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.390
Terrific.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:43.800
But how many pieces do
they put on the air, right?

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.990
What you had with the
networks in their golden days,

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.360
in the halcyon days,
ironically, you

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.470
didn't have as many
programs as you have today,

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:57.530
but that half hour of
news in the evening

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:01.010
covered a wide, wide
variety of subjects.

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.890
I agree with you.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.280
I think Vice does
some excellent work,

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.660
but the number of subjects that
they're capable of covering

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.360
over the course of a year?

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:11.902
Very limited.

00:54:11.902 --> 00:54:12.776
DANIEL SIEBURG: Sure.

00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:13.510
And you're right.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.780
Audiences are very fractured.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.946
they've got so many choices.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.930
We're pretty much out of time.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.240
So Ted, I know that
you're going to be

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.260
signing some books for folks.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.590
TED KOPPEL: OK.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.890
DANIEL SIEBURG: Last
thing if I can ask you,

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.050
who's doing it right today?

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:32.780
I mean, who's a person that
you admire, who you watch,

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.260
or you see in news?

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.380
An anchor, a
reporter, somebody you

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.865
think is really worth
spending your time with.

00:54:39.865 --> 00:54:41.490
TED KOPPEL: Look, I
think my old friend

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:47.930
Charlie Rose is doing a
terrific job over at CBS.

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:53.095
I think my friends
at the PBS News Hour

00:54:53.095 --> 00:54:58.320
are doing-- years
ago, Robin McNeil,

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.660
who helped begin the
News Hour, said to me,

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.550
we are the program
that dares to be dull.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.636
And I said, Robin, I
think sometimes you're

00:55:09.636 --> 00:55:10.635
a little bit too daring.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.300
We have to find a balance
between being so dry.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.390
I think they're
coming a long way,

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.800
and I'm delighted that
the PBS News Hour is now

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.590
being led by someone who used
to work for me at "Nightline,"

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:34.110
and she is doing a brilliant
job of producing that program.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:36.050
So yes, there are
good people out there.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.065
Gwen Iffil is a
terrific reporter.

00:55:38.065 --> 00:55:41.070
And Judy Woodruff is
terrific reporter.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.620
And they're doing a great job.

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.110
I love NPR.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.180
I really do.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.970
I think NPR, on balance--
a friend of mine

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:57.030
once described NPR as being like
the inside of an intricately

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.970
designed sweater.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.860
You look at the outside,
and it's perfect.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.430
The design is just lovely.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.700
And you pull it back,
and you see all the knots

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.430
and the loose threads.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.660
It's a weird outfit.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.470
It really is.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.132
But what comes out
of there is terrific.

00:56:12.132 --> 00:56:13.840
DANIEL SIEBURG: Well,
we're delighted you

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.180
spent an hour here with us.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.996
So please, everyone,
thanks to you for coming.

00:56:18.996 --> 00:56:21.361
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.486
And if you've got
additional questions,

00:56:26.486 --> 00:56:28.860
I'm sensitive that you have
to get out at a certain time.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.950
This is the start of a cross
country book tour or for you.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.390
But thank you again for coming.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.010
TED KOPPEL: My pleasure.

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.890
Thank you, Daniel.

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.030
DANIEL SIEBURG:
Thank you all too.
