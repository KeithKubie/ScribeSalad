00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One answer is you could just call extend prefix.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We change the order of the arguments around.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That would do the trick. Or you could spell it out explicitly like this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to stick with this because over time we're going to be modifying this function.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to be dealing with complications like

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what happens if you run off the edge of the board,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what happens if you intersect with other letters on the board.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I want to have something that I can customize

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
rather than the extend prefix that we wrote before.
