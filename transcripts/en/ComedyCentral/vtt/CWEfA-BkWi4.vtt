00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.768
People at home know
what a bump is?

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:05.571
probably not everyone
is like Coke no?

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.140
Me too. It's like
when a famous person

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.975
walks into the comedy club
and they get to go on

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.911
before you got bumped
by Jeremy Piven the other night.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:14.047
Oh that's got to hurt.
No it feels good.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.382
Yeah that's does have too like
someone famous in the crowd.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.051
You're like (bleep) them
I do this for me.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.452
And then the second
you see them in there

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.887
and you're like
I'm playing the hits.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.622
Yeah. Like I hope they laugh at
me!

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.825
What's up everybody welcome
stupid questions.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.126
I'm stupid Chris Distefano.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.361
I'm here with my man

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.398
Sam Morrill. What you get
a good bombing story.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.600
I always like to ask comics
a good bombing story.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.304
Man I was in Bridgeport
Connecticut and it's going like

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.706
pretty rough first 20 minutes
or so that's Bridgeport.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.475
Here's a guy
who's just heckling me.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.411
Every other Joe
said Dude shut up.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.748
No one gives a shit about your
stupid additions to my jokes.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.017
Shut Up. Shut your mouth
and he gets up and I'm like

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.685
This is the biggest dude
I've ever seen.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.554
Really started walking
toward the stage

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.557
and I'm like they're not pay me
enough for this so I'm outta
here.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.593
So what do you do.
Walked off stage to boos.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.061
I go in the green room
with a cordless Mike

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.664
I'm still holding the mike
and he's banging on the door.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.732
There's like one woman
there doing security.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.135
He finally leaves.
I go back out

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:11.571
and I do another 30 minutes
and then one guy right

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.541
as I get my rhythm back yells
he's waiting outside for you.

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.110
You know you do a shitty gig

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.846
when you have to plan
an escape route from the stage.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.383
Here's a stupid question what
gives you a bigger sense

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.019
of accomplishment
clipping your fingernails

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.988
or picking your boogers.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.656
Clipping nails.
Because then that means

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.892
that they got long enough
for me to actually.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.528
Yeah I have anxiety.
Bite my nails.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.563
Same. Same what me bite them
off to disgust.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.966
It's not a cool..
it's not a good tock.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.201
Speaking of Tick's there
was a guy just at a comedy club

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.803
and the guy had a tic
who owned the club.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.638
he always says Mamma Mia every
time

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.006
he was like mamma mia! mamma
mia!

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.774
He kept saying Mommy and I
was like what's going on.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.042
He's like oh I have a tick.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.545
I can't control it mamma mia!
and just kept saying mamma mia

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:55.214
and then when he gets drunk
it gets even crazier.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:57.650
You just he can't say anything
but mamma Mia.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:59.118
it'd be great if the doctor fix
it.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.288
Now all I can say
is Mama Mia too

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.925
Oh here's a stupid question if
you could be any vegetable

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.361
What vegetable would you be.
Terri Schiavo.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:14.834
No I would be I would be.
I think I would be a pickle.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.402
You would be a pickle
because they were allowed

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.070
in a lot
of different environments.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.972
They're
a versatile veggie.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.409
Yeah I think I get to be
zucchini or maybe a carrot
yeah carrot

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.745
to kind of they're another
like VIP vegetable.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.447
You'll see him and like drinks.
Yeah. Get him in a cake.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.417

Has anyone ever told you that?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.386
You are really me now.
Yeah I do.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.556
I got ecstasy

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.024
Thanks for doing
stupid question.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.392
Now you get a stupid gift

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.195
because you're special

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.796
I got you multiple gifts.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.464
Most people get one
gift I got you multiple gifts

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.266
because you crush I can't wait
to see this.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.135
Here we go. So we know
you're a big New York Knicks guy

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.369
but they're not a sponsor.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:54.674
So we got you orange shorts
knicks colors and we got
this

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.209

00:02:56.242 --> 00:03:02.315
because you have little baby
bitch hips, um socks that we
got.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.451
These are about 99 cents
for a 30 pack.

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:12.825
We got you a jersey that says
Knicks and Ewing.

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:16.195
But again neither our sponsor
can sue because it's not that.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.097

make you nauseous

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.365
