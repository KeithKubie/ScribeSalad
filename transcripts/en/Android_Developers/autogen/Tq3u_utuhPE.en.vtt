00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 Mandol dm The cold is approaching 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.840
 The developer preview version 6, which was released earlier, 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.830
 I'm driving a Mars test. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.039
 If you have not tested your app yet 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 Why do not you start testing now? 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 Hello I'm Google TV web hard What is CANA YES 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.880
 From now on you will be able to test your app on m Premier Sea 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 I'll also briefly see what new features are available 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 Let's take a look. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.980
 Let's get started right away. M Developer preview skt on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.149
 It contains mlauter device image development document sample code and so on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 Go to the next developer preview site to see all the tools and resources you need 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.270
 can 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.899
 Before you get started, you should have one correct version of skip, especially the fast boot 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 Failure to do so may result in errors when uploading system images. 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 There is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 So let's first look at how to download the m developer's skills. 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.460
 I'll do it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.780
 Developer Preview sk is an Android studio 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 You can download it from 2.3 version impression. 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 Or you have another one for preview version testing 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.990
 Download the latest version of Android stew from the site, especially s 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.909
 wish 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.479
 Next, you need to update your Android droid to version 1.3 or later 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.590
 Open the Preferences or Settings menu and select the update item 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
 Select 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.290
 So that one can receive updates to the Android studio via this channel. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 Select and update app 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.600
 If you run the Android Dio again and enter the update item, 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 Roll also sdk in Korea, you can choose a grass roots channel 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 Press check or button and wait for a while 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.579
 If you choose not to use gsk, the new sk platform and preview version 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 You can install the tools 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.290
 We are almost ready to test the m developer preview version 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.450
 I do not want to skate because g2g has all the sk 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:13.739
 When you create a project, you can select the target sk as m primers, 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 Modify the grades file on the plate so that the scale version entry is not compiled. 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:22.250
 You can set it to mnc. Do not forget the double quotes. 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.360
 Next is the time to prepare the device. If you want to use the emulator 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.470
 You can use mnc x86 system image by avd major 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.790
 There is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.350
 Of course, it would be better to use the actual device than the oliter. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.340
 As you have been told for the first time, 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:45.060
 live69tv r You can upload new direct system image 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.570
 There is one thing to note: 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.990
 All data on that device will be erased 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.760
 Please backup important data in advance. 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.790
 If you are using a Mac or a x or x line 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.930
 You must allow OEMs to unlock 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.170
 Then, after rebooting the device with the boot loader menu via the add command 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.820
 Starts each command without a fast boot oem 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:16.140
 At this time, the device is initialized and all data is deleted. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:21.000
 Go to your system image and execute the script command of flash protection 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.760
 Wait a minute and your device will bootloader baseband firmware and os 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.770
 Will be updated in order 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.270
 I'm finally ready to test the m developer preview version 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:37.050
 As always, upgrading will cause compatibility issues. 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.340
 m as well as the preview version, visit the developer's site at 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:45.480
 You can see the various breaststrokes at a glance 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 Let's look at some of the major changes. 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.070
 Let's start with a summary of the new tribulation request model. 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.150
 If you use an api that requires specific permissions in your app, you 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:01.290
 You will be able to choose whether or not to allow the issue 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.550
 Users will have better control over the behavior of their apps, 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.320
 I am worried that the update rate will be lower because of the update c addition. 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.340
 You do not have to. 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.870
 At the same time, however, while the app is still installed, 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.100
 May not exist 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:21.510
 Even if a previous installer is installed, 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:26.700
 You can explicitly choose which permissions to grant 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.250
 So, before you can use features that require specific permissions, 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.110
 Be sure you have it 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.980
 In camera apps, the necessary camera access rights 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:43.080
 If you have the necessary permissions to run, 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:47.970
 You might want to ask the user to accept the permission 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.840
 Autobackup is a hands-on experience for developers. 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.160
 This is a new service that allows you to sell 105 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:00.360
 m If you have built a target, you have 20 megabytes 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.580
 It's free, and your app data automatically shows up on your Google Drive 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.900
 Will be encrypted and stored 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.800
 Of course, you can not back up specific data with additional schema files. 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.180
 You can specify it explicitly or you can not use data backup 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.960
 May be 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.090
 New backup manager adb shell command to test automatic backup function 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.169
 Has been added, and in this version of the amp, regardless of the target sk version of the app, 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.639
 Backup function is activated 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:30.120
 When the version is officially released, the Emmy version is targeted 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.900
 This feature will only be enabled for apps 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.650
 Rose mode and app standby mode both use the device's battery 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.889
 This is a new feature in mParser to optimize 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.909
 The escape means sleeping in the Korean language. 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:50.400
 If the device is not used for some time without any movement, 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:51.779
 In addition, apps that have not been used for a long time after installation will be in standby mode 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.219
 Is activated 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:58.529
 In both states, the system allows your app to use at least 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:01.979
 I will suggest the functionality of your app 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.159
 You may not be able to use the network, 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:09.569
 It can be supported and the device can not be woken up 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.409
 Even under these circumstances, you need to test your app 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.219
 There is 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:17.430
 The following new ad commands have been added 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:22.529
 To test the escape model, the command 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:26.430
 The following commands are available in the app standby mode test lab 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.330
 Added as an add command to test newly added question recognition api 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.589
 It was. 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.939
 You can also use the add finger touch command to enter 10 fingerprint assumptions 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:37.830
 There is 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:41.219
 Please keep your developer feedback a few times before the m version is released. 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.719
 We will release an improved preview version based on 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.039
 And when the platform is stable enough and always works, the full version 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:51.569
 Will be released 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:55.620
 In fact, the first line before final release means this process 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:57.180
 Whenever a new version is updated, sdk and device image 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.899
 Will be updated 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:05.129
 For your own convenience, you can use the 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:06.569
 When you update, the preview of future versions will be automatically updated via ota 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.050
 Will be 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:14.789
 There are many other features in the bundled version 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:17.550
 Test the various features and see how the new apr 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:21.810
 Please check to see if you can improve 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.419
 Join the developer community and use the Issue Tracker to 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.499
 Please forward it to us 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:33.000
 Also, for Korean developers, Google Korea also has mplab related 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:35.580
 Developers and developers can test m version devices directly 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.259
 We also have space available. 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.259
