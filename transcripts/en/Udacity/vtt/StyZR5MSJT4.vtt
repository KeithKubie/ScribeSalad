00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we'll have a couple of quizzes to see that you understand Cipher Feedback Mode.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first question is, how does one decrypt a message encrypted

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
using Cyper Feedback Mode?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here are the choices.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The first choice is we have to go through the blocks backwards,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
XORing out the cipher text from the results of encrypting the X values,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we can compute the X values in reverse order like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The other choice is we do the decryption going forward,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
XORing out the cipher text with encrypted Xi values and updating them

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as we did in the encryption mode.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A third choice is the same as the second choice except instead of using

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the encryption function, we're using the decryption function,

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is the inverse of the encryption function.
