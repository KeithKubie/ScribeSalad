00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
The proportion we should
use here is 20 over x.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.020
Remember, we want to keep
the units consistent.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.010
So here, inches is in the numerator

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.080
which means we want inches to be in
the numerator in this one as well.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.300
And in the original proportion,
days is in the denominator and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.720
so x should be days as
well in the denominator.
