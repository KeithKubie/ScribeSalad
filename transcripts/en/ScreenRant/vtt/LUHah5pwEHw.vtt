00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.059
An actor’s primary job is to convince audiences
that everything they see on screen is authentic.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.571
A good actor does not pretend to be a character
going through scripted actions, they become

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.590
the person and exist naturally.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.200
When it comes to sex scenes the question of
reality and simulation may cause viewer to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.060
ask, “Are they really doing it?”

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.300
Here are 10 Famous Actors who Actually Did
It on screen.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.750
Chloe Sevigny, The Brown Bunny
Writer/Director Vincent Gallo is a controversial

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.730
filmmaker who tends to take advantage of his
position.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.219
His first film Buffalo 66 featured Christina
Ricci in one of her first scantily clad and

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.890
seductive roles after evolving from child
to adult actor.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.480
However, it was 2003’s The Brown Bunny in
which actress Chloe Sevigny enacts fellatio

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.280
on Gallo that really had people talking.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.790
The excruciatingly awkward four minute scene
was fine for Sevigny as she stated she had

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.469
an intimate relationship to Gallo prior to
filming.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.500
&nbsp;It was an unprecedented move considering
Sevigny was becoming a major player of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.930
indie film scene before The Brown Bunny.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.549
Legendary film critic Roger Ebert complained
about the film not because of the salacious

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.570
scene but because of its banality.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.610
Sevigny’s career did not suffer and she
has since become an even bigger star with

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.259
choice film and television roles.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.270
Robert Pattinson, Little Ashes
Robert Pattinson is best known to audiences

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.880
as the sparkly vampire, Edward, from the Twilight
film franchise.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.189
When he isn’t playing the object of a lip-biting
teenager’s affection, the actor likes to

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.930
branch out to small films like Little Ashes.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.010
Little Ashes is a 2008 drama about the life
of artist Salvador Dali.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.810
For a sex scene in the film, Pattinson decided
to pleasure himself on camera to have a realistic

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.810
reaction.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.409
He later regretted the scene claiming it was
such an embarrassing moment in his career

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.720
that he almost quit acting.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.730
He persevered and continued working in spite
of publicly displaying the personal moment.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.909
Divine, Pink Flamingos
John Waters may be one of the most bizarre

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.390
filmmakers in history.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.420
His extreme vision knows no bounds but he
has been able to acquire a cult following

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.330
in the over five decades he has been making
movies.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.030
All of his movies require a warning and an
iron stomach prior to viewing.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.070
One of the strangest and notorious Waters
films is 1972’s Pink Flamingos.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.730
The film stars flamboyant drag queen Divine
and includes many questionable scenes such

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.160
as Divine eating real dog feces.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.750
Just as Pink Flamingos seems to have reached
its unappealing peak, it goes a step further

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.250
with Divine performing fellatio on an actor
who plays her son.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.109
Luckily, the two actors were not actually
related.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.079
The scene is disturbing nonetheless.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.750
John Waters continued to make weird films
like Cry-Baby and Serial Mom but none of them

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.090
compare to the truly off-the-wall Pink Flamingos.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.299
Donald Sutherland with Julie Christie, Don’t
Look Now

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.400
Don’t Look Now is a creepy 1973 thriller
which stars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.050
The film has a vibe similar to Rosemary’s
Baby and tells the story of a couple who travel

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.800
to Italy after losing their daughter.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.310
Soon they meet two women who claim that their
daughter is alive causing chilling events

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.310
to unravel.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.250
Don’t Look Now has a memorable sex scene
between the two stars that was so convincing

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.729
many questioned if the two were engaging in
an unsimulated act.

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.561
A movie producer who was on set while they
were shooting the scene claimed that the scene

00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:28.700
was not the work of movie magic but rather
a genuine act between Sutherland and Christie.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.769
Sutherland denied it years later but the film’s
director and star Christie have decided to

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.430
remain tight lipped on the matter.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.470
Melvin Van Peeples, Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss
Song

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.520
Melvin Van Peeples is a revolutionary filmmaker
who triggered a new era of African American

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.370
focused flicks that were released in the 1970s.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.610
His film Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song
was a solitary project which he wrote, directed,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.680
produced, scored and financed after it was
clear no studio would touch the action thriller.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.480
Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song led the
way for future Blaxploitation films, Shaft

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.580
and Superfly.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.950
Since the film was put together with scotch
tape and a dream, Melvin did his own stunts.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.980
There were also unsimulated sex scenes featured
in the film.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.360
As this was basically Van Peeples pet project,
he and the other actors engaged with one another

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.880
freely which reportedly resulted in a few
sexually transmitted diseases, making the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.660
independent film a memorable experience for
all who were involved.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.000
Peter Sarsgaard with Molly Parker, The Center
of the World

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.010
The 2001 drama The Center of the World stars
Peter Sarsgaard as a dot.com millionaire who

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.790
offers an exotic dancer $10,000 to spend three
days with him.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.220
While the plot sounds similar to Pretty Woman,
the film is much darker and was filmed digitally

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.950
giving it a voyeuristic feel.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.160
The film aroused controversy with its full
frontal nudity and a scene involving a dancer

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.970
penetrating herself with a lollipop.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.480
With that, it became the opinion of many that
the sex scenes between Sargaard and actress

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.030
Molly Parker were also real.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.570
There has been no confirmation to the contrary
and the assumption remains true until otherwise

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.570
stated.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.060
The Center of the World did not suffer for
its graphic scenes but was praised by film

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.160
critics allowing it to be known as a true
arthouse film.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.850
Malcolm McDowell, Caligula
The 1979 historical drama Caligula may be

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.130
the most well-known mainstream film to feature
illicit pornographic sexual acts.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.380
The film stars a cast of legitimate actors
including Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.440
Peter O'Toole.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.950
Penthouse founder Bob Guccione produced the
film with the intention of having a pornographic

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.780
style film with a big budget, feature-film
quality and seasoned actors.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.450
Caligula does feature many orgy scenes performed
by Penthouse Pets and most of the mainstream

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.310
actors stick to graphic nudity without penetration.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.080
However, Macolm McDowell in the titular role
was not able to get away with faking it on

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080
screen.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.490
Rumor has it there was no faux fornicating
on his part and he truly committed to embodying

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.280
the sinful Roman emperor.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.030
Eric Balfour with Lauren Lee Smith, Lie With
Me

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.920
Canadian actress Lauren Lee Smith has worked
steadily in television and film for years

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.370
most notably as a main character on the Showtime
series The L Word and her brief stint on CSI.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.470
Eric Balfour is an even more recognizable
actor who has popped up in films like 2003’s

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.250
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and television’s
Six Feet Under and Haven.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.250
The two actors have both been around the block
with demanding roles for a while but their

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.080
commitment to acting was tested with the 2005
drama Lie to Me.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.450
The plot revolves around a sexually aggressive
woman who hooks up with an equally aggressive

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.870
man causing explosive situations along the
way.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.700
The drama involved many explicit sex scenes
with the two leads carrying out the scenes

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.930
with actual explicit acts.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.182
Even with the actor’s dedication to graphic
realism by pushing themselves to the limits,

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:43.330
the film was not well received.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.620
Keiran O’ Reilly with Margot Stilley 9 Songs
British Actor Keiran O’ Reilly and American

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.810
Actress Margot Stilley play a young couple
who travel through England in the love story

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.310
9 Songs.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.300
Director Michael Winterbottom has a history
of realism with his filmmaking in movies like

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.520
1999’s Wonderland and 2002’s 24 hour Party
People.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.060
For the film 9 Songs, Winterbottom decided
to bring naturalism through in the way of

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.590
intimate scenes between O’Reilly and Stilley.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.760
The sexual content was majorly controversial
once the film was released in 2004 due to

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.440
multiple instances of the two actors engaging
in one salacious scene after another.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.169
Critics were not impressed by the scenes but
found them unerotic and tedious to watch.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.110
Viewers and critics agreed the film was not
worth the buzz.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.120
Halle Berry with Billy Bob Thornton Monster's
Ball

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.419
The 2001 romantic drama Monster’s Ball spills
over with tremendous performances including

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.050
Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger and Halle
Berry who earned an Academy Award for her

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.050
gritty role.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.710
Thornton plays a former prison guard and Berry
a widowed woman who recently lost her son

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.080
in a tragic accident.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.090
The entire film is one bummer after another
which culminates in a sexual encounter between

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.180
Thornton and Berry after drowning their sorrows
with alcohol.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.470
There was much speculation concerning the
authenticity of the scene.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.240
Berry’s and Thornton’s comments to the
press regarding their mutual attraction may

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.949
have been what sparked speculation.

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:09.710
The two stars did not deny whether the scene
was real but did emphasize the steaminess

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.730
of filming it.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.810
Whether the heated scene was just another
reason Berry deserved Oscar gold, or it was

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.840
legitimate sex between the two, is still unknown.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.230
There’s our list.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.230
What did you think?

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.230
Who did we forget?
