00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.030
The action-packed trailer for DC's Suicide
Squad movie took fans by storm, revealing

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.880
new scenes, new characters, and even more
hard-hitting humor. But it also packed in

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.270
more easter eggs, comic book nods, and hidden
touches that viewers probably missed. We've

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.670
made sure to catch them all, so we hope you
enjoy The Suicide Squad Official Trailer ALL

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.279
EASTER EGGS You Missed.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.279
Bravo

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.099
Viewers were probably more interested in the
characters inside the prison uniforms than

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.910
the writing on them, but the orange uniforms
confirm that the movie's heroes are detainees

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
of "Site Bravo" - apparently the codename
for Bell Reve prison. The name itself doesn't

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.809
reveal a ton about the story, but it explains
why director David Ayer chose the name "Bravo

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.120
14" for the title of the movie while in production.
The 14, well... we're open to theories.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.469
Special Delivery

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.760
While the villains like Deadshot and Harley
Quinn are transported to what looks to be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.800
an army base before their mission, the rabid
Boomerang is a different story. He bursts

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.269
from his sack and into a figh so fast, viewers
might have missed the joke: it was no ordinary

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.140
bag, but an Australia Post mailbag, a nod
to the famous villain's Aussie roots.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.270
Tailcoats

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.630
Whether you're a crazed criminal or not, any
truly formal occasion demands a tuxedo - or

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.590
in this case, a tailcoat - but the white tie
and carnation capping off the look are a clear

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.979
reference to one famous image of Joker and
Harley Quinn, painted by noted comic artist

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.600
Alex Ross.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.840
Mr. Frost

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.660
A single shot of the trailer shows actor Jim
Parrack acting as a hired gun or henchman

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.729
for Joker. But pay attention to the name on
his sleeve, and you'll notice he's no random

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.909
henchman: that's Jonny Frost, the Joker's
right hand man who narrates Brian Azzarello's

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.240
hit "Joker" graphic novel.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.240
Midway

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.860
Keep your eyes peeled as the action of the
trailer unfolds, and you'll catch a few different

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.229
signs that show it's all set in the fictional
location of Midway City (on police car Deadshot's

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.860
jumping over). Loosely based on Chicago, the
DC city is most famous for being the home

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.850
of two Justice League heroes, Hawkman and
Hawkgirl.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.280
Katana's Katana

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.990
Samurai swords are nothing new to fans of
martial arts films or comic books, but the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.259
one wielded by Katana is one of a kind. Known
as the 'Soultaker' sword, the blade has the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.810
mystical ability to absorb every soul whose
life it has ever taken. This one shot reveals

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.760
how the filmmakers will be showing the souls
contained within Soultaker, as spectral skulls

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.540
radiating off of the blade like heat.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.459
If that weren't enough, Katana is also able
to commune with any of the spirits residing

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.540
in her blade. In the trailer, it looks like
she's doing exactly that, with her eyes fading

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.930
from completely white to completely black
to show the link has been made. At least,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.580
we hope that's what we're watching.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.980
Fists of Fury

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.930
Batman has his Batarangs, Catwoman has her
whip, and Deadshot has his wrist-mounted firearms.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.000
Although they began as weapons of imagination
in the pages of DC Comics, the firearms team

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.209
for Suicide Squad has come through with flying
colors, bringing to life one scene that fans

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.810
of the ruthless assassin have been hoping
to see adapted to the big screen for years.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.560
Harley's Rebirth

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.209
Seeing the Joker take&nbsp;another&nbsp;jump into
a vat of chemicals seems pointless, until

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.879
you realize that he's headed in to retrieve
Harley Quinn. The scene perfectly mirrors

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.579
the New 52 origin of Harley, where Joker slowly
manipulated her to his way of thinking, before

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.439
tossing her into the same chemicals that created
his twisted mind, and seeing Harley Quinn

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.379
emerge.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.629
Latin Wisdom

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.410
The last laugh of the trailer goes to Harley
Quinn, who smashes a store window in the middle

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.870
of a suicide mission. But take a closer look
at the mannequin in the store, and you'll

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.860
see the same Latin phrase repeated over and
over: "si vis pacem para bellum." Translated,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.349
the phrase means "if you want peace, prepare
for war." Somehow, we think that the Squad's

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.670
mastermind, Amanda Waller would absolutely
agree.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.810
Those are the easter eggs, secrets and awesome
touches we spotted in the Suicide Squad trailer,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.840
but which ones did we miss? Let us known in
