00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.680
Now that we saw what the main values and practices

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.200
of XP are, I want to go back for a minute

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.800
to discussion of requirements engineering in XP. In XP, user

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.180
requirements are expressed as scenarios or user stories, as we already

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.500
discussed. These are written by customers on cards, and what

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.550
the development team does is to take these cards, take these

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.240
users stories and break them down into implementation tasks. And

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.310
those implementation tasks are then used as a basis for scheduling

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.210
cost estimates. So given these estimates, and based on their priorities,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.770
the customer will choose the stories that will be included in

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.980
the next release, in the next iteration. And at this point,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.220
the corresponding cards will be taken by the developers and the,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.380
the task will be performed, and the relative, and the corresponding

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.350
card will be developed. And just to give an idea of

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.330
the order of magnitude, if you consider a few months project,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.390
there might be 50 to 100 user stories for a project of

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.820
that duration. So, now let me give you an example of what

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.630
the story card might look like, and I'm going to do it using

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.930
a story card for document downloading and you can really do all of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.780
this, basically as seeing what the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.440
scenario is, downloading and printing an article.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.590
And it describes basically what happens when you do that, what is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.530
the scenario. First, you select the article that you want from a displayed

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.760
list. You then have to tell the system how you will pay for

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.680
it. This can either be through a subscription, through a company account or

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.670
by credit card, and so on. So what developers do, they take

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.020
this story card, and they break it down in to development tasks.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.100
So, here I'm showing you some examples of task cards for the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.360
user story that we just saw. In particular I'm showing three task cards

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.740
and if we look at the third one, there is a name

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.260
for the task, which is implement payment collection. So this is the development

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.600
task that we have the perform and here, there's a description of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.240
what that developed code should do. And notice that, you know, the task

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.400
card can even be more. explicit than this, more

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.450
specific than this, and talk about actual development tasks.
