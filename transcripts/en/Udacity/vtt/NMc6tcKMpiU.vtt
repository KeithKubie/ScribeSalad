00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:03.307
Another parallel communication pattern worth mentioning is called transpose.

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:07.343
For example, you might have a 2D array, such as an image laid out in row-major order.

00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:13.802
This means that the elements of the array, or the pixels of the image, are laid out one row at a time.

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:17.332
And I've color-coded the rows here just to show you more clearly what I'm doing.

00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:20.529
But you might want to do some processing on the columns of this image.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.150
And so you'd want a lay out like this.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.748
This means you need to do an operation to reorder the elements.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:27.440
As you can see, I've drawn this as a scatter operation.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.917
So each thread is reading from an adjacent element in the array,

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:35.500
but is writing to someplace scattered in memory, according to the

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.633
stride of this row column transpose.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:42.250
I could also have expressed this as a gather operation, like so.
