TINA LEE: Hi, I'm Tina Lee,
founder of MotherCoders,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.940
a nonprofit that helps
moms gain the tech skills

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.060
they need to compete
in the new economy,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.110
and provide on-site child
care while they learn.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.930
I'm a strong ambitious woman.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.860
Is there anyone
else here like that?

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.740
[CHEERING]

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.807
Yeah.

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:28.390
Good, because I need
your help getting

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.160
to the Planet of Belonging.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.000
Why?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.940
Because there we'll
get a fair shot

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.580
at achieving our potential.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.330
We'll find inclusion,
fairness, and fulfillment.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.630
It's very different than the
planet that we're on now.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.110
Right now, on the
planet that we're on,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.850
it's not working for everyone.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.540
On Planet of Meh there's
systemic inequality based

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.100
on things like race and gender.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.580
There's also this notion
that your value is measured

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.480
by time rather than impact.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.670
And lastly, worse
yet, we're organized

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.379
around the idea of
a nuclear family,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
even though families have never
worked that way, especially

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.310
today, when 46% of households
there are two parents working

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.320
full-time jobs.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070
So you're wondering,
who is it working for?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.330
This guy, right?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.370
It's designed for him.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.770
Young, white, male,
straight, preferably

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.300
with no student loan debt or
caregiving responsibilities.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.220
Who does that leave out?

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.400
Everyone else.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.770
But since we're here celebrating
International Women's Day,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.320
I'd like to focus specifically
on what is happening to women.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.140
For starters, we get paid less.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.210
In the US, women are paid
$0.66 to every man's dollar,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.710
for similar work.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.410
And if you're a woman
of color, disabled,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.270
queer, or a little
older, you're probably

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.160
going to fare even worse.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.440
And if you think you're immune
to this because you're in tech,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.070
I'm sorry to tell you, are not.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.920
In fact, there's still
a pay gap in tech,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.289
and there's only a small
percentage of venture funding

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.490
that's going to startups
with women founders.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.980
It's no wonder we
have a leadership gap.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.670
And one of the main reasons why
women, our careers get stalled

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
is because we're society's
primary caregivers.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.520
70% of us spend 20 hours
or more per week caring

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.880
for kids, parents, even
family and friends.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.050
And because no good
deed goes unpunished,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.450
we end up getting
paid less for it,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.200
because we will trade
money and career

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.790
advancement for flexibility.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000
And if you become a
mom, which 81% of you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.790
will do or already
have done, you'll

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.740
get hit with a mommy tax.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.290
That's because you'll be
deemed less competent and less

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.664
committed to your
career once you

00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:50.230
become a mom, while the
opposite happens to dads.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.450
They get a fatherhood
bonus, because now they're

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.110
more deserving and
more competent.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.140
So here's me, right?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.550
Yellow, I am a daughter
of poor immigrants,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.950
and I have two girls.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.142
We're so screwed!

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:06.130
We're getting out
of here, and we're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.005
taking my husband Steve
with us, because he's

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.406
a really good dude.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:10.280
We're all packing up.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.810
We're going to
Planet of Belonging,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.400
because there it
won't matter where

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.420
we came, from how much
money we have, who we love.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.360
We'll just work together to
meet everyone's basic needs

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.450
and still have enough time
to do the awesome stuff we

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.810
were meant to do.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.330
Notice affordable childcare.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.140
I am so excited about this
idea that I've already

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.680
started building a crew.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.280
A team of women,
amazing women that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.570
come through the
MotherCoders program.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.840
And with your help, we're
going to build this army

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.300
into a national force.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.160
But here are some more
ways you can help.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.380
If your company doesn't already
have these retention policies,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.700
please help them implement some.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.560
And you can even double down
by tying executive compensation

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.370
directly to diversity goals,
or just giving all the women

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.490
a raise to close the gap.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.830
Then let's cultivate
a culture of care.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.560
It turns out, when people
feel connection and warmth

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.900
at their workplace, they
report higher levels

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.620
of satisfaction and teamwork,
which translate directly

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.150
into higher
performance, more money.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.520
And then safety.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.170
Here is Google's formula for
building effective teams.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.050
Notice that the first,
foremost ingredient

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.560
is psychological safety.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.820
Yet our caregivers are
scared to tell their bosses

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.262
about their responsibilities.

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:27.220
And finally, to get to
the Planet of Belonging,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.850
we're going to need
a lot of power.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.260
Millennial power.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.240
Thankfully, this
rising generation

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.670
will be the biggest
since the boomers,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.890
and they'll also be the most
diverse and the most educated.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.210
Especially the women.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.720
And women right now control
85% of all consumer purchasing

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.150
decisions.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.640
We actually have the economic
power to pull this off.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.820
And don't forget we
have allies in men

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.470
like my husband Steve, who want
off the Planet of Meh, too.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.460
So for the sake of each other
and everyone coming behind us,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.930
I urge you to join us at
MotherCoders in our effort

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.160
to get to the
Planet of Belonging,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.890
a new world where we will
all be given a chance

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.467
to be our best selves.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.800
Thank you, and please come
see us at the community fair.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.950
