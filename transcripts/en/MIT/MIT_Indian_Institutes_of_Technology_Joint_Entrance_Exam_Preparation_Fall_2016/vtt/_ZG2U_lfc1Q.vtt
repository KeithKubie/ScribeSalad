00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Hi, the topic of this video is scalar triple
product, that is a very important topic for

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.950
JEE.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.650
I will probably say this is the most important
topic for JEE, more than cross product more

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.250
than dot product because this combines cross
product and dot product.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.590
There are a lot of questions which come in
JEE just based on scalar triple product.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.230
It is a very important concept and I hope
that this video will be able to provide you

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.090
a basic understanding of scalar triple product.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.800
The idea behind video is to first introduce
scalar triple product and then do a few problems

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.120
on this topic.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.040
There will also be a followup video in which
we will go for more examples of scalar triple

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040
product.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.330
So “what is a scalar triple product”?

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.010
Till now we have done dot product which was
a \dot b

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.309
We have done cross product which was a \cross
b.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.579
Now this is a scalar triple product.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.530
So as the name suggests — triple means there
are three quantities: vector a, vector b,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.630
vector c — and it is a scalar product.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.129
Like dot product was a scalar product, this
is also a scalar product but there will be

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.840
three vector quantities, a b and c.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
And the output

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
Hi, the topic of this video is scalar triple
product, that is a very important topic for

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840
JEE.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
I will probably say this is the most important
topic for JEE, more than cross product more

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
than dot product because this combines cross
product and dot product.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840
There are a lot of questions which come in
JEE just based on scalar triple product. It

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.840
is a very important concept and I hope that
this video will be able to provide you a basic

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
understanding of scalar triple product.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.840
The idea behind video is to first introduce
scalar triple product and then do a few problems

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840
on this topic.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840
There will also be a followup video in which
we will go for more examples of scalar triple

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.840
product.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840
So “what is a scalar triple product”?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840
Till now we have done dot product which was
a \dot b

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
We have done cross product which was a \cross
b.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
Now this is a scalar triple product.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840
So as the name suggests — triple means there
are three quantities: vector a, vector b,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
vector c — and it is a scalar product.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
Like dot product was a scalar product, this
is also a scalar product but there will be

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
three vector quantities, a b and c. And the
output would be a scalar.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
Let us first discuss how we can get a scalar
quantity out of three vectors.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.840
Let us say we have vector a, and we have vector
b, and we have vector c.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
Now, how can I get a scalar quantity out of
this?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.450
Can I do a \dot b \dot c?

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.869
This would mean that (let me put brackets
here) a \dot b is a scalar quantity. And I

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:47.580
cannot dot a scalar with c so. Thus this not
possible.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:59.020
Can I do a \cross b \cross c.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.000
This would mean that this is a vector quantity
as I am taking a vector crossed with another

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.340
vector - and that will give a vector output.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.760
However, we want a scalar output so this is
also not possible. We will also be discussing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.400
what kind of product is this but that is the
part of the next videos.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.430
However, can we do something like this - a
\cross b \dot c. This is vector dotted with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.940
another vector, and thus gives us scalar output.
This is a correct one. This is what we want

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.120
to know.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:57.599
Scalar tripe product is defined as

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:45.340
a \cross b \dot c. So what does this mean?
How can we then get the answer for the the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:57.530
scalar tripe product. The expansion would
be something like this.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.010
You can imagine that basically you have \i
component and you multiply all of that with

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.280
cx. So rather than doing \i \j \k separately
you can just put cx cy cz in the determinant

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.860
at the top.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:41.750
This is an important property which i have
written down. You are doing a \cross b \dot

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.750
c.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:54.580
Now can you see something else also which
might or might not be that obvious? We know

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:18.380
that (a \cross b) \dot c = c \dot (a \cross
b). We know that because this is a dot product.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:29.470
Let us call this vector d. Then d \dot c = c
\dot d. So all you are saying is (a \cross

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.159
b) dot c = c \dot (a \cross b)

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:40.229
Also, there is a property of determinants
that basically means that you can flip two

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.850
rows, the answer would become negative of
the actual answer, and thus if you flip again

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.930
(the second time), then the answer would remain
the same.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:56.190
So if I flip (row) a and (row) c, then (row)
a will come to the top and row (c) will come

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.190
to the middle.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:08.660
Then when I flip (row) b and (row) c, it will
become a b c. In other words (a \cross b)

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:24.259
\dot c can also be written as | ax ay az;
bx by bz; cx cy cz|.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:50.860
I have done this by flipping rows twice — flipping
c row and a row, and then b row and c row.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:07:01.639
However, if you think about this, whatever
was in the \dot came at the top.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:14.500
I can write this also as a \dot ( b \cross
c).

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.599
What I am saying is whatever is in the dot
came at the top row or the single vector came

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:21.620
at the top row.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.550
I have written this down as (a \cross b) \dot
c = a \dot (b \cross c). This is a super important

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.550
property.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.819
a \dot (b \cross c) = (a \cross b) \dot c.
In other words, you can flip the sign of \dot

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:35.819
and \cross.

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.780
The first property that we have discussed
was this.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.050
The second property that I want to discuss
is (a \cross b) \dot c = a \dot (b \cross

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.099
c).

00:07:48.099 --> 00:08:08.400
Third property is a \dot (b \cross c) = (a
\cross b) \dot c. And sometimes

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.740
this is written as [a b c], since the position
of \dot and \cross doesn’t matter.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:20.180
It doesn’t matter you are taking dot here
or cross here. It will always come out to

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.530
be same.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.790
I hope that this is making sense: we first
said in a determinant and when we flipped

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.540
the rows twice the value remains the same.
Also because the top row belonged to the alone

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:42.120
vector, we said a \dot (b \cross c) is same
as (a \cross b) \dot c.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:09:04.170
We also know that (a \cross b) \dot c =
c \dot (a \cross b) = (c \cross a) \dot b.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:13.959
Or this can also be [c a b]. Because now we
are taking the associative property of dot.

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:24.920
Similarly, now I can write this as b \dot
(c \cross a). Am flipping the dots here again,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:40.339
and now i am changing this as (b \cross c)
\dot a i.e. changing dot and cross. And this

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:44.399
is [b c a].

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:47.160
This is a very very important property.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.312
What i am trying to say here is (a \cross
b) \dot c. This seems to be a cycling property.

00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:58.640
Cyclic property says that a should go to b,
and then b should go to c, and then c should

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.880
go to a.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:09.790
So what is happening is [a b c]. You can always
think it terms of cyclic [a b c]

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:16.680
The cycle is always [a b c] and that means
as long as you have [a b c] written in the

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.010
correct cycle, then the value remains the
same.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:29.279
In other words, [a b c] = [c a b] = [b c a].

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:38.920
I just want to highlight one other thing after,
[a b c] = - [a c b].

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.029
So if you flip two things, the cycle breaks.

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:48.320
It is not [a b c], it is [a c b] and so you
have broken the cycle. Or you have reversed

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320
the cycle.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.060
So rather than [a b c], you are now going
[a c b].

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.612
Thats why you have a negative sign and you
can check that so if you just flip two rows

00:10:54.612 --> 00:11:00.210
- just b and c - only once you do row exchange,
then there is negative sign in front of the

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.210
determinant.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.860
Thats why there is a negative sign here.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.950
Again you can make the cycle that [a b c]
= - [b a c]. The cycle is again [a c b], not

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.330
[a b c].

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:17.170
This [a b c] = - [c b a]

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:22.570
This is a very very important property. I
hope that you are able to now understand what

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.570
we are doing.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.899
We discussed a lot of things very quickly.

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:30.839
This is a scalar product: (a \cross b) \dot
c — because (a \cross b) is a vector and

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:35.899
then you are dotting it with (vector) c.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:42.110
The second thing we discussed was that you
can flip the position of \dot and \cross.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.580
We showed through the determinant property
that when you flip rows twice, you can conclude

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.280
that (a \cross b) \dot c = a \dot (b \cross
c).

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.420
The third property is that there is a cyclic
property to the whole system.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:12:00.040
We saw this by exchanging the \dot and \cross.
And by using the property of dot product i.e.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.410
(a \cross b) \dot c = c \dot (a \cross b).

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.550
You should take some time to digest these
things because these will be used in and out.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.380
They are very very important for the chapter
of vectors.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.470
So please please take your time to understand
these things. Slowly go through this by writing

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.880
these equations and then you should be able
to understand this.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:26.350
I don’t think this a very difficult concept
to grasp but for once you have to really understand

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.350
it.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.209
So two things: you can exchange the sign of
\dot and \cross, and there is a cyclic property.

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:37.770
For evaluating (a \cross b) \dot c, you can
just use the determinant.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:13:01.339
The next thing I want to discuss — like
all other products — is the physical significance.

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:08.240
What is the physical significance of (a \cross
b) \dot c.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:17.280
What basically we have to realize is that
this condition a \dot ( b \cross c) =0, then

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:32.410
a b c are coplanar.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:41.079
This is the first part of the significance.
I want to stress on this quite a lot because

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:44.740
you will often use this in questions.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.740
What does this mean?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:52.589
Let us say you have two vectors, b and c.

00:13:52.589 --> 00:14:04.470
Two vectors are always coplanar. If you have
two vectors, you can always pass a plane through

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.540
them.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.800
b and c are two vectors and you have passed
a plane through them.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.220
(b \cross c) is a vector which is perpendicular
to both b and c. This is something we have

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.949
discussed in the topic of cross product and
if you can’t recall it, please go and check

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:21.449
back the notes on cross product.

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:27.459
Whenever we have (b \cross c), let us say
n, it is perpendicular to both b and c.

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:35.079
What we are saying is that this n vector is
perpendicular to the plane of b and c.

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:51.230
Because b \cross c is n, a \dot n = 0. What
does a \dot n = 0 mean? This mean a and n

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.389
are perpendicular.

00:14:52.389 --> 00:15:02.959
If a and n are perpendicular, a has to lie
in the plane of b and c. or a, b, c are coplanar.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:07.260
What does coplanar mean? It means that if
there are three vectors, you can pass a plane

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.260
through them.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.339
With two vectors, you can always pass a plane
through them.

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:19.329
Let us say three vectors are like this (demonstration),
you cannot pass a plane through them.

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:22.459
Only with two vectors, you can always pass
a plane.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:26.550
If there are three vectors, you cannot always
pass a plane through them. When can you pass

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.800
a plane through them? Whenever a \dot (b \cross
c) = 0 or the scalar triple product = 0.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.029
How are we explaining this?

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:39.470
b \cross c is a vector perpendicular to both
b and c. Or is perpendicular to the plane

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:46.270
of b and c. When a \dot n = 0, that implies
a and (b \cross c) are perpendicular. Since

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.769
dot product is zero whenever two vectors are
perpendicular. So this forces a to lie in

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:52.880
the plane of b and c.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:03.160
This is very important and you just have to
remember that whenever three vectors are coplanar,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:13.480
the scalar triple product is 0.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:25.810
Coplanarity also means
that you can represent the third vectors as

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:31.690
linear combination of the first two vectors.
This is also a way to understand coplanarity.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:38.970
When can you represent a vector as a linear
combination of a and b?

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.459
Let us say there are a and b, and a plane
passes through them. Then basically you are

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:50.860
saying that you are stretching one vector
or compressing a vector as l and m can take

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.850
any real values.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.340
Let us say you made one vector half and other
vector double, and then now you are adding

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:03.589
them. So basically completing some kind of
addition, and addition forces you to not leave

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.819
that plane.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.880
That is why these three things are coplanar.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:21.099
You can also imagine that if I put c=la+mb
here: if I take cross of b with b, it will

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:30.970
become zero. Then, we will be left with (a
\cross b) \dot a. Then you can flip \dot and

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:37.630
\cross, and it will become (a \cross a) \dot
b. Cross of a with a will also be zero.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.100
You can check. You can just put this expression
back and check that this always comes out

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.130
to be zero.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:49.070
So coplanarity means that one vector can also
be written as the linear combination of other

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:55.760
two vectors, and scalar triple product [a
b c] is zero.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.170
I hope that is giving some insight into the
significance of scalar tripe product.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.070
Dot product was the projection of a vector
on the other vector.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.870
Cross product was the vector perpendicular
to both the vectors.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:13.230
Scalar triple product = 0 means a condition
for coplanarity.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:28.039
Second thing that I want you to learn as a
formula, if there is

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:50.740
a parallelopiped — parallelopiped is like
a 3-D parallelogram. Volume of parallelopiped

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.540
is [a b c] where three sides are a vector,
b vector and c vector.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.460
There are a lot of proofs for this but I don’t
think you need to understand the proofs.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:10.350
a vector is this entire side, c vector is
this entire side, and b vector is this entire

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:17.070
side. Then the volume of parallelopiped is
[a b c].

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:59.840
If there is a tetrahedron, with sides a, b
and c, then volume would be [a b c]/6.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.309
If this is a little bit unclear to you, don’t
worry too much about this. Just go back and

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.150
look at some images of tetrahedron and parallelopiped.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.980
Just remember that whenever the side are a,b
and c, then the volume of parallelopiped is

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.020
[a b c] and the volume of tetrahederon is
[a b c]/6.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:28.220
Let us recap whatever we have discussed. This
ends the property discussion of scalar triple

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.220
product.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:36.110
We have discussed that (a \cross b) \dot c
can be written as a determinant.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:47.250
We also learned that you can flip \dot and
\cross. I showed this by flipping the rows

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.210
twice and hence (a \cross b) \dot c = (a \cross
b) \dot c.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.700
Then we learned about the cyclic property
of [a b c]. And that there will be a minus

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.809
sign whenever the cycle is broken or reversed.

00:20:55.809 --> 00:20:59.780
Then we discussed two things about physical
significance.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.190
Condition for coplanarity: one vector is a
linear combination of other two vectors and

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.370
that is also expressed in terms of (a \cross
b) \dot c = 0. Since b \cross c is a vector

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:13.780
perpendicular to the plane of b and c, and
if a \dot n=0, a has to lie in the place of

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.780
b and c.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.831
And finally, if a,b and c are sides of parallelepiped
and tetrahedron, then the volume is [a b c]

00:21:19.831 --> 00:21:20.900
and [a b c]/6.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:26.559
These are the properties we have discussed.
Please remember them and learn them. They

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:35.000
should be on your fingertips whenever you
see them.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.630
Let us try to do some very quick problems.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:22:20.860
First problem is: If a, b, c are coplanar,
what is

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:39.340
the value of [2a - b, 2b - c, 2c -a]?

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.929
We have been told that there are three vectors
a,b,c that are coplanar. Then we have been

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:47.690
asked to find the scalar triple product of
vectors of the linear combination of a,b and

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.690
c.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:59.740
One way to solve this problem is to take a
cross and then take dot, and trying to find

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.860
something in terms of [a b c].

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:12.140
My point here is to really make you understand
what this means. Think about three vectors

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:20.960
that are coplanar: you have two vectors like
this and third vector like this — they are

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960
in a plane.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.470
What you are doing is that you are just taking
a linear combination of these three vectors.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:32.370
Can you ever go out of the plane? Can you
ever create a vector which is out of the plane?

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.400
For instance, if c = la + mb, since a, b,
c are coplanar.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.559
Then 2a-b is a linear combination of a and
b.

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:47.570
2b-c, because c = la + mb, is also a linear
combination of a and b.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.840
2c-a is also a linear combination of a and
c.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.310
So even all these vectors are just linear
combination of a and b. That means that they

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:58.980
are in the same plane. So you don’t even
need to do anything. You don’t have to calculate.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.960
You can just directly write that this is equal
to zero.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.730
Because a, b, c are coplanar, any linear combination
of these vectors will also lie in the same

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:14.990
plane. So these three vectors are in the same
plane. So you just have to understand that

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:20.549
since these vectors a coplanar, their linear
combinations has to be coplanar, so this has

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:24.220
to be zero since this is condition of scalar
triple product.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:30.140
I can bet that a lot of students will try
to solve this problem. They will start with

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:38.900
[a b c]=0 and then they will expand this by
taking a cross here and dot here, and opening

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:45.750
up the brackets and trying to solve it somehow.
All you have to do is to understand that coplanarity

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:54.180
means that that linear combination of the
vectors will lie in the same plane.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:01.010
I hope that this gives you some insight about
scalar triple product.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:21.720
The second problem that I want to do is: What
is the value of \lambda such that \lambda

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:43.659
\i + \j + \k, \i + 2 \lambda \j + \k and \i
+ \j + \k are coplanar.

00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:54.510
So what is
the value of \lambda such that these three

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.130
vectors are coplanar.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:03.380
The question is begging you to remember the
condition of coplanarity that a \dot (b \cross

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.210
c) = 0. Thats it.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.340
How can we write a \dot (b \cross c) is as
we have discussed a determinant. Let us call

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:24.880
this a vector, b vector and c vector.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:54.200
Then a \dot (b \cross c) = |\lambda 1 1; 1
2\lamba 1; 1 1 1 | = 0.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:01.880
I hope with time you will become quick in
opening up determinants.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.899
If you open up the determinant, you will find
that this is 2 \lambda ^ 2 - 3 \lambda + 1

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:13.419
= 0. You can check that this what it comes
out.

00:27:13.419 --> 00:27:24.840
That would give you the answer \lambda = 1,
1/2. In an objective test, this could be a

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840
multiple-choice problem.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:34.610
Can we check what the answer \lambda = 1 mean?
If \lambda = 1, then this becomes \i + \j

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:44.160
+ \k and then this becomes \i + \j + \k. So
they are same vectors. So if they are the

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.390
same vectors, that means their cross will
always be zero.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:54.340
So if they are the same vectors, this basically
become two vectors, which will obviously be

00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:01.980
coplanar. Rather than three vectors, you have
basically two vectors which are always coplanar.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:07.429
If \lambda=1/2, then this become \i + \j +
\k, and then these two become same. So again

00:28:07.429 --> 00:28:10.940
they become two vectors and they are always
coplanar.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.279
I hope that with this you are physically able
to understand the meaning of scale triple

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:16.279
product.

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:20.120
In this video, we covered very important topic
of scalar triple product. We discussed its

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.250
properties. We discussed 4 properties. And
then we did two examples to understand the

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.529
meaning of scalar triple product and how to
apply it.

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:30.400
In the next video, we will discuss vector
triple product. If you enjoyed this video,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.680
