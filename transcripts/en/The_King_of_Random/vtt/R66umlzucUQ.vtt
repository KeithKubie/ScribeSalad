At some point this summer, you may find yourself
somewhere your grill isn't, with an itch to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.820
cook up something tasty. So in this project
let's hack an empty drink can, into an itty

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.320
bitty BBQ. That'll help get you the fix
you need, and put some sizzle on those links

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320
one glorious dog at a time.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.680
We’re all familiar with the term “lifehacks” but this summer, the guys at mike’s hard
lemonade 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.360
asked me to help put a refreshing twist on it with what they’re calling “mikehacks"
/ˈmīkˌhak/

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.920
Mike Hack: Basically a lifehack that makes any social
occasion, more awesome.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.400
I just made a Bitty-Q that grilled the largest
garlic and onion bratwurst I could find at

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.690
the grocery store, so there's a good chance
it'll handle your hot dogs as well. For this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.220
project I chose to use this large drink can,
which you can see is nearly a pint and a half,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.220
so it's pretty big. To get started, we'll
need to cut the can completely in half, which

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.800
you could do with a pair of scissors, but
whatever you use, the goal here is to split

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.040
the can cleanly in two. If we make some small
angled cuts about half an inch from the edges,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.510
we'll be able to bend the aluminum over, forming
a small ledge. I was able to get a nice clean

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.680
crease with the help of a popsicle stick.
Let's do the other side the exact same way,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.720
then trim down the pointy parts so they're
not quite as sharp. Now let's focus on making

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.420
an awesome, and removable, cooking grill.
I made mine with a wire coat hanger, and I'll

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.550
give you the template for free. Just check
the description for the link. Now let's use

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.220
something like a pair of wire dikes to cut
the hanger at the neck, then find a way to

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.290
remove the protective coating. I used a piece
of 60 grit sandpaper, and got the film removed,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.280
in under a minute. Now let's go ahead and
use the template to measure, and carefully

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.960
bend the wire to shape, until it looks something
like this. Now we've got a removable grill

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.049
that spring loads into position when we're
ready to start cooking. Alright, it's time

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.840
to add the legs. I picked up a couple of 4"
U-bolts from the hardware store, and we'll

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.530
need to go ahead and remove the metal plate,
so we can use it as a template, on the inside

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.390
of the can. This way, we'll know exactly where
to poke the holes we need, and they'll need

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.510
to be just large enough to accommodate the
open ends of the bolt from the inside. Now

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.240
the plate can go back on, and if we bend the
two legs away from each other, you can see

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.579
the plate locks down on the can, holding it
securely. Now, if we do the same thing on

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.819
the other side, and replace the nuts, just
for decoration, you can see we've just created,

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.739
a half-barrel BBQ ready for grilling. Now
we could stop here, but let's take it to the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.879
next level by adding a top. I found these
1" utility hinges fit perfectly between the

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.510
gaps on the grill, so let's poke some holes
where they fit the best, and use something

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.310
like these #4, round-head machine screws,
to fasten them together. The bolts are three

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.079
eights of an inch long, and you can see I
fastened the hinges with the barrels facing

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.310
inward. Now, let's finish up by adding a miniature
handle. This piece is called a "strap loop"

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.060
and I found it at the hardware store as well,
and after fastening it near the edge with

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.840
some #8 machine screws, our Bitty-Q is completely
finished. It looks like it's ready for grilling,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.989
so let's see what it can do. Now because our
grill is completely removable, it makes it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.230
nice and easy, to add some coals, or whatever
else you use for grilling. You can see the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.609
wire grill snaps into position, and is held
firmly in place, so let's go ahead and add

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.879
a bratwurst to the coals, and close the lid
to get it sizzling. And check this out, it's

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.150
even got a built in loop for hanging your
tongs. Now, after about 10 minutes you can

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.069
see our brat is perfectly grilled, sweating
out juices, and ready to satisfy those cravings.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.329
I nestled this one into a golden brown bun,
added some condiments, and thoroughly enjoyed

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.169
it off camera. Now, there are all kinds of
variations you can make to this idea as well.

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.859
I tried using some smaller cans as a base,
and added some wire lath to form a makeshift

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.249
half barrel grill, which you can see does
a pretty nice job as well. So now you know

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.620
how to turn your empty drink cans, into a
sexy and satisfying, miniature BBQ. So go

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.060
ahead and get your grilling fix, just about
anywhere you want, because now you can. 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.000
Well that's it for now, if you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
