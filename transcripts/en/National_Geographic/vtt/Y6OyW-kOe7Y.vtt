00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.400
So it's not just your
interest in the oceans or space.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.333
You've touched and been touched
by engineering and technology.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.700
Yeah.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.567
And there was a lot about the
cameras you used for Avatar.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.266
But you go farther
back than that.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.333
Well, yeah.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.633
I just love engineering
and I love solving

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.300
hard engineering problems.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.400
And I love working with really
smart engineers in a room

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.967
and trying to do
something that hasn't

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:27.000
been done before,
like make a sub

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.367
that can go to extreme depths.

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:32.367
You know, there were materials
problems, electronics,

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.734
batteries, all sorts of things
that had to be developed

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.600
that were actually
hard problems.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.867
And you know, I just like that.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.000
So Charles, he likes
solving problems.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400
So he would've made
a good scientist.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.734
He would've made
a good scientist.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:45.900
He would've made
a good engineer.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.934
He would have been a
good just about anything.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.400
He could've been somebody.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.066
But that got me wondering.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:01:01.800
OK, what kind of preparation,
what kind of thinking

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.400
must have gone in to
motivate him in 2012 to make

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.166
the first solo descent to
the deepest place on Earth,

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:16.633
in a submarine that he
piloted and co-designed.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.133
- Wow.
- So you know where he went.

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.300
What's the deepest
place on earth?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.767
The Marianas Trench.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:21.600
Mariana Trench.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.667
Thank God.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.633
I thought you were
going to say my fears.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.433
Almost 7 miles down.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.133
Almost 7 miles down, off
the coast of the Philippines.

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:34.066
And so I asked him about
that record setting dive.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.934
Let's check it out.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:37.300
So what motivated you
to go to the bottom

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.967
of the ocean, bottom of Earth?

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.967
You know, the funny
thing is that I've

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.367
been asked that a lot.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.033
And it occurs to me that a kid
would never ask that question,

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.800
because a kid would
know, you just got to go.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.266
Why wouldn't-- a kids--

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.834
You so dissed me in
that moment right there.

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.000
[interposing voices]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.934
As a culture, we start
to think like, adults.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.333
- I want to be a kid again.
- I know.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.400
Exactly.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
So a kid would say,
why wouldn't you go.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.500
It's there.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.900
And you haven't looked yet.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900
So why wouldn't you build a sub
and get in it and go and look?
