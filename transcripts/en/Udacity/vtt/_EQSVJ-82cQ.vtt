00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.750
Let's now do another BTB and BHT quiz but this time we have a BHT that has

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.540
16 entries. And each entry is a one bit

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.110
predictor and that one bit predictor starts predicting not

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.730
taken. So all of the 16 entries initially

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.869
start out predicting not taken. The BTB is a

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.588
four entry perfect predictor still. The question for you

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.200
this time, is how many mispredictions will we have

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.972
for each instruction using this BHT and

00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:32.743
BTB? Write the number of mispredictions here for

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:36.006
this MOV instruction. Write the number of mispredictions

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:37.005
here for this MOV instruction, and so on.
