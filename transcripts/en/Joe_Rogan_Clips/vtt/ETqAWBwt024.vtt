00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.440
Guys,
I'm gonna Shit my pants.
Why I ate so much cheese shit bro.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.230
Now we have a toilet.
It's water little bit and it was wonderful.

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.520
The thing confused me man.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.500
One shoot the water but I can I that you can do both.
Whatever you want.

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.390
If you shoot it up there before it'll make you shit harder to like shoot.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.600
Probably it's a primer and heal.

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
The problem with that is when you take one of those shits when you've got just

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:27.210
shit all over your ass and spray something on,
it gets messy.

9
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:31.320
Shit goes everywhere.
So why did you want to do the quarterly call the lady.

12
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:40.320

Big Bear.

13
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.780
Big restaurants does less white trash up there.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.330
The families get the other people I've been going to hate me for it.

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
They hate when I bring it up cause I get so fucking sacred like well they don't

16
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.180
want it to be like Nas.
Kanye West.

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.120
How's it a secret of Kanye West says ski town or what?

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.460
What is it going to be on your podcast?

What's hard?

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.080
Is that happening?
No,

it'll probably happen.
It's just Kanye is,

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.760
you know,
he's a complicated artist and I'm sure there's a bunch of other issues.

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700
First of all,
he wants to get to know me.

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.200
We've got to get to hang out together and,
oh,
steam shovel Felder.

23
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.330
We'll time that shit.

Do bring him to his classroom.
He's a really nice guy,

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.800
When I talked to him on the phone,
he's a very,

Hey,

28
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.430
I told you guys I really liked doing these as much as I like doing anything.

29
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.890
Like when someone says like,
what's a,

30
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.420
what's your favorite guest or is there one guest you've never had on just this,

31
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
it doesn't exist.
They don't exist.
There's no one I like.
I like doing podcasts.

32
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.320
I like doing podcasts with everyone,
watching fights.

33
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.820
Dude call a future that that guy who's working on longevity drugs.
