00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.130
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, everyone

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.350
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.380
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle East Division

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.630
and I'm happy to see you all here.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
Today's program is
the first this fall

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.400
in the ongoing library series
entitled, "Conversations

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.870
with African Poets and Writers."

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.640
And this particular program is
the twenty-fourth in the series.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.020 position:56%
In October 2011, the African section
of the African Middle East Division,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.720
in partnership with the Poetry
and Literature Center headed

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.220
by Rob Casper, who is represented
today by Anya Creightney

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.020 position:56%
who will be speaking, and in
partnership with the African Society

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.500
of the National Summit on
Africa, which was then headed

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.270
by Bernadette Paolo and is
now headed by Patricia Bain

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.690
who will be speaking, too.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.040
She's the President.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880
And by Ambassador Pamela
Bridgewater who is here with us,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.320
the Chairman of the Society.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.720
Well, those three organizations
launched a new program here

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.850
at the Library of Congress
consisting of conversations

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.370 position:56%
and interviews with established and
emerging poets, short story writers,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.550
novelists, and playwrights of
continental and diasporic Africa.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.670
Four years later, the
series has become well known

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.450
and well established, and
has brought to the Library

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.710
and to our patrons and
readers, as well as all those

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.590
who access the Library's
webcasts around the world,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.550
some of the best writers
from Africa.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.940 position:56%
From those who are no longer with us
like Chinua Achebe and Ali Mazrui,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.480 position:56%
to poets like the Poet Laureate of
South Africa, Keorapetse Kgositsile,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.930

writers like Amadou Kone

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.100
from the Cote d'Ivoire,
Nigerian writer Igoni Barrett,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.050
the poet Omekongo Dibinga from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.300
to Tijan Sallah, a Gambian poet.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.400
We brought many, many
people to this series.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.580 position:56%
Last year we even hosted Lemn
Sissay who became the new Chancellor

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.050
of the University of Manchester.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.950
And today we have Shenaz Patel

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.140
who is the first Mauritian
writer in the series.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.130
She's here thanks to the
International Writers' Program

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.130
at the University of Iowa
and the Bureau of Education

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.700
and Cultural Affairs of
the Department of State.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.470
I thank you all for bringing
such a wonderful writer to us.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.670
And before we start the program,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.740
I would like to introduce
the President

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.160

will then conduct the conversations.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.640
So without further ado, Patricia.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.370
Thank you.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.820
&gt;&gt; Patricia Bain: Welcome
to Conversations

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.030
with African Poets and Writers.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.330
Good afternoon.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.630
My name is Patricia Bain.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.700
I'm the President of the Africa
Society here, as Dr. Deeb said,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.980
with my Chairman, Ambassador
Pamela Bridgewater

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.050
and Miss Sarah Caruso
right in the back of her.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.920
Thank you Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,
Dr. [Inaudible] who is not here,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.980
everybody associated with
the Library of Congress.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.460
For this iteration over
African Poets and Writers I want

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.580
to especially thank you, Mary-Jane,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.980
for being an extraordinary
partner in the series.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.280
This is the twenty-fourth.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.810
It's very exciting.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.960 position:56%
The African's Society's
partnership with the African section

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.340
of the Africa and Middle
Eastern Division and the Poetry

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.340
and Literature Center of
the Library of Congress

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.330
in our view is the perfect marriage
because we both provide a platform

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.010
for African literary
figures accessible

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.260
to everyone throughout the world
who would not have the privilege

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.580
of meeting them but for this forum.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.310
And today we have the pleasure
of an exceptional author,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.620
our first from Mauritius,
Miss Shenaz Patel

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.960
who is really also a
playwright, a journalist,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.450
social and culture issues
for Modern Advocate.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.270
You do a lot, Miss Patel.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.220
You're an impressive literary and
culture ambassador from Mauritius.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.290
And having you with us today
makes us cognizant of the myriad

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.050
of languages and cultures that
are spoken in the 55 countries

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.180
of the African continent.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.510
And the fact that the progress
of African writers is really felt

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.090
in countries all over the world.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.460
With you and with all our
previous guests we learn more

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.050
about different African
countries, the different voices,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.840
and we grow from what we
learn, as does our audience

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.030
and so we're very pleased to
have you [inaudible] today.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.510
And now I will call on Anya.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.510
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Hi,
everyone, and welcome.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.550
Thank you, Patricia, and thanks
to both the Africa Society,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.170
and the National Summit
on Africa, and the Africa

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.770
and Middle Eastern Division
here at the Library of Congress.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.910 position:56%
My name is Anya Creightney and I'm
the Program Specialist of the Poetry

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.640
and Literature Center
here at the Library.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.640
I'm also a proud partner
in this series representing

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.730
and celebrating literature from
across the African continent.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.230
I'm thrilled and delighted

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.290
to welcome the International
Writers' Program at the University

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.180
of Iowa back to the Library of
Congress, and especially pleased

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.660
to welcome writer Shenaz
Patel to the Conversations

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.420
with African Poets
and Writers series.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.930
The International Writers'
Program is a unique conduit

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.250
by connecting established
writers from around the globe

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.810 position:56%
to other cultures via reading tours,

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.860
classroom talks, and
public lectures.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.620
Since 1967 over 1400 writers from
more than 190 countries have been

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.130
in residence at the
University of Iowa.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.660
Writer Shenaz Patel is one of
these outstanding residents.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.230
A fiction writer and a
playwright hailing from Mauritius,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.860 position:56%
as has been mentioned, Ms. Patel has
written four novels, numerous plays

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.010
and short stories in both
French and Mauritian Creole.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.800
She is best known for
her 2005 novel,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.240
excuse my French, "Le
Silence des Chagos."

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.490
It's close as I can get.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.260
[Laughs]. And as a working
journalist, she writes about social

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.960
and cultural issues, much
like Patricia has mentioned.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.050
And she's often seeking to
unearth the unsaid and the untold.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.760
So I know we are all excited
to hear from her today.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.410
Let me tell you just a word about
the Poetry and Literature Center.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.450
We are the home of the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.560
This year it's Juan Felipe
Herrera in his second term.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.300
And we put on 30 to 40 programs
just like this one a year.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.350
To find out more about our series
and other programs of the Library

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:49.730

writers, please visit
www.loc.gov/rr/amed.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.420
And certainly last,
but not least I want

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.330
to thank our presenting partners
The Bureau of Educational

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.290
and Cultural Affairs at the
U.S. Department of State

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.740
and the Penn Faulkner Foundation.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.800
Now let me turn it over to
Shenaz for a reading followed

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.390
by a conversation with Eve.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.690
Please.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.800
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Good
morning, everybody.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.570
I'm very happy and honored
to be with you here today.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.810
It's a very special
occasion for me and I'd

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.500
like to thank particularly the IWP
for bringing me here to Washington,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.470
first to Iowa City where we've been
spending two months-and-a-half now

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.320
with 36 different writers from 30
different countries and it has been

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.320
such an enlightening and
great experience to be able

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.210
to share the literature of
other countries and also share

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:13.110 position:56%
on a human point of view with so
many writers which I especially want

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.680 position:56%
to thank because they have brought a
lot to my understanding of the world

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.260
and my understanding of people.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.090
And all that is going to come

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.120
through in the future
writing so thank you so much.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.960
I would like to read
today from the novel,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.800
[inaudible] "Le Silence des
Chagos," which is a novel

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.780
which was published a few
years ago which is very,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.080
very special to my heart.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.250
For me it's not just a
novel, it's a life story.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:51.000
It's based on a true
and tragic story.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.450
It recounts what happened to a
population called the Chagossians.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.320
They lived on islands, an
archipelago, the archipelago

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.160
of Chagos which initially belonged
to the territory of Mauritius.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.240
Mauritisu, as you know,
is a small island state

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.610
in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.370
And we were formerly a British
colony from 1810 to 1968

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.850
when we gained our independence.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.300
And when Mauritius asked
for its independence

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.230
in the 1960's the British
said, "Okay.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.650 position:56%
We're going to give you independence
but we're just going to keep

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.780
that part of your territory,
the Chagos archipelago."

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.480
And there was a deal between
the British and the Americans

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.970 position:56%
who wanted this particular place
and the main island that archipelago

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.960
which is called Diego Garcia, they
wanted to establish a military base

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.070
on this island because it was
ideally situated in the middle

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.770
of the Indian Ocean to be able

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.370
to control the whole
of the Middle East.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.030
And it must be known that
most of the bombings that went

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.820
on these last years on
Afghanistan and Iraq killing

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.840
from the island of Diego Garcia.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.720
So the United States said that
these islands are very important

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.500
to maintain the security
of the "free" world.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.970 position:56%
But what is not really known is that
this freedom happened at the expense

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.620
of the freedom of a population, the
Chagossians who were living there

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.830
and who were disposed of
in terrible conditions.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.680
The British said to
the American that,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.810
first that there was no
[inaudible] on these islands.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.770
Then they had to get rid,
in a way, of these people

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.060
and this happened in
two different phases.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:56.720
The first one, they tried to get
the people away by different means.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.020
They closed the hospital.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:05.490
They didn't send what we needed
for everyday life at first

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.120
and they tried to get
them to go to Mauritius.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.050 position:56%
And when they wanted to take the
boat back to go back to the islands,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.810
they were told that
the islands were closed

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.210
and that they weren't going back.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.570
And then the second phase in
the beginning of the, 1972,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.520
the Americans were getting
impatient so they just sent a boat.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.730
The people were given half an hour
to collect their things and get

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.480
on the boat and go away without
being told what was happening

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.890
to them, where they
were being taken.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.850
And they were thrown in Mauritius,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.890
totally helpless and
without anything.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:54.640
And these people have been fighting
for years for the recognition

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.060
of the harm that has
been done to them.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.240
Mauritius has been
fighting also as a state

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.890
to claim sovereignty
on that [inaudible].

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.290
And three weeks back
our Prime Minister was

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.360
at the National Assembly of
the United Nations in New York

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.660
to reaffirm our claim on these
islands and this is a story

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:23.240 position:56%
that struck me, not for its
geopolitical and historical context,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.180
but for the people
who were concerned.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.990
And I met some of these people.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:35.940
They confided their story to me and
I really wanted to get it across,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:41.480
the story of how you feel
when you're confronted to this

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.290
in your life, how you live
through that, if you can,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:51.180
because a lot of Chagossians
didn't go through it.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.550
A lot of them committed
suicide and it was very,

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.250
very hard for their population.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.520
And so I met some of them and
they confided their story to me.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.130
And this book is a way of
trying to get their story

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.910
across because they
didn't have a voice

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.060
at that time to tell
their own story.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.800 position:56%
So I'm just going to read an extract
from "Le Silence des Chagos."

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.280
"Charlesia was starting to be
fed up with all those Mauritians

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.590
who aimed to hold her back.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.120
At the hospital the doctor had
been saying for a long time now

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.100
that her husband was completely
recovered and he could leave.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.550
It was obvious that he was, and
for that matter, she'd been sure

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.050
that she could have treated
him at home in Diego Garcia.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.850
A few days of [inaudible]
infusions to lower tension

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.700 position:56%
and fresh coconut milk to cleanse
the symptoms would have disappeared.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.990
But the nurse over there
was a scare monger.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.290
He has to go to Mauritius.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.040
We can't take care
of him anymore here.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.920
He has to seek treatment
in Mauritius.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.010
That's what they wouldn't
stop saying to Charlesia.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.440
Even the administrator
encouraged her to leave.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.760
'Go. You have to go.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.450
He'd be better cared for in
Mauritius and it will do you good.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.640
You've worked hard anyway.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.940
It's vacation season.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.240
Bring the kids.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.730
Have a good time.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.260
Stop worrying.'

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.330
She finally let them
convince her and they left

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.990
on the next voyage of
the Mauritius boat.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.770
They disembarked there at the
end of that queue which led

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.550
to the dust clotted
noise of Port Louis,

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.160
the capital city of
Mauritius Island.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.900
More than a month had passed since.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.320
Her husband was fully recovered and
it was well past time to return.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.840
They'd been imposing for too long

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.180
on these people with
their six children.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.610
It will be soon that
their welcome turned

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.690
to vinegar, she could feel it.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.270
They had a funny way of
living here, always in a rush,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.860 position:56%
constantly required to stuff
themselves inside the claustrophobic

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.950
hub cities.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.810
The children were getting restless.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.640
They needed space, their space.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.600
This time the people

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.450
at the [inaudible] office
would have to reply to her.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.400
She'd come there twice
already asking

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.860
when the next boat
would depart for Chagos.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.330
She could see herself
[inaudible], turning her back

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:40.070
to the great port surrounded by
those eyesore high mountains,

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.920
sea filling her lungs, a brief,
calm journey to the north

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.340
and then one morning
in the slanted light

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.740
of dawn there was a [inaudible]
sprinkled over the water

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.350
like a spray of gentle
prayers, whispered, 'Granted.'

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:04.210
Charlesia pulls the flower
embroidered handkerchief

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.040
from her blouse [inaudible].

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.040
She enters the office.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.050
A few ceiling fans struggle to turn
their blades, creaking and wheezing

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.380
under a layer of dust
and [inaudible].

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.280
Seven men, shirt sleeves rolled up,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.850 position:56%
are seating behind green formica
desks, [inaudible] in their teacups.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:32.440
Chalesia goes up to the person
standing closest to the door.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:39.080
He raises his head,
tosses her a brief glance.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.420
'My, look who's here.'

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.790
A sharp laugh lifts
up through the room.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.280
Charlesia holds her ground.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.100
[Foreign language spoken].

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.910
She's not asking them for sorcery.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.560
She simply wants to know
when the next boat leaves

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.480
for Chagos, her home.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.340
The fans creak a little louder.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.630
[Foreign language spoken],
go on tell her.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.370
The voice comes from the back
of the room between two piles

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.980
of folders another man looks at her
with something evasive in his eyes

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.010
but his voice is firm,
'She has to be told.'

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.860
An immense silence descends
over [inaudible] head.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.310
It lands suddenly on her
chest which contracts

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.800
and she's powerless to control it.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.110
Another voice rises up beside
her, 'Then tell her yourself.'

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:42.270
The man hesitates, he
fidgets with his pen,

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.370
twirling it between
his thick fingers,

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:52.330
his nails almost perfect
squares, 'I'll ask the boss.'

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.430
His chair scrapes on the
floor, he give a discreet knock

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.950 position:56%
on the glass door, listens briefly,
then turns the cover handle and goes

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.220
in the office, carefully
closing the door behind him.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.320
Charlesia sees him.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.220
He has barely moved forward in the
room, sweat has drawn brown waves

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.380
at the back of his beige shirt.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.080
He speaks for a while,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:24.890
turning around to indicate the
place where she is standing.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.190
Charlesia waits.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.490
The others are [inaudible] work,

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.810
[inaudible] away on
their typewriters.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.260
The man raises his hand
again, slips it in his collar,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.030
mechanically he rubs his neck.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.080
Then he waves it in front of him.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.700
He seems to be insisting.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.550
Finally he nods, turns back,
[inaudible] the handle,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.940
opens the door, closes
it again cautiously.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:54.330
He slowly walks back to
his table, sits down again.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.840
'Well?' asks his colleague.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.690
'Well, he told me to tell her,'

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.720
'Hmm. Maybe you should
take her outside.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.380
She looks like a handful,
that one,' he says, laughing.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.650
Charlesia feels like
she's going to lose it.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.550
Are they talking about her?

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.520
What is all this gossiping about?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.320
She walks up to the man.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.620
[Foreign language spoken].

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:28.810
He barely lifts his eyes to hers,
yes, he has something to tell her.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.110
Better get on with it.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.000 position:56%
It's almost noon and he has to hurry
if he doesn't want to get overtaken

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.240
by the crowd at the shop where
the stuffed breads are waiting.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.690
'You won't have a return boat.'

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:47.460
He blurted out the sentence,
closing his folder with a force

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.260
that made the metal rings
on the side clatter.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.050
Charlesia doesn't move.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.370
She was afraid for a moment

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.240
that he had slammed the
folder shut on his fingers.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.600
She already saw his blood streaked
flesh pitch frantically trying

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.900
to escape the steel ring

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.770
but the restless left hand
couldn't manage to force open.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.210
The sound of the folder
booms in her head.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.590
The clacking rings, the
clattering of the drawer.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.340
He said something to her but
she didn't understand what.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.510
She looks at him to
repeat it but he continues

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.370
to shuffle through his belongings.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.050
The others get up around him.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.000
Charlesia doesn't move.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.650
She stares at the man, waiting
for him to repeat his sentence.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.720
'There will be no more
returning ships.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.670
You have to stay here
[foreign language spoken].'

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.010
He spoke with a dry
voice, lowered his head,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.950
and arranged his lost
papers in a drawer

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.660
that shut carefully with a key.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.320 position:56%
Charlesia hears the blades from the
fans stirring the air, kicking it up

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.480
and sending his words back to
her, '[Foreign language spoken].'

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.070
The man approaches her.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.060
Around then the office is empty.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:13.740
He puts his hand firmly
on her shoulder,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.820
makes her turn to the door.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.300
She's outside.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.770
He disappears.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:26.830
Over there the sea calls to her
against the current of human waves

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:31.500 position:56%
that lap toward the exit, step after
step she walks to the farthest point

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.820
of the queue where
she stands motionless.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.250
From his sentry box, the
attendant watches her,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.270
hypnotized by that silhouette,
by the red scarf prominent

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.040
against the [inaudible] as
backdrop of the glittering sea.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.110
He watches this woman [inaudible]
the sea who appears to be waiting.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.890
Waiting for what?

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.270
A boat. An ever absent
boat that tattooed

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.790
on the retina of a lookout woman.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.990 position:56%
She probes the blue span, infinitely
blue, but as much as she tries,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.100
she can't seem to hope
for the curtain.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.440
The sea remains obstinately empty.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.880
There's no boat.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.280
There's no more boat for her.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.440
That's what they have just
told her, yet another one

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.260
of their stupid jokes
to pass the time.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.560
No [inaudible].

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.330
That doesn't mean anything.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.830
This sentence has no sense.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.860
They'd better [inaudible]
such insanities.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.160
'[Foreign language spoken],'
was that your [inaudible]?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.920
What do they think, this
bunch of simpletons?

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.520
That it's a restaurant or something

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.820
like their shitty office
of [inaudible]?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.050
Something with opening and
closing hours from nine

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.430
to four written up on the doors?

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:52.030
If she threw herself in the water,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.300
would the [inaudible] gunboat
come back to rescue her,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:03.910
bring her back home on
the other side of the sea?

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.730
Charlesia steps up to
the edge of the queue.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.340
The greasy harbor waters
flow heavily

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.280
against the concrete parapet.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.030
Over there the horizon
is a sharp, bright line.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.280
The boat has already
gone over it without her.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.760
And she asks herself
wherefrom comes that wave

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.300
that falls suddenly
through her whole body?"

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.100
Thank you.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.100
[ Applause ]

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.840
I just wanted to say that
the book is written in French

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.020
and that this translation has
been made by Patricia Hartland

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.640
who I especially want to
thank for a very beautiful

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.370
and loving work she's
done on the translation.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.170
Thank you.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.260
[ Applause ]

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.560
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.860
Thank you very much, Shenaz.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.160
That is beautiful.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.740
I think I know how it ends
but I won't give it away.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.590
I did want to mention that today
is rather significant, though,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:19.030
because yesterday marked
eight years ago that we came

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.910
up with the inspiration
somewhat for this series

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.210
and that was the celebration

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.560
of the fiftieth anniversary
of "Things Fall Apart."

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.880
And that was November third, 2008.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.980
I can't believe it's been eight
years already but that has passed,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.310
as has the great author,
Chinua Achebe, so, you know,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:44.020
we can kind of dedicate
today's program to his memory

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:49.800
as he was the father of the
wave of that African moment.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.980
So that's a moment
of remembering him

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.630
and remembering what
happened eight years ago.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.630
And it's a different scenario

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.190
because eight years ago we were
the day before election day

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.680 position:56%
and now we're heading into next week
and that's all I'll say about that.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.980
[Laughs].

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.680
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I could say that.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.980
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: We're
supposed to be non-partisan here

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.680 position:56%
so we'll just move on to literature.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.450
So my first question for you
is when did you start writing

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.770
and can you talk about
the relationship

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:26.540
between literary writing and
your role as a journalist?

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.040
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: To say when I
started writing I'd have to say

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.950
when I started reading because
it's so much related to me.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.350
I had the chance to [inaudible]
a family who loved books.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.690
My father would go to the
book island where people

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.030
at one time were [inaudible]
selling everything they owned

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:51.660
so people went there to buy
furniture or things like that.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.860
And he went around the
island and came back

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.250
with big boxes of old books.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.960
And I didn't quite understand
at first why he did that

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.440
and why it was so important.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.000
And very quickly I wanted to be
able to read by myself to be able

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.500
to understand what the treasures

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.210
in these boxes he brought
back from work.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.500
I became a very eager reader.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.160
I had to read and I still
have to read every day.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.900
I can stay without writing for
some days but not without reading

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.120
because I feel like my day will
be so incomplete without reading.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:36.130
And I think I took in another way
at school I took from the letter A

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.450
to letter Z from all the books.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.750
I then I want to point out that
like I also had stories in my head

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.360
that I wanted to tell so
that's how the writing came.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.830 position:56%
But it was a very, very long process
from the beginning of writing

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:56.040
to the fact of publishing
because I think it's very hard.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.340
[Inaudible] telling your
story or [inaudible]

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.640
in the books the you write.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.480
You always put a little of
yourself in what you write.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.060
And it took me a very long
time to overcome that kind

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:10.130
of shyness [inaudible] ability as
a fact of showing what I wrote.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.050
And so it wasn't until
I was around 30 I think

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.720
that I started publishing.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.930
But writing has always been there
for me as something essential

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.790
to my life because I have
the impressions [inaudible],

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:30.620
they're very utopic impressions
that rising could change the world.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.330 position:56%
And so at first I was high like that

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.290
and everybody was asking me what
do you want to do after [inaudible]

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.580
when you're a grownup and I
said I want to be a journalist

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:45.040
because I was very struck
by what I saw around me.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:52.600
I was very ill at ease and
unhappy with a lot of situations

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.350
of injustice that I could
see around me and I felt

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.060
like I just couldn't do as if
it had nothing to do with me.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.350
And I felt that being a
journalist and writing,

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.680
it would perhaps change that.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.860
I have evolved in that
[inaudible] even not totally

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.380
and that's why I'm still writing.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:19.430
And literature is a
different kind of writing

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.080
and journalism is very
precise, very [inaudible]

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.260
and you don't throughout, a
very precise way of writing.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:32.520
Literature is my space of freedom
where I can do whatever I want.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.410
I remember a friend telling me one
day, I was kind of going around

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:39.840
and frantically trying to fix
everything that wasn't going right

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.220
in the lives of people I love and
he just took me by the shoulders,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.420
he stopped me and he looked
into my eyes and he said,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.230
"You know, you're not God."

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.660 position:56%
I was very disappointed [inaudible].

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.480
But then I found out in
literature I could be God.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.280
I could create someone that I
would like to see in my life

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.390
and that I wouldn't
perhaps see in my life.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.510
I could create that person.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:15.390
I could kill him tomorrow
if I was fed up with him.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.150
I could bring him back the day
after if I was missing him.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.890
So literature is my space of
freedom where I can be God

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.640
and change the world in a way.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.120
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.420
Excellent.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.720
You know, so Shenaz and I spoke
a little bit briefly before the

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.920
program and it came to our
realization we're both journalists

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.850
and it's interesting for me to find

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.900
out why she started
being a journalist

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.830
because it was the
same reason I did.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.800
I was sitting in the middle of
Uganda and Idi Amin took over

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.870
and I read things about
Idi Amin and I was like,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.610 position:56%
"That's not really what I'm seeing."

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.410
So I'd change everybody's
opinion by being a journalist

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:57.280
and I gave up on that idea, too.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.740
Didn't pursue the further reading
and then the other thing is

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.880
that you are a biblophobic.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.310
I found out this new word.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.390
Biblophobia is the fear of
running out of books to read.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.690
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Yeah.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.990
That's true.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.670
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: So that's a very
useful word for people like you.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.290
In addition, I just wanted to
make an aside that Chinua Achebe,

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.210
that I had asked him why did
he kill my favorite character

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.500
in "Things Fall Apart,"
Ikemefuna, and he said,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.390
"I didn't kill Ikemefuna,
Okompo did."

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.660
And I said, "But you created
Okompo," and he said, "No,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.340
once I created Okompo
he had his own life."

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.660
So I think that when you
say that you get to be God

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:44.040
in your own writing, you know, your
characters become who they want,

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.290
who you want them to be
and then they take off

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.590
on a life of their own.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.890
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: That's true.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.410
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: So my
next question is who

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.840
or what are the major
influences on your work?

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.540
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: It's
difficult to say.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.070
There's so many.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.720
I love, it's a strange thing
because I write in French,

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.560
my two mother tongues are
French and Creole so I write

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.070
in French and originally Creole.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.400
I don't write in English,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:24.990
I don't know if I should say
unfortunately or anyway not yet.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:32.350
But I find that [Inaudible] has
been very, very inspiring for me

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.110
because in [Inaudible]
I find the vitality

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.630
that I don't find in [inaudible].

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.440
But he has much more freedom
and [inaudible] with language

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.150
in [inaudible] than
French literature.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.580
[Inaudible] nowadays.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.900
And so I've read a lot of
[Inaudible] and I particularly

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:59.750
like authors like [Inaudible]
who could create,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.010
and I was always fascinated

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:09.400
by that person who's
totally not alive at all.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.770
It's ink on a white page and
then suddenly just by the way,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:17.750
a word here instead of here,
a comma here instead of there,

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:22.520
you create a world and you create
characters who become like persons

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.970
and feel like they're alive
and not until you've put

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:29.080
down the book you have impression
that its characters are walking

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.800
with you and still be
with you years and years.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.620
And he knows how [inaudible]
creates characters

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.760
that you know wouldn't exist
in real life but in the spirits

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.670
of the book are really, are alive.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.460
And Salman Rushdie was [inaudible].

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:54.440
"Midnight's Children" for me is
one of these books that really says

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.980
so much about the power of
literature to create a world

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:05.260
and to create people that go
beyond what we could experience but

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:11.860
yet tell us so much about who we
are and our place in the world.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.150
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: All right.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.750
My next question for
you, why did you choose

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.490
to write fiction as
your creative outlet.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.810
I know you've written short
stories, plays, and news articles,

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.910
but also have you delved into
other literary genres like poetry?

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.600
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: We
have a discussion,

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.900
it's fun that you ask the question

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.640
because we have an
ongoing discussion

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.830
about that for the past two months.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:46.590
I've never dared poetry because
I love poetry so much and I felt

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.590
like it was higher than me.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.140
But then I've been writing
something since I've been here

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.410
and I've been writing in English
which for me is quite strange.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.900
And my friends [inaudible]
tell me that,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.980
"You're writing poems,"
and I said, "No.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.280
I'm not writing poems.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.680
I'm writing text."

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.870
But I'm a little bit surprised
about the categorizations we make.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.650
If it's creative non-fiction, or
fiction, or poetry, or novellas,

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.750
or short stories, or for
me all these are texts.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:23.430
And the [inaudible] is not
the genre but the voice.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:28.590
What I'm looking for in
text is voice and the story.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:34.640
You write if you have a
story to tell, otherwise,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.670
I mean go play [inaudible].

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.090
There are so many stories
around us that want to be told.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:50.850
And I've tried, I like
particularly the short story

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:56.630
because the short story
for me is like the pebble

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.150
that you throw in a pond.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.990
It's very compact.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.340
It goes down very quickly.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.240
But it leaves after it these
ripples on the water which are

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.300
like echoes that grow around you.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.090
And a good short story when it's
well written, it's [inaudible].

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.790
It's like throwing a
pebble in a pond that gives,

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.600
it stays with you for
long afterwards.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.950
People like to think that
writing a novel is more difficult

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.250
than writing a short story.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.410
I don't totally agree.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.710
It's another process.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.510
It's a longer process.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:41.380
But you're not, you can be less
good at some things and try to make

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:47.120
up for it in other aspects.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.040
In a short story you can't.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.760
Either it's well written
and it's good or it's not.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.790
And theater, plays is also a
very interesting field for me

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.780
because it's a place where
you're in [inaudible] contact

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.150
with the [inaudible] and
that's very important.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.890 position:56%
When you write a novel, you write it

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.190
and then you don't
know where it goes.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.890
You're not in contact
with people who read it

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.700
but you can read it afterwards
but it's not the same process.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:19.340
In the plays, writing is
directly aimed at people

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.160
so that's a very interesting
thing also.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.040
I'm also interested in graphic
novels because that's another way.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.450
And in fact, I'm fascinated

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.890
by all the different
ways of telling a story.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:39.200
At the IWP in Iowa City we had
an interaction with some dancers

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.610
from their school of dance.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:46.620 position:56%
And it was really fascinating to
see how they took some of our texts,

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.780
what we got from it and how they
told our story, everybody's,

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.240
so how the stories we write
can be told by others.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.640
And we see it and felt by other
people and told different view.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.230
And I think this is [inaudible].

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.530
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.260
That's really interesting to me
as a writer because I know also

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.120
that it's more difficult to write
a 500 word article than it is

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.390
to write a 1500 word article.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:20.420
So I think the parallel is there
with the news stories also.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.720
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Yes.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.880
That's one of the first things my
first [inaudible] chief told me

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.610
when I started as a [inaudible].

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.150
I was nineteen.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.020
And I had been investigating on
something for weeks and weeks

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.230
and I came up with so many
information [inaudible] I kind

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.840
of said, "Can't I have two
pages of the newspaper?"

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.140
And he said, "No.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.440
You won't.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.740
Just one page and you
stick to that."

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.040
And I said, "There's so
many things to [inaudible]

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.080
that I have to leave aside."

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.380
And he said to me, you know, one
day he went to his editor and chief

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:56.570
and gave him this article and said,
"[Inaudible] I didn't have time."

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.680
[Inaudible] even more
time to make it short.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.080
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.120
Having been born and
raised in Mauritius,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.100
and what has Mauritian
literature been like historically

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.780
and what's happening in
the literary scene now?

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:19.390
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: The actual
literary scene is very active,

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.040
very energetic I would say.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.490
There have been, Mauritius
published the first book

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:28.030
in the southern hemisphere
in 18-something, I forget

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.590
but in the nineteenth century.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:40.680
And since then we have had a
very lively literary scene.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.040
There have been different
phases in that.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:50.350
At one point we had all that
colonial literature [inaudible],

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.350 position:56%
you know, the breeze in the palm
trees and the beautiful young Creole

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.240
and the verandas and
things like that.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.910
And [Inaudible] the great French
poet wrote there [inaudible] poem

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.210 position:56%
called [inaudible] for a Creole lady

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.260
which was directly inspired
by these [inaudible]

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.250
when his parents were
sent him away from Paris

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:19.690
where he was living a very,
how can I say the word?

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:24.930
They didn't like the life he was
living in Paris, the [inaudible]

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.820
so they were trying to send him
away to India and on his way

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.720
to India the boat stopped
in Mauritius

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.340
and then he never went further.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.870
He stayed in Mauritius and
then he went back to France

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.590
and he wrote these
poems that are part

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.040
of his famous connection
called [Inaudible].

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.340
So there has been a lot

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.910
of that emotional literature
a few years back.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:51.300
And then there has been
a second phase where

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.390
Mauritian writers felt like
they had to exile themselves

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.310
to be able to exist as writers,

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.650
that it wouldn't be happening
in Mauritius so they had to go

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:05.550 position:56%
to France, or England, and to other
countries like that to be recognized

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:10.200
as writers either to
live as writers.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.730
And suddenly we had a lot
of literature that was kind

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:26.550
of looking back at the island like
something dreamed and it over -- .

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.070
I can't find the word in English.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.370
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Romanticized?

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.670
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Yeah.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.970
In a way that's it.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.270 position:56%
But then we have a generation now
of writers who really know Mauritius

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:46.640
and who talk about Mauritius
in a very different way.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.780
We have writers, a
generation of writers

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.500
who are published mostly in France.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.040
I have a friend writer
called [Inaudible].

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:02.770
Her latest novel called
[Inaudible] was in line

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:11.420 position:56%
for the [inaudible] most prestigious
French prizes a few weeks back,

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.440
[foreign language spoken].

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.920
And it's interesting to
note that at the same time

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.220
as there is the great
vitality of our writers,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.720
we are not read now in our country.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.390
We are read elsewhere
around the world and studied

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:29.430
around the world but
not in our country.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:35.400 position:56%
But I think that Mauritians in a
way have a problem with what we tell

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.270
and say in our literature.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.390
When my second book came out
it was, it's called "Sensitive"

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.470
and it was published in France.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.890
So the news first came
out in the newspapers

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:51.050
that I was having a book published
in France by a great publisher.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.130
And so people came up
to me saying, "Wow.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.430
We are proud.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:55.730
That's great."

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.500
[Inaudible] colony so there's
still that tendency, well,

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.400
if it's published over there, it
must be good, it must be great.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.720
And I say, "If it was published

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.620
in Mauritius I would have been
writing exactly the same book,"

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.020
but never mind.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.110
[Laughs]

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.930
Book then the book came out.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:18.060
People started reading it and
that's where the problem started.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.570
I was approached by a
lady once in a bookstore

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.180
when I was doing a book signing.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:29.500
And she was very angry and
she was very aggressive.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.770
And she told me, "Why
did you have to go

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.990
and tell these things
about us in France?"

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.390 position:56%
Because the image of Mauritians that
I did in my book didn't fit at all

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.700
with the postcard image
that we have.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:49.340
We're a tropical country,
very touristic country.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.890
We like being told we're the
best, we're the number one,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.190
[inaudible] for the great.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.620
And we don't like anything
going against that image.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.860
And we contemporary writers
are not writing the postcard.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.790
I don't mean to say we're
writing against the postcard

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:11.330 position:56%
but what we're telling doesn't quite
go across with the official image.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.060
And so I told this lady, "Well,

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.940
I'm not here to do the
promotion of Mauritius.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.230
[Inaudible] all that at the tourist
office and they do a very good job.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:24.360
And that's not my job as a writer."

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.420 position:56%
But I think we're very much a
culture of representation and that's

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.690
about [inaudible] our colonial
past as to our touristic present

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.040
where we don't like things to
go against the official image.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.570
And that's where we writers
are a bit not going [inaudible]

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:48.840
but that's the way it is.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.610
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Do you have
a favorite Mauritian writer,

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.960
other than yourself?

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.260
[Laughs].

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.560
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: [Laughs].

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.860
Nathacha Appanah is a great writer.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.690
I encourage all of
you to read her books.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.280
She has a book that
has been translated

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.440
in English that's called
"The Last Brother".

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.410
And it tells the story
of her, you know,

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:10.520
at one time when the Jews
were leaving Europe to go

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.950
to Palestine during
the Second World War,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:19.600
a boat was anchored by the British.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.040
And some of the, there were
1,000, a little over 1,000 Jews

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.070
that they sent to Mauritius.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.450 position:56%
And so this book tells the encounter
between the young Mauritian boy

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:38.280
who has lost his brothers in
[inaudible] and a young Jewish boy

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.100
who is imprisoned in Mauritius
and it's a beautiful book

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.040
and it's called "The Last Brother."

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.070
There's also [inaudible]
which is a powerful writer.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.940
[Inaudible].

00:45:53.940 --> 00:46:01.730
He wrote a book, a beautiful book
called [Foreign language spoken].

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:07.060
It's called in English it's "The
House that Walked to [inaudible]".

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.100
And it tells a lot about the inter
ethnic relationships in Mauritius

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.890
and it's really a very
interesting and beautiful book.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.630
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: I believe I
met [Inaudible] when she was

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:24.280
at the Penn Faulkner Africa
celebration last year in New York.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.550
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: She's a
very, very powerful writer.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.120
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: It would be
great if we could get her.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.060
You know, be the second
Mauritian writer.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.440
So tell me about your literary
journal that you founded.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.060
Is it still published?

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.980
And why did you create a magazine?

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.920
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I see that you've
been doing a lot of homework.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.220
[Laughs].

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.520
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Journalists.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.820
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Yes.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:55.890
We published, a few years back,
I was in a fit of [inaudible],

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.130
you know, people complaining,
saying, well, people don't read.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.810
We're not a reading, we
don't have a reading culture.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.290
If we don't buy books,
people don't read.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:09.060
And always I'm sitting there
whining and complaining and I said,

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.600
"Why don't we just do something,
try to do something about it?"

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.770
We had very few book
stores in Mauritius.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.220
They are located only
in the five main cities.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.510
And it's always the same people
who [inaudible] book store.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.700
A lot of people don't
go to a book store

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.100
because they feel like
it's not for them.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.530
Whereas I think literature
should be for everybody

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:36.930
because it has something to tell
in exchange with every one of us.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.380
And [inaudible] a group of friends,
writers, we sat down and we said,

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:46.040
"Why don't we try to do something
and launch a literary journal?"

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:53.760
With contemporary writers, but the
specificity of it is that we wanted

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.780
to have it going all over the
island to all those people

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.440
who don't read the new books.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.200
And the best way to do that,
I was working in a newspaper

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.840
so I thought the distribution
network

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.780 position:56%
of the newspapers is very effective.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:16.020 position:56%
It goes through 800 different places
throughout Mauritius and everywhere.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:21.260
And so we said, "Why don't we
just try to make that and printed

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:29.480
on newsprint and inserted in the
newspaper, distributed over the 800

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.880
and more [inaudible]
for Mauritians."

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.790
And it was a great experience
because I went out on the day,

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:43.090
the first day it went out and I
went to different places and I went

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:46.760
into that small shop where there
were construction workers working

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.090
on the construction site

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:55.050
just on the other side and
[inaudible] came in the shop

00:48:55.050 --> 00:49:00.500
to buy a sandwich or something
[inaudible], saw the journal

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.740
on the table there and he started
flipping through it and laughing

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.040
about things that were in it

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.180
and asking themselves things
about things they read.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:14.340
And that was a very
interesting thing

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:20.710
because I think it was
a way of [inaudible].

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.660
But that ended very quickly

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:30.150
because unfortunately some people
are a bit narrow minded to say.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:35.450
Some of us participate in that
[inaudible] where we're working

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:42.790
for another newspaper which was
in a way compliment of the one

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.180
who distributed us and
so there was a fight

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.090
between those two newspapers
which was so stupid.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:55.350
But then it ended that I still
think about launching that again,

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.740
about working on it again.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.480
And one of my other dreams is also

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.310
to have [inaudible] going
throughout the island

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.280
and bringing books everywhere
to little children [inaudible].

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.950
It's still an ongoing dream.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.250
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: So you
have a librarian streak?

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.550
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Yes.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.850
I do.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: That's very
interesting because I was the editor

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.800
of an inserted magazine
in a newspaper as well.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.100
So I'm beginning to think we -- .

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.400
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: So we have
a lot in common, don't we.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.700
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Yes.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.310
I think so.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:30.690
You translated "Tintin"
books into Mauritian Creole.

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.490
Why did you choose those works and
how were they received because,

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.970
as you know, that in contemporary
times some find "Tintin"

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:43.060
to be controversial or
specifically racist?

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.030
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I'll
start answering that -- .

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.580
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Did
you lose the mic?

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:59.000
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I think my
mic is not working [inaudible].

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.300
Thank you.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.570 position:56%
I'll start answering that by talking
about Creole which is something

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.820
that I, is very important to me.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:14.290 position:56%
Creole is the local language that
was born out [inaudible] of history.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:19.920
We had French [inaudible]
who brought in slaves

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:25.200
from different parts of Africa
to work in [inaudible] fields.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.800
And at one point they had
to find a way to communicate

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.230
so that's how Creole emerged
from the very, very difficult,

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.520
very violent period of our history.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.810
But it's fascinating to see
how people can create out of

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:45.120
that something that is
very lively and creative

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.890
which Creole language is to me.

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:52.450
More than 90% of people
in Mauritius speak Creole

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:57.120
but for a long it has been
considered as another language,

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:05.050
as [inaudible] has been looked
down, has been really entreated

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:10.440
which shouldn't be because it's
the mother tongue of most of us.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.320
But we have those prestige
languages like French and English

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.480
which people think is so important.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.970 position:56%
And there's always a kind of quarrel
between one language and the other

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:26.000
which shouldn't be when you
can have different languages

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.130
and international languages
and [inaudible] languages also.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.890
The result of that is that
we have [inaudible] growing

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.160
up in the Creole language and
then at five going to school

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.440
and we're taught everything in a
language which was totally foreign

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.040
to them which is English.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.270
So we went to school and it
was all history and mathematics

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:51.240
and everything in English
which amounts to here children

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.330 position:56%
in America going to school and being
taught everything, I don't know,

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.940
Portuguese or something like that.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.930
The result of that for a long
time 50% of our children were left

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:05.140
out school at the end of the
family cycles or around ten,

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.690
they were thrown out of school.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.170
And it's a terrible
thing for our country.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:16.520
But for a long time it was
correct to do it in a way

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.640
because there were very
labor intensive [inaudible]

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.220
with the sugarcane plantations.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:27.900
But now this has changed and we
need more people who are educated.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.420
And so there's a big fight
for Creole to be recognized

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.290
as a language and going
to our schools.

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:39.420
And I think that we, as writers,
have a great responsibility

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.220
to [inaudible] that fight.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:45.460
It was important for us to
translate it, though I had a friend

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.160
who translated all of Shakespeare's
plays in Creole as a way

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.040
of showing that Creole [inaudible].

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.480
It's as valid as a language
as English or French.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.600
We translated a lot.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.640
We created a lot of Creole.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.070
And the result is that nowadays

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:08.000
or as of two years ago Creole has
been introduced in our schools

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.470
and I think that's a very
great step for our country

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.040 position:56%
and for the children of our country.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.640
So translating "Tintin",
I translated, for example,

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.590
Beckett's "Waiting for Godot"
in Creole which is such a lot

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.970
of complexity even its
original language, it was like,

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.740
one time I was like taking my
hair out and why did you have

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.040
to go into such a [inaudible]?

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.340
It was very difficult.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:37.830
It was really a challenge.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.970
Translating "Tintin"
[inaudible] because

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:45.700 position:56%
"Tintin" is a very famous comic
that was created in Belgium by Herge

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:51.220
and has been translated in
over more than 100 languages.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.660 position:56%
And it's very [inaudible] countries.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.990
And translating it
in Creole was a way

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:05.690
of making other language exist
beside all those great languages.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:10.010
[Inaudible], yes, "Tintin" is
controversial in some ways,

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:16.040
for example, "Tintin" or in
Congo it is said to be racist.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:20.640
And some people have tried
to have it interdicted

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.300
and I'm totally against that.

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:27.020
I think it goes against my
freedom of knowing [inaudible]

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:34.150
because it tells about a period
of time and how people reacted

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:35.450
and formed at that period.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:47.880
Herge is a product of his time
and in a way he was reacting

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:56.560
and creating in conformity
with that period.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.070
He was, and at that
time [inaudible].

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:05.520
He wrote a book, another comic,
about men walking on the moon.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:13.120 position:56%
So all those refer what was in
people's minds and a certain section

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.530
of people's mind at that time.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.920
And for me that's interesting.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.090 position:56%
I think I have a right to know that.

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:24.390
It helps me understand in the same
way as I'm trying to understand

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:29.470
at the moment what is going
on, the minds and hearts all

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.770
over the world [inaudible].

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:37.340
And I wouldn't like to be, some
things to be taken out or off

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.170
by people who decide for me
what I have a right to read,

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:43.660
and learn, and have access to.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.010
And I think reading "Tintin" is
interesting to get in contact

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.470
with what certain people
were thinking at that time

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:55.250
about their prejudices,
about all of that.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.110
So it's also interesting to me.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.290
And I don't believe in
censorship in that way

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:06.890
because I think it would deprive
me of the right to take [inaudible]

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.040
and then make my own
opinion and decision.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.340
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Well,
I hope that at the end

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.490
of September you were able to
celebrate Banned Books Week

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.560
in which you take every book
that's ever been maligned

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.020
and you publicize it and celebrate.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:26.140
And everything that's considered
bad about it becomes good.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.250
But I'd like you to
translate [Inaudible].

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.840
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I will.

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.230
I hope so, yes.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:33.530
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Yeah.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:34.830
Sounds like that -- .

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:36.130
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Again.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:37.430
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: It went out again?

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:38.730
Oh, okay. All right.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:40.030
So let me ask my questions
and [inaudible].

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.330
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: [Inaudible].

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:42.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Let me ask my
question and I'll pass it on to you.

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.500
This is the last question.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.180 position:56%
How do you see the future for
Africa and African diaspora writers?

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.600
And what steps need to be
taken to broaden the readership

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:56.190
of African literature in
the international community?

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.160
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Hmm.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.460
This is a big question.

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:07.340
I think we have a problem
first with our own image

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.990
and I think we don't fit in
the [inaudible] ourselves

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:15.900
and what we create most of the time
because we feel like it must come

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:22.230
from America or even or France and
things like that to be interesting.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.030
One of the big challenges
I think will be

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.000
to create publishing
houses throughout Africa

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.040
that would have a great network
of distribution [inaudible].

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.570
Because even between African
countries we don't get

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:37.870
to read our own books.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:43.100
We don't get South African books
in Mauritius unless they go

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:47.040
through a publishing house
in New York or elsewhere.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.770
And I think that's where
we must try the same way

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:55.550
as we created a [inaudible],
to take things in our own hands

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:58.840
and stop waiting for international
publishers to become interested

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.800
in what we are writing
and what we are doing.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.350
So that's the future
that I think we have.

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:12.380
An interesting time ahead
of us to really try to put

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:15.060
to the word what we are
writing, what we are creating,

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:21.330
our very own voices and not
try to please a publisher based

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:25.190
in New York, or England, or in
France who's going to tell us,

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:29.600
"Well, you have to write along
these lines or along this current

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.890
to be able to sell,"
because I think our voices

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:40.240 position:56%
and our stories have their own way
of saying things, have their own way

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.540
and their own [inaudible].

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:46.140
And we were having this ongoing
discussion about what is universal

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:52.560
or not and I think that's a
strange way of putting things,

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.710
that we should, when writing,
thinking how universal am I being?

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:04.450
Steinbeck worked all his life from
his small comfy village and he's

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:08.490
so universal because when you
speak about the human being

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:10.970
in a way you're universal anyway.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.920
So we shouldn't be afraid
to be telling stories coming

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.020
from our countries [inaudible]
very old voices which might defer

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.830
from the international
trends of the moment.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:27.240
But to be able to do that we
have to give ourselves the means

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.710
of being published
and being distributed

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.050
and that's a great challenge.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:38.400
And I think that at a political
level should be [inaudible].

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:45.780
And because the cultural aspect
most of the times left out.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:55.020
And we should call our politicians
and [inaudible] people to account

01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:03.310
on that aspect also because it's,
as much as [inaudible] creative is

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:09.060
such an important part
of who we are.

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:15.660
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Before I
open it up I just wanted

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.990
to make a very small aside that
might be something that came

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:24.570
from another dimension but
today, had my father lived,

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.160
he would have been 93 years old.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.260
C. Clyde Ferguson, Jr., he was the
first Black ambassador to Uganda

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.050
and it was from Uganda that
I traveled to Mauritius.

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:37.700
And so somehow I feel like
somehow he probably said, "Hey,

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.490
on my birthday I'm going to get you
all together because you have a lot

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:43.830
in common, more than just
sharing the microphone."

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:48.210
At this point I would like to
open up to the audience, I,

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:53.570
I'm going to let Anya figure out
how to do that, for questions.

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:57.090
And, of course, I want to
say thank you to Shenaz

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:02.350
for what was just an incredibly
informative conversation.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.650
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Thanks to you.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.450
Thank you very much.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:10.010
[ Applause ]

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.450
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So we'll
open it up for questions.

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:12.750
I'll come to you with the mic

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.920
and then bring the
mic back to Shenaz so.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.850
We'll be patient with our mics.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.150
One. Just takes one.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.070
&gt;&gt; I'm curious.

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:31.400
You used the expression

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.790
that [inaudible] it's more there's
more freedom for you in [inaudible]

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:37.690
than there is and I just wondered.

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:39.090
What does that do when you write?

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.650
I know you just started
writing in English.

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:44.860
Does your writing change?

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.160
What about the writing process
changes for you when you write

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.460
in English as opposed to French?

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.560
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: [Inaudible]
if I'm writing in English,

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.460
it's too early to say I think.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:10.710
One thing I've noticed since I'm
here is I was very self conscious

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:14.420
at first about talking in English
because, about speaking English

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.100
because I'm not used
to speaking in English.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:22.500
I speak French and Creole and
my English is kind of rusty.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.800
And I said I felt like this
culture from [inaudible]

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.430
which is called a woman
withdraws and I feel

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:32.730
like that when I speak English.

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.030
I feel like I'm talking to someone
and at the same time I'm looking

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.220
for a word and I'm opening all
the drawers frantically trying

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.520
to find the right word.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.590
It's not coming out at that moment
so I have to find another way

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:47.050
around to try to say things and
very frustrating because you feel

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:52.190
like you're not getting across
exactly what you want to say.

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.220
And you sometimes feel like
[inaudible] seems stupid

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.050
or not accurate, what
you want to say.

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:03.150
It's kind of negotiation all the
time and what you want to say

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:06.460
and how it gets across on the spot.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.600
Writing is easier because then
you have time to go and look

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.870
for the word which you
don't have in conversation.

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.160
But it's also leading
to why I write I think

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.390
because you realize I'm not very,
people have that habit sometimes

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:25.670
of being to interact and kind
of ping pong the conversation

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:29.350
and very often I find myself like
five minutes afterward I'll say,

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:30.650
"Oh, that's what I wanted to say,"

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:33.070
but then [inaudible] the
person and say, "Come back.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.800 position:56%
That's what I wanted to say to you."

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:42.030
[Inaudible] you can so that's nice.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:49.690
What I found here is that
Anglophone people are not that,

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:54.390
what I say that?

01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:01.300
They don't hold you to account to
the purity of the language in a way

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.700
as much as French people do.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.720
The French when you don't
speak French correctly is,

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.810
you feel much more awkward
about it because there's, well,

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:14.120
there's an academy which
sets the standards.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:20.770
And people are very, are much
more precise about it and whereas

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:26.270
in English I feel like there are
so many Englishes and you are

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:28.140
so much more free with it.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.800
When I read the book, and
we're talking about it now,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.600
and Pria here is from South
Africa, we are waiting very excited

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.210
for Arundhati Roy's next
book which is due next year.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:43.620
When I read "The God
of Small Things",

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:48.580
which is this wonderful book,
it was such a revelation to me

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.900 position:56%
that you could write English that
way because just these English words

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:59.810
and she completes them or turns
them into Indian way of speaking

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.660
and she just use so free with that.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:07.370
In French literature you have
a writer called [Inaudible]

01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:12.650
who wrote a book, is
from Martinique I think,

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.090
who wrote a book called [Inaudible]

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:18.060
and he got the [inaudible]
and people were exclaiming

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.420
about how he was enriching
French language and being kind

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:26.810
of bringing Creole structures
and Creole words into French

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.740
and it was like a [inaudible].

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.540
In English it's done all the time.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.470
So I feel like there's
much more freedom there.

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:40.660
And writing literature for me is so
much about creating language also

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.810
because we're so often
confronted with

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:48.520
even when we're writing now
in own language with the,

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.820
how words are inadequate
sometimes, how the words we have,

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.050 position:56%
the words that exist, the words that
we haven't had, are not sufficient,

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:02.040
are not adequate enough to
tell what we want to tell.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.660
And so we feel like
creating new words or trying

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:08.600
to find other ways of
telling the stories.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.220
And at the moment I really feel
like in English there's more space

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.610
for that so I have
to reflect on that

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:18.070
and see what I'm going
to do afterwards.

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:22.000
Am I going to claim that freedom
in English or trying to [inaudible]

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.870
in French because, well, writing,

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:28.410
it depends the objective
of your writing.

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:31.560
If you write for yourself,
my boys are full of things

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.560
that I know I'd never
send to a publisher

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.090
because it won't get published.

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:43.140
It's nothing current of the moment
or [inaudible] but then [inaudible]

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.320
if you want to be published your
publisher is going to tell you,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.040
"Well, that's not in
the trend of things,"

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.350
or what do you change,
what do you not accept.

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.040
It's very not easy.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.860
But I feel, I really feel

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:05.760
like Anglophone [inaudible] there's
much more vitality at the moment.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.510
And that was a wonderful,
wonderful presentation

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.640
and I loved your reading as well.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.530
I wanted to ask you, and perhaps
in a way you suggested it,

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:27.170
are there particular themes,
especially, and it's a bit

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.080
of a follow-up to what you just
said, are there particular themes

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:36.580
that you would like to write about
that you may have already written

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.500
about or that you're
hesitant to write about?

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.500
But are there certain things
in your writing that you would

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.570
like as you're looking into
the future to write about?

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.130
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: I usually say
that I don't write about themes.

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:59.680
I don't think I'm a
writer with messages.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.850
I write a story.

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.150
Very often it starts
with a sentence.

01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:07.770
I'll have a sentence walking
in my head for days and weeks,

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.370
and sometimes months
and I don't know why.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:14.560
But it's there.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.860 position:56%
It's there for a reason [inaudible].

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:24.500
I know there's something that
goes through it and why do write?

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:30.930
Why do we sit down at one
point and come to the computer

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:35.590
or the blank page instead
of going out, having fun,

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.010
walking, swimming, anything?

01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:41.550
It's because I think at
one point we feel an urge

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:47.290 position:56%
that is very deep to tell something.

01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:49.110
Why? I'm not quite sure.

01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:53.310
And I'm not quite sure
I want to know.

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:56.780
I think [inaudible] I'm
afraid of knowing too much

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:03.370
and losing the ability to
write [inaudible] looks

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.040
like this one's [inaudible].

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.360
I'll speak up.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:13.460
It's just that it's a mystery for
me how it happens, why it happens.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.760
[Inaudible].

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.730
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: On the podium?

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:19.400
&gt;&gt; On the podium.

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:21.950
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: That mic works.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.910
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: Can you hear me?

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:27.070
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: It's a very -- .

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:30.490
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:34.710
It's a very mysterious thing
for me and I like it that way.

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:39.280
I don't quite know how it
happens, why it happens.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.120
For me it's like a, I have
a very sweet tooth, also.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.420
I like eating.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.360
And I like comparing writing to
that cake, that multi-layered cake,

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.660
or the [foreign language spoken].

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.960
I'm referring French.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.780
Things happen to us every day.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:59.240
We walk and overhear a conversation
and someone makes a confidence

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.820
to us and we see a thing.

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.120
We hear music.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.020
We get a feeling of something.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.960
And all these kinds of
pies look like that,

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.750
well, at least that's for me.

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:12.040
And at one time it gets
quite concrete and I feel

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.130
like there's a story
there that's taking shape.

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:19.870
And the precise moment for
me that it becomes writing

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:22.310
because I write it out of my head.

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:25.650
I walk around and I
write stories in my head.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:30.660
And there's one particular point
when I'm reading and I feel like,

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:35.480
you know, on a TV screen when
there's something interfering

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.130
with image, I feel
exactly like that.

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:41.110
I'm reading and I have
the characters in my head

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:44.310
who are talking to the
characters in the book.

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:45.840
And it's like, and I say, "No.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.140
No. You stop.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.670
You put the book down.

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:51.860
You write what you have to write."

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.360
But it's a very, very
mysterious process.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.490
I don't wake up one
morning and say, "Okay.

01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:02.690
Today I'm going to write a
novel about abused women,

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:04.950
or violence against children,
or things like that."

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.890 position:56%
But it's there, it's in the writing.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.570
And it's in all that I live.

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.350
It's in all that makes me react.

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:13.480
It's in all my fears.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.790
It's in all my doubts.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:18.760
I think I write a lot with,
because I'm not satisfied

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.030
with the world that it is.

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.560
I write a lot with
what I don't understand

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.300
and that's the only thing I know.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.290
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: And I believe
since the mics have died

01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:35.090
that perhaps this concludes
our program.

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:41.990
[Laughs]. I did just want to
say that in kind of dovetailing

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:47.720
on what you'd said, I saw a tee
shirt about two days ago that said,

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.680
"English is difficult
but it can be understood

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.200
through thorough thought
though," which is a little bit

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.220
of alliteration there, you know,

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.450
with the same letters
and, you know, so English.

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:02.210
As a former English
professor, it is difficult

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:07.400
but it does have many
nuances and facets.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.830 position:56%
And French, well, when you speak to
French people who don't do it right,

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.130
they don't understand you.

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:14.430
&gt;&gt; Shenaz Patel: [Laughs].

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:15.730
That's true.

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:18.050
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: But if
there are no more questions,

01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.500 position:56%
can we once again thank Shenaz Patel

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.690
for her presentation
and her presence here.

eighteenth for the Ghanaian writer,

Kwame Dawes, who will
be in conversation

with the area specialist,
Angel Batiste.

We hope you will return.

We may have December
surprise, maybe.

for coming this afternoon

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.160

more African literature.
