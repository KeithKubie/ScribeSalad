JENNIFER KOHL: Welcome!

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.880
Who's excited to be
here this morning?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.320
[CHEERING]

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.290
What started off as
two chapters in 2007

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.410
on opposite sides of the
world has gained momentum

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.660
as other organizers
like yourselves

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.860
have built GDG chapters all over
the world in their local areas.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.740
STACY DEVINO: Honestly, my
favorite thing about GDG global

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.170
is meeting people from
all over the world

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.920
and really understand what
is different and unique

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.785
and what they bring that I
might never encounter otherwise.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:35.160
VITALY ZASADNYY:
The main goal is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.743
to connect with the
great communities.

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:38.920
That unique chance to
see all these people,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.250
all the elites in one place.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.910
I find this very unique, and
to share our own experience

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.350
because we have work to share.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.350
NITYA NARASIMHAN: We have
three goals that we've

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.640
been trying to achieve.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.100
One is how do you get actionable
learning for people who

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.511
want to transition into tech?

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.010
How do you get
representation so you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.410
get under-represented
people showing up?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.720
And basically, now what
makes us do what we do?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.220
Which is like, you
know, we all have

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.960
a passion for getting
people, empowering

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.257
them to do other things.

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:06.925

RAYAN AL ZAHAB:
Well, if you want

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.460
to have an
[INAUDIBLE] community,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.300
it has to be self-sustainable,
able to actually scale

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.190
in the minimum effort possible.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.280
So focus on your community,
but get independent

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.510
and self-sustainable.
