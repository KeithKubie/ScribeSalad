world challenges are of the city it's
 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.810
world challenges are of the city it's
not just an academic exercise we live in

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820
not just an academic exercise we live in
 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.620
not just an academic exercise we live in
the real world

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630

needing to really challenge how can we

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170
needing to really challenge how can we
 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.930
needing to really challenge how can we
get ahead of that how can we monitor how

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
get ahead of that how can we monitor how
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.260
get ahead of that how can we monitor how
can we see what is happening those those

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
can we see what is happening those those
 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.150
can we see what is happening those those
incremental movements in this slope

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160
incremental movements in this slope
 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.310
incremental movements in this slope
before something really catastrophic

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320
before something really catastrophic
 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.650
before something really catastrophic
happens I'm reaching out to this

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
happens I'm reaching out to this
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.080
happens I'm reaching out to this
institution finding out how we can use

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090
institution finding out how we can use
 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.820
institution finding out how we can use
that understanding how global climate

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830
that understanding how global climate
 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.610
that understanding how global climate
change affects things like landslides I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620
change affects things like landslides I
 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.650
change affects things like landslides I
didn't know actually that the landslides

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660
didn't know actually that the landslides
 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.480
didn't know actually that the landslides
are a consequence of some of the global

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
are a consequence of some of the global
 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.090
are a consequence of some of the global
climate change that we've experienced so

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100
climate change that we've experienced so
 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.320
climate change that we've experienced so
how do we understand what those

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330
how do we understand what those
 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.140
how do we understand what those
connections are I have feeling bridges

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
connections are I have feeling bridges
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.990
connections are I have feeling bridges
and railings &amp; stairs here in the real

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000
and railings &amp; stairs here in the real
 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.540
and railings &amp; stairs here in the real
world and and working with this

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
world and and working with this
 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.710
world and and working with this
institution working through the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
institution working through the
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.270
institution working through the
engineering working through through

materials testing and other kinds of

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050
materials testing and other kinds of
 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.500
materials testing and other kinds of
applications to see you know can we do

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510
applications to see you know can we do
 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.660
applications to see you know can we do
things crazy things like 3d print

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670
things crazy things like 3d print
 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.800

stairs so we are the testbed we're happy

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120
stairs so we are the testbed we're happy
 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.600
stairs so we are the testbed we're happy
to be the testbed for this institution

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610
to be the testbed for this institution
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.180
to be the testbed for this institution
we are as I think has been said before

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190
we are as I think has been said before
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.130
we are as I think has been said before
we're the double black diamond of cities

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140
we're the double black diamond of cities
 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.710
we're the double black diamond of cities
right if you can do it here you can do

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720
right if you can do it here you can do
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.710
right if you can do it here you can do
it anyplace across the globe so we're

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720
it anyplace across the globe so we're
 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.680
it anyplace across the globe so we're
happy for this partnership we're happy

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690
happy for this partnership we're happy
 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.450
happy for this partnership we're happy
to be that place to be the real world

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
to be that place to be the real world
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.370
to be that place to be the real world
but you can test these ideas and we need

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380
but you can test these ideas and we need
 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.470
but you can test these ideas and we need
the knowledge that this institution and

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480
the knowledge that this institution and
 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.840
the knowledge that this institution and
that this institute brings we're in an

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850
that this institute brings we're in an
 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.690
that this institute brings we're in an
era of big data we're about to get heaps

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700
era of big data we're about to get heaps
 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.550
era of big data we're about to get heaps
of it and have no capacity really to

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560
of it and have no capacity really to
 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.290
of it and have no capacity really to
understand that so to partner with this

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300
understand that so to partner with this
 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.790
understand that so to partner with this
institution to partner with all of you

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800
institution to partner with all of you
 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.010
institution to partner with all of you
in this room to help us understand

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020
in this room to help us understand
 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.500
in this room to help us understand
what's happening to help us intervene in

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510
what's happening to help us intervene in
 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.150
what's happening to help us intervene in
ways that really serve the underlying

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160
ways that really serve the underlying
 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.330
ways that really serve the underlying
values of our city and contribute to the

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340
values of our city and contribute to the
 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.150
values of our city and contribute to the
success of our city residents so happy

looking forward to the next year and
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.430
looking forward to the next year and
what will happen and fewer landslides if

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440
what will happen and fewer landslides if
 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.750
what will happen and fewer landslides if
we can do that so thank you

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760
we can do that so thank you
