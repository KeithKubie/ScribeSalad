00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
&gt;&gt; So are role models important? I think not
only are they important they are vital. I

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.670
think they need to be yournger and they need
to speak much more openly with the corridors

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.800
of power. So when you look at this region
and you see the make up, it's not just we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.739
just not have to have gender equity but also
youth equity. We need to have young teenagers

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.079
and young adults coming out and speaking vocally
about the needs of the community. So we know

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.870
how to respond to the next generation not
just the current generation. So we absolutely

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
need leaders within the youth here and we
need to be able to partner with them both

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.989
in the West and other countries around the
world. Thank you so much.
