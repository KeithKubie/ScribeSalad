00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.293
- [Voiceover] We already know a little bit

00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:02.467
about square roots.

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:03.800
For example, if I were to tell you

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.388
that seven squared is equal to 49,

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:09.864
that's equivalent to saying that seven

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:13.668
is equal to the square root of 49.

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:16.269
The square root essentially unwinds

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.110
taking the square of something.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.565
In fact, we could write it like this.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.651
We could write the square root of 49,

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.709
so this is whatever number times itself

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.366
is equal to 49.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.027
If I multiply that number times itself,

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:32.281
if I square it, well I'm going to get 49.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.422
And that's going to be
true for any number,

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:36.974
not just 49.

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:41.683
If I write the square root of X

00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:43.981
and if I were to square it,

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.429
that's going to be equal to X

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.781
and that's going to be true for any X

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.002
for which we can evaluate the square root,

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.080
evaluate the principle root.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.236
Now typically and as you advance in math

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:00.236
you're going to see that this will change,

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.985
but typically you say,
okay if I'm going to take

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.805
the square root of something,
X has to be non-negative.

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:09.395
X has to be non-negative.

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:13.972
This is going to change
once we start thinking about

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:15.901
imaginary and complex numbers,

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.671
but typically for the
principle square root,

00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:21.464
we assume that whatever's
under the radical,

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:25.509
whatever's under here, is
going to be non-negative

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.902
because it's hard to square a number

00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:28.740
at least the numbers that we know about,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.580
it's hard to square them
and get a negative number.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.974
So for this thing to be
defined, for it to make sense,

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:37.106
it's typical to say
that, okay we need to put

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:39.184
a non-negative number in here.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.225
But anyway, the focus of this video

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:44.109
is not on the square root, it's
really just to review things

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.863
so we can start thinking
about the cube root.

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:50.201
And as you can imagine,
where does the whole notion

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:53.768
of taking a square of something
or a square root come from?

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:55.147
Well it comes from the notion of finding

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.784
the area of a square.

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:00.580
If I have a square like this
and if this side is seven,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.264
well if it's a square, all the
sides are going to be seven.

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:05.687
And if I wanted to find the area of this,

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:09.078
it would be seven times
seven or seven squared.

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.944
That would be the area of this.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.421
Or if I were to say, well what is

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.166
if I have a square, if I have,

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.956
and that doesn't look
like a perfect square,

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:21.608
but you get the idea, all the
sides are the same length.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:25.039
If I have a square with area X.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.037
If the area here is X,

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:29.232
what are the lengths of
the sides going to be?

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.425
Well it's going to be square root of X.

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:33.260
All of the sides are
going to be the square root of X,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.964
so it's going to be the square root
of X by the square root of X

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:37.776
and this side is going to
be the square root of X as well

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:39.261
and that's going to be
the square root of X as well.

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:41.943
So that's where the term
square root comes from,

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:44.277
where the square comes from.

00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:46.363
Now what do you think cube root?

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:47.864
Well same idea.

00:02:47.864 --> 00:02:49.775
If I have a cube.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.055
If I have a cube.

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:55.317
Let me do my best attempt at
drawing a cube really fast.

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:59.314
If I have a cube and a
cube, all of it's dimensions

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:03.669
have the same length so this
is a two, by two, by two cube,

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.876
what's the volume over here.

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:10.348
Well the volume is going to
be two, times two, times two,

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:15.232
which is two to the
third power or two cubed.

00:03:15.232 --> 00:03:17.014
This is two cubed.

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:18.895
That's why they use the word cubed

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:20.879
because this would be the volume of a cube

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.379
where each of its sides have length two

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.370
and this of course is
going to be equal to eight.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.233
But what if we went the other way around?

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.740
What if we started with the cube?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.979
What if we started with this volume?

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.809
What if we started with a cube's volume

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:40.450
and let's say the volume
here is eight cubic units,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.930
so volume is equal to eight

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.857
and we wanted to find
the lengths of the sides.

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:51.180
So we wanted to figure out what X is

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.606
cause that's X, that's X, and that's X.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:56.810
It's a cube so all the
dimensions have the same length.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.512
Well there's two ways that
we could express this.

00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:01.280
We could say that X times X times X

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.158
or X to the third power is equal to eight

00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:08.640
or we could use the cube root symbol,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.837
which is a radical with a
little three in the right place.

00:04:12.677 --> 00:04:15.838
Or we could write that X is equal to,

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.526
it's going to look very
similar to the square root.

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.238
This would be the square root of eight,

00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:21.526
but to make it clear,
they were talking about

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:23.914
the cube root of eight, we would write

00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:26.054
a little three over there.

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:27.261
In theory for square root,

00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:28.782
you could put a little two over here,

00:04:28.782 --> 00:04:29.656
but that'd be redundant.

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:30.825
If there's no number here,

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.715
people just assume that
it's the square root.

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:36.641
But if you're figuring out the cube root

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.775
or sometimes you say the third root,

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:39.743
well then you have to say,

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:41.738
well you have to put this
little three right over here

00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:46.161
in this little notch in the
radical symbol right over here.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.354
And so this is saying X
is going to be some number

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.617
that if I cube it, I get eight.

00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:52.476
So with that out of the way,

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:54.544
let's do some examples.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.583
Let's say that I have...

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.174
Let's say that I want to calculate

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.284
the cube root of 27.

00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:04.752
What's that going to be?

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:07.540
Well if say that this is
going to be equal to X,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.902
this is equivalent to
saying that X to the third

00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:14.355
or that 27 is equal to
X to the third power.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.491
So what is X going to be?

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:19.653
Well X times X times X is equal to 27,

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:23.154
well the number I can think of is three,

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:26.850
so we would say that X, let
me scroll down a little bit,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.953
X is equal to three.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:31.156
Now let me ask you a question.

00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:34.413
Can we write something like...

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:36.355
Can we pick a new color?

00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:41.355
The cube root of, let
me write negative 64.

00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.359
I already talked about
that if we're talking

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.495
the square root, it's fairly typical that

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:47.097
hey you put a negative number in there

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.850
at least until we learn
about imaginary numbers,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.121
we don't know what to do with it.

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:52.605
But can we do something with this?

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:57.342
Well if I cube something,
can I get a negative number?

00:05:57.342 --> 00:05:58.444
Sure.

00:05:58.914 --> 00:06:01.173
So if I say this is equal to X,

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:04.445
this is the same thing as
saying that negative 64

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.006
is equal to X to the third power.

00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:09.097
Well what could X be?

00:06:09.097 --> 00:06:11.540
Well what happens if
you take negative four

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.180
times negative four times negative four?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.523
Negative four times four is positive 16,

00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:21.297
but then times negative
four is negative 64

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.423
is equal to negative 64.

00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:25.103
So what could X be here?

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:27.722
Well X could be equal to negative four.

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:31.112
X could be equal to negative four.

00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:32.708
So based on the math that we know so far

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:37.708
you actually can take the cube
root of a negative number.

00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:39.885
And just so you know, you
don't have to stop there.

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:40.904
You could take a fourth root

00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:42.471
and in this case you'd have a four here,

00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:43.469
a fifth root, a sixth root,

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.385
a seventh root of numbers

00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:48.368
and we'll talk about that later

00:06:48.368 --> 00:06:49.761
in your mathematical career.

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:50.771
But most of what you're going to see

00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:51.770
is actually going to be square root

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.627
and every now and then you're
going to see a cube root.

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:54.962
Now you might be saying, well hey look,

00:06:54.962 --> 00:06:58.511
you know, you just knew that
three to the third power is 27,

00:06:58.511 --> 00:06:59.768
you took the cube root, you get X,

00:06:59.768 --> 00:07:02.046
is there any simple way to do this?

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:04.609
And like you know if i give
you an arbitrary number.

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:07.000
If I were to just say, I don't know,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
if I were to say cube root of 125.

00:07:12.416 --> 00:07:13.989
And the simple answer is,

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.542
well the easiest way to
actually figure this out

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.312
is actually just to do a factorization

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.998
and particular prime
factorization of this thing

00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:25.206
right over here and then
you would figure it out.

00:07:25.206 --> 00:07:29.369
So you would say, okay
well 125 is five times 25,

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:31.624
which is five times five.

00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:36.024
Alright, so this is the same
thing as the cube root of five

00:07:36.024 --> 00:07:37.765
to the third power, which of course,

00:07:37.765 --> 00:07:41.979
is going to be equal to five.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:43.302
If you have a much larger number here,

00:07:43.302 --> 00:07:47.905
yes, there's no very simple way to compute

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:49.798
what a cube root or a fourth root

00:07:49.798 --> 00:07:51.755
or a fifth root might
be and even square root

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:53.960
can get quite difficult.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.305
There's no very simple
way to just calculate it

00:07:56.305 --> 00:07:59.248
the way that you might
multiply things or divide it.
