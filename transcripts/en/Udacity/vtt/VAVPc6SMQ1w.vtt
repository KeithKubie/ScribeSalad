00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.719
Let's see how you did with the concept map for

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.270
lesson three. Starting here with the human genome, there's 98%

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.200
of it approximately that's non-coding. It doesn't code for anything.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.660
Then about 2% of it is protein coding. But all these

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.170
regions, as part of the genome, are actually made of

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.360
DNA, which we learned a lot about in lesson two. And

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.400
in lesson four, we will learn more about this non-coding

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.380
region. But here in lesson three, we learned about the protein

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.670
coding regions of the human genome, which are

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.730
divided into genes. Genes can have different sequences, so

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.710
they can have different versions. They can code for

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.860
different things, and we call these different versions alleles.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.950
This is the word will keep coming back to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.900
in this course. And alleles originate from mutations which

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.530
we'll learn about more in lesson six. Now, a

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.760
protein coding gene is composed of two major kinds

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.680
of sequence: introns and exons. The introns are spliced out

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320
of the message that's going to be produced, and exons are going to be kept in

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.110
the messenger RNA, or mRNA. Now the process that synthesizes mRNA from

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.460
the gene DNA is transcription. And it's the first part of the central dogma.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270
Now, once you have an mRNA transcribed

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.280
from the DNA gene, it's going to be translated

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.500
by ribosomes into protein. Proteins are the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.780
building blocks of cells. And the essential process

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.920
of genes to RNA or DNA to RNA to protein is called the Central Dogma.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.720
Now, RNA is similar to DNA, in that

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.400
it's made up of nucleotides though not deoxynucleotides.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.111
And there are four types of nitrogenous bases here. Adenine, which can base-pair

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:51.820
with uracil. Or U, a new nitrogenous base in the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.440
RNA alphabet. And we still have guanine that compare with cytosine.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.320
Now, our mRNA transcript is actually divided into

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.510
codons, which are groups of three letters of nucleotides.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.240
There are a total of 64 combinations of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.670
codons that are possible, based on this grouping of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.840
three. And these 64 combinations are interpreted as

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.950
the genetic code. And in the genetic code, we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.220
have three stop codons, one start codon, and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.200
all the rest code for 20 different types of

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.540
amino acids. These amino acids make up proteins,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.880
and these protiens are the building blocks of your

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.042
cells that make up who you are. I hope this helps clear

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:41.220
up some of the major concepts you learned about in lesson three.
