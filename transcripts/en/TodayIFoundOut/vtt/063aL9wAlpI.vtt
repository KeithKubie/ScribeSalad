00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.829
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:08.200
In the video today, we're looking at why the
mass avoidance of some business is called

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.420
boycotting.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.360
This term was named after a nineteenth century
Englishman, Captain Charles C. Boycott (who

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.770
originally had the surname “Boycatt,”
but the family changed the spelling when he

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.380
was nine years old).

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.010
If you guessed that at a certain point Captain
Boycott became quite unpopular with the masses,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.030
you’re correct.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.120
Shortly before Boycott would find himself
boycotted, the situation in Ireland was that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.850
just 0.2% of the population owned almost every
square inch of land in Ireland.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.210
Most of the owners of the land also didn’t
live in Ireland but simply rented their land

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.280
out to tenant farmers, generally on one-year
leases.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.070
In the mid-nineteenth century, many of these
tenant farmers banded together with three

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.899
goals: “Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure, and
Free Sale”.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
One particular organization that emerged in
the 1870s pushing these “Three F’s,”

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.269
among other things, was the Irish National
Land League.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.789
This brings us to September of 1880.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.610
The leader of the Land League, Parliament
member Charles Stewart Parnell, was giving

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270
a speech to many of the members of that organization.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.000
During the speech, after the crowd, in true
mob-like fashion, expressed that any tenant

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.550
farmer who bids on an evicted neighbor’s
land should be killed, Parnell humbly suggested

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.290
that another tact should be used.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
Rather than murder the individual, he proposed
it would be more Christian to simply “shun

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.310
him on the fair green and in the market place,
and even in the place of worship, by leaving

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.940
him alone, by putting him in moral Coventry,
by isolating him from the rest of the country,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.860
as if he were the leper of old – you must
show him your detestation of the crime he

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.860
committed.”

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.320
Essentially, they were to be boycotted, but
they didn’t have that term yet, though they

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.650
wouldn’t have to wait long.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.950
The first documented reference of “Boycott”
being used as a verb was just two weeks after

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.950
that speech.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.930
At the time, Captain Charles Boycott, now
retired from the military, was working as

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.460
a land manager for the third Earl of Erne,
John Crichton.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.480
The harvest that year wasn’t turning out
well for many farmers, so as a concession

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.690
to tenants, Boycott decided to reduce their
rent by 10%.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.009
Rather than accept this, his tenants demanded
a 25% reduction, which Boycott’s boss, the

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.700
Earl of Erne, refused.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.769
In the end, 11 of the Earl’s tenants didn’t
pay their rent.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.260
Thus, a mere three days after this speech,
Boycott began the process of serving eviction

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.360
notices to those who hadn’t paid, sending
out the Constabulary to do this.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.300
Needless to say, this did not go over well
with the already riled up masses.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.280
Upon the tenants realizing eviction notices
were going out, the women of the area began

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.299
throwing things such as rocks and manure at
those delivering the notices until the Constabulary

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.019
left without being able to serve all the notices
to the head of the households, which was required

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.170
by law for the eviction notice to be considered
served.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.030
Without the notices delivered, nobody had
to leave their homes.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.239
Next, the teaming masses decided to use Parnell’s
proposed social ostracism against Boycott

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.950
and anyone who worked under him.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.810
Soon, those who worked under Boycott began
leaving his service, often with those workers

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.889
being coerced and threatened by others until
they, too, joined in the ostracizing of Boycott.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.790
This ultimately left Boycott with a large
estate to manage, but no workers to farm the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.680
remainder of the crops.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.329
Other businesses also stopped being willing
to do business with Boycott; he couldn’t

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.999
even buy food locally and getting it from
afar was difficult as carriage drivers, ship

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.200
captains, and letter handlers on the whole
wouldn’t work with him.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.879
In late November, this led to Boycott being
forced to leave his home, fleeing to Dublin.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.549
Even there, he was met with hostility and
businesses that were willing to serve him

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.580
were threatened with being “boycotted.”

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.400
The practice of boycotting spread, and within
a decade whenever a business did something

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.159
to the dislike of the Irish National Land
League, the business would quickly find themself

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.310
boycotted, with the name for the practice
sticking due to the wide publication of Boycott’s

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.579
plight in the news.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.999
By 1888, just eight years after Boycott was
first boycotted, the word even made it into

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:53.620
the New English Dictionary on Historical Principles,
better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.560
The word spread to other European languages
and quickly made it over to America when Captain

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.139
Boycott visited friends in Virginia, attempting
to do so in secret -registering under the

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.629
name “Charles Cunningham.”

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.500
The newspapers caught wind of his arrival
anyway and widely publicized his history,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.480
which got the term firmly planted in American
English as well.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.409
BONUS FACT

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.579
Boycott did get his crops harvested the year
he was boycotted, finding 50 workers from

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.730
out of town to come harvest his crops.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.940
The problem was that the locals did not take
kindly to this, so the government had to step

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.569
in and had nearly one thousand soldiers escort
the workers and protect them while they worked.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.900
Funny enough, this ended up costing the British
government about £10,000.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.620
How much were the crops worth?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:49.970
About £500.
