Hi I'm Gabrielle, and I'm going to be
your instructor for UIKit Fundamentals.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.490
If you're taking this course, you should
have built at least one single view app

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.710
that adheres to the NBC design pattern,
which means, you know how to add objects

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.280
and storyboard and connect them in your
view controller and you're familiar with

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.550
some basic features of UIKit,
the iOS user interface library.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670
If you're not familiar
with these concepts,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.360
we recommend you take Intro to
iOS Development with Swift first.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.090
A link to that course is
in the instructor's notes.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.530
This course is all about becoming
more comfortable with UIKit and

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.050
mastering its most
widely used components.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.150
Our primary goal is to give you lots
of opportunities for hands-on coding.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.080
And you'll build lots of small apps
to help you learn specific concepts.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.130
At the end of the course, you'll have
the skills required to build a mean

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.370
generating app from the bottom up.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.620
Let's take a detailed look at
this app in the next video.
