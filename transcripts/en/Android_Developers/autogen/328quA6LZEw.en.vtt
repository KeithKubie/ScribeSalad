00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.300
 [Background Music] 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.000
 Menon: WeVideo was prepared 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 For the purpose of providing the possibility of listing digital stories 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.866
 Creating videos for everyone and anywhere. 

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.200
 It started on Android 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 Because we noticed there was no attractive application on this system 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.800
 To create videos. 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
 Add to that the great speed with which the basic Android systems were deployed 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.766
 Which made us choose it at first. 

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.933
 Since then, most of our investments have gone 

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.533
 In the development of smart phones 

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.666
 To Android. 

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.366
 We've made a great distinction among other Android apps 

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.666
 As we provide you with access to all the capabilities of the device 

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.366
 Through our application. 

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.400
 You can capture different clips and crop these clips, 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.733
 We've done this with the Android platform 

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.666
 Which allowed us to access OpenGL air, 

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.533
 So we were able to make a presentation and preview 

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.833
 In real time. 

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.733
 Since launching our new application, 

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.100
 We have made very impressive investments on mobile. 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.533
 Earnings on Android have doubled every two months. 

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.700
 85% of our users work on Android. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.000
 When we introduced the multidimensional design, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.933
 We decided to rethink the design of the application, 

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.200
 And rethink the user experience 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.833
 To raise it to a new level. 

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.800
 Tsarigurdsiv: Many of the concepts of design have been multidimensional 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.566
 Our true resonance. 

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.000
 We were able to create a pleasant experience 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Users. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.466
 As a result, 

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:13.633
 We've seen a 100% increase in user interaction. 

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:15.166
 Represents the ability to reply to reviews 

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.666
 Great feature. 

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.766
 Check every day for all reviews 

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.400
 We analyze the data that we receive. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.933
 More importantly, it is 

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.800
 When someone is exposed to a problem 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.500
 We can provide direct assistance. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100
 Feeling great to see someone 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.600
 Gives you 1 star to review 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.633
 Then turns to give you four or five stars. 

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:35.266
 We love testing on the Play Store. 

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.800
 For example, we recently conducted 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.100
 An update to the screen shots 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.566
 Using colors and text, 

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.800
 This has resulted in an increase in the conversion rate 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.233
 Reached 50%. 

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.300
 It's important to provide your app in different languages 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
 To succeed in penetrating the global market. 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.333
 We have seen an increase in the installation ratio of up to 200% within regions 

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.733
 We benefited from our application 

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.433
 And subscriptions to the Play Store. 

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.800
 Recently, we reviewed the in-app purchase flow level. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.066
 We wanted to know if we could convert more 

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.633
 To buy our products at an additional cost. 

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.133
 We decided to change the background colors, font size 

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.400
 For all elements. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.800
 We were able to publish quickly 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500
 We started selling within a few days. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.633
 We noticed an increase in the conversion rate 

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.066
 Amounted to 60%. 

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.566
 Menon: The basic Android system was great 

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.866
 Through which we managed to provide a structured application. 

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.866
 Through the deployment of applications that are characterized by speed, 

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.533
 Play Store card experiments, 

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.833
 Comments we receive from users, 

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.800
 The ability to invest with Google Wallet, 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.733
 We successfully managed to get an increase in 

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.366
 Install rate and profit rate.
