MAX SALTONSTALL: Hello.

00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.496
My name is Max
Saltonstall and I am here

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:05.560
with four awesome
authors from Tor.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.520
Can you each just introduce
yourselves briefly

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.346
and tell me a little bit
about what your book is like?

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:14.160
ELIZABETH BEAR: I
am Elizabeth Bear.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.020
2015 is significant
for me because it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.840
is my 10th year as a published
novelist and I'm still here.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.910
Still here, still clinging on.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.130
My newest book is
called "Karen Memory."

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.690
It is a Wild West
steampunk adventure

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.690
novel starring
heroic saloon girls

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780
versus disaster capitalists.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.650
And I've been describing it
as sort of like "Leverage"

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.774
if the good guys were hookers.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.440
MAX SALTONSTALL:
That's pretty accurate.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.312
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yeah.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.750
JAMES CAMBIAS: So
I'm Jim Cambias.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.890
My new book, it's my second
novel, it's called "Corsair."

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.900
And it is a near-future,
hard SF take

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.310
on a classic science-fiction
trope of space piracy.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.860
Basically, I
figured out that you

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.697
can make space pirates
work if you leave

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:02.780
the pirates on the ground.

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:11.120
So it's a comic thriller about
Captain Black, the space pirate

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.972
and his nemesis Captain
Santiago of the Air Force.

00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:16.430
BRIAN STAVELEY:
I'm Brian Staveley.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.445
I write epic fantasy.

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:19.070
The first book, "The
Emperor's Blades,"

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.910
follows three adult children
of a murdered emperor.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.580
There's a monk, a Special
Forces soldier who

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.230
rides on these giant
birds, and a politician,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.180
and they're trying to figure
out who killed their father

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.580
and not get killed themselves.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.790
Second book that's here is
"The Providence of Fire."

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.540
MAX GLADSTONE: Hi.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.600
I'm Max Gladstone.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
I write post-industrial
fantasy novels, sort of Gandalf

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.330
meets Grisham.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.720
We have dead gods with
shareholders committees,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.250
and wizards with
pinstripe suits,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.350
and bankruptcy
transactions reinterpreted

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.920
as sort of necromancy
performed on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.420
enormous semi-sentient spiritual
entities, that sort of thing.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.880
Basically, the workaday world.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.020
And my new book,
"Last First Snow,"

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.740
is about human sacrifice
and zoning laws.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.117
MAX SALTONSTALL: Awesome.

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:05.200
BRIAN STAVELEY: Full stop.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.790
MAX GLADSTONE: Basically.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.889
MAX SALTONSTALL: So you've each
approached very different parts

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.551
of fantasy and Sci-Fi
and you've got,

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.550
I think, really interesting,
different settings.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.600
How did you go
about researching,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840
say, your Pacific Northwest
sort of gold rush or your space

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.340
pirates?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.650
How did you get into
that culture of it?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.570
ELIZABETH BEAR: Well,
for the Pacific Northwest

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.824
I cheated a little bit
because I made up a city--

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:30.990
MAX SALTONSTALL: Rapid City?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.990
ELIZABETH BEAR: Rapid
City, from which

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.770
I took all of the
elements that I really

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.880
liked from the
history of Portland,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.340
San Francisco, and Seattle.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.110
And just stuck them in a
blender, into the Vitamix,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.280
hit whizz.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.150
So it's got--

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.950
MAX SALTONSTALL:
With giant robots.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.366
ELIZABETH BEAR:
With giant robots.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:48.670
It's got San Francisco's
Chinatown and Seattle's history

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.310
of the buried waterfront city.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.422
Basically, the good bits.

00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:55.380
The good parts version
of the Pacific Northwest

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.639
during the gold rush.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.930
And then I read a whole bunch
about the Gold Rush and I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.035
visited all of
those places and I--

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:03.035
MAX SALTONSTALL: Alaska?

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:03.826
ELIZABETH BEAR: No.

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:04.920
I haven't.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.660
I will probably have to go
to Alaska at some point,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.100
but not for this book.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.260
I read a lot of
Jack London, though.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.960
Does that count?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.876
MAX SALTONSTALL: Sure.

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.176
That's fine.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:18.655
AUDIENCE: Any relationship
to Rapid City, South Dakota?

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:22.325
ELIZABETH BEAR: Other
than the name, no.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:25.632
JAMES CAMBIAS: So
for "Corsair," I'm

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:27.340
keeping it in the
relatively near future.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.980
It only takes place in
something like 2030.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.714
So I tried to-- it's
as contemporary-feeling

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:34.130
as I could get
away with and still

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.250
have space pirates, industrial
operations on the moon,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.460
invaluable payloads of Helium3
being shipped to Earth.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.960
So I kind of assumed that,
say, tomorrow somebody decides,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.250
yes, that's what we'll do.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.144
And begin setting up the
infrastructure for it.

00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:53.310
MAX SALTONSTALL: I think
NASA actually just gave you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.520
the announcement you
wanted yesterday.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.010
JAMES CAMBIAS:
Well, there we go.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.609
And I've been completely
cut off on this book tour.

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.150
I don't know.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.246
Are we at war with Norway?

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.120
ELIZABETH BEAR: We're
on an asteroid hurtling

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.453
through the Northeast currently.

00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:05.290
BRIAN STAVELEY: That's how
rumors get started, Jim.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.795
MAX GLADSTONE: We've always
been at war with Norway, Jim.

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:09.340
MAX SALTONSTALL: Shh!

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.740
JAMES CAMBIAS: So it's
mostly the contemporary world

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.334
with people stealing spaceships.

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:18.250
MAX SALTONSTALL: Well,
you took some liberties

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.209
in terms of how are
things going to progress?

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.670
JAMES CAMBIAS: Well, yes I have.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.240
since it's 15
years in the future

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.680
I had to throw in
self-driving cars

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.690
and there's a
pirate themed resort

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.550
island which doesn't really
exist, but could easily exist.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.882
MALE SPEAKER: And should.

00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:37.340
JAMES CAMBIAS: But
most of the rest

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.920
I tried to keep as familiar
to the reader as possible

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.120
because that's not what
the story is about.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.098
ELIZABETH BEAR: So how about
those self-driving cars, Max?

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:48.532
Ha ha ha!

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:51.270
MAX SALTONSTALL: When your
tour takes you to Mountainview

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.250
I'm sure we'll conduct an
interview inside one of them.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.420
BRIAN STAVELEY: I used to
teach ancient world history

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.390
and philosophy and
comparative religion,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.371
so that was all valuable
material for the world

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:01.870
building.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.790
But you know there's also a
lot of personal experience

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.950
that goes into the books.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.656
For instance, the Special
Forces guys, the Kettral,

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:10.980
they do a lot of training.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.900
And I do this sport
called adventure racing

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.866
that I've drawn on in my
conception of the Kettral.

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.240
And one of the things I would
do with my adventure racing

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800
teammates, we had a thing
where once a week you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.790
could call another person
on the team at 2:00 AM

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.120
and assign them a two
hour physical task

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.620
that they had to
get up and do then.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.500
So you could call someone,
and one night I got the call.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.060
"Get up.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.772
You up?" "Yeah.

00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:38.710
I'm up." "Find a 45
pound rock." "OK.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.230
I have one in mind." "Go
carry it for two hours."

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.015
And so the Kettral have to
do a lot of things like that

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:46.849
and I've drawn on some
of those experiences.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.764
JAMES CAMBIAS: This is
a sport you do for fun?

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:51.270
BRIAN STAVELEY: Well, that's
just the training for the sport

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.061
but it gives you a
sense of what you end up

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.160
doing in the race itself.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.867
MAX GLADSTONE: We're using a
loose definition of fun, here.

00:05:56.867 --> 00:05:58.700
Or an endorphin dependent
definition of fun.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.330
BRIAN STAVELEY: Indeed.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.700
Exactly.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.366
Well, there is-- I don't know if
you're familiar with this term.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:03.410
There's Type 2 fun.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.000
Does this sound familiar?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.030
Type 1 fun is fun
when you're doing it,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.220
like drinking good wine
or having sex or whatever.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.000
Type 2 fun is miserable
when you're doing it

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.402
but you look back on it fondly.

00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:15.610
ELIZABETH BEAR: Like writing.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.220
MAX SALTONSTALL: I
think we call that--

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.460
BRIAN STAVELEY: Like writing.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.760
Writing is Type 2 fun.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.580
And Type 3 fun is just
horrifying and never fun.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.979
So not actually fun at all.

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.520
MAX GLADSTONE: Type
3 fun is only fun

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.980
when your grandkids are
talking about the time they--

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.690
BRIAN STAVELEY: Absolutely.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.190
ELIZABETH BEAR: Type 3 fun is
fun when you're getting drinks

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.415
off of it 20 years later.

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:33.540
JAMES CAMBIAS: That's true.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.149
Shackleton's expedition
was Type 3 fun.

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:37.649
MAX SALTONSTALL: Ooh.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:38.440
MAX GLADSTONE: Wow.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.148
JAMES CAMBIAS: I think
they all survived.

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:42.280
They all lived and went
off to fight World War I

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.284
when they got home.

00:06:43.284 --> 00:06:44.486
MAX GLADSTONE: Goody.

00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:45.610
BRIAN STAVELEY: Type 3 fun.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.693
MAX GLADSTONE: Type 3 fun.

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:47.505
World War I?

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:49.630
All right.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.170
So the research for
my books comes off

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.810
of talking to a
lot of my friends

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.190
and being an enormous nerd.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.100
So the metaphors
that I would use,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.830
I'd reach out for, for trying to
describe what like a bankruptcy

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.460
lawyer I was talking
to or a guy who

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.830
was working in like
nonprofit sort of organizing

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.830
fund-raising, trying to figure
out good metaphors for what

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.040
they did.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.980
I write reached for
magic, basically.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.310
So my wife's mother is
a bankruptcy attorney

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.470
and I grew up in, basically, the
middle of nowhere in Tennessee.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.300
And as far as I was
concerned, bankruptcy

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.920
was what happened when the
company ran out of money,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.390
it sold all of
its stuff and then

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.240
you use that to pay back people.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.389
And I was talking with her
and she said, well, no.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.430
The company's worth
something is a going concern,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.590
so you try to figure how
to make it keep going.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.490
And there are protections
that you put in place.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.490
And I thought, well, OK.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.334
So you put a magic
circle around something

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:45.250
and then you have this
dead body in the middle

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.960
and you carve it
open and you start

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.884
taking out stuff that's rotting
or it doesn't work quite well.

00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:52.050
You argue with all of the
other people who are doing

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.990
this at exactly the same time.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.862
And then when you think you
have a working body-ish thing,

00:07:57.862 --> 00:08:00.070
you stitch it all back
together and get the lightning

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.080
generator hooked up.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.710
And, like, Delta
airlines rises off

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.360
of the slab and shambles
forth talking about,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.110
I don't know, increasing
shareholder value

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.995
or making flights arrive
on time or something.

00:08:08.995 --> 00:08:10.660
MAX SALTONSTALL: And you just
summarized "Three Parts Dead."

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:10.880
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.520
That's "Three Parts Dead."

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
So that's my first book.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.990
And I kept poking into
other aspects of this world.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.810
So assume that
necromancy is a metaphor

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.270
for a certain kind of law.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.139
What would other
things look like?

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:24.930
And by the time we get
to "Last First Snow"

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.630
we have a desert city that
bears moderate resemblance

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.610
to Los Angeles that
used to work just fine,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.150
because they had a bunch of
relatively oppressive gods

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.215
that they worshipped who
provided water and utilities

00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.090
and things like that.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.860
But then there was a revolution
and all of those gods died.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.174
And then you're left in a
desert city with no water

00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:44.590
and so you need
to figure out what

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.840
you're going to do about that.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.280
And there's some
understandable civil unrest.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.230
So as the revolutionaries,
these sort

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.110
of immortal wizard-king
type people,

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.730
are trying to figure out how to
become water utility magnates

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.920
and fix up the city the
way they want it to go.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.650
They run into people who liked
the city the way it was before.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.156
And--

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:05.655
JAMES CAMBIAS: With
human sacrifice.

00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:06.320
MAX GLADSTONE: Yes.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.820
Well, yeah.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.260
ELIZABETH BEAR: Having lived
in Las Vegas for many years,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.980
the Las Vegas Valley
Water Authority

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.695
is the closest thing to
a god that that city has.

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:17.320
MAX GLADSTONE: Well
that's what I mean.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.945
Like, more and more
of the modern world

00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:20.650
makes sense to me
sort of exclusively

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.281
filtered through
this fantasy lens.

00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.280
BRIAN STAVELEY: Don't
tell a lot of people that.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.730
More and more of
the modern world

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.880
I can only see it through
the lens of fantasy.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.420
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.870
I mean, certainly
don't tell the people

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.440
who are going to come
after with the white coats

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.028
that who are possibly
watching on YouTube.

00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:34.960
ELIZABETH BEAR: They
don't watch YouTube.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.043
MAX GLADSTONE: Well, yeah.

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:39.640
But I mean there's a lot of
stuff that seems like magic

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.850
to us on a day to day basis.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.200
Right?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.290
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Self-driving cars.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.123
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:44.915
Well, self-driving cars
or the smart phone,

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:46.456
which-- there are
very few people who

00:09:46.456 --> 00:09:48.390
could describe how to
go from raw material to

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.980
finished smartphone,
especially if you

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.070
build in an app ecosystem and
the network communications

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.906
technology that is
required for the thing

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:57.050
to be even remotely useful.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.470
People can't really go from
farm to table on one of those.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.970
So--

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.230
BRIAN STAVELEY: I think
they're born, not built.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.550
MAX GLADSTONE: Yes.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.130
And that's it.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.375
BRIAN STAVELEY: There's little
eggs that hatch smart phones.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.958
ELIZABETH BEAR: Now
I'm picturing farm

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:06.880
to table smart phones.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.370
MAX GLADSTONE: I
think Neil Stevenson

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.430
wrote a book about that.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.290
JAMES CAMBIAS: And that's why
we had the whole phenomenon

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.470
of legal thrillers-- you
referenced John Grisham--

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.545
because increasingly,
it feels like dark magic

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:19.855
that no one understands, really.

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:21.980
ELIZABETH BEAR: Cory Doctorow
is all about the farm

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.990
to table smart phones.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.670
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.170
Right.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.785
ELIZABETH BEAR: That's pretty
much his schtick, actually.

00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:28.950
MAX SALTONSTALL: So
what did you take out

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.150
of your most recent book?

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.990
What did you end up pulling
to make it stronger?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.700
ELIZABETH BEAR: What did we cut?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.616
MAX SALTONSTALL: Yeah.

00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:39.622
What ended up on the
editing room floor?

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:43.452
BRIAN STAVELEY: Just
about 60,000 words.

00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:45.480
ELIZABETH BEAR:
I'm actually-- I'm

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.420
that weird sub-species
of write who underwrites.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.920
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Are you allowed to?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.795
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yeah.

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.960
My early drafts
are like 15% to 20%

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.210
shorter than my finished drafts
because they're very Spartan.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.546
They tend to be missing a lot
of things like transitions

00:11:00.546 --> 00:11:04.370
and character motivations
and important-- things that,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.670
it turns out, are
important to the reader.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.090
So I have to go back and
put all that stuff in.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.961
So I guess I'm the
opposite of Stephen King.

00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:13.460
JAMES CAMBIAS: Well,
I have to admit

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.668
I'm kind of in the same boat.

00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:16.300
I tend to write short.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.410
So when I handed in the original
manuscript for "Corsair,"

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.340
my editor told me,
this is not long enough

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.220
to publish as a novel.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.137
Please make it bigger.

00:11:24.137 --> 00:11:25.386
MAX SALTONSTALL: It's magical.

00:11:25.386 --> 00:11:26.870
How do you get
from the manuscript

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.500
to the novel process?

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.150
Eggs, right?

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.134
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yes.

00:11:30.134 --> 00:11:31.300
ELIZABETH BEAR: Writer eggs.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.770
JAMES CAMBIAS: But I was
able to-- that actually, I

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.960
think it makes it, not
just because longer,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.070
but I think it enabled me to
add several more characters

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.510
and, I think, make the
story a bit more interwoven.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.139
And so I'm glad that
they told me to do that.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:50.430
MAX SALTONSTALL: Sort of a
building-in layers approach.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.046
JAMES CAMBIAS: Right.

00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:54.555
ELIZABETH BEAR: I start
off very much like Jim.

00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:55.680
I start off very scaffoldy.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.591
It's super pixelated.

00:12:00.591 --> 00:12:02.090
My early drafts are
super pixelated.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.970
And then I have to go in and
focus down, and focus down,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.594
and focus down, and
then eventually you

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:08.031
have a nice, sharp, clear story.

00:12:08.031 --> 00:12:08.530
But--

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.390
MAX GLADSTONE: Zoom and enhance.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.765
ELIZABETH BEAR:
Zoom and enhance.

00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:13.976
Yeah it's like CSI,
only it actually works.

00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:16.780
MAX GLADSTONE: See, I go for
the make the block of marble

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.470
first and then chisel the
block of marble away thing.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.390
So I write very quickly,
almost sort of on automatic,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.110
and then I end up with
160,000 word manuscript that

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.541
becomes 105,000 word manuscript
over the process of paring it

00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:32.040
away.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.498
ELIZABETH BEAR: So you could
actually tell us what you cut.

00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:35.400
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.800
But the funny thing is, once I'm
done cutting I almost never am

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.380
aware of what I cut.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.890
A lot of it is
repeated description

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.775
or you have a
conversation that's

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.900
three pages long that
becomes a conversation that's

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.230
one page long because you have
one major beat needs to be hit.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.360
There are chapters where
I had two characters who

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.230
are going through a very long
sort of rambling set of stories

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.690
about their lives, but
then just simmered down

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.380
on the stove top to become
maybe a page and a half long.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.960
So there are some very
short chapters in the book

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.440
because that was the one
beat that needed to be there.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.500
And then I added in some
sort of other side plots

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.345
when they became
absolutely necessary.

00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:18.554
I realized the book
was missing stuff

00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:19.970
BRIAN STAVELEY: I
mean, obviously,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.260
a big part of the job for any
of us is building the world.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.710
And sometimes it's
not immediately

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.710
evident in the moment how much
of the world you need to build.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.140
So in the third book that I
just finished, for instance,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.290
there's a very tall staircase.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.020
And to me, it was sort
of implausibly tall.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.720
And I spent a long
time trying to figure

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.260
through the engineering
in this staircase,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.340
and what kind of
wood are they using,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.660
and how is it all put together.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.860
And my wife read it
and she's like, what

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.901
is all this crap about
the stair-- it's like four

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:46.440
pages of staircase building.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.864
Nobody cares about that.

00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:50.530
AUDIENCE: Unless
you're Herman Melville.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.410
MAX GLADSTONE: Right.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.290
And I thought, yeah.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.500
Nobody does care about that.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.650
But for me, I often
need to write that stuff

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.420
and then maybe two lines
make it into the final text.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.070
But in my head, at least, I know
how that staircase was built.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.260
If somebody comes at me
on the next book tour,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.986
I've got answers.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:07.735
ELIZABETH BEAR: That's
the iceberg effect.

00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:09.840
Like, 10% of your world
building is above water.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.140
BRIAN STAVELEY: Yep.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.160
MAX GLADSTONE: You have
the iceberg approach

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.900
or the gilding approach, right?

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.020
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yes.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.540
Or the electroplating approach.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.810
Tim Power's term for you
electroplate on the research,

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.660
and as long as it's flawless,
it could be one molecule thick

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.786
and nobody will ever know.

00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:26.910
MAX SALTONSTALL: Questions?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.455
Feel free.

00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:28.950
AUDIENCE: Can I follow
up on a particular point?

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.860
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yeah.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.170
AUDIENCE: Since you spoke
last I'll address it to you,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.350
and also because I
read "Karen Memory"

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.776
and I enjoyed it very much.

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.110
Is that world you
had written before

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.230
or did that grow full-blown?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.590
ELIZABETH BEAR: That
is a brand new world.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.890
And the book was
about-- I think I

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.510
wrote the first
sentence in 2009 and it

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.560
took a long time to sell.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.200
It was actually
very fast to write,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.750
but it took a long time to
sell because it's weird.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.952
It's not any other, like,
really accepted subgenres.

00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:06.660
It's a little bit
steampunk but it's also

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:12.850
a little bit weird west, and
the nontraditional protagonist

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.260
and all this other stuff.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.920
The world, itself,
was just the result

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.200
of a lot of reading and
cogitating and wandering around

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.840
in Seattle underground
and parts of San Francisco

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.770
and just trying to--
and there's a lot

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.580
of actual historic inspiration
for the characters in the book.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.560
There's a character
in there, Mary Lee,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.750
who's a young
Chinese-American woman who

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:45.200
rescues-- her schtick is that
she rescues young women who

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.870
are being sexually trafficked.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:56.110
And there were people like her
in San Francisco in the 1800s.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.900
So there's a lot of just
sort of these little bits

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.870
of American history that
have been erased or forgotten

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.760
or aren't part of the
narrative, but are so

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.695
cool that I want to talk about.

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:07.070
AUDIENCE: You've
already answered

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.861
the question I was
going to follow up with,

00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:11.150
which is-- I mean, I
love when I open a book,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:16.250
particularly a standalone
book, and there's a full world.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.045
I can't imagine
the amount of work

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:20.600
that goes into that
that never shows.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.990
And I was wondering
if all of you

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.276
could talk a little bit about
where your worlds come from.

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:29.384
JAMES CAMBIAS: Well,
"Corsair," like I said,

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:30.675
is mostly contemporary reality.

00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:34.870
But my first novel,
"A Darkling Sea,"

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.770
that takes place on an alien
planet with its own native

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.640
inhabitants and involves
both the local inhabitants,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.490
the human explorers, and
a second space-faring

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.240
civilization which is
in conflict with humans.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.830
So I had to build two alien
civilizations, alien species,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.300
for that.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.120
And that was a lot of fun.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.150
But as to the background,
to some extent

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.599
it's because we've been
interested in all this

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.369
our whole lives.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.780
That's why we're in this job.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.119
So the preparation for
writing "A Darkling Sea"

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.700
was, well, I minored
in astronomy in college

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.515
and I married a
biologist and I--

00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:17.034
MAX SALTONSTALL: You cheated.

00:17:17.034 --> 00:17:17.550
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yeah.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.680
BRIAN STAVELEY: Preparing for
that moment all your life.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.509
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yes, right.

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.130
ELIZABETH BEAR: Stealing
ideas from one spouse

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.310
over the breakfast table--
time honored tradition.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.685
MAX GLADSTONE:
This is the reason

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:27.400
that the second book tends to
be really hard because you write

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.550
the first book and
that's your whole life up

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.530
until that moment.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.544
And then you sit down with
another blank sheet of paper--

00:17:33.544 --> 00:17:35.530
BRIAN STAVELEY: I
also find there's

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.620
top-down sort of world building
and bottom-up world building.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.729
So the top-down
stuff is, you start

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:42.520
with a big idea about
theology or whatever,

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.384
but there is a
moment-- I'm thinking

00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:47.050
more about my third book because
I just got done with it-- where

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.250
I had some characters in a room
and I didn't want them just

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.370
sitting in an empty room.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.350
So I need to fill that room in.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.760
And I put in some statuary.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.800
And then the statuary
needs to be of something.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.466
And I thought, well,
this character will

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:00.017
have statuary of these gods.

00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:01.850
And then I need to think
of how the gods are

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.520
depicted in that statuary.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.190
And all of a sudden you're
coming at the theology

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.900
not from, this is
my pantheon and then

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.760
here is how it works on the
people of this world, but from,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.650
I need some crap in
the corner this room.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.460
And suddenly the Pantheon
is growing out of that.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.480
And hopefully those
meet in the middle.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.480
MAX GLADSTONE: I talked
a little bit about where

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.150
my world's coming from
earlier, but there's

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.410
one particular night
that I can think of.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.960
I had just gone to see
"Psycho" and Slavoj Zizek

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.980
was introducing it.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.060
It was like this
weird thing that

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.268
was going on at the Brattle
Cinema in Harvard Square,

00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:37.240
if any of you guys
have ever been there.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.380
And I was walking back
and everything just

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.510
looked profoundly weird.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.030
Cars were coming
by and I thought,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.200
Jesus that's something
that's two, three tons that's

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.870
just rolling down the street
faster than a horse could run.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.700
And I think this
is totally normal.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.540
Like, the equivalent
of monkey-me 10,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.360
20,000 years ago would think
this was a transcendentally

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360
weird experience.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.230
ELIZABETH BEAR:
That moment when you

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.650
realize that you are living
past several singularities.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.150
MAX GLADSTONE: Right.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.540
It's the "Naked Lunch" moment.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.040
Right?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.810
You see what's exactly
on the end of your fork.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:16.520
And thinking about how I
could write a world that

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.370
seems that weird to
us but would also

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.350
seem close enough to something
that we-- to the world

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.830
that we live on a
day to day basis,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.371
to highlight the weirdness of
the world that we live on a day

00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:26.460
to day basis.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.460
That's kind of the seed
that a lot of this stuff

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.140
is coming out of.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.010
MAX SALTONSTALL: I need
to get across town.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.080
Let me just grab one of
those giant dragonflies

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.270
and give it a little
bit of my soul.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.795
And then--

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:34.520
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.310
MAX SALTONSTALL: Have
my meeting on time.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.590
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.820
MAX SALTONSTALL: Question?

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.400
AUDIENCE: So you talked
a little bit a minute

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.650
ago about bottom-up
world building.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.800
I'm not sure who on the
group goes top-down.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.740
I think, I'm sorry, Mr.
Gladstone if I remember that?

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.250
You were giving
this big description

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.830
from "Three Parts Dead,"
which I haven't read yet,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.180
this really interesting,
fascinating world.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.717
Assuming you start
there, if you do.

00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:58.550
I don't know if this
is how you work or not.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.070
How do you go from, here is
this wonderful, weird world,

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.129
and then find the characters
and the plot to put in it?

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:08.670
MAX GLADSTONE: Well, at least
the way that I was interpreting

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.490
what you were saying, is that
it all feeds into itself one way

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.780
or the other, whichever
direction you're going.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.760
So if you have this
strong umbrella

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.677
image of what the world-- how
the world fits together, then

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:21.760
the next question you ask
are, what kind of people

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.270
come out of this world?

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.470
And then, what do they want?

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.240
And then, where do
they want to go?

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.344
What does their day
to day life look like?

00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:29.760
Or if you're
starting with the day

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.101
to day life stuff then you
can blossom up from that into,

00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.350
what are the major concerns
that they're dealing with?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.770
ELIZABETH BEAR: Or
both simultaneously.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.070
At least the way I do it,
it's very synergistic.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.040
I've had books that started with
a sentence, with a character,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.970
with a thematic statement, with
an argument I wanted to have,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.487
and all of them present
their own struggles.

00:20:52.487 --> 00:20:54.320
But the thing is, it's
like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.369
Like, you get one piece.

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:56.910
And then you fill
in a bit around it.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.670
And then you find a corner
that looks like it matches.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.350
And you put it where
you think it goes.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.550
And then you discover, no,
actually it's over here.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.416
And it happens on
different levels

00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:09.290
and from different
directions simultaneously.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.810
It's not a linear process.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.880
I imagine there may be people
for whom it's a linear process,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.055
but I am not them.

00:21:15.055 --> 00:21:18.740
JAMES CAMBIAS: I like to
follow a test which is,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.080
what stories can be told in
this setting that cannot be told

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.890
in the world in which we
are sitting right now?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.440
So if you're postulating
a future with interstellar

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.590
travel, what
stories can you tell

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.960
that you can't tell in a setting
without interstellar travel?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.360
And since most stories involve
somebody wanting something

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.610
or being afraid of something or
being convinced of something,

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.780
what fears or desires
or convictions

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.800
are possible in
that world, or are

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.372
impossible in that world that
would be possible in our own?

00:21:55.372 --> 00:21:56.580
Because that's the flip side.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.035
You can have Winston Smith
wanting to be able to sit

00:22:00.035 --> 00:22:03.750
in his room and not
be watched in 1984,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.270
which is a desire that
he cannot satisfy.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.550
BRIAN STAVELEY: There's
also a just brute force

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.350
technical writing
element to it, I find.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.527
Sometimes if I'm starting
a chapter with plot--

00:22:16.527 --> 00:22:18.860
let's say I have a plot point
that I want to get through

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.840
and it's not working-- I'll
double back and I'll say,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.221
let's just let
the characters go.

00:22:23.221 --> 00:22:25.220
Let me tackle it from a
character point of view.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.510
And if the characters
don't have anything

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.980
interesting to say maybe I'll
start with a long description

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.980
and see if that
generates anything.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.530
And so, for me-- and I
don't know if you all

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.960
find this-- those
different approaches are

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.170
ways to get into and past some
of the roadblocks I run into.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.440
ELIZABETH BEAR: And
even more than that,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.470
if I'm having a hard time
writing in a particular way

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.300
I will change my process up.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.610
Like if sitting at the
computer typing isn't working,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.480
I will take my laptop
and go somewhere else.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.530
Or I will take a notebook
and go somewhere else.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.080
Or I will-- I have
actually written

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.499
on little scraps
of torn up paper

00:23:00.499 --> 00:23:01.790
because it feels insignificant.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.600
You're just scribbling.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.100
Right?

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.530
You're brainstorming so the
sensor part of your brain

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.405
doesn't get involved.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.000
And I also will
sometimes go back

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.950
and reverse outline what
I've already written

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.990
to see where it's going.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.875
MAX GLADSTONE: That is so
much smarter than what I do.

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:17.450
ELIZABETH BEAR: You just
sit there and bang your head

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.020
on the keyboard?

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.220
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.330
Well, just bang my head
against the story until--

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.372
BRIAN STAVELEY: You can
see this dent right here.

00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:24.538
ELIZABETH BEAR: This is
that 10 years of experience.

00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:26.312
MAX GLADSTONE: It's
Iron Head training.

00:23:26.312 --> 00:23:27.895
That's what I'm
getting myself in for.

00:23:27.895 --> 00:23:30.090
JAMES CAMBIAS: The different
physical mode is actually

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.350
something I've used, as well.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.690
I'm a parent and any of you
who have kids know that they

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.560
need to be driven places a lot.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.420
And when you're waiting
for something to finish,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.800
take along a notebook and you
can just sit and write out, not

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.550
necessarily story prose, but
think on paper, so to speak.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.550
What is this person
doing in this story

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.382
and what should he be doing?

00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:54.090
Things like that.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.464
BRIAN STAVELEY: My wife calls
this the crazy paper stage.

00:23:56.464 --> 00:23:58.610
There comes a point near
the end of each book where

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.200
there's all these plot threads.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.050
I'm trying to yoke
them together.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.770
And that's when she
comes home someday

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.060
and I have computer paper and
post-its all over the wall.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.150
And she just thinks, oh--

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.650
MAX GLADSTONE:
serial killer moment?

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.220
BRIAN STAVELEY: Yeah.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.880
We're doing the crazy
papers again, huh?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.310
It's just going to
be a week or who.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.250
Just going to be a week or two.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.290
ELIZABETH BEAR: Index
cards with the spray tacky

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.090
stuff on the back.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.140
You can just stick them and--

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.680
BRIAN STAVELEY: And then
you have them on the table.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.280
And she's like, can I just
move these for dinner?

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:21.420
No!

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.721
You cannot move
those for dinner.

00:24:22.721 --> 00:24:23.623
ELIZABETH BEAR: That's why
you stick them on the walls.

00:24:23.623 --> 00:24:24.581
Stick them on the wall.

00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:27.334
BRIAN STAVELEY: That's
gold, right there.

00:24:27.334 --> 00:24:28.750
MAX GLADSTONE:
Generally, the time

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.367
when I sit down to actually
do the outlining is when I've

00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:33.200
gotten so far into the
draft that absolutely

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.360
everything looks horrible.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.260
All the choices are
bad choices and I just

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.260
want to set it on fire.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.410
And that's when the
reverse outlining, like,

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.500
what do I need to do to just
end this book, comes into play.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.360
ELIZABETH BEAR: It's
also really useful

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.276
to go through and write
down everything that's

00:24:45.276 --> 00:24:46.770
unfinished on an index card.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.730
And then you spread
them out on the table

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.010
and you pick one up and say, OK.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.800
This is a doable thing.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.540
And you do that thing.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.060
And then you put that index
card in a different pile.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.101
MAX GLADSTONE: Getting
things done for novelists.

00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:00.200
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yes.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.658
This probably works for-- this
is probably good for anybody

00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:03.159
because--

00:25:03.159 --> 00:25:04.991
MAX SALTONSTALL: We
call it sprint planning,

00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:06.320
but it's the same thing.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.540
ELIZABETH BEAR: The thing
that I have been attempting

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.210
to teach myself for
the last three years

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.440
is that the little fuzzy
animal, that little mammal that

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.990
lives in my head, doesn't
like to be punished.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.060
And if I punish it for doing
the things that I want it to do,

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.820
then it will stop
doing those things.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.650
So what I need to do
is when it behaves

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.470
I need to give it a cookie.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.680
And if I'm having a miserable
time and it's not working

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.260
and things are going well, I
need to get up, take a break,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.555
wait for that moment when
the animal gets bored

00:25:35.555 --> 00:25:37.530
and gives me an idea.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.000
And then I give it a cookie.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.534
And it's self-training.

00:25:40.534 --> 00:25:42.325
You're habituating
yourself to do the thing

00:25:42.325 --> 00:25:44.306
that you want your brain to do.

00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:45.680
BRIAN STAVELEY:
And this explains

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.876
why you find yourself
having a beer at like,

00:25:47.876 --> 00:25:48.750
11:30 in the morning.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.490
ELIZABETH BEAR: Shh!

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.948
MAX SALTONSTALL: Or carrying
a rock at 2:00 in the morning.

00:25:51.948 --> 00:25:52.960
BRIAN STAVELEY: Or that.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.720
ELIZABETH BEAR: No,
that's punishing.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.540
JAMES CAMBIAS: Or why there's a
little dispenser with rat chow

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.090
pellets next to your laptop.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.256
MAX SALTONSTALL: Or cocaine.

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:01.590
MAX GLADSTONE: Before
I went full time,

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:07.250
I asked John Crowley,
what should I be aware of?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.300
What are the risks?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.410
And he said, well, there's
going to come a point.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.868
You want to be very clear with
your wife about how this all

00:26:12.868 --> 00:26:15.170
works, because there
will come a point

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.249
when she will come
back from work,

00:26:17.249 --> 00:26:18.790
from a very hard
day at work, and she

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.620
will find you sitting on
the couch in your underwear

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.330
watching soaps and
eating jelly beans.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.290
And she will ask you, what
the hell are you doing?

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.320
And you will say, I'm working.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.040
And you won't be lying.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.635
And she just needs to be
ready not to murder you, then.

00:26:36.635 --> 00:26:38.760
JAMES CAMBIAS: I find it
impossible to picture John

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.260
Crowley sitting on
the couch, eating

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.915
jelly beans in his underwear.

00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:46.090
MAX GLADSTONE: This was the
advice that the man gave to me.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.530
It's not happened yet, so far.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.155
ELIZABETH BEAR: The
third novel divorce

00:26:49.155 --> 00:26:50.385
is an axiom in the genre.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.370
Actual industry term of art,
"the third novel divorce."

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.100
That's the point when your
spouse realizes that this is

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.350
never going to stop happening.

00:27:02.951 --> 00:27:04.200
MAX SALTONSTALL: It's a cycle.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.408
ELIZABETH BEAR: It's a cycle.

00:27:05.408 --> 00:27:06.040
Yeah, exactly.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.456
MAX GLADSTONE: My
wife is amazing.

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:12.025
MAX SALTONSTALL: Do
you have a character

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:13.649
that you've written
that you would like

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:16.154
to actually spend time with?

00:27:16.154 --> 00:27:17.813
BRIAN STAVELEY: Yes.

00:27:17.813 --> 00:27:20.246
MAX SALTONSTALL: Which
would be your favorite?

00:27:20.246 --> 00:27:21.840
BRIAN STAVELEY: The assassin.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.798
MAX GLADSTONE: Oh, god.

00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:23.298
Yeah.

00:27:23.298 --> 00:27:26.268
BRIAN STAVELEY: Provided
I wasn't on the list.

00:27:26.268 --> 00:27:27.385
MAX SALTONSTALL: Why?

00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:28.850
BRIAN STAVELEY: She's
got a good sense of humor

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.641
and she likes life.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.720
ELIZABETH BEAR: I try to
have at least one character

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.910
in every book who I wouldn't
mind being stuck in an elevator

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.500
with.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.910
because that's what
writing a book is like.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.993
It's like being stuck in
elevator with this person

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:43.557
for nine months.

00:27:43.557 --> 00:27:45.181
MAX SALTONSTALL: I'd
love to spend time

00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:46.180
with Connie because
it looks like she

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.440
cooks a real mean breakfast.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.850
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yeah.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.351
She'd be awesome.

00:27:50.351 --> 00:27:52.600
And especially when you're
writing like a first person

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.000
narrator, you need
that person to have

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.790
that kind of-- because then if
you're writing a first person

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.640
narrator or single
point of view character

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.605
who is not somebody who your
reader wants to be stuck

00:28:04.605 --> 00:28:06.980
in an elevator with, they're
going to go spend their beer

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.790
money on somebody else's book.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.320
And that is not
the outcome I want.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.464
So you're trying
to write character

00:28:13.464 --> 00:28:15.130
who are charming and
interesting and you

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.870
want to hang around with
even if they're, maybe,

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.730
not nice people.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.050
Like, you wouldn't necessarily
give them your checkbook

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.310
but you might take
them out to lunch

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.935
and listen to them
rant about politics.

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:26.185
MAX SALTONSTALL: Is there
one that stands out for you?

00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:28.184
ELIZABETH BEAR: Karen's
actually great for that.

00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:30.200
She's a fun character
to write because she's

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.660
one of those characters who runs
toward the sound of gunfire,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.430
which is a great
quality in a protagonist

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.690
because then you don't
have to do any plot work.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.920
You know, somebody screams.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.992
She runs toward it and
the plot handles itself.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:45.450
Another one I think I would
really love to hang around with

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.930
is actually the protagonist
in my first book,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.910
Jenny Casey in "Hammered,"
who was a ranter.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.710
And she was one of those
people who-- one of my friends

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.650
who was beta reading
the book for me

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.547
commented that she really liked
reading it because Jenny was

00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:06.630
the sort of person who she
could imagine going out

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.130
with for a pizza, and putting
a quarter on the table,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.400
and saying, OK.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.110
Five minutes.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.390
Toronto City politics.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.050
Go.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.030
It would just happen.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.590
JAMES CAMBIAS: For
me, it would be

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.130
the hero of my first
novel, Broadtail,

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.480
who is a giant lobster
who lives at the bottom

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.650
of a lightless ocean
on an alien world,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.590
and is a gentleman
and a scientist.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.290
ELIZABETH BEAR: But
does he drink beer?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.270
JAMES CAMBIAS: Undoubtedly,
it would be lethal.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.020
BRIAN STAVELEY: They
have stingers, right?

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.811
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yes.

00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:37.735
He would get stung.

00:29:37.735 --> 00:29:38.235
Neurotoxins.

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.630
BRIAN STAVELEY: That's
the neurotoxin of choice.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.155
Yeah.

00:29:40.155 --> 00:29:41.530
MAX GLADSTONE: Well,
you could have a beer

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.450
and then he could have
neurotoxic stingers.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.789
So Elayne Keverian, who
is this sort of mediator

00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:50.580
slash necromancer--

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.766
ELIZABETH BEAR: Team Elayne!

00:29:51.766 --> 00:29:52.890
MAX GLADSTONE: Team Elayne!

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:53.474
She's amazing.

00:29:53.474 --> 00:29:55.598
MAX SALTONSTALL: I'd want
to meet her once and then

00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:56.610
be very far away,

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:56.840
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, I know.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.465
I mean, she's the
kind of person that I

00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:00.912
would love to have an
informational interview with.

00:30:00.912 --> 00:30:03.120
MAX SALTONSTALL: As long as
she's not seeking you out

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.770
for an interview.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.936
MAX GLADSTONE: Yes, exactly.

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.834
That would be problematic.

00:30:06.834 --> 00:30:08.250
The King in Red--
who is this sort

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.270
of enormous, skeletal,
lich lord guy who's

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.370
in charge of, basically,
water and power for the City

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.330
of Dresediel Lex where
the fourth book takes

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.200
place-- he's a lot of fun
to hang around with so long

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.140
as you don't get on his bad
side and he turns you inside out

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.049
or decides to string a lyre
with your nervous system

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:26.590
or something.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.950
ELIZABETH BEAR: Pay
your water bill.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.565
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:28.675
Pay your water bill on time.

00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:30.750
MAX SALTONSTALL: And don't let
any demons come out of the tap.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.910
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.191
Don't let any demons
come out of the tap.

00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.280
MAX SALTONSTALL: I
think the King in Red

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.705
would be an interesting
lunchtime companion.

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:36.635
Any other questions?

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:37.135
Go ahead.

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.718
AUDIENCE: So when
you write characters

00:30:38.718 --> 00:30:41.460
who are decidedly
unlike yourself

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.970
how do you keep the
characters true to who

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:44.920
you want them to be?

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.480
And where do you
draw inspiration

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.889
for those characters?

00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:50.180
BRIAN STAVELEY: We were
talking about this a little bit

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:50.820
last night.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.500
And I was saying
that this is where

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.150
I think the technical
effort of writing

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.180
coincides with the
moral effort of living.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.970
In that, when I
was in high school

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.930
I would go to these parties
and be like, she's an asshole

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.310
and I don't want to talk to him.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.090
And that was bad living, right?

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.950
But it's also
crippling for a writer

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.540
because you don't get those
characters into your head.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.750
And as I got older,
and even more and more

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.140
this is an ongoing
process, I find

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.940
people, all kinds of people,
more and more interesting.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.840
And that leads to a better
life which is really nice.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.760
But it also makes it
a hell of a lot easier

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.379
to write the
characters in books.

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:30.170
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yes.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.544
The characters may be externally
different from yourself,

00:31:32.544 --> 00:31:35.080
but in order to be able
to write them at all,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.290
really, you have to find that
zone in your head somewhere

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.465
which can be mapped on to them.

00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:44.420
ELIZABETH BEAR: Well, but
sometimes writing somebody

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.290
who's very culturally
different from myself,

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.870
for whatever reason--
what I try to do

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.250
is go out and read
a lot of fiction

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.540
by people who fit into that
demographic because reading

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:03.740
books about 19th
century China is

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.950
very different from
reading a bunch of books--

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.750
even in translation which is
all I can manage because I'm

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.910
an American and I speak one
language fluently and two

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.530
very badly.

00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:22.540
Read primary texts or as
close to the primary text

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.200
as you can get.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.100
And in that way, kind
of try to internalize

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.550
the cultural values.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:34.240
And this is just as relevant
in 21st century America.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240
America's a big country.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.134
There are a lot of
people in it with a lot

00:32:37.134 --> 00:32:38.550
of different
backgrounds and a lot

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.510
of different social and
cultural expectations.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:48.250
And I have to-- I'm a
43-year-old white female

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.420
Yankee, and those
are all things I

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.340
need to be aware of when
I am writing somebody

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.260
who is not those things.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.140
Even if it's a
generational difference,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.750
that their expectations are
going to be very different.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.840
MAX GLADSTONE: So two sort
of approaches that I use.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.690
One is very close to what
you guys are talking about.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.000
The more intense your
self-image, the more you're

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.420
like, I am this kind of person.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.170
I do these things.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.450
I do not do these things.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.950
The harder it is
to write characters

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:17.810
who are unlike yourself.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.393
So the more you can break open
that and find parts of you that

00:33:20.393 --> 00:33:22.435
may be in internal
contradiction or conversation,

00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:24.392
that's where some of the
really cool characters

00:33:24.392 --> 00:33:25.640
are going to come out of.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.300
Then, of course, like,
epical research in order

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.870
to be able to capture
people who are not like you.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.050
The other thing, this
is sort of dumb trick,

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.740
but there are
situations in which

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.545
commonalities of human
experience come out a lot more.

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:46.670
As someone who really likes
writing thriller plots,

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.320
where there's a lot of,
like, what's going on?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.650
Oh my god, we're being
attacked by giant whatevers.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.600
Like, let's run.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.220
The bomb's about to go off.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.510
Whenever you get people down
on to the most basic hierarchy

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.570
of needs levels, it's easier
to write, authentically,

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.340
folks who are very
different from you

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.320
and very different
from one another.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.555
And if you can get your
characters on that level,

00:34:08.555 --> 00:34:10.555
then sometimes, if you
have done enough research

00:34:10.555 --> 00:34:12.360
and if you've done enough
of the spiritual work

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.610
that Brian's talking about--

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.909
BRIAN STAVELEY: I don't know
if it's spiritual, but--

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.380
MAX GLADSTONE: It
is spiritual, I

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.790
mean, for whatever
definition of spirit

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:18.873
you want to be working on.

00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:19.480
Right?

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.184
Then you can progress from that
up towards the sort of higher

00:34:23.184 --> 00:34:25.350
levels and figure out how
the character would differ

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:30.316
from you or anyone else in more
staid or less immediately life

00:34:30.316 --> 00:34:31.274
threatening situations.

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:32.690
ELIZABETH BEAR:
But also the thing

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:36.489
that James is talking
about plays into that.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.329
That looking at the
parts of yourself

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:39.870
that are not the
things that are part

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.870
of your immediate identity.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.620
You know, like I am
this kind of a person.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.330
Well, yes.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.960
I may think I'm this
kind of a person,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.080
but there's a lot of conflicting
stuff going on in my head.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.449
And there are urges and
rationalities and logics

00:34:55.449 --> 00:35:00.560
that do not-- the little guy who
thinks he's driving the machine

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.162
is not necessarily
cognizant of and would not

00:35:03.162 --> 00:35:03.995
want to acknowledge.

00:35:03.995 --> 00:35:05.930
MAX GLADSTONE: I think we can
make that sort of Whitman's

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:06.460
step, right?

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.990
If you can be large
and contain multitudes,

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.956
then it gets easier.

00:35:10.956 --> 00:35:12.580
ELIZABETH BEAR: And
study anthropology.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.010
I mean, that's the other thing
because the entire purpose

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.450
of an undergraduate
anthropology degree

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.270
is to alienate you from your
own culture and the rest

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.410
of humanity so that everybody
looks like an alien, including

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.020
yourself.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.729
MAX SALTONSTALL: Also
the lobster people.

00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:29.770
ELIZABETH BEAR: No, the
lobster people are like--

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.460
JAMES CAMBIAS: Also,
read old books.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.001
Read books written
in different times

00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:36.230
as well, because
that way-- the world

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:41.732
of the 19th century or the
18th century is not our world.

00:35:41.732 --> 00:35:43.190
MAX SALTONSTALL:
What have you read

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.731
that's really changed
how you thought

00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:47.097
about fiction or about writing?

00:35:47.097 --> 00:35:48.930
JAMES CAMBIAS: What
have I read that changed

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.445
how I thought about fiction?

00:35:52.897 --> 00:35:54.980
BRIAN STAVELEY: I suspect
the answer for all of us

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.400
is tons of stuff.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.900
Right?

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.280
If you ever get
to a point where,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.730
even for a year
or six months, you

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.340
have the same idea about
fiction or writing,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.911
that's probably
kind of a bad sign.

00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:06.410
Right?

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.640
And so you stumbled
from crisis to crisis

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.240
where you read--
I just read David

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.990
Mitchell for the first
time, for instance.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.580
And I thought, oh, no.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.455
There's all these other
things I haven't even

00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:18.910
been thinking about.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.040
But that's just the
latest example of that.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.890
And hopefully, if you're
reading good stuff,

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.600
every writer provokes a kind
of mild crisis where you think,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.109
I wasn't doing that.

00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:28.150
MAX GLADSTONE: How can I?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.983
BRIAN STAVELEY: And I
think the moment where

00:36:29.983 --> 00:36:33.580
you start thinking, yeah I'm
on top of this, that's probably

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.910
a very bad point to be.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.660
ELIZABETH BEAR: My
agent claims that there

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.180
are no words that
strike more terror

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.840
into her heart
than author saying,

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.840
I really like this book.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.737
I think this is
going to do well.

00:36:42.737 --> 00:36:44.570
MAX GLADSTONE: And it's
funny because people

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.080
think that it's the ideas
that one gets jealous of

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.320
or that one wants to
hoard, but it's techniques.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:49.850
ELIZABETH BEAR: Ideas
are a dime a dozen.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:50.891
BRIAN STAVELEY: Oh, yeah.

00:36:50.891 --> 00:36:53.560
MAX GLADSTONE: How did you
manage to make me cry there?

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.592
How did that happen?

00:36:54.592 --> 00:36:56.800
JAMES CAMBIAS: I am going
to make one recommendation,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.966
though, and it's an odd one.

00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:00.671
It's a short story
collection by Roger Zelazny.

00:37:00.671 --> 00:37:02.670
ELIZABETH BEAR: I was
going to bring up Zelazny.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.836
JAMES CAMBIAS: "Frost and
Fire" I think it's called.

00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:06.780
And he has wonderful
story introductions

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.890
and afterwards to
each piece in that.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.460
And taken together, they
are an excellent guide

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.140
to how to be a fantasy and
science fiction writer.

00:37:16.505 --> 00:37:18.630
ELIZABETH BEAR: Let's all
talk about Roger Zelazny.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.160
MAX GLADSTONE: Let's.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.090
JAMES CAMBIAS: There
are worse things.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.590
MAX GLADSTONE: Y'all should
be reading Roger Zelazny.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.870
ELIZABETH BEAR:
There's this thing.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.030
I remember precisely
the two things

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.540
that made me understand how
unreliable narrators worked.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.730
And one of them was the
Rick Springfield song

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.500
"Jessie's Girl."

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.150
Where like, the 357th time
this thing comes on the radio

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.355
you're like, ohhh!

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.300
Because the song knows
why this guy can't get

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.690
laid even though he's
a first person narrator

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.890
and he doesn't know.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.970
But the song is
presenting a portrait

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.900
of this absolutely
reprehensible human being who

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.450
is totally not self-aware.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:07.690
And the other one was,
I was halfway through--

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.991
it was like the third or fourth
time I had read the Roger

00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:13.490
Zelazny's Amber novels-- and I
was like halfway through "The

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.580
Guns of Avalon"-- and I remember
I was standing in the shower,

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.980
both hands in my hair, getting
the Prell in there, and I went,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.720
that son of a bitch
is lying to me.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.100
It clicked.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.980
And in my defense, I was
probably 14 years old.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.240
It just clicked that the
narrator was actually

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.600
lying to me, and that was
why things in the story

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.030
didn't match up.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.170
Like his version of
events didn't match up

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.150
with what other characters
in the story were saying.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.000
And it was epiphany.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.330
You know the mind blown .gif?

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:50.071
It was like that except
with more shampoo.

00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:52.760
MAX GLADSTONE: Zelazny was one
of the early ones for me, too.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.730
His book "Lord of
Light," actually.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.320
This is a novel of
layers and layers

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.210
and layers and
layers and layers.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.210
ELIZABETH BEAR: An
epiphany in every book.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.085
MAX GLADSTONE: Right.

00:39:00.085 --> 00:39:03.790
You have-- spoiler alert.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.790
There's been a colony
ship that's crashed

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.730
on a distant world.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.600
And several hundred,
possibly 1,000 years later,

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.429
the descendants of the colonists
have set up this civilization

00:39:14.429 --> 00:39:16.970
that's based off of the culture
that they were coming out of,

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.170
which is sort of
Indian sub-continental.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.980
And the crew members had figured
out body to body transmission

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.630
and cloning and have
set themselves up

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.530
as gods, many of them
from the Hindu pantheon.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.790
And the book is written
almost in-universe.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.070
So the language is that of
a kind of prose translation

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.532
of the Mombarta,
but the experience,

00:39:39.532 --> 00:39:41.240
like what's actually
going on underneath,

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.860
is pretty well thought-through
science fiction.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.630
And the characters who are
operating in the milieu

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:51.360
are aware of both aspects.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.419
So there's one guy,
Sam, the main character,

00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:55.585
wants to start a revolution
against these people who

00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:57.100
have set themselves up as gods.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.080
So he thinks, well, I'm
going to "invent" Buddhism

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.960
in this context, and go
about being the Buddha.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.310
And so on the one
hand is this narrative

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.240
of the construction of Buddhism
and on the other hand's

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.310
like a sort of scientific,
science fictional sort

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.330
of political ploy.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.510
And the open question of,
is this a fantasy novel?

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.940
Is this guy really the Buddha?

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.420
What does being
really the Buddha

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.600
entail in this
sort of a scenario?

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.010
Is this science fiction?

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.400
Like, every single
layer gets activated.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.160
And the more I read it, the
more sort of parts of an onion

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.490
I peel back.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.370
ELIZABETH BEAR: Matryoshka
doll after Matryoshka doll.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.370
It just keeps unpacking.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:36.203
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah.

00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:38.684
And the notion that you
can do so many things

00:40:38.684 --> 00:40:41.225
in one book, which is smaller
than, I think, most novels that

00:40:41.225 --> 00:40:42.170
get published today.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.350
It's very slim.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.830
ELIZABETH BEAR: They
would send it back to Jim

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.230
and tell him to write
another 20 chapters.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.160
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.993
BRIAN STAVELEY: But
then what I find happens

00:40:47.993 --> 00:40:49.890
is you get obsessed with
something like that.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.580
You've read this book and
you think, I need to do that.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.047
And you spend a year doing
that and then next year there's

00:40:56.047 --> 00:40:57.380
the next thing that comes along.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.005
You're like now I
want to do that.

00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:00.190
ELIZABETH BEAR: And the
thing is that you're

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.620
really bad at this thing that
you really, desperately want

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:02.920
to do.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.700
And you screw it up,
and you screw it up,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.856
and you screw it up, and
you finally go, oh, I'm

00:41:05.856 --> 00:41:06.470
never going to figure this out.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:07.990
And you go on to screw
up the next thing

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.000
and discover that you're
doing the thing you couldn't

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.760
do when you were
actually trying to do it.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.600
Am I the only person
that's happened to?

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.683
MAX GLADSTONE: No, no, no.

00:41:13.683 --> 00:41:16.300
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.799
BRIAN STAVELEY: Other questions?

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:21.090
AUDIENCE: What did y'all do
before you became full time

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.720
writers, and what was
that transition like?

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.830
BRIAN STAVELEY: High school
teacher, and terrifying.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.780
ELIZABETH BEAR: I had a series
of stereotypically crappy

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.500
artist jobs.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.515
I was an office manager.

00:41:33.515 --> 00:41:35.920
I was a stable hand.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.870
I did microbiology
procedure manuals

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.330
at Hartford Hospital, which
was actually a great job.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.090
I loved my boss.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:48.220
I wrote news summaries
for a clipping service,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.970
a job I refer to to this
day as the media mines.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.425
Think the spice mines of Kessel,
except watching Dateline.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:02.300
Actually, the reason I went full
time was because I was living

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.120
in Las Vegas at that point in
time and the tourist economy

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.520
crashed after 9/11.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.410
And I lost my job.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:11.780
So there was nothing else to do.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.360
It was like I got pushed.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.000
It was a baby bird scenario.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.210
I did not, like, make a
conscious decision to,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.710
I'm going to go
write full time now.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.186
It's like the job with
the safety net went away.

00:42:21.186 --> 00:42:25.640
JAMES CAMBIAS: I kind of took
it sideways in many ways.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.070
I had a couple of
jobs in publishing

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.240
but then I moved with
my wife to a place

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.950
where there were
no publishing jobs.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.840
And so I decided,
well, this will

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.030
be a good opportunity for
me to try freelance writing.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.030
But I was doing it for
role playing games.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.640
I was writing source
books for various role

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.780
playing game publishers.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.300
And back then,
every game publisher

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.430
had a house magazine
with adventures

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.410
and supplemental material in it.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.530
And I could write a 3,000 word
role playing game magazine

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.780
article a week.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:05.300
So the main problem was finding
enough outlets for my output.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.720
And also doing some
freelance nonfiction writing.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.160
And it was only
after I had begun

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.070
to sell some short
stories that I

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.000
decided to make the
transition to writing fiction.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.120
MAX GLADSTONE: I was teaching
in China for a couple years

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.430
and writing books on the side.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:28.640
And came back in 2008
just as the US economy

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.841
did the Anakin Skywalker
face plant into the lava.

00:43:31.841 --> 00:43:34.320
ELIZABETH BEAR: It's
amazing how often

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.200
the economy doing a
face plant into the lava

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.380
figures in these
stories somewhere.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.240
MAX GLADSTONE: Which was sort
of the prompt for writing "Three

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.970
Parts Dead," because you know,
bankruptcy and lawyers sort

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.700
of flying off to try
to save the country

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.200
was a lived experience
of a lot of people

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.390
that I knew at that time.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.470
And in 2009 I had a
job working for a sort

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.889
of white paper marketing
firm in the Boston area.

00:43:54.889 --> 00:43:56.430
And that was going
on for a few years

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.680
as I was trying to sell the
books, writing more books.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.760
And then one of them
sold just as my wife

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.797
was getting a good job.

00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:05.380
And it was like, grab the brass
ring while it's coming around.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.110
See what happens.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.340
And I've been hanging onto
the brass ring ever since.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.090
MAX SALTONSTALL: There's
another question.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.280
AUDIENCE: In that regard,
since you brought it up,

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.880
in this day and age, how
do you go about-- you have

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.300
your first completed novel.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.140
At least the first one
you're happy about.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.490
How you go about selling it?

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.070
Do you publish it
online these days?

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.260
Do you go the E. L. James route?

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.199
Do you shop it around?

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:29.240
Even then, what do you
after you-- like you said,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.390
you printed your first one
and then you have more.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.220
And then how do you keep going
if you don't have-- especially

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.601
if they're not within the genre
confines of sci-fi or something

00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:40.100
else?

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.010
MAX GLADSTONE: To answer
the second question first,

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:46.050
as soon as you finish a book,
at least in my experience,

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.890
the next book is kind of
waiting there to get going.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.760
And the process
of selling a novel

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.820
is a long and complicated one
with many paths and byways

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.430
and tangles and turns.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.260
So the only thing to
keep me sane, anyway,

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.760
was to start on the next book.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.990
ELIZABETH BEAR: Finish
the submission draft

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.570
of whatever book it is.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.696
And if you're going the agented,
traditional publishing route,

00:45:06.696 --> 00:45:08.070
you start trying
to find an agent

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.620
with a series of queries and
query letters and submissions.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.200
And meanwhile you're
writing the next book.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.220
When I broke in, I had
written three novels

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.490
that had been rejected
by various agents

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:26.430
before the fourth novel
that I had written

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.390
was picked up by an agent.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.780
And by the time she
sold it, I was actually

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.380
halfway through the third book
the trilogy which worked out

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.255
really well for me
because I got a three book

00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:39.497
deal for my initial contract
rather than a two book deal,

00:45:39.497 --> 00:45:40.580
which contributes to buzz.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.788
Because anytime anything a
little out of the ordinary

00:45:42.788 --> 00:45:45.320
happens, the publishing
industry goes, oh, you know,

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.660
this person got a special deal.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.800
They must be--
and really, it was

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.780
just that I could deliver
two manuscripts immediately.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.880
Shh!

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.657
Oh, sorry.

00:45:54.657 --> 00:45:55.490
JAMES CAMBIAS: Yeah.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.640
I'm kind of facing
that hurdle right now.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.550
I wrote "Corsair" mostly
before "Darkling Sea" came out

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.340
but I'm still finishing the
next book even though "Corsair"

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.242
is already on the shelves.

00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:13.742
So I'm struggling to
catch up, basically.

00:46:13.742 --> 00:46:15.450
MAX SALTONSTALL: How'd
you get published?

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.430
BRIAN STAVELEY: Why is
everyone looking at me?

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.013
MAX GLADSTONE: You
haven't spoken yet.

00:46:21.732 --> 00:46:23.940
BRIAN STAVELEY: I came at
it from totally left field.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.150
And I didn't know anything.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.858
And I was stupid.

00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:28.680
And so I thought, well, "Game of
Thrones" is like 300,000 words,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.910
so I'll write something
that's about 300,000 words.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.971
My editor is sitting here just
cradling his head in his hands.

00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:37.470
That seems like a
good way to start.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.110
And it was not.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.590
Don't do that, by the way.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:43.279
No agent will look at some
random person they've never

00:46:43.279 --> 00:46:44.820
heard of and think,
oh 300,000 words,

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.340
that's a great
length for a book.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.700
MAX GLADSTONE: They'll
look at it and laugh.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.590
get a good belly
chuckle out of it.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:49.200
BRIAN STAVELEY:
Yeah, that's right.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.489
And then never respond to you.

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:52.530
ELIZABETH BEAR: It's a
nice length for a trilogy.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.137
BRIAN STAVELEY: Well, yeah.

00:46:55.137 --> 00:46:56.470
But eventually I found an agent.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:59.366
And then the agent
does the negotiation

00:46:59.366 --> 00:47:00.365
with various publishers.

00:47:00.365 --> 00:47:01.899
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:01.899 --> 00:47:04.190
ELIZABETH BEAR: I mean, I've
done some self-publishing,

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.360
but it was all after
tread publishing for me.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:06.964
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:06.964 --> 00:47:08.880
MAX SALTONSTALL: One
more question back there.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.400
AUDIENCE: How do you go
from an idea to like.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.515
committing to that
idea, meaning like,

00:47:14.515 --> 00:47:17.374
I'm going to create an entire
novel around this idea.

00:47:17.374 --> 00:47:19.010
And how many ideas
do you cycle through

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.635
before you committed to one?

00:47:20.635 --> 00:47:22.676
MAX SALTONSTALL: Or how
do you fail faster so you

00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:23.610
can discard the bad ones?

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.700
JAMES CAMBIAS: That's actually,
yes, a damn good question.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.870
ELIZABETH BEAR: It is.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.110
JAMES CAMBIAS: For
the first one it was,

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:33.620
that was the idea
I had at the time

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.660
which seemed like I could
make a novel out of.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.905
But the next one,
actually for "Corsair,"

00:47:38.905 --> 00:47:40.820
I followed sort of an
interesting approach

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.360
which I had heard about
from Mary Robinette Kowal.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.450
Which is, she kind
of draws up a list

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.450
of novels she's like to
write and then asks her agent

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.860
which one they could sell.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.010
And that's sort of what
we did with "Corsair."

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.530
This is a book
that I could write

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.320
and my agent
thought it would be,

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.155
of the ones I had suggested, was
the one that was most sellable.

00:48:02.155 --> 00:48:03.780
ELIZABETH BEAR: Once
you're established

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.140
you get a fair amount of
input from editors and agents

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.820
as to what they might
like to see next.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.490
When I'm just
starting out or when

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.260
I'm writing something that's
just for me, like short fiction

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.453
that I'm going to then write
and sell as a completed piece

00:48:19.453 --> 00:48:22.280
to a magazine, which involves
a submission and rejection

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:28.860
process, still, to this
day, I still get rejections.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:34.220
The way that works
is basically, when

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:38.720
I have an idea I start
a file for the story.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.660
If it has a title,
I give it a title.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.340
I save it in a
file with the date.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.355
And every time I
work on a story,

00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:44.990
I save it in a new
file with a new date

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.990
because that's how my
backup system works.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.990
That way I have iterating--
if one file gets

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.220
corrupted I have everything
on either side of it.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.380
And then basically, I just
wait until-- unless I've

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.280
got a deadline pushing
me, I wait until the idea

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.740
becomes compelling.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.030
And then I write it.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.780
And the thing is that
ideas never go away.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.110
I've got one short
story which rejoices

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.655
in the title of "On Safari
in Ralay and Carcosa with Gun

00:49:15.655 --> 00:49:19.340
and Camera," that has
consisted of that title

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:25.780
and a first sentence since 1989.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.640
And now I've got like
a paragraph and a half.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.320
And this sucker's
going down before 2020.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.729
That's my commitment.

00:49:33.729 --> 00:49:36.145
And I know it's going to be
like a 5,000 word short story.

00:49:36.145 --> 00:49:38.065
It's just taken me forever
to get my teeth into it.

00:49:38.065 --> 00:49:39.775
JAMES CAMBIAS: I've
had a similar one.

00:49:39.775 --> 00:49:41.200
I'm not going to
spill the title,

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.240
but I've got a
short story which I

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.050
keep coming back to every year.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.680
And it's like, can I
write this one yet?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.514
No, as it turns out.

00:49:48.514 --> 00:49:50.013
BRIAN STAVELEY: I
also think writing

00:49:50.013 --> 00:49:52.471
a book is a little bit like
mountaineering or marriage.

00:49:52.471 --> 00:49:52.970
Right?

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.890
You know, if you
have a peak in mind,

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.970
you don't know what the
weather is going to do.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.390
All you can do-- you
check the forecast.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.880
You check the conditions.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.390
You're as sure as you can be
that you can do that that day.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.155
And then you get to a point
where you just go for it.

00:50:10.155 --> 00:50:11.280
And same way with marriage.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.613
You can't be certain what's
going to happen in 20 years,

00:50:13.613 --> 00:50:15.490
but you know you
love that person.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.760
And you're as sure
as you can be.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.740
And then you go for it.

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.070
And I feel the same way
with writing a book.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.620
OK.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.410
I think I can do this.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.697
And I love it.

00:50:26.697 --> 00:50:28.780
ELIZABETH BEAR: And a book
is a shorter commitment

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.446
than a marriage.

00:50:29.446 --> 00:50:30.300
BRIAN STAVELEY: Yes.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.950
Yes.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.450
And less deadly
than mountaineering.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.345
ELIZABETH BEAR: Yes.

00:50:33.345 --> 00:50:35.120
And hopefully a longer
commitment than a mountain.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.050
BRIAN STAVELEY: Yeah.

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.085
And less deadly.

00:50:37.085 --> 00:50:41.531
MAX GLADSTONE: So less nomic,
but honestly, I have a--

00:50:41.531 --> 00:50:43.280
BRIAN STAVELEY: I
didn't even [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.890
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:44.640
Exactly.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.720
That's good.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.260
I have a notepad on my phone,
like one little note document,

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.260
and if I come up with an idea
for a book, I'll write it down.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.910
And I generally have a
couple of projects on deck.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:00.240
And this was true before I
ever got a publishing deal.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.762
I had the book that I was
working on at the moment

00:51:02.762 --> 00:51:03.970
that I kept chipping away on.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.428
You really need to
finish something

00:51:05.428 --> 00:51:08.079
if you're going to ever have a
hope of getting it out there,

00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:09.620
or even just showing
to your friends.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.160
Be like, hey!

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:10.701
Check it out!

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:11.340
Look, I did it!

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.030
Read it.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.949
It's great.

00:51:12.949 --> 00:51:14.990
And then you watch them
while they're reading it.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.740
What do you think?

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.980
ELIZABETH BEAR: That's
a little creepy, Max.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.180
MAX GLADSTONE: Well, you know I
never claimed not to be creepy,

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.346
ELIZABETH BEAR: Fair enough.

00:51:21.346 --> 00:51:25.720
MAX GLADSTONE: But
anyway, so-- so that's

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.390
like a nine month
process for me.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.090
It's slower for some people
and faster for others.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.890
And that means a lot
of ideas just pile up.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.224
And they just go in the notepad.

00:51:33.224 --> 00:51:34.848
And I almost never
look at the notepad.

00:51:34.848 --> 00:51:37.470
The question is which of those
ideas that I actually committed

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:40.970
to virtual paper, anyway,
stay alive in the mind

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.585
until I'm sitting
down and I'm staring

00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:44.950
at "The end" on the
second or third book

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.280
that I had plans to write.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.890
And then it's like, well,
what am I-- oh, that one.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:49.470
That one.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.134
They just live.

00:51:51.134 --> 00:51:53.300
MAX SALTONSTALL: Thank you
all very much for coming.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.410
We've got some
books in the back.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.780
And stick around,
maybe, for a couple

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.010
of minutes to do a little
bit of signing and chatting?

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.635
MAX GLADSTONE: Thank
you for having us.

00:51:59.635 --> 00:52:00.910
Thanks, everybody.
