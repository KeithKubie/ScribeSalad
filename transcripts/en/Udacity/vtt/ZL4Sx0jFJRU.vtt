00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.100
All right, let's walk through the solution to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.680
this guy. It's a pretty straightforward one line

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.940
solution. We simply say baseball weight equals baseball

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.370
weight.fillna numpy.mean baseball weight. What we're doing here

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.120
is saying let's compute the mean of all

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.040
the existing non NA values in baseball weight.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.420
Then let's take all the NA's in baseball

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.860
weight. And replace them with this mean value.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.740
Let's take the baseball weight column, and replace it with

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.259
this new column, which doesn't have any NA values in it.
