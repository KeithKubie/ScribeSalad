00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.649
Empathy: it’s not just for humans anymore!

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:12.260
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’ve
been on the internet the past few days, then

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.150
you might’ve seen this story about Koko
the gorilla mourning the death of Robin Williams.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.830
Koko is part of California’s Gorilla Foundation,
and she’s well-known for her fluency in

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.830
English.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.539
She’s capable of signing and communicating
over 1,000 words in English.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.470
Back in 2004, Williams visited Koko to film
a PSA for the foundation - and the two developed

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780
a special bond.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.129
So earlier this week, when Koko heard of his
passing, photos surfaced on the internet showing

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.629
her emotional reaction to hearing the news.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.399
According to her caretakers, she became incredibly
somber - quivering her lip, and signing the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.239
words “woman” and “cry.”

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.270
Now aside from being horribly sad, part of
the reason this story is gaining so much attention

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.780
- is that a lot of us out there assume that
humans are the only animals capable of empathy.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.940
Primate researchers will tell you differently,
but it’s still a widely-debated topic.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
And a new study, published this week in PeerJ,
aims to examine the relationship between human

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.910
empathy and empathy of apes.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.150
Specifically, they looked at bonobos - which
are our closest evolutionary cousins - and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.050
they examined them under the context of emotional
contagion.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.369
It’s the ability to transfer your emotions
to another person using facial expressions,

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.899
and it’s widely considered to be the most
basic form of empathy.

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.659
One of the most trivial forms of that, can
be seen in the phenomenon of yawn contagion

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.469
- or contagious yawning.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.159
Interestingly, humans and bonobos are the
only two species where yawn contagion seems

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.120
to follow an empathic trend - meaning it’s
more likely to occur between individuals who

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.159
share a strong emotional bond.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.010
Which is another reason they chose bonobos
for this study.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.780
Over the course of five years, a team of researchers
observed both humans and bonobos doing everyday

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.790
activities, and they took note of how many
times each individual responded to another’s

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.840
yawns, and how quickly it took them to respond.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.080
It turns out, that in cases where the yawner
and the responder were NOT friends, bonobos

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.789
responded just as quickly to another’s yawns,
as humans did.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.790
Meaning emotional contagion may be just as
prominent in bonobos, as it is in humans.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.790
HOWEVER.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.020
In cases where the yawner and the responder
were close, or had a strong bond - humans

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.440
still reacted more quickly to someone else’s
yawn, than bonobos.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.350
Researchers believe this might be due to the
complex emotional foundations that human relationships

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.480
are built on - but it still highlights an
important conclusion of this study.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.320
Which is that when it comes to empathy, a
close relationship between individuals is

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.030
more important, than their species.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.150
The Robin Williams story is a good example
of that - but there’s an even better one,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.200
involving the same gorilla, Koko - adopting
a kitten, caring for it for many months, and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.490
then expressing deep sadness when she learned
the kitten died.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.340
That story has since been adapted into a children’s
book - and it’s a poignant example of the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.050
deep emotional bonds that can exist between
two individuals, even those of wildly different

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.050
species.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.690
I’m sure some of you out there have pets,
or similar stories of bonds you’ve developed

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.690
with other animals.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.520
If so, feel free to share them in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.930
watching!
