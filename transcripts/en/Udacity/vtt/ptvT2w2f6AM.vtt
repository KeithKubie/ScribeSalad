Before we move on from
artificial intelligence,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.910
we need to cover one more thing,
Bayes rule.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.020
Bayes Rule is one of the foundational
elements of artificial intelligence and

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.540
a critical concept of
machine learning as well.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.640
So let's briefly hear from Sebastian
on Bayes rule, and Bayes networks.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.780
Note that understanding this relies on
having some prerequisite probability and

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.110
statistics knowledge.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.950
If you find yourself confused about
syntax, we recommend you review some of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.160
the resources linked in
the instructor's notes below.
