series making apps beautiful in this
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.240
series making apps beautiful in this
part we're going to focus on the spacing

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
part we're going to focus on the spacing
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.930
part we're going to focus on the spacing
and the typography of the list item as

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940
and the typography of the list item as
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880
and the typography of the list item as
well as the detail view to make it look

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
well as the detail view to make it look
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580
well as the detail view to make it look
more beautiful so let's just switch to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
more beautiful so let's just switch to
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.130
more beautiful so let's just switch to
our phone to see where we were up to at

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
our phone to see where we were up to at
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.859
our phone to see where we were up to at
the end of the last part and we've

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
the end of the last part and we've
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019
the end of the last part and we've
modernized the app and had an action bar

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
modernized the app and had an action bar
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.900
modernized the app and had an action bar
gotten rid of the virtual navigation

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910
gotten rid of the virtual navigation
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.880
gotten rid of the virtual navigation
menu button the legacy menu button but

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
menu button the legacy menu button but
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430
menu button the legacy menu button but
you know we look at this and the text

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
you know we look at this and the text
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020
you know we look at this and the text
isn't particularly well formatted the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
isn't particularly well formatted the
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450
isn't particularly well formatted the
images are an inconsistent size when we

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
images are an inconsistent size when we
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100
images are an inconsistent size when we
go into the detailed view the text is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
go into the detailed view the text is
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.010
go into the detailed view the text is
kind of going from edge to edge there's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
kind of going from edge to edge there's
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.610
kind of going from edge to edge there's
still some glaring problems from a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
still some glaring problems from a
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529
still some glaring problems from a
design point of view that's what we're

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
design point of view that's what we're
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090
design point of view that's what we're
going to look at fixing up in this part

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
going to look at fixing up in this part
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.369
going to look at fixing up in this part
so let's go back to the slides and let's

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379
so let's go back to the slides and let's
 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.720
so let's go back to the slides and let's
let's see what we're going to try and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
let's see what we're going to try and
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.639
let's see what we're going to try and
achieve the first thing we want to do is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
achieve the first thing we want to do is
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.210
achieve the first thing we want to do is
have a consistent set of heights for

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
have a consistent set of heights for
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550
have a consistent set of heights for
each of our list items so we're using a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
each of our list items so we're using a
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830
each of our list items so we're using a
48dp rhythm as per the Android design

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
48dp rhythm as per the Android design
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.330
48dp rhythm as per the Android design
guidelines so if we look at where where

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
guidelines so if we look at where where
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580
guidelines so if we look at where where
we are now this is actually what we want

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
we are now this is actually what we want
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710
we are now this is actually what we want
to be so when we look at these slides

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
to be so when we look at these slides
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410
to be so when we look at these slides
now you see that the the line items the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
now you see that the the line items the
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600
now you see that the the line items the
the list items are really nicely spaced

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
the list items are really nicely spaced
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490
the list items are really nicely spaced
out and we've got some margins on either

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
out and we've got some margins on either
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.980
out and we've got some margins on either
side of the the detailed view as well so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
side of the the detailed view as well so
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.569
side of the the detailed view as well so
let's look at how we do that in code so

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579
let's look at how we do that in code so
 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.100
let's look at how we do that in code so
switching over to code we've specified

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
switching over to code we've specified
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499
switching over to code we've specified
the dimensions XML file we want to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
the dimensions XML file we want to
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.440
the dimensions XML file we want to
abstract out the the values that we're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
abstract out the the values that we're
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390
abstract out the the values that we're
using as much as possible so we've got

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
using as much as possible so we've got
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670
using as much as possible so we've got
an eight dip vertical margin which just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
an eight dip vertical margin which just
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859
an eight dip vertical margin which just
basically means that on the text views

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
basically means that on the text views
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.139
basically means that on the text views
we're going to have it department margin

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
we're going to have it department margin
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030
we're going to have it department margin
above and below and so the way we're

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
above and below and so the way we're
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590
above and below and so the way we're
going to do that is in this list item

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
going to do that is in this list item
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.560
going to do that is in this list item
article in our linear layout that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
article in our linear layout that
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.139
article in our linear layout that
contains our text views we have this

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
contains our text views we have this
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300
contains our text views we have this
margin top and margin bottom defined

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
margin top and margin bottom defined
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.649
margin top and margin bottom defined
with our list item vertical margin in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
with our list item vertical margin in
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.980
with our list item vertical margin in
the the detailed view for the fragment

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
the the detailed view for the fragment
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.609
the the detailed view for the fragment
we are also going to use a margin left

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
we are also going to use a margin left
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.300
we are also going to use a margin left
and a margin

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
and a margin
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.530
and a margin
right and we're going to use that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
right and we're going to use that
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.720
right and we're going to use that
detailed horizontal margin and that's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
detailed horizontal margin and that's
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.370
detailed horizontal margin and that's
what's going to give us the spacing on

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
what's going to give us the spacing on
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.030
what's going to give us the spacing on
either side of that detailed view so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
either side of that detailed view so
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.140
either side of that detailed view so
switching back to the slides and you can

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
switching back to the slides and you can
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760
switching back to the slides and you can
see the kind of spacing that we're after

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
see the kind of spacing that we're after
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.509
see the kind of spacing that we're after
what we want to do is once we've we've

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
what we want to do is once we've we've
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.330
what we want to do is once we've we've
put those dimensions in we also want to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
put those dimensions in we also want to
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.100
put those dimensions in we also want to
now fix up the spacing with the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
now fix up the spacing with the
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.170
now fix up the spacing with the
thumbnails and basically what we want to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
thumbnails and basically what we want to
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.509
thumbnails and basically what we want to
do here is eliminate that inconsistency

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519
do here is eliminate that inconsistency
 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.220
do here is eliminate that inconsistency
that we have from thumbnail to thumbnail

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
that we have from thumbnail to thumbnail
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.259
that we have from thumbnail to thumbnail
the way we're going to do that is use

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269
the way we're going to do that is use
 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.479
the way we're going to do that is use
the center crop attribute on the image

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
the center crop attribute on the image
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.380
the center crop attribute on the image
view and set the scale type so that way

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
view and set the scale type so that way
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.720
view and set the scale type so that way
it's nice and consistent from each image

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
it's nice and consistent from each image
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.630
it's nice and consistent from each image
to image the next thing we want to do is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
to image the next thing we want to do is
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.340
to image the next thing we want to do is
focus on the typography so if you look

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
focus on the typography so if you look
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.550
focus on the typography so if you look
at the image on the left the fonts there

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
at the image on the left the fonts there
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.479
at the image on the left the fonts there
okay they're not they're not

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489
okay they're not they're not
 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.550
okay they're not they're not
particularly attractive you can see very

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
particularly attractive you can see very
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350
particularly attractive you can see very
much on the right hand side that we've

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
much on the right hand side that we've
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.449
much on the right hand side that we've
paid a lot of attention to detail there

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
paid a lot of attention to detail there
 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.479
paid a lot of attention to detail there
and made some some really good changes

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
and made some some really good changes
 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.580
and made some some really good changes
so let's look at what we did there we're

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590
so let's look at what we did there we're
 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830
so let's look at what we did there we're
going to look at the the two main text

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
going to look at the the two main text
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.870
going to look at the the two main text
views the top one is the the title and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
views the top one is the the title and
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.150
views the top one is the the title and
then the subtitle in each in each list

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
then the subtitle in each in each list
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.069
then the subtitle in each in each list
item so you'll see that we've used a

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079
item so you'll see that we've used a
 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.349
item so you'll see that we've used a
condensed font and made it bold in the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359
condensed font and made it bold in the
 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.130
condensed font and made it bold in the
for the title for the subtitle we've

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140
for the title for the subtitle we've
 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.370
for the title for the subtitle we've
actually changed the color of the text

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
actually changed the color of the text
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.199
actually changed the color of the text
so that it's it contrasts less and you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
so that it's it contrasts less and you
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.789
so that it's it contrasts less and you
may want to abstract that out too and

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799
may want to abstract that out too and
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.009
may want to abstract that out too and
we've also made it all caps the other

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019
we've also made it all caps the other
 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.449
we've also made it all caps the other
thing you want to look at is the fact

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459
thing you want to look at is the fact
 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.289
thing you want to look at is the fact
that with both of these we've actually

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299
that with both of these we've actually
 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.490
that with both of these we've actually
fixed the number of lines and we used

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
fixed the number of lines and we used
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.289
fixed the number of lines and we used
this property called ellipse eyes which

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299
this property called ellipse eyes which
 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.849
this property called ellipse eyes which
will basically truncate the text and put

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859
