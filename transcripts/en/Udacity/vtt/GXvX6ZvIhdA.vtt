00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.260
Now that we've got the background image of our new location let's go ahead and

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.730
get some more information about the new city.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.990
For that let's start by pulling up some New York Times articles about it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.810
The New York Times provides an article search API

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.970
that pulls articles from 1851 to today.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.420
This request will be a bit more complicated than simply creating a URL string

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.790
for an image tag.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.500
To start, we'll need an API key.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.530
Many APIs want you to use a special name called an API key

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.730
to identify yourself when you access their data.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.330
There are a lot of reasons for this.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.010
For instance, they might want to limit the rate of your request so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.390
they don't get overwhelmed.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.030
As long as you aren't issuing thousands of GET requests per day to this app,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.390
you probably won't need to worry about a rate limit.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.970
But all of your requests still need to have your key attached to them.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.440
The New York Times uses their own API key, so you'll need to sign up for

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.610
a free account in order to complete the project.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.080
Another thing you'll sometimes run into is authentication.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.200
Services like Facebook and Twitter use OAuth to authenticate users.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.970
They only people with accounts to be able to get data since that data is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.260
often not publicly accessible.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.200
You won't have to worry about authentication for

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.150
this course, but if you want to build more involved applications with

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.830
services like Facebook that's something you'll have to figure out.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.740
Luckily, most services that require authentication also provide getting

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.970
started guides with example code and detailed explanations.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.600
For now, head over to the link in the instructor notes for

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.050
requesting a New York Times API key and follow the instructions here.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.490
After you got your key,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.130
check this box right here to let us know you're ready to keep going.
