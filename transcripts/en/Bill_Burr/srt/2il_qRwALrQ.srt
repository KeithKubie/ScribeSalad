1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,940
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,530
just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. What's going on?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,130
How I yeah,
I am once again,

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,340
this is like all of a sudden I never
have fucking guests and then all of a

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:18,720
sudden they all come out of the
woodwork almost at the same time on all

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,710
musicians. And once again,
we have a very special guest,

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,410
a Ms Tal Wilkenfeld how are you? I'm
good. You got a new album coming out. Yup.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,620
Right. It just can't, you know, I
didn't even want to start with that.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,690
Cause I know you've fucking been talking
about all kinds of music I had asked

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,100
you, cause we were over your place right
now. Well, how are you liking the Vitamix?

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,150
I love the Vitamix because I got
into like the, I'm an old man now.

12
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,140
I don't know if he can tell.
I use a lot of lotion, right?

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,130
They can still in my twenties but I'm
about to turn 51 here in June. And uh, I,

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,000
I've started to do like for breakfast. I
like to just have like a smoothie. Yeah.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,160
His phone. He's, that sounds
to everybody doesn't live in,

16
00:00:56,161 --> 00:01:00,270
it's the fucking greatest thing ever.
Right? You just drink it. You full. Yeah.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,570
You know, rather than doing the
Denny's grand slam breakfast,

18
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,360
you feel like a tub of shit,
which makes you eat something else bad.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,350
So people been telling me about the
Vitamix and this is where I am in my life

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,630
where I'm like,
like that was the thing.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,700
You have all these amazing
instruments and shit.

22
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,710
And the thing that stuck
out was like, Ooh, Vitamix.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,850
I wonder if that one mashes up the fucking
spinach and Kale a little bit better.

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,230
The best recipe to you do cause I got it.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,600
I got two really good ones that I
stand by. What are they trade? Uh,

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,740
I got one that uh, I substituted the
Kale for spinach. Spinach tastes better.

27
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:35,070
All it is, it's just that.
So if a Dandelion Greens,

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
just Fyi you with,
I need the landline Greens now.

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,040
What do you do to sweeten that
up so it's not bitter as shit?

30
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,250
I used some honey just a little
bit. Just a little bit. Yeah, man.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,100
One time my wife took
me to some restaurant.

32
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,150
We ended up eating like Dan the lines
like a damn light. We both trying it,

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,510
not like, hey man, let's be healthy. We
both looked at each other. It's like, oh,

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,180
it was one of the worst things I ever
tasted it. So when you grind that up,

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,250
what do you have almond milk in there too?
Or Center?

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,990
It's actually a juice really. It's not
like a smoothie. Um, but it's quite thick,

37
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:08,340
which is why I still call it a smoothie,
but mine has dandelion Greens, Cilantro,

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,430
a little bit of black pepper.
Oh my God.

39
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,780
Tumeric and ginger. Like fresh
ginger, which Richard, call me.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
What you stand by that it's this sounds,
it sounds.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,100
What else do I put it in their water?

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,940
There's obviously water and then I
get hungry. An hour and a half later.

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,803
Where do you buy?

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,410
Danny was go in your backyard and
yanked them out of the fucking grass.

45
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,770
What do you, what do you get your
dental, ENT. Any health food store?

46
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,410
Wholefoods or I've never said,
I gotta be honest with you.

47
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,080
And I've been to a few of those
little health food places. I've never,

48
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,800
I've never seen that. But uh, all
right. Mine. Mine is just simple.

49
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,060
It's just a almond.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,500
It's a almond milk with some almonds
just in case there's not enough almond in

51
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:53,550
there that some spinach,
uh, to fuck is a banana.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,110
A little bit of ice.

53
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,560
And I know I'm forgetting something
says cinnamon blueberries ever use

54
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,010
blueberries? No, I gotta get
a couple of goals cause I,

55
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,390
I basically have to go to smoothies
and I'm getting sick of them.

56
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,630
And then I have like this Greek yogurt
parfait and I just sort of rotate that on

57
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,910
a three thing. I'm just,
I've had it, you know,

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,370
you don't like when you've been jamming
with people too long, you're like,

59
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,660
we need some new blood or something.

60
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,360
That's where I am assuming you're trying
to steer it back to the music here.

61
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,510
So let's at least say the name of your
incredible album that I only heard three

62
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,360
tracks of, cause I couldn't
figure out how to download it. Um,

63
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,850
for those of you not
familiar with Tal, she's, uh,

64
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,450
she's basically played with everybody and
I promised her I wasn't going to bring

65
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,680
up all the past like, hey man, what
was it like playing with this person?

66
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:33,514
But she's,
you know,

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,040
I MDB or she's played with literally
everybody and you've basically been known

68
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:43,420
as this monster Bass player that
can just play with anybody. And, uh,

69
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:47,760
your hidden talent of an unbelievable
singing voice is finally displayed.

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,740
That that's what killed
me when I listened to you.

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,500
Just played those three
tracks for me. Aside from, of
course, how upfront, you know,

72
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:57,160
the basis and all the mics,
which I'm loving. Um, I, yeah,

73
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,450
I had no idea you could sing like that.

74
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,780
I kind of, um, I, I've
kept it quiet for awhile.

75
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,070
Like I started as a singer songwriter
when I first picked up guitar and then,

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,290
um,

77
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,710
sort of started focusing just on guitar
when I moved to America because I left

78
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,730
home when I was 16,

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,230
and I moved to America and I went to
this music school for a little while and,

80
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,550
uh,
I went from like,

81
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,690
I hope you went to a nice place,

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,780
all this crap about the
Michael Jackson documentary,

83
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:27,170
which I refuse to fucking watch.
Why would you do that?

84
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:30,620
Why would you put all those that those
horrible stories in your head? It's like,

85
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,500
I get it. All right. The guy was
a creep, but now he's dead. So

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,690
what are we doing? I guess
you got list. Somebody going,

87
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:42,550
someone was telling me going, you, how
will you have to watch it? So then you,

88
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,030
you as a parent,
it's like,

89
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:49,031
I'm not going to let some fucking guy
sleep with my kid behind nine doors anyway

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,750
, so you've got this album
coming out. So I went to, um,

91
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,950
I went to this,

92
00:04:55,951 --> 00:05:00,951
this school and I went from being allowed
to play like half an hour a day to

93
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,970
wanting to practice for like six hours

94
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,330
day. Was that torture for you considering
the way you took? I remember hearing,

95
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,470
I watched that interview, you said the
first time you actually played a chord,

96
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,360
you got emotional, you cried. Yeah.

97
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,120
So you love something that much and
then all of a sudden you go into,

98
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,880
you're going to school in Australia.

99
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,760
So they were teaching about Columbus and
all the great stuff that happened here

100
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,360
in America of course. Right.
Whatever it was, how you guys,

101
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,390
you got dropped off by the
English and so what happened?

102
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,210
Something like that where a
bunch of convicts apparently.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

103
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,300
So then all of a sudden,
was that torture for you in school?

104
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,200
It was just, it was hard
because, um, you know,

105
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:42,180
academia was the focus. Especially like,
um, where I, with who I grew up with,

106
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,100
you know, um, my mom just like
really wanted me to, uh, you know,

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,250
do all my head. Yeah. I do all
my schoolwork and stuff. I mean,

108
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,320
she's probably just being
a responsible parent,

109
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:57,321
but like I just was not into
geography and history I was into.

110
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,780
So did you ever just like to pick up the
bass and be like, mom, listen to this.

111
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,760
I mean, listen to this and then look at
my grades in math and you tell me which

112
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:08,080
direction I'm supposed to go in.

113
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,300
I mean, uh, I was just, I was
a guitarist at that point.

114
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,130
Like I only switched
to bass when I was 17,

115
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,730
which I already moved to America
at that point. But yeah, I mean,

116
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:21,050
she hugged me play. I just, I
think that like, you know, uh,

117
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,090
the music business is a tough place and
she probably just thought like, ah, maybe,

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,970
maybe that's not the best thing for
you to do, to be in the music industry.

119
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,270
It's so uncertain. Um, so,

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,610
but I wasn't going to listen to
what anyone was going to say.

121
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:39,080
Like that's all I knew that I had to be
a musician and I didn't care if I was

122
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,510
going to be homeless and,
and be a musician. I just,

123
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,550
I knew that that's what I had to do.
So

124
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,240
I ever wonder how many this,
how many musicians are out there?

125
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,100
Because that story is like,

126
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:52,670
you had that inner drive and
like I always wondered like,

127
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,380
how many like Jimi Hendrix or like working
at home depot because their parents

128
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:01,040
or, or some something, you know, they just
didn't have that thing to be like, no, no,

129
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,720
no, fuck that. I'm doing it. Right. Um,

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,450
really important people that basically
taught you how to walk and talk and all

131
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:12,160
of that stuff start telling you, you
know, you shouldn't go in that direction.

132
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,410
That's just something that you, is,
was that something that developed?

133
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,190
Was it the love that you had when you
started playing guitar that you will like,

134
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,790
no, I literally have to do this? Or do you
feel you always had sort of that, that,

135
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,133
uh,
that drive?

136
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,950
Well, I actually think, um, as a kid,

137
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,030
especially as a teenager, like if your
parents tell you not to do something,

138
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:36,150
you're gonna want to do it more.
Like 99% of teenagers.

139
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,090
I dread those days when my daughter.
Okay. Yeah. So it probably worked, uh,

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,930
out in the right way that she didn't
really want me to focus on music because

141
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:50,390
that just made me want to do it more. Oh,
okay. Yeah. I mean I'm kind of, I mean,

142
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,770
I wouldn't even say I was
necessarily rebellious,

143
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,190
but if you want something in that bad and
someone's telling you no, you're like,

144
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,790
well,
I'll prove to you that,

145
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,470
that I really deserve this and I'm
gonna work my ass off. And I did, like,

146
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:02,730
I was so focused,

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
like my rebellion as a teenager
was to succeed as a musician.

148
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,880
It wasn't like to go off and
do drugs or whatever else.

149
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,720
Like that was my rebellion was,
was success.

150
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,790
You know, I went to, I was
looking at schools to see
which one to take, you know,

151
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,400
put my daughter and you know, all the
public schools are shit out here, I guess.

152
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,130
So you're going to send them to private
school and spend like a zillion dollars

153
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,650
by the time I'm like eight.
It's so fucking stupid.

154
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,860
So he went to this one and it was
like a French speaking one. Right.

155
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,780
So all the kids, it was amazing. The kids
were super smart as a great school and,

156
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,550
and, but the lady given like the tour,
right? She goes, uh, the hell did she say?

157
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,770
I asked her, I said, hey, you know, uh,

158
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,360
to the parents kind of learned French
along the way. She's like, no, we,

159
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:51,210
we encourage you to speak
the perfect English at home
and blah, blah. I said, well,

160
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,110
what if I want to learn it
too? When she looked at me,
she goes, yes, it's too late.

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,670
I was just like, God damn, I actually
respected it, but you know what?

162
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm so happy she said that to me because
now I've got this thing like, God,

163
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
I'll show you. Yeah. And I got flashcards.

164
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,510
I would have flash cards
and I'm like looking at,

165
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,430
I'm trying to put together phrases and
stuff. I listened to the back of my head.

166
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:16,431
I know she's probably right and I love
the school and I'm actually excited that

167
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,540
the potential to go there. But like
I do relate to that as far as, um,

168
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,980
when somebody says that,

169
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,510
but there was a period of my life
where I wasn't that guy. Oh yeah.

170
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,610
Like if somebody said that to me, I'd be
like, okay, forget it. Oh really? So yeah,

171
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,680
I've probably had that since
I was really young, like, uh,

172
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,900
like just determination to
do whatever I want to do.

173
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,500
Cause like I remember
being super focused on, um,

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,820
running before I was a guitar player and
I was like obsessed with long distance

175
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:48,240
running. Like, and, and in my head
I'm like, I have to be the best,

176
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,490
I have to be the best
runner gold from Australia.

177
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:54,900
One girl that was better than
me and it pissed me off so much.

178
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,860
And I remember like, there was
this one race that was, I dunno,

179
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,310
it was like a 10 mile race. It
was really long and, and I just,

180
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,320
I just had to beat this, go.
And I did beat the girl you did.

181
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,070
But I did this like,
um,

182
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,120
like still a Vittori dance afterwards
because I was so excited and I threw my

183
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,610
back out and know. Yeah. So then I,

184
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,220
I kind of was like hobbling around for
a little while and couldn't run like a

185
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,220
couple of weeks.

186
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,150
And then that's actually when I walked
past that guitar and started playing get

187
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:28,440
this out. Right. Yeah. Wow. She
got mad when you did that dance.

188
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,030
I mean, I don't think she saw it.
She was that far behind me. Wow.

189
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,320
That's like a feel good movie except they
always run credits before you blow out

190
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,870
your back. Then you became like
a musician. So you know, the,

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,650
the few tracks that I heard that through,

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,790
the three that I listened
to was definitely, you know,

193
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,930
this is really like a very personal
album as far as like, you know,

194
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,850
talking to yourself though,
that one you just played.

195
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,210
What was the name of the haunted heart?
Love haunted love.

196
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,410
The one that's just the base and
voice with the orchestra. Yeah.

197
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,620
That was some pretty,
uh,

198
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,610
heavy lyrics that may be sort
start thinking about my parents.

199
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,520
I went on a little trip there.
One of those. Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,970
Thinking about my whole life and um,
I fo people listening here,

201
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,550
I can't recommend like the level of
quality of, of the music that you've,

202
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,570
you've done with other
people now to actually hear,

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,290
hey these are my ideas with
your voice on top of it. Uh,

204
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,600
the second I heard you a few of these,
I was like, oh this is one of these,

205
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,930
these albums I'm just going to put
in back in the day when you had a CD,

206
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,640
just stick it in there until the thing
just uh, started skipping on you. But um,

207
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,920
you mean how your iTunes that
skipping on you right now,

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,550
he like had money second.
I know I am the worst.

209
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm the worst before
all you can download it.

210
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,150
You got Spotify is like I
don't have Spotify. I, I'm,

211
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm this idiot who I still buy music and
then it fills up your computer and now

212
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,220
cause right now I need a new,
I need a new laptop.

213
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:50,070
I need a new phone and I need
new iPod, iPad, the whole thing.

214
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,070
Shit in the bet on me at the
same time. And uh, yeah, I

215
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,890
can I buy it on vinyl? I yeah,
I have a record player. Yes.

216
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,190
I'll even give it to you on vine.
They don't need to do that.

217
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,040
You already got me a Burrito here
from coming over so I'll, I'll, I'll,

218
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,060
I'll throw some money towards
that. But um, what was I gonna say?

219
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,490
So you also mentioned that you're
actually going to be doing a whole tour in

220
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:13,150
this thing too, Huh? Yeah. Now headline
in tour, you open and what are you doing?

221
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,140
Headlining headline in. Nice.
I'm excited. And I got to Boston.

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,240
Is this your first like
big headlining tour?

223
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,780
Cause you've always been like
the hired gun as far as I know,

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
this is your first like,
um,

225
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,550
well I I actually I was opening for
the who with my band and we played the

226
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,690
Boston Garden and some really cool,
is it called the bus and garden?

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,960
They called the TD bank.
North side guiding Qi. How'd
you like that? That was fine.

228
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,220
And you do that recently?
Yeah,

229
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,710
I did some stand up there and I did
jam before with my brothers. So cool.

230
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,450
Uh, we had a good, yeah, we definitely had
a, you know what's so funny is we a ever,

231
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,170
no one was paying attention at all and
we were playing or whatever they thought

232
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,320
was kind of funny that we were doing it.

233
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,540
And this is comedian Jim Brewer who
does this amazing bit on slayer fans,

234
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,960
like how dedicated and crazy they are.
Well we actually play it,

235
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,830
I forget what song we played.

236
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:09,160
We played a slayer song and literally
it was like no one was reacting to

237
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,580
anything we were doing. We suck. Right.
The second we started playing slayer,

238
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,690
some fucking security
guide, like, you know,

239
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,780
halfway up the renewed just goes slayer.

240
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,670
Hilarious. So, um,

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
now your style of music like going no,

242
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,320
you're gonna ask me something
was going to say like,

243
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:30,820
like what does playing before
a standup set do for you?

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,880
It makes the, the venue
not as intimidating. I've
only done it at like what?

245
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,810
Because you know, it stand up in a
place that big doesn't make sense.

246
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,710
You like highlight, you know, I,
I had all these feelings of like,

247
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,690
why am I a, like how did I get
here? What am I doing here?

248
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,990
What the fuck do I have to say that
justifies all these people showing up,

249
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:57,640
you know, the normal, if you're any sort
of like human being, that's what you have.

250
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,020
If you're a psychopath,
you just like, yeah,

251
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,560
well how come I'm not playing the
football stadium or whatever. You know,

252
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,570
I've ever played in the Roman Coliseum.
But I, yeah, I was sitting there and uh,

253
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,220
that's that what was, what was
going through my head. But, um,

254
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,280
the first time I ever did one I did for
the New York comedy festival and I did

255
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,670
Madison Square Garden and, uh, we
got together and jammed in there.

256
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,820
And I just did that because
I love led Zeppelin.

257
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,170
And they did song remains the same.

258
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,620
If I could just play some drums
there and make a little bit of noise.

259
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:27,670
And what happened was we were having so
much fun and I invited so many people

260
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:31,990
down there, they, I, you know, I
didn't ever fully forget where I was,

261
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,430
but next thing you know, you
know I was yelling, Hey Josh,

262
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,430
John is at that Motley
crew thing and you just,

263
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,210
you just yelling and you just
kind of made it yours. Yeah.

264
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,920
So that night it just
didn't, it didn't feel, um,

265
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,970
I was able to kind of just like,

266
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,170
I had already made a bunch of noise in
there and nothing bad happened, you know,

267
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,650
enough the roof collapse. So I think that
that's kind of like what it did for me.

268
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,350
Although I fucked up at the form
cause I played it like three hours.

269
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,060
I almost fucked up cause I was just like,

270
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,930
I got off stage and I was like wiped
out. I was just like, oh no. Oh No.

271
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,640
But then like the adrenaline is like,
oh my God,

272
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,710
what if I bombing from all
these fucking people? You know,

273
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,330
that that'll get you through
a good 90 [inaudible]

274
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,570
but why do you not like play on stage for
your audience? Because I respect them.

275
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,040
Ah, you're a great drama. I
didn't know why you say that.

276
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,970
Uh, I'm good for a comedian. I'll give
you that. But I am not a, you know what I,

277
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,390
I like,
uh,

278
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,310
like one of my favorite things to do
is to watch a pro play cause it's just,

279
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,260
you know, when they're just
doing like a sound check,

280
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,350
a lot of times there'll be physically
playing something that I could play,

281
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,890
but I could never make it sound like that.
And there's always like a personnel,

282
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,050
you know,
if you listen to a really good drama,

283
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,410
you can hear like you can hear
them in the plane, which, um,

284
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,610
you know, took me a while to be able to
hear that. But, uh, now I'm able to do,

285
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,750
and I've, I've, I've seen, I don't know,
there's just something cool about it.

286
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,920
It's like watching a professional hockey
player, like taping up this stick.

287
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,700
There's just something,
when you see a pro doing something,

288
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,730
um, it's an your into it. Especially if
it's your hobby. It's fucking mesmerizing.

289
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,900
So that's, that's why when a
few times I've come over here,

290
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,500
like I'm always in there cause I'm like
sitting back and just watching all of

291
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,320
you guys play.
And um,

292
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,510
my favorite thing about watching a live
band is watching a band that doesn't

293
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:24,140
play it the same way every night and you,
and even if you've never seen the band,

294
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,480
you can tell cause they like looking
at each other and everything.

295
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:29,300
So that's when I get into like, aw
man, they're in the moment right now.

296
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,010
This is like watching a comic riff.

297
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,980
And so he's going to do something to
make somebody smile and then he adds

298
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:34,820
something else tonight.

299
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:39,440
And just as an audience member and a
fan of music trying to pick up like that

300
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:42,300
thing going on and um, and like my, I,

301
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,110
it turned like I'm the bands
I listened to growing up.

302
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,650
Like I remember Stevie Ray Vaughan,
whenever he was playing a solo,

303
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,040
it was like Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon
and Reese will always looking right

304
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,720
at him. Like, is he going
to go back in again?

305
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,510
Oh are we going to be going back to the,
you know,

306
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,150
him singing and he just would fucking
be wailing and he had this little thing,

307
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,180
you just look at him, he gives, give him
a little nod and how they all were like,

308
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:05,240
okay. And, and, and they
wouldn't fuck that up.

309
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,690
I'm just having attempted to Gino get
together with friends and play and

310
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:13,580
everything. I just, I've, I have
such an admiration for it. So, um,

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,840
I mean that's how I feel about comedy
and great comedy and that's why I like

312
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,840
watching you perform. Oh yeah. When
I do a great shit joke and I, okay.

313
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,750
I not over to somebody who just did
a dick joke gem and it's amazing.

314
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,930
It's right on the same level. No, but
like, cause I just started as, you know,

315
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,750
like getting really heavily into
comedy the past like year or so. Yeah.

316
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,450
And like the reason that appeals to me
so much is because it like speaks to both

317
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,470
parts of me as a
musician. There's the, uh,

318
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,600
the jazz musician in me, which is like
the improvisational musician, which like,

319
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,550
like really enjoys watching you ref like,
and, and just, and then there's like,

320
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,610
then there's like the composer, like
the, the person that's like, you know,

321
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,640
into writing songs and like,
and then watching you create
this amazing materials.

322
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,190
So it's, it's very sad cause that a
requirement for people in your band.

323
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,400
Cause I mean, when you work, when
you go and do this tour, like, uh,

324
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,120
I just know it's doing the same
jokes over and over and over again.

325
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:16,650
It's like you have to like, do something
to break out of it. Do you, um,

326
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,820
on this tour, I mean, you sell on the
album, you got to go out and, and, and,

327
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:24,970
you know, play it and sell the
music to them. Like how, uh,

328
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,180
how much like messing around do you do?

329
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,580
I do a lot and then is a requirement and
that's why it's been really tricky to

330
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:37,350
find band members. And I have
found like the perfect, um,

331
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,160
guitarist and drummer to play
with me because, you know,

332
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,570
my music is a composition. Lee. Um,

333
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,920
like lyrically for instance,

334
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:51,090
very influenced by folk music
or just songwriter music.

335
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,300
But then musically it's um,

336
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,510
it's influenced from anything from
rock to folk to jazz to whatever.

337
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,930
It just goes all over the place.
That's what I was loving. But this,

338
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,010
this is some sort of through line.
Maybe it's you,

339
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,370
I don't know what it is on and because
I was just listening to that song was so

340
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,490
great and then I really started listening
to the mix of it. I'm like, wow,

341
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,710
she's the whole bottom end of this song.
And then it felt like,

342
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:15,870
I don't know how to say technically,

343
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,050
but it felt like the guitars
and keys were like up here and,

344
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,410
but you are the sort of the meat and
potatoes of the whole thing driving the

345
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,030
whole song. But like the uh, the
different tones and stuff. Um,

346
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,420
there was wide I'm, I'm, I'm the worst.
I don't know the names of the, yeah,

347
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,660
when you went into that bridge,

348
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,680
that was all our is up
though with sections called
at Middlesex was just like,

349
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:37,340
what the fuck is that? And then you go
right back to that part that really rocks.

350
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,090
Cos when I looked at you,
I was just like,

351
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,320
that's when the crowd's going to go nuts.

352
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,710
Cause you taking them on this ride where
you coming out and you just, you know,

353
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,920
blowing their wig back in the beginning
and then it goes to this other places

354
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,620
like, Whoa, what the fuck is
this? This is this mood thing.

355
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,770
Well that's where it's like,
hey, if people start taking
the drugs in the crowd,

356
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:57,360
I would feel and look, and I went,
I went, what you'll be doing?

357
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,600
That's what I do. I grew up going to
heavy metal concerts. That was a time,

358
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,400
all of a sudden somebody like sparked up
a fucking J is we used to say. And uh,

359
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,240
and then all of a sudden
like out of nowhere,

360
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,200
you just punched him in the face again
and then the fucking song is over.

361
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,200
It's just like, yeah. Um, I
think that the cohesiveness, um,

362
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,350
on the record comes from like having
the same band play all of these songs,

363
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,940
even though they've, they're very
different. Like, some are, you know,

364
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,970
just vocal and base and some of our
acoustic guitar and, and very, uh,

365
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,580
little, uh, behind me.

366
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:33,270
And then there's like these full rockers
but it's the same band and I just think

367
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,650
that that's really important.

368
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,830
Like for how long does it take
you to put that together? Well,

369
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,920
it took me a few years to sort of search
for the sound of the record and like

370
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:48,220
figure out who was going to play on
it and who, who like what was the,

371
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,370
the best sound for these songs.

372
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,670
And then I finally went
into the studio with

373
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,040
the Blake Mills and Jeremy and Paul
Stacy and uh, we cut corner painter,

374
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,560
which is the first song I played you in.
It's the first song on the record.

375
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,540
And that when I heard that back on
the speakers, and this was no base,

376
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,060
it was just,
I was playing acoustic baritone guitar.

377
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:14,470
Blake was playing guitar and Jeremy was
playing drums and the sound was so full,

378
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,520
I didn't even want to play bass on it.
There's no bass on that song at all.

379
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,560
I just played it on an organ. And then
Belmont tench overdubbed a organ as well,

380
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:26,110
like a pump organ.
But I heard that song was like,

381
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:27,700
this is the lynch pin for the record.

382
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,270
And so then I went home and I like
wrote a bunch of other songs that I felt

383
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:34,210
would fit with that vibe or compliment it.

384
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,470
And then once I'd done that,
we went back in the studio for,

385
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,490
it was like anywhere from like eight to
10 days and cut the whole thing at once.

386
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,060
And so I think that that's part of
the cohesiveness is that we just,

387
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,940
we cut it all together.
Or when you've put together a band,

388
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,940
if you ever had been like, okay,
I know these two people are right,

389
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,260
and then a third person comes in and
so it takes it into another direction.

390
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:59,300
You got to fire one of those other two
people that just cause, but the other,

391
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,240
cause the other person's such a beast.
I mean it's all, it's all about Canada.

392
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,050
Sorry, pointed out the drums
when I said that. Right.

393
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,110
Chemistry take casting
for a movie to like some,

394
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,980
sometimes it's the most important
thing is the casting. All right.

395
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,830
How do you like your life by
the way? I Miss Australia. Um,

396
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,030
I don't Miss Australia. Um, some
of my best friends are there.

397
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:25,330
I definitely miss them, you
know, but, and I miss the beach.

398
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,170
I don't really think that the beach
in La is that cool? No, I gotta be,

399
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,680
I'm terrified of the ocean and every
time I go to Australia, it's like I,

400
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,670
if I was ever, you know, there's
a place to get eaten by a shark.

401
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,850
It is definitely the coasts of
your country. It's so beautiful.

402
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,600
You'd beat me as well. At least I was,
you know, at least you dive beautifully.

403
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,820
I remember we were there in like a,
I don't know when we were, was your,

404
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,120
your weird winter down there, which is
just the different time. And it was too,

405
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,570
it was too cold and
windy. Um, it's not weird.

406
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,540
It's just weird to me cause I'm
in the northern hemisphere, but,

407
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,310
so we were down there and I was expecting
it to be fucking hot and all of a

408
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,330
sudden I was like freezing.
And, uh, but even then I was
looking at, and I was like,

409
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,220
if it wasn't so rough
and it wasn't so cold,

410
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:10,720
I think I would add maybe I did actually
go into the water when I was in Perth

411
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,030
because I just wanted to say
that I stood in the Indian Ocean.

412
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,680
I literally went up to my ankles and I
got back in and then I got in the car and

413
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:21,400
I was listening to the radio and there
was a helicopter following in like an 18

414
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,570
foot tiger shark along the beach just to
let the surfers and everybody know that

415
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:30,571
the thing was there and you guys had
the creepiest terminology ever for when

416
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:35,650
someone gets eaten by a shark, you
say he was taken. That's what I heard.

417
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,920
Oh yeah, it was something, blah, blah.
He got taken. I'm like, Oh my God,

418
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,530
I'd rather be eaten than taken,
eaten to muse. It's over. I mean,

419
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,400
it's fucking horrific.

420
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,650
And then you bleed out and it's
over. Taken means I, I you, you,

421
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,990
you took me somewhere.

422
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,620
I just start thinking of chainsaw massacre
when that fucking guy just grabbed

423
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,720
that woman a yanked her in,
slammed the door.

424
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,870
Hey. Taken. Almost on. Slightly
more polite though. No,

425
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,100
no. Well I guess what the next
word is taken to the movies. Right,

426
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:07,934
exactly.

427
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,410
Taken into the fucking, I been taken
to the movies by some sharks. Oh yeah,

428
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,500
I was going to say, you know, it
seems a, you know what I liked?

429
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,230
It's this fair play on this album.
Yeah.

430
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,670
As far as a, there was a few where it
was the other person. That was a few.

431
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,490
That was you. All right,
so that's a a, that's a,

432
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:31,620
that's an important milestone
in your life when you the,

433
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,500
at least for me it was when I was
able to be like, all right, you know,

434
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:38,380
I was going through that dude
chicks if fucking Psychos, you know,

435
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:42,400
I did that till I was about 35 and I
was just like, all right Phil, you know,

436
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,140
at what point are you going to fucking is,

437
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:48,340
it may be you maybe who you're picking
maybe what you're bringing to the table.

438
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:51,630
And then once I was able to do that,
I am finally ended up meeting Nia.

439
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,301
I,

440
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:57,301
that's kind of why I called the album
love remains because love remains as in

441
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,740
the remnants of love.
Like the aftermath of,

442
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,000
of a love gone bad or love remains.
I like love still exists.

443
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,680
Oh it's true. It is.
Oh I thought you went,

444
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:13,220
there was still pieces of other
relationships in you. It's, it's both.

445
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:17,030
It's like the remnants and then
love still, you know, continues.

446
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:17,960
There's always love.

447
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,030
Well this is theory among my guy friends
that women are able to cry it out cause

448
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,050
you're allowed to cry,

449
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,490
that you're able to get passionate
and then it's just like fucking gone.

450
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,030
Where guys like hang on to shit.

451
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,000
I mean I was reading
this book on Bob Cousy,

452
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,490
he's one of the Great Celtics
and Bill Russell, right.

453
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,920
And one of the greatest players
of all time. And Bob Cousy,

454
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:44,750
his wife passed away and he still has a
picture on the wall and he still talks

455
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,470
to, well I guess they didn't break up.
So maybe it was that. But like, you know,

456
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:52,780
I used to always joke with my wife going,
you know, if I died within three weeks,

457
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,590
you'd have all my clothes
down at goodwill. Hey,

458
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,660
keep me a DVD in a back of a fucking
closet. Where's she's like, no,

459
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:06,010
I would never do that. But I just
feel like women are better at, uh,

460
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,710
either e how you're wired. And then
I also think it's more, it's, uh,

461
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,370
one of the great emotions crying when
the great healing emotions is not

462
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:19,000
acceptable for guys and
you just shut it off.

463
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,970
So not only do you not get to heal,
you actually make yourself,

464
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:26,860
I think worse by fucking, uh, holding
it in. It's bad enough. You know,

465
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:31,360
I dunno, it's, it's a really
a weird thing. So, uh, that's
a, that's actually, I don't,

466
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,050
I don't know what the word is, but to hear
you say that, that, that you actually,

467
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,240
uh,
some of it stays in there.

468
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,180
I don't know what that makes
me feel not as fucked up.

469
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,630
Well also like I feel like when when
you're in love or when you love someone

470
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,310
like it,

471
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,430
people often like projected outwards as
if it's the other person that's making

472
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:54,270
you in love.

473
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,580
Whereas like love is actually just
always in you and that that person is,

474
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,580
is maybe igniting it or oh,
was showing you that it's there,

475
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,290
but it is always there.
And knowing that keeps me centered.

476
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,930
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, that's
not something that you can,

477
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,400
it's hard to remember that, you know,
I would say I would say, I don't know,

478
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,050
I'm actually literally getting
uncomfortable just even talking about it.

479
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,580
It helps.

480
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,580
I was walled off for a long
fucking time and then I,

481
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,540
I had like this massive amount of love
in me and it would just come out in these

482
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,910
weird ways like about like,

483
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,070
like animals being abused or
any sort of person being hurt.

484
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,300
I could feel it,

485
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:42,270
but like if I was just with somebody
and we're going to the movies,

486
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,860
like I didn't even know
what the fuck to do.

487
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,300
I just be sitting there like this
fucking robot. Like, did you enjoy that?

488
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,690
Now we're getting on the subway and it was
just like, and I was meeting people, I,

489
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,660
I just, Oh, I know you,
I, I'm embarrassed at the,

490
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,060
where the kind of person I was back in
the day as far as like trying to get

491
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,070
through stuff like that.
But how did you break through that?

492
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,020
I met somebody I couldn't break up with.

493
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,310
I would in my head fantasize during tough
times of breaking up with my now wife

494
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,490
and in my head we were living
in this place where there was,

495
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,140
there was the first
place was an elevating,

496
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,600
they'll place had stairs and when
she was going to get on the elevator,

497
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,140
even in the fantasy of being single
again before the door closed,

498
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,340
I would run out and go get her.

499
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,850
Or when she would walk down the stairs
at Iri and I come back in like I couldn't

500
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:27,684
eat.
I couldn't even.

501
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,700
And for years I did that
and it never dawned on me.

502
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,620
Like I've always been so fucking like,
not in touched with like, hey bill,

503
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,980
you know, this is the 20,000 fucking
signal. Like I used to ride around.

504
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:47,670
I had a paper back in the day and I used
to ride around in the morning and I had

505
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:51,750
memorized comedy routines of my favorite
comedians and I would fantasize that I

506
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:55,380
was doing them in front of the school
and it didn't dawn on me at that point.

507
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,710
They hit bill. Maybe you want to be
a comedian. It didn't, it was just,

508
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,940
I had no connection to it
whatsoever. Huh. It was just me.

509
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,460
I think at that point it was all about,
you know,

510
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,050
getting people to like me so I wouldn't
get the shit kicked out of me or I

511
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:13,140
wouldn't have to deal with some, you
know, you know, was, you know, it was,

512
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,620
it was before all this carrying on social
media is just like the whole everyday

513
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,040
at school.
It's just like,

514
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,370
am I going to get it today or is or how
can I get it off of me and get it onto

515
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:28,050
the next weakest kid who was
a very weird, um, I dunno,

516
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,410
some of it was good but a lot
of it wasn't a necessarily,

517
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:35,640
probably the way kids should grow up
now we're probably like overly doing it.

518
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,210
I Dunno.

519
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,490
You don't make me feel good when you
came when I came into your place here and

520
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:42,160
you were like, oh there's my phone,
I lose my phone all the time.

521
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,380
Oh my gosh.
You have massive ADHD.

522
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,940
I also unfortunately get phone anxiety,

523
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,350
which I hate. Like oh you
don't have it right? Yeah.

524
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:57,250
If I don't have it I start to like
feel like oh shit, where's the phone?

525
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,760
Or like if I don't look at
it for, for, for too long,

526
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,761
I start to feel that and so I have to
work really hard at like disciplining

527
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,520
myself so that I can like keep it away
from me for a certain amount of hours to

528
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,950
be like creative and productive.
Cause it's just PR.

529
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,470
Like I feel so sorry for like for kids
that are like teenagers right now.

530
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:22,471
Like they just like so attached to their
phones and I see what it does to my

531
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:25,840
brain. Teenager I am.
That was brutal. Yeah.

532
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:30,400
Not like gives you the shortest
attention span it like everything's just

533
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:35,080
immediate.
And so I'm just so glad that like,

534
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,150
uh,
it kind of came a little bit later.

535
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,170
You realize we're like lab rats cause
we're like sort of the first wave of like,

536
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,600
well let's see what this does. The
people I actually saw, you know,

537
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:48,090
I went and I got gas today and I
saw this up to the Burrito or no,

538
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,820
well that's going to be later.
That's what,

539
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:54,550
this podcast will not be a full hour
whenever you're know what's hitting me,

540
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:57,370
what the fuck is on the microphones
that are here and dropping nuts.

541
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,970
Piece of Fuzz. Um, so I
went up to that still there.

542
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,130
See this is the podcast. People
are used to good though. Um,

543
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,150
so I pulled up to get,
I was getting pumping gas and you know,

544
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,760
this la couple pulls up
la meaning beautiful.

545
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,460
I'm not judging them like
they're assholes. They're
fucking beautiful. Right?

546
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,340
So they pull up and the guy
gets out to pump the ghost.

547
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,390
The woman's driving the second
she barely prost park, you know,

548
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,100
the immediately the phone and was just
sitting there and I was watching her and

549
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:30,550
I was just like, that's
me. That is literally me.

550
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,930
I do that when I'm driving like a lot.
I know. Fucking terrible. It's, yeah,

551
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,870
I called a friend up one time,

552
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,450
this is maybe about three months ago.

553
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,540
I was trying to do like an intense
period of writing and I said, hey,

554
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,430
could you just cause I'm,
you know, it takes like,

555
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,570
I think apparently 28 days to break a
habit. I said, can you come over for,

556
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,260
you know, 28 days
apparently, I think, can you,

557
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:57,160
can I give you my phone and then just go
away and then I'll meet you back here?

558
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,350
And I did that for a few days and actually
like helped me like reprogram myself.

559
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,020
Oh yeah, yeah. And like once
you do that, then it's like, ah,

560
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,080
you feel like you can finally relax.
It's weird.

561
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,400
This is something that I learned going
overseas and I can't get texts from

562
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:16,870
anybody. This is what happens if you
don't text anybody. Nobody texted you.

563
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Like I would come back thinking,
oh my God,

564
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,610
I haven't checked my
text messages in 10 days.

565
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,950
I'm going to have 5 million fucking texts.
And I had like maybe six,

566
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,460
seven. Yeah. I don't, what am I a loser?
Nobody. Like if I don't text people,

567
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,430
you're like, no, I come back to a zillion
of them now. I feel like an asshole. No,

568
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:38,140
I came back and it's just like you, uh,
it's, it's like, you know, like once,

569
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:39,920
do you want something in
your life not to happen

570
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,190
and you don't realize how much of it
you're creating? Yeah. Okay. Well,

571
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,870
so much of the phone shit,

572
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,910
I realize I am creating all of the texting
that I'm doing. Like, I'm in traffic.

573
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,650
Traffic sucks. I just start calling
people, right? I'm just like, hey man,

574
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,220
what's going on?
I'm stuck on the fuck.

575
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:00,500
I literally have a friend of mine that
we like we our friendship cause she's

576
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,180
married with kids and I'm married,
didn't have a kid.

577
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,730
It was just like our whole relationship.

578
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,790
I don't think I've seen her in a year
and a half hour relationship that we have

579
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,780
the deal,
the,

580
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,500
an unwritten deal is that we call each
other when we're stuck in traffic. Yeah.

581
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,220
And the big joke is,
hey, I'm on the one 35,

582
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,000
hey I'm on the one on one or the other
person picks up. All right, where are you?

583
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,470
How long a drive do you have?

584
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,250
And it's just like you're sort of almost
like a suicide hotline talking them to

585
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:25,770
get home.

586
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,210
I do like all of my phone
calls in the car to or um,

587
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,530
really, really late at night. Like
while I'm getting ready for bed, like,

588
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,030
like my friends in Australia just know
that I'm going to call it like 3:00 AM my

589
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:42,030
time. Like facetiming them while
I'm like brushing my teeth and shit.

590
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:43,560
And now it's like a ritual. Like, oh,

591
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,380
are you ready for teeth brushing
time and what is it like

592
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,010
seven the next day? They're right. A seven
at night. 14 year olds or even slightly.

593
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,280
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, around,
around about then it's great that guy,

594
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,170
I always call Australia at that time
when I'm getting ready for bed time.

595
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,380
What was the last time you heard
some music that that made you? Uh,

596
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,510
like whenever I listened
to like amazing music,

597
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:07,900
I always fantasize that it's me doing
it. Oh yeah, yeah, I do that. No,

598
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,600
and all the way through the song. If the
drums are awesome, I'm playing drums,

599
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,640
someone singing great,
then all of a sudden I'm doing that.

600
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm very self involved.

601
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,760
One was the last time you as a musician
listened to something and you were just

602
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:20,500
like, ah, fuck. I wish that was me.

603
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,710
Does that happen? I don't
know. It doesn't happen.

604
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,110
But strike too with the texting
and now fantasy, the fantasizing.

605
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,060
I don't do that.
But I listened and admire a lot of people.

606
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,070
Who'd you to listen to it coming up?

607
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,900
I didn't want to ask you
any of these questions.

608
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,750
I know you've been asked this fuck,

609
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,240
I listen to miles Davis and then
of course there was the bgs,

610
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,490
jazz disco.
I just,

611
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,540
you know what I'm really obsessed
with is his Indian classical music.

612
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,560
Do you remember that time?

613
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:55,670
We were like driving back from one of
your shows and I played you some Indian

614
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,910
Indian classical music. I've played
you. I remember we were meeting,

615
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,080
me and Josh were singing some
Song Bob Dylan Song to you,

616
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,020
which you really didn't like
or you are making fun of.

617
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,170
But Bob Dylan is like one of my favorites
of all time. I love Bob doing okay.

618
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,290
But like you were like joking around
my changing the lyrics and stuff.

619
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,590
I was just being an asshole.
I with media,

620
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,980
if we do that all the time that you made
me laugh so much and then I played you

621
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,380
in Indian classical piece,
but maybe you don't remember that.

622
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,290
But what I remember you played
me that Blues Song. Yeah.

623
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,510
That was blind Willie Johnson. Yes.
Also one of my faves. Yes. Okay. Yeah,

624
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,090
that I remember. Yeah. I love old
blues. Like it's so raw and real. Right.

625
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,730
And I also like, like as if you,
you'll notice like on my album,

626
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,840
like I switch in and out of
like time signatures a lot and,

627
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,220
but it doesn't sound like I'm
switching time secrets. She has.

628
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,740
At least that's what I do tell
them the things that I, yeah,

629
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,790
I didn't really notice it, but that's
what I'm saying. Like, because I kind of,

630
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,280
I let the music,
um,

631
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,800
like the melody or the story guide the
time as opposed to like the other way

632
00:35:58,801 --> 00:35:59,101
around.

633
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:04,020
Like sometimes people will write the
music first and then that lay the melody

634
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:06,240
and stuff on top. Oh, I saw
an interview with somebody,

635
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,070
so they'd said every time
I come home with a riff,

636
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,280
it's in a weird time signature
and then the drummer fixes it.

637
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,300
And I remember thinking like,
this should've fucking kept
it. Right. Getting that,

638
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,120
yeah, but like fuck do I know. But
I'm just saying that's, that's what I,

639
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,960
that's what I would think. Yeah. Like
I was joking around like with, uh,

640
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,600
with Bob Weir because like basically he,
he played with Lightening Hopkins.

641
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,000
Bob, we're here shooting
grateful dead right now.

642
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,110
He played with Lightening Hopkins is
one of my favorite like blues players.

643
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,290
And um, and when he started,
like those guys were all
like in their forties, right?

644
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,510
Yeah.
And lose guys on me.

645
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,620
And he was joking around like saying that
like lightening played like the 12 and

646
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:46,260
a half bar blues because you know,

647
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,500
if he has to add a beat
to finish the story,

648
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,090
he's telling me he's going to add a beat.

649
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,740
Like it's not about like just
this rigid thing and like I was,

650
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,540
I've been composing like that too.

651
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,500
Like if the melody wants to go on
a few beats longer or you know,

652
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,360
then make it a buyer or seven like,

653
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,720
and it will feel natural
if it goes with the melody.

654
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,050
But if you try to fit a melody over the
top of the time signature than sometimes

655
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:13,830
it can feel a little bit more, um,
choppy. Yeah, I get that. Yeah,

656
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,500
because then it's the
cause to the lay person.

657
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,330
They're not listening what time it's in.
No,

658
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,310
they're just following
the melody and the story.

659
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,980
And it's the same with like
all that old folk music too.

660
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:26,760
Like you listen to some of the old folk
like you hear like bars of five and

661
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:30,120
seven cause it just adding
beats to like finish the phrase.

662
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,020
I know I never noticed and that's
sometimes why like you know,

663
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,780
there won't be drums on it.
Like if there was drums it,

664
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,700
it probably would sound kind of strange,

665
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,070
but it's just like an
acoustic guitar and a voice.

666
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,010
Like that song I played for you,
that Bob Dylan Song it's called,

667
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,510
it's all right mom.
And any bleeding,

668
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,480
like there's some bars have
like five and shit in that.

669
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,840
He just like add some
beets and as you were,

670
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,890
you wouldn't know it if you counted it.

671
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,080
It's odd because he's just trying to fit
the lyric in. Ah, yeah. It's, it's genius.

672
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:02,490
I love it. How, how, oh,
you're so talented in that
area. Like when, when did,

673
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,950
when did you notice that shit?
Like I would just be like,

674
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:08,130
I'm just psyched if I listen to a song,
I know all the words. I wouldn't be like,

675
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:09,510
oh that was just in seven

676
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,590
when I first moved to America
and I was playing guitar.

677
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,330
I, and I was like starting to play like
six hours a day and I like gave myself a

678
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,690
tendonitis and I had to stop playing
for a minute. And then I started like,

679
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,400
like messing around like with drums with
one hand or like base with one hand.

680
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,900
And people started coming up to me being
like, yeah, mini Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.

681
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,920
And I'm like, what the fuck is mini
Vinney you know, of any color Uda. Uh,

682
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,830
okay. So I went and like
listened to Vinnie Khalida,

683
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,300
this is me at I guess like 17 now and uh,

684
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,700
and everyone was passing around tapes of,

685
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,440
of Vinny color you'd like or like
the stuff with charisma and um,

686
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,440
just a bunch of other stuff.
And uh,

687
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,440
and actually Vinnie was then one
of the first people I met when,

688
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,760
when I moved to America because he came
to my school and I'd been playing for

689
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,620
two and a half months at the
time. And like one of the, the,

690
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,000
these drum clinicians was
friends with him. Wait a minute,

691
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:13,840
you don't even play in two and a half
months if somebody told you to move to no

692
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:18,630
base space. Cause I'd been playing
guitar for a couple of years. Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,230
And what was that like? And he was like,
oh we should play some time. I said yeah.

694
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:27,490
And I was so shy like, because I listened
to all this stuff and obviously his,

695
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,630
he's one of the best in the world and I
was, but I kept it in my head. I'm like,

696
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:34,780
okay, okay. But then I moved
to New York and I was like,

697
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,730
I just want to be a jazz musician.

698
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,060
I want to like play in clubs
like five times a night.

699
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,270
And like Charlie Parker and
monk and all the guys did.

700
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,490
And I did that for a few years
and then that's when like I,

701
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,400
I played with the Allman brothers and
like made a record and played with the

702
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,440
almond brothers. That was my first Gig
when I was a teenager. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah.

703
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,820
Like that's where it all started.

704
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,490
And then I came back to La
and I like played Vinnie,

705
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:05,470
this stuff with the Allman brothers
and my, um, my solo project. And, uh,

706
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,720
and then the weeks later he got the
call from Jeff Beck that like, Oh,

707
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,790
hit Jeff Beck's management that they
needed a bass player. And then he,

708
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,810
he told them about me and then they called
me and they asked me to send in tapes,

709
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,620
I sending the tapes and the next thing
I knew I was flying to England to

710
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:25,380
audition for Jeff. So, and then everything
like, you know, prince and her whole, you,

711
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,140
um, I think I was 21 when I started
playing with Jeff. Yeah, he's as correct.

712
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,780
That's the first time I saw
you live at Ronnie Scott's,

713
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,830
which I've still never been in there the
couple of times I've gone to London I

714
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,760
received, it's always like
packed. I'm like, Oh fuck,

715
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,900
I want to go in there and just,
yeah,

716
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:44,560
I have a drink and actually listen to
some music for like two sites the first

717
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:49,480
time I saw you. So were you nervous when
you went into the audition? Um, well,

718
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:53,140
I was food poisoned.
I just got enough a plane,

719
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:57,310
like where me and Vinnie went to the
airport and I ate some barbecue chicken

720
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:01,600
pizza and I got on the plane and Vinny
is a grieving on about politics because

721
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:05,950
he's obsessed with politics and I'm like,
hey Vinny, I'm feeling kind of sick.

722
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,680
And uh, he's like, yeah, yeah. Um, so
then this happened and that he, you know,

723
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,530
I mean he kind of reminds me of you and
you're writing me and him. He was from,

724
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:19,630
uh, he's from like Pennsylvania. Oh, is
he? Yeah. Oh No. Yeah, Pittsburgh. Oh,

725
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,270
he's from Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
guy. Oh, he went to Berkeley.

726
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,600
That's why I knew there was some sort
of Massachusetts from there. Yeah.

727
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,400
But anyway,
he's going on about politics.

728
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,820
And then meanwhile I just like throw
up in a bag and I'm like, there it is.

729
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,000
He's like that. What is, I'm
like, I'll see you in 10.
And I was so sick that like,

730
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:39,320
then I had to let get rushed
to the hospital and we
landed and like be on a drip.

731
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,020
And then the next day
I auditioned for Jeff.

732
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,980
And so I was feeling really weird but um,

733
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,570
talk about the worst fucking place
to get food poisoning. Oh my God.

734
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,140
But the audition went well because at
that point I was so like woozy that I was

735
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,460
just like, okay, let's
get through this. Yeah.

736
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,680
And then that was the point where like
Jeff pointed to me and said Solo on,

737
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,300
cause we've ended as lovers and like
he ended up loving that so much that he

738
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,600
like kept it in the set and that's how
he was like featuring me every night.

739
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,050
Oh Wow.
Like

740
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:16,050
a cool of him totally sharing who he
is and all of that stuff too to like,

741
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,450
uh, I love, um, when
people do stuff like that,

742
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:24,100
there's a lot of comedians that I,
you know, um, that I'm a fan of.

743
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:25,870
But what really makes me,
you know,

744
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,400
over the top is when I see them
like encouraging and helping out,

745
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,930
you know, pick comics that are coming up.
Cause I, I hate that fucking thing of, uh,

746
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,400
you know, that behavior people
will get to a certain level,

747
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:42,790
then they start treating, you know, I
don't know, I'm here and you're there.

748
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:46,240
It's all stupid. It's just like, it's,
you know, you're great like that.

749
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:49,780
Like the way that you kind of mentor
younger comedians by, I mean I,

750
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,550
I try not to be in it.
I mean I remember most people were nice,

751
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,690
but I definitely remember who the people
who weren't necessarily the names,

752
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:01,800
but I just remember how that may be feel.
So it's,

753
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,240
it's sort of the same thing too,
um,

754
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,240
with being like a parent and stuff.

755
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,570
I remember the good days at
school and I remember the bad day,

756
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:14,080
so I'm about how much fun it was
playing with the other kids at school.

757
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,170
And then I also remember
how bad it was if, you know,

758
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,570
you wore the wrong shirt
or whatever and it's just,

759
00:43:19,571 --> 00:43:22,480
it was just your day to take the
pounding and just like how you could just

760
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:24,670
literally beginning that was
literally like your world.

761
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,210
And that's something that I'm hoping
I'm going to be able to remember. Um,

762
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,050
which I think I will as, as Mike, my
kids going through school as far as, uh,

763
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,620
knowing that though, I
mean those days, I mean,

764
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:38,570
who the hell knows with all the fucking
cameras out there, I don't even get it.

765
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,290
If anything, my buddy was just telling
me, you know, some key told this story.

766
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,210
There was some kid everybody
picked on that day.

767
00:43:46,211 --> 00:43:47,710
And then the kids who picked on him,

768
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,140
they found out who all of them were
and they had to go see the fucking

769
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,130
psychologists and shit. And I was really
thinking about that. It's just like, wow,

770
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,310
man. Like nobody, like there
was none of that at all.

771
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,290
Like the guidance counselor was just some
Weirdo down the hall and he would just,

772
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,550
he just would talk to,

773
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,290
he would only really talk to kids who
had no hope of going to college. Right.

774
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,220
And he'd just be down. They're like,
well, hey man, you know, like maybe a,

775
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:16,570
you get into construction, you know. I
mean, I never even talked to him. I just,

776
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,900
I don't know what he talked to them
about maybe their home lives and shit.

777
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:23,890
Maybe it was like a therapy thing,
but like, only the fucked up kids,

778
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,030
God guidance. Right. Always
weird. Everybody else was
just like, all right, you're,

779
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,830
you're following the cattle right
over the fucking cliff. Go to school,

780
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:35,640
two years of language, get
into college, pick a major,

781
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,300
decide what the fuck you want
to do at 18. And then it, yeah,

782
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,680
it was one of those things.
And um,

783
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,210
I remember when I was 15,
um,

784
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,670
there was like this like woman that came
to the school that was supposedly like

785
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:51,671
a career counselor and she came up with
this huge book that looked like yellow

786
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:57,290
pages or something, right? And everyone
had to have an appointment and,

787
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,800
and you'd go in and she'd be like,
okay, so now what do you want to do?

788
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,780
And like someone to be like,
I want to be a dock guy,

789
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,410
open up the book. And she'd looked under
doctor. And so I walked in, she's like,

790
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:13,310
so what do you want to do? I'm like, that
wouldn't be a musician. And she's like,

791
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,270
sorry, there's no musician here.
What else would you like to do?

792
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,860
I just walked out. Oh, you walked
out. What did she do? I don't know.

793
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,940
That was it. I would have been, yeah, I
want to have like an epiphany being like,

794
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:26,810
wow,
I made,

795
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:29,510
how many of these fucking kids wanted
to do something that's not in this book?

796
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,520
Right? Yeah. But then
you have to look at her.

797
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,860
It's just like there's no way
that was her dream in life.

798
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:38,120
To have a yellow book and talk to people
half your age. What do you want to do?

799
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,440
I want to be a zookeeper. All right,
let's get to disease. All right.

800
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,420
Do you have any khaki shorts?

801
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,910
So you literally have somebody didn't
follow a dream talking you out of yours

802
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,820
and you had the strength to fucking
walk away from that. That's very,

803
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:58,250
very commendable. So
that's the, those are the

804
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,320
moments in life there to haunt me that
I think back into my life when somebody

805
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:06,340
said something negative
and thank God, you know, I,

806
00:46:06,341 --> 00:46:10,160
I didn't latch onto a totally and
somebody else like, cause I have like,

807
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,290
I have like this like three Mike
moments in my life, you know,

808
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,740
like climbing up a fucking cliff that if
I went to go this way I would have fell

809
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:25,850
back down and, and just the luck of it
sometimes when I think of it like, God,

810
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:30,510
what if I didn't meet this person?
You know, and why reading my,

811
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,800
I worked with this guy in a warehouse and
I finally found somebody that was into

812
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:38,210
comedy the way I was and he
understood that you could become it.

813
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,000
You know what I mean? Like
he was going like, dude,

814
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,620
these guys on TV and not funny man,

815
00:46:42,621 --> 00:46:45,650
one of these days I'm going to take a
shot of Jack Daniels and just go on stage

816
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:49,100
and do it. And all of a sudden
like, cause it just, you know,

817
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,590
it was on TV that was
like a million miles away.

818
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:53,970
There was no fucking internet or anything.
And uh,

819
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,460
we had nobody had video cameras, nothing.
So it just seemed impossible to me.

820
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,340
It was so impossible. It didn't
even seem impossible. Didn't even,

821
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:02,840
I didn't even enter my brain and be like,

822
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:05,810
fucking going to the moon and all of
a sudden he was just next to me going,

823
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:09,080
I'm going to fucking do it. And I
was just thinking like, well shit,

824
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:11,060
if he can try it, I'm
going to try it. So, uh,

825
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,290
if I don't run into him and if he doesn't
have the balls to say I'm going to try

826
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:15,411
it,

827
00:47:15,411 --> 00:47:20,411
then I'm just fucking hanging out with
other knuckleheads like me drinking,

828
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:24,480
then then all of a sudden I'm 30 and
where the fuck am I? You know? So, yeah.

829
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,810
Do you believe like in like a destiny,

830
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,340
like do you believe that if
that wouldn't have happened,

831
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,220
someone else would have
happened or do you believe

832
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,930
like, I don't believe in destiny
because of tragedy, right?

833
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,060
I don't think that anybody's
destiny is there. The, Hey,

834
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,380
thank God you're not this person. I
just think you get lucky. You get lucky.

835
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,080
It's like a half court shot,

836
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,220
I would say in a lot of ways.
Well maybe it's not that it's,

837
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,860
it's don't you think it's like
partly luck and partly manifestation.

838
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,870
Like if you really want something,

839
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:58,750
you're going to create the
path forward and it can,

840
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,820
and it can go in many directions.
Yeah. But I also feel like,

841
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,860
and there's also tragedy,
which is unavoidable and, um,

842
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:12,670
unpredictable, the tragedy of where
you're born, right? What you'll look like,

843
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:15,220
what race you are,
we're part of the world you're in.

844
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:20,140
Like how lucky I was to be a white guy
born in USA, you know what I mean? And it,

845
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,720
and how lucky I was to be born
outside of Boston had this crazy,

846
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:26,770
insane seeing this like a lot of like,

847
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,360
you know, hurdles that were like
this big. And even then, even then,

848
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,920
because of all the bullshit,
uh,

849
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,250
that even just,
even if you get that much of a head start,

850
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:43,660
all of this other shit that can
emotionally fuck you up can,

851
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,510
um, you know, I mean, I think
by the time I was like nine, uh,

852
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:53,800
I, I, I had already just sort
of like, I had that. Yeah,

853
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,380
I don't give a fuck. I don't
give a fuck. I don't, yeah,

854
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,400
I just didn't give a shit like, but,
and, but I did, you know what I mean?

855
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:04,330
And then that's all your work to get
back to that person who did care and did

856
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,120
want stuff. You just, as a defense
mechanism, you just like, yeah,

857
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:09,950
I don't give a fuck. Oh, really?
Is that going to happen? No.

858
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,340
And then when that's supposed to,
what make me cry. Fuck you. Like I,

859
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:17,440
I became that person, which is, uh, it's,

860
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,550
it works is far as to
get through that shit.

861
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:25,450
But as far as getting anything
you fucking want in life,

862
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:29,230
we have to be open and warm and
attract stuff to you that you want.

863
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,650
And you're over there with you. Oh yeah.
I don't give a fuck. Fuck you really,

864
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,540
400 pounds on my chest. Put 500. I don't
give a fuck doing that dumb guy. Shit.

865
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,540
Um, yeah, there's like, yeah,
it's just, yeah, that's the,

866
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:46,690
that's the thing when you're sitting
there and it fucking Boston garden going,

867
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,220
how to fuck if I didn't meet this guy,
if that guy didn't say that,

868
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,250
if I went out that night and went
with those people and did that,

869
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,170
he just think of all of that fucking what
if shit and this somebody who went out

870
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:02,050
that night and went with those people and
then they fucking sitting in a cubicle

871
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:05,170
or a jail cell or in a fucking
loveless marriage or something.

872
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,130
And then just like,

873
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,580
why the F that that's somebody's
destiny to be in a loveless marriage.

874
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,230
It's like I just, I don't, um, yeah, and
commas and other one I don't buy into,

875
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,160
I think calmer works if you, if you,
if you believe in it, but what do you,

876
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,940
how do you define Karma? That
basically, if you're a good person,

877
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:23,900
good things happen to you.
But if you're a bad person,

878
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,560
that's not what comment is though.
But in my world it is.

879
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,340
But comment like if you like comma
simply means cause and effect.

880
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,170
So, okay, well if you do good things
then no, it's not a bad, good or bad.

881
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,020
It's just you feel like I'm
in school again. No, no, no,
but you do it. You do it.

882
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,720
Can you just give me the F and
I'll go to summer school? This f

883
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:49,090
not like you, you, you, you do an
action and it causes a result. Right?

884
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:53,120
It's as simple as that.
That's all Karma means.

885
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,150
That's like being a satanist.

886
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:59,090
People thinks that you believe in the
devil and people were just like, ah,

887
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,340
satanism or whatever. They don't even
believe in a heaven or hell or devil.

888
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,590
It's just they just living for
themselves and everybody said, oh,

889
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:08,510
they render the devil.
So I always thought Karma was like,

890
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:11,500
if you're a fucking nurse or
the bed should help us here.

891
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,500
And then in my business,

892
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,700
I'd watch these fucking people stealing
and doing all this shit and just look at

893
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:20,030
them and be like, well,
you know, good. You know,

894
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,460
nothing's bad's happened to them
and I've done a bunch of bad shit.

895
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:24,830
And like overall my life
is good. But I, you know,

896
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:29,300
I've heard a lot of people and shit
so and so what is it that it just,

897
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,190
it just simply means that you do
an action and it creates a result.

898
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,230
So all these people are using
that term incorrectly. Yes.

899
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,830
I just put it in a script incorrectly.
Well,

900
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:44,830
episode eight F F is for family.
Well,

901
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,320
it's correct in that because like a lot
of people think that that's what it,

902
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,640
what it is. But like when you go
to the root of what comment is,

903
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:56,060
it just simply means like you do an
action and it's cause and effect.

904
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,030
I saw somebody, uh, somebody
I follow on Instagram,

905
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,600
they had a picture of a boomerang
and it said Karma on it.

906
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,680
So that's actually wrong.
Oh my God,

907
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:09,680
I wish I knew the real definition than I
could have been that pompous ass on the

908
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,750
Internet feeding like
actually none of you guys.

909
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,890
That's like one time I saw this guy
talking about how he didn't have white

910
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:19,880
privilege and his idea that he didn't
have white privileges because he wasn't

911
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:23,660
born rich and he had to work
for the things that he had.

912
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,160
So his idea is that white privileges
means you're born on a yacht and all of

913
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,170
this fucking shit. It's like,
no, that's not what that means.

914
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,220
That means that no point where you with
because of your seat and just get pulled

915
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:38,600
over for being white, get the shit
kicked out of you, you know, and all,

916
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:41,240
all of these other things that would
have happened to you. You just,

917
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,960
you basically because you had to work for
things. You feel you're not privileged.

918
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,560
So literally his
definition was privileged.

919
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,930
It was,
I can't give you any more details of it,

920
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:58,790
I'll tell you afterwards because it's,
I mean, how do you deal with like, um,

921
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,760
Internet trolley type people?
Like,

922
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,080
have you ever struggled with that or
wanted to interact with people like that?

923
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:09,650
Early on I did, but now I just, it
has nothing to do with me. Yeah. Yeah.

924
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,410
It has nothing to do.

925
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,430
The amount of shit that I hate that
really just has to do with me and my day

926
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,970
that I do. And other people do that
too. I don't think, um, you know,

927
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:21,020
any different than they
are. But like, um, yeah,

928
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,040
I don't give a fuck.

929
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,370
I don't even have to be a specific thing
that I did and I thought it was bad too.

930
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,900
And then everybody said you shouldn't have
done that, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like,

931
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:33,720
I dunno. I Dunno what I, but if it's
just like a, you know, you know,

932
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:36,750
so much of whatever you post
isn't about what you posted.

933
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,740
It's about what's in the background so
you to be, so you could do some gravy.

934
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:41,850
Oh my God,
that's fucking great.

935
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:46,260
But what's up with that fucking picture
on the wall? Yeah. Laughing my ass off.

936
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,660
Like that's like what I
learned after a while.

937
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,900
It's like that's their moment
right on the thread, right?

938
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:54,810
Like I'm going to be the guy that
notices the thing that starts and then

939
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,330
everybody's talking about
what I wanted to talk about.

940
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,590
And then it's this weird thing
where you feel good, but like I, I,

941
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,340
I do the same thing if I send out a
tweet and it gets a bunch of retweets and

942
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,470
likes, I'm like, all right,
people thought that was funny.

943
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,390
So I'm just on the other end of it.

944
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:14,070
So I just learned like I can't get upset
that somebody is noticing something in

945
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:16,680
this and now they're doing their little
show. Like who the fuck am I? It's like,

946
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,530
you don't want someone to do that.
Don't post something on there.

947
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,180
And I just look at like,
listen,

948
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:24,180
you don't want people saying
a bunch of bad shit about,

949
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,650
you don't put your face on the Internet.

950
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,150
It's like you're literally asking for it.

951
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:30,630
You're sticking your chin out and they're
winding up and punching you and then

952
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:35,130
you're acting like a victim. It's
like, well you fucking don't post shit.

953
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,180
Just sit there like this or you know,
post it.

954
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,800
Take a few shots and uh,

955
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,091
continue on.

956
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:46,620
I guess as a musician like I'm a
little firstly like as an instrumental

957
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:47,454
musician,

958
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,080
there's nothing anybody can
say about like what I'm saying,

959
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:55,560
I'm not expressing an opinion,
I'm just playing notes. Right.

960
00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:00,830
But then now I've just put out an album
of songs with lyrics and there's only

961
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:02,490
been out there for right know.

962
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:05,580
What I'm saying is that in
the context of the song,

963
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,230
and I'm very much expressing like stories
that are personal but like to go out

964
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:13,710
there as a comedian and like
express really strong opinions.

965
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,910
Like I can't imagine like the difference
in like the kind of feedback that you

966
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:18,744
get.
And

967
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,800
I guess I'm curious what people do is
you have to understand that what they do

968
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:24,870
is they don't,
like I've always said,

969
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,350
he's like you can do 80 jokes in a row
and someone will sit there laughing and

970
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:31,980
enjoying your set and then the 81st
one has to do something about them.

971
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:34,060
If it's a fat joke in their fat,
right.

972
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,010
If it's about women and they are a woman
or it's about this state and there from

973
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:40,740
there and then all of a sudden, yeah,
it's funny you say that, then they go,

974
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:45,720
that statement you made about fucking
Arkansas and it's just like, no,

975
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,290
no, no. They were all so they all,
all jokes except for the one. Right.

976
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:54,070
You know what I mean? So this, this, this,
that, um, you know, there's just that,

977
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:55,000
that thing,
I just,

978
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,530
I don't pay it any mind and um,

979
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,890
yeah,

980
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,840
yeah. If there was ever any sort of
big dust up about something, I said,

981
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:08,720
if I actually looked at it and thought
I said something wrong, I'd be like,

982
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,400
all right, well maybe I'll phrase
it a different way. But like, I,

983
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,110
I do think it's absolutely ridiculous
that people get offended about a joke that

984
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,790
was told at a show that they weren't at

985
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,320
and how has it taken so out of context
and no, you want it to show. Yeah.

986
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,640
And you chose to click that thing
and the tears. And another thing too,

987
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:27,490
if the comedian didn't film it and posted,
yeah.

988
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,720
If just some fucking asshole in the
crowd, they'd get mad at them. Yeah.

989
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,541
And it's just like,
well,

990
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:35,350
what the fuck are you doing if you're
this easily offended about standup comedy,

991
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,030
what are you doing watching,
watching standup comedy?
The whole thing is, so like,

992
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,860
I just saw,
I think it was in Australia,

993
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:46,861
like the first mammal went extinct due
to human global warming and barely,

994
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,930
barely a word about it. But like all
of this shit, uh, you know, fucking,

995
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,550
you know, it's more difficult to
be a comedian if you're a woman.

996
00:56:57,551 --> 00:57:00,430
A fucking me too.
Uh,

997
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:04,660
it's all about us and what we're going
through and Llama, Llama, blonde,

998
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:06,220
all of this shit.
And just meanwhile,

999
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,600
all of that pales in
comparison to, you know, if,

1000
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,580
if this fucking places in here,

1001
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,490
you're not going to have to
worry about any of that. Right.

1002
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,710
That's why I think that the cell
phones a super destructive, like,

1003
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:22,030
because they are making everything
about me, me, me, look what I'm doing,

1004
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,090
look like where I am, look
what I'm eating. And so, and,

1005
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,010
and were on it constantly. And it's
like, well, the Jesse Kristala you fall.

1006
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,970
Did you see his thing that he did
the, the unfollowing? No. Oh my God.

1007
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,550
It's one of my favorite things ever.
He's talking about,

1008
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:41,740
it's just making fun of Instagram models.
Uh,

1009
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,330
I mean I can do it.

1010
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:46,000
I don't feel like I'm doing
this joke because he put it
out there. He goes, look,

1011
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:49,750
he goes, if you're on Instagram,
it goes in your posts and stuff.

1012
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,800
You've just taken a picture of your
booty and your titties. He goes,

1013
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:56,060
make no mistake.
You Hook in.

1014
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,350
And he just starts calling them
hookers and then, you know,

1015
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,330
and then he just starts
really like something.

1016
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,880
Some of these people I didn't even know
fucking exist that I guess this thing

1017
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,000
that pretty girl still with a bite into
a sandwich and they kind of look up like

1018
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:11,920
that saying like, yeah, that I'm going to
start this thing called the unfollowing.

1019
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,670
And what I love about it is,

1020
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:18,340
first of all I'm seeing him turning
the corner as a comedian because he was

1021
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:22,720
always just, he just had that this guy is
a club like a fucking closer, you know,

1022
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,240
and now he's getting,

1023
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:30,241
he's like fine in his like like this razor
because he was always kind of fun and

1024
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:34,060
energetic and stuff and,
but now it's, it's like,

1025
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:38,740
it's like it's becoming this, you seeing
this force going in this direction.

1026
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:43,000
Like I was fucking cry and laugh for
like I'm not afraid to do things along

1027
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:46,810
those lines make me laugh and it's just
really fucking was making me laugh.

1028
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,200
But the funniest thing about that is that
would really bother somebody like that

1029
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,110
where like cause cause they're living,

1030
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,320
not that I would want to hurt those
people cause it's very easy to hate

1031
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:02,060
beautiful people. You know
what I mean? It's just, it's,

1032
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,020
they're very hateable as you're staring
at them because you hate yourself.

1033
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:09,910
Like why am I this fucking of just with
like this beauty in all of this stuff.

1034
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:11,470
Like, like look at that. You've got like,

1035
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,180
I got to fucking do nine hours of fucking
specials to get half as many followers

1036
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:19,630
as you do because you were a fucking
half shirt, you know? So I just,

1037
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,920
there was just something
funny to just finally see a,

1038
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,590
a movement to make their numbers go down.
I don't know.

1039
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,030
The more I'm saying this out loud,

1040
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm actually realizing that it's kind
of says more about me than about those

1041
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,570
people that take those pictures. But I
don't know. I just thought it was at,

1042
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,190
that shit is funny. So I'm actually
watching that girl at the gas station.

1043
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:44,750
I'm going to try to take, uh, like this
morning I didn't have my phone, you know,

1044
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:45,950
when I spent the entire,

1045
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,320
like two and a half hours I have
with my daughter this morning,

1046
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,730
chased her around, we play with
the puzzles, I read the books. Uh,

1047
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,490
what else did we do?
Was teaching how to play catch and uh,

1048
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,870
I think she's going to throw at the
left hand, which would be really cool,

1049
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,800
although she's really big.

1050
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,980
But the Darryl Dawkins over the
top sort of two handed slam.

1051
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:06,470
I know you're not going to
know that reference he played
for the 76 years before

1052
01:00:06,471 --> 01:00:08,210
you were born.
Um,

1053
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,200
so I'm trying to get her not to,
uh,

1054
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,380
be into stuff like that.
But the weird thing is,

1055
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,230
is because they're so hyper with their
energy and all you want to do is just

1056
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:19,064
hold them and hug them.

1057
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:23,640
The best way to do that is if you put
on their favorite cartoon and then they

1058
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,640
stay just totally snuggle up next to you,

1059
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:29,770
but then there's no interaction other
than the physical because then you just

1060
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,830
literally say like, Hey, hey, hey,
hey, give me a kiss. Give me kiss.

1061
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:37,550
And they'll go like, we'll just sort of
lean into you and not even look at you.

1062
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,170
Just give you the chicken. They just
sorta lasered into that. And I'm like, uh,

1063
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,460
I dunno. I Dunno. I watched a lot of TV.

1064
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,630
I did all right in life.

1065
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:51,490
The fuck are you going to do
so and allowed to watch TV and,

1066
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,250
and look at you look fucking talented.
You are. And I'm up there just screaming,

1067
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:59,680
yelling like a lunatic. Um, where can
people get this album? Um, anyway. Yeah,

1068
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:04,550
listen to music. Um, can they
download it on iTunes? Yeah. Spotify.

1069
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:13,670
I don't think it's true to things going
to be said on this podcast than that.

1070
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:13,911
Yeah,

1071
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:18,230
I can't because my fucking computers
filled up and I forget my password all the

1072
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:20,540
time.
Well I just want to uh,

1073
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,070
congratulate you because I know you worked
so hard on this. It just assembling,

1074
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,510
abandon,
all of that type of stuff.

1075
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:28,490
Like there's so much more work
to this where I just like,

1076
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:29,630
I need an order to new hour.

1077
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,990
I don't have to find a Mike
stand guy and all of this shit.

1078
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:35,510
I just have to go out and
just go do it. But um, uh,

1079
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,740
whatever you did the three songs that
I listened to, I mean it is just,

1080
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,270
it's on such a high level
creativity and everything.

1081
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,320
Um, I'm, I'm really happy for you and uh,

1082
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,930
everybody watching listening cause there
was going to be some clips of this on

1083
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:55,880
video. Please download and it is
called love Romaine. Love remains.

1084
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,840
All right. Thank you for coming
on. I was going to ask you, um,

1085
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:05,050
how do you stop doing ums and uhs
and you knows and shit like that?

1086
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,770
How do I, yeah. No, I don't, I do
it all the time. All the time. Why?

1087
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,910
Because I get something that will
cause you do it. I do it so much. Oh,

1088
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:16,030
I do it to how you do and you're in care.
Not,

1089
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,880
I didn't know if I don't give
a fuck. He, you listen to a

1090
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,420
Keith Richards Jagger, people can't
understand him. He doesn't give a shit.

1091
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,670
But like what about when
you're doing material?

1092
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,320
I guess because you've written the
material that's going to be less of that

1093
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,450
because you know what you're about to say,

1094
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,130
as opposed to if you're
just doing a podcast.

1095
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,790
If I was to actually try to
work on something like that,
then I would be up here,

1096
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,130
which is not where I want to
write. Yeah. I want to be,

1097
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:44,070
it's just calming down the rain spout
and out my fucking considered technique

1098
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:49,080
for a comedian to like at some
point work on that. Yes, it would.

1099
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,240
Whereas like with like, um,
I learned, I started, uh,

1100
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,650
taken from lessons from Dee de
village. Um, how many, like,

1101
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:01,110
how much,
you know,

1102
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,920
of the way I was playing was getting in
the way of me getting to where I wanted

1103
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:10,380
to be with whatever,
because my, my technique,

1104
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:13,950
I was like sitting like this and I was
grabbing the sticks like that was getting

1105
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:16,130
blisters and,
and uh,

1106
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,230
like I wasn't making gravity at anything
that had to do with physics work for

1107
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:21,810
me.

1108
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,700
So I was literally fighting the drum
kit and then he taught me all of this

1109
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:30,120
stuff. I haven't seen him in a couple of
months and I'm going back to my bad old

1110
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:33,480
habits. But, um, there is that thing,

1111
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,320
I think that like a while we'll say
with like a musician, it's like,

1112
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:39,420
I don't want to learn how to read,
man. I just want to, you know,

1113
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:43,200
I just want to fucking be this, you
know, free fucking thing. Right.

1114
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,790
And just there is merit in that because
you do have those people who only can

1115
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,560
play if there's sheet
music in front of him.

1116
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,280
But if you can somehow marry both of those
where you actually have technique but

1117
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,900
you can still play from
here and not be up there.

1118
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,500
I think that that's like the promise
land and I always kind of felt is a

1119
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:04,201
comedian,

1120
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:09,201
if you could somehow combine Richard Pryor
that specially did live in concert on

1121
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:14,040
long beach, if you could
combine that with George Carlin,

1122
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,190
um, where his stuff was
just like, I feel like he,

1123
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:22,830
he knew every fucking word that he
was going to say and it was like,

1124
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:28,710
yes, like pop up, up, up, up, up, up.
The whole time where prior, you know,

1125
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:32,130
on that special came walking out,
it was like a hell Gig.

1126
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:36,480
There was people walking around and
shit and he just started making fun of

1127
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:41,070
people. And I think the way
he was wired that helped him,

1128
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,120
that helped him better than if everyone
was just sitting there staring at him

1129
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,570
like, okay, begin your,
your standup special.

1130
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,800
I think that he came out and
sit your ass down, you know,

1131
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:54,390
sit your fucking ugliest.
I what?

1132
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,330
All that stuff that he was saying and
everyone was just walking around and he's

1133
01:04:57,331 --> 01:05:01,890
riffing and then he just
just got in a zone. And

1134
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,850
what's amazing, you know,
is if he can to his own,

1135
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:09,690
usually that lasts for like six minutes
because what happens up to six minutes

1136
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:13,140
of that is you're like,
you start worrying going,

1137
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:15,780
well what happens when this ends
and I have to go into my act,

1138
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,990
I'm going to be fucked.
And you,

1139
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,480
you can't think that because it's
almost like when you haven't tried like

1140
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:24,400
meditating. Yeah. So you know,

1141
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:27,100
like when you start to feel like you're
floating and like leaving your body,

1142
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,170
if you start thinking,
oh my God, this is great,

1143
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,570
I'm leaving and then you'll
just go right back down.

1144
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:35,620
So that's the same way with like,
like catching his own.

1145
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:39,370
So like what I've learned a little,
I know about technique with like drums,

1146
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,550
he should just practice
a little bit every day.

1147
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:46,720
And then when it starts to become this
thing, you don't have to think about,

1148
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:51,340
then all those skills you learned about
sort of leaving your body and just like,

1149
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:53,920
just like, I mean your
body's there, but you're,

1150
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:57,400
you're listening to what you're playing
that's making you do that next thing.

1151
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,200
If you can exist,

1152
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,410
you can go back there with all this
technique now he not going to get hurt,

1153
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:06,220
you're not going to get tired and
eventually will. But like, um,

1154
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,320
so I think what the comedian, if, if
I was to try to do that, like okay,

1155
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:13,300
maybe I won't curse as much
or something like that.

1156
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:17,530
Like I that would definitely
be a few steps backwards. Um,

1157
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:22,390
by that man, maybe it would
help me. I don't know. I don't,

1158
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:26,860
I honestly don't think,
I don't think. Okay.

1159
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,600
Cause if I go up there
and I start doing that,

1160
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,090
I said it's all about not being
here. Um, I mean I sell them.

1161
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,440
I'm obviously thinking like, okay, I'm
going to, it's more like, okay, you

1162
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,210
like I just walk out,

1163
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:43,780
I just start talking and then this Joe
comes out and then I said this joke,

1164
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:47,050
which made me think, oh yeah, I have
this joke and look at this fucking guy.

1165
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,740
And then it just sorta just, oh now
we're over here and it just, you're just,

1166
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,410
but do you have like a set list of jokes?

1167
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,800
Like you want to do it in this
order or this order? Yeah,

1168
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:01,350
but that is all out the fucking window.
The second I go up there and sell,

1169
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:06,100
some nights it goes like that.
And then other nights I like,

1170
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,020
I definitely have like sections,
but this,

1171
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:12,070
some nights I just go out there and all
of a sudden I tell the last choke first

1172
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,910
and I'm switching everything around. And
then the guy I talked with is this like,

1173
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,430
you know, waiting to go
on stage going like, dude,

1174
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:20,980
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
Or You did,

1175
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:23,860
you close a bit in the middle. I was
like, wait, he's only doing 35 minutes.

1176
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:26,590
And then you went on, you did
like another, you know, whatever,

1177
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,560
another 25 after that or something.
Um,

1178
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:35,140
I have like the main setlist you know,

1179
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:39,580
so that's the, you know, this is
the plan, the general fucking plan.

1180
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,390
And then you go out there and shit
happens. You're in a weird mood.

1181
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:46,690
Somebody says something is you look at
something in the back of the room that

1182
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:50,500
makes you think of something and then
it go, it goes in that direction.

1183
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,090
And um,

1184
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:57,300
and I am a full believer of doing that
because then it doesn't become this grind

1185
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:58,960
cause I used to,
I used to have,

1186
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:02,370
I start with this and then that leads to
this and I have my segways in blah blah

1187
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:06,610
blah blah blah. And it just became
like, you know, it's rigid. Yeah.

1188
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:11,050
And then I would be on stage and my
mouth would be talking and I would find

1189
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:12,670
myself thinking about going like,

1190
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,480
well the second show if the
or lets me not close it out,

1191
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:20,840
I could probably be home by,
and then I was just like, yeah.

1192
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,070
And then I was just like,
wait,

1193
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:26,510
I'm talking right now and people laughing
and I'm thinking about other shit,

1194
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:31,310
what the fuck am I doing right
now? And um, I uh, it's weird.

1195
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:35,990
I learned how to free myself up through
y more through watching musicians.

1196
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,710
I've always equated it to music because
that's something that I sort of started

1197
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:41,480
with.
So I always thought,

1198
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:45,920
I remember talking to a long time ago
late great Patrice O'Neil and I said,

1199
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,050
I was telling him, I was like, you know,

1200
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:51,350
I always wished I could see someone cause
you couldn't gauge how good you were,

1201
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:52,850
you know,

1202
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:56,120
you can't see how good you are or how
might your improving because you're, you,

1203
01:08:56,690 --> 01:09:01,130
you know what I mean? You're
just in there. So I always
said I always wanted this.

1204
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,930
I wish I could just have somebody sit
down and play guitar at the level of comic

1205
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:08,810
that I am right now. It's
like, could they change chords?

1206
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,380
Could they play without looking?
Could they solo?

1207
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,380
Like where am I on that trajectory?

1208
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:19,990
And it's one of the few times he didn't
give me any shit. He was just like, hi.

1209
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,200
He goes,
that's actually interesting.

1210
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,330
Then probably I reacted to that and
then he probably trashed me cause he

1211
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:27,680
actually opened up for half a second.

1212
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:34,190
So yeah. Fascinating. Fascinating.

1213
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:36,020
Nuts and bolts of how
to tell Dick and shit.

1214
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:41,021
Jokes will continue after these messages
from stamps.com and now for bill burrs

1215
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,530
theme song. Oh, I get a
theme song out of this.

1216
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,800
I would've thought it would've
been all like a Ukulele,

1217
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:51,980
some sort of Irish Jig song. Did they
play Ukuleles out there? I don't know.

1218
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,710
You have to play though.
Seriously? I have to play. Yeah.

1219
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,990
Why do I have to play this?
I'm going to sing the theme song.

1220
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,490
Well then you have to tell a joke.

1221
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,690
I have to tell a joke or why
do I have to do my hobby? Oh,

1222
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,890
do you know what I mean?
What am I playing Dan

1223
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,380
to crack? I don't have any earplugs.
My years are fucking junk. Okay,

1224
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:17,090
so play it really softly. Play it
really softly. Is that piano or 14

1225
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,270
hey, can you just, can you just make sure
you do the retard, Huh? The retard. Yeah.

1226
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,200
I learned. How were you going to retard
in the end? All right. You Ready? Yeah.

1227
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:32,050
All right,
Bill.

1228
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,133
Hell,

1229
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,523
Bill Bell,
Bert.

1230
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,630
That's all I get. No, no, no. I was
going to keep, oh, I didn't know. Okay.

1231
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:45,464
You're the one that

1232
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,920
why it sounded so simple.
I didn't pick you and keeps you

1233
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,503
bill.
Bill.

1234
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,110
Let me see. I think it needs more. What
if you went petted the Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

1235
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,990
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Yeah.

1236
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,033
