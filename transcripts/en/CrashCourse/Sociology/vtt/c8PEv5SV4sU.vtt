00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Social Class in America can be hard
to talk about.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.940
And not just because you may find it
awkward to discuss who’s poor and who’s rich,
or who has more power and who has less.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.340
As sociologists, the difficulty for us is in pinning
down exactly what we mean by social class.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.040
There isn’t just one definition of it, and
the definition you use will depend on what
society you’re interested in.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.580
If we go by Marx’s definition, we have two classes:
the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production,
and the proletariat, who do the labor.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000
But this might be too simplistic for our world.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.619
If you own a small store, and you work there,
which category do you belong in?

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.100
Your day-to-day life probably looks more like
that of a retail employee than that of a CEO.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.100
But Marx would put you in the bourgeoisie,
because you own a business and hire workers.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.960
So let’s try another definition, one that’s more
in the tradition of our old friend Max Weber.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.820
His theories were more about what kinds of
opportunities a person’s class gives them.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.400
The owner of a big company has different opportunities
than the owner of a small shop.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.860
But they’ll both have different resources available
to them than someone who manages an office,
or somebody who works at a factory.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.740
So in this case, a social class can be defined
as a group that’s fairly similar in terms of income,
education, power, and prestige in society.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.300
And we can use this definition to better
understand the social classes that make
up society in the United States,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.120
and it can help us to answer some of the
questions they raise.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.780
Like, is there more than one kind of upper
class?

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.220
How can the middle class fit everyone who
thinks they belong in it?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.200
And what does poverty in America really
look like?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.200
Broadly speaking, American society can be
split into five social classes:

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.260
upper class, upper middle class, average
middle class, working class, and lower class

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.540
The upper class consists essentially of the
capitalists in Marx’s system.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.060
This is the top of the income and wealth
distribution – those who earn at least $250,000/year
and control much of the country’s wealth.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.740
And as we learned last week – money talks.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.640
This group tends to wield a lot of political
and social power.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.820
But within the upper class, there are sub
classes that distinguish, by and large, between
old money and new money.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.000
The upper-upper class includes those who derive
their wealth from inheritance rather than work.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.520
People in this class may have jobs, but usually
they take on more honorary positions such as board
members or heading up philanthropic organizations.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.780
But there’s also a large part of the upper
class whose wealth came from work.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.240
Most of those we think of as wealthy – the
Bill Gates, Oprah Winfreys, and Kanye West’s
of the world – fall into this group.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240
After upper class comes the middle class.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.020
Remember awhile back when we talked
about how almost every American thinks that
they’re middle class?

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.260
That’s way too many people to fit into the middle,
which is why sociologists split the mid-range of
the income distribution into three groups.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.400
Upper middle class families typically have
incomes between $115,000 and $250,000 per year
and make up about 15% of income earners.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.510
About 2/3 of the adults here have college
degrees – and many have post-graduate degrees.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.760
It’s almost a given that their kids will
attend college when they grow up.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.380
Adults in this sector tend to have jobs that
are considered prestigious – doctors, lawyers,
engineers, and the like.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.620
Their families typically own homes in good
school districts, and are able to afford luxuries,
like travel and multiple vehicles.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.580
And it may not surprise you to learn that they’re
wealthy, at least compared to most Americans.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.799
This group is likely to have wealth from their
home, strong 401Ks, and financial investments.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.940
Now, families in the so-called average middle
class make between $50,000 and $115,000 and
make up about 35% of income earners.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.760
Keep in mind, the median family income in
the US is $70,700.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.580
So families in this group still tend to own their own
homes, but the mortgages might be more cumbersome.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.100
And they have some wealth, usually tied up in their
home or a modest retirement savings account.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.440
About half of this group is college-educated,
though they’re more likely to have attended
public universities than private schools.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.460
And average middle class jobs are typically
so-called white collar jobs – think office workers,
teachers, middle-managers.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.220
In contrast, most blue-collar workers, or
those whose work is primarily based in manual
labor, fall into the lower-middle class.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.940
About 30 percent of Americans are in this
category, with incomes ranging from about
25 to 50 thousand dollars a year.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.560
Lower middle class families are less likely
to own their own homes and typically hold
little to no wealth.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.260
The most defining feature of this social class
is the type of jobs that are associated with it –

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.100
namely, manual labor, which is why it’s
often referred to as the working class.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.100
Factory work, construction, manufacturing,
maintenance work – all of these jobs generally
fall under working class occupations.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.200
And while some working class jobs require
technical skills, they don’t usually require a
college education.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.540
It’s important to note that working class jobs are
more sensitive to how the economy is doing, because
these jobs tend to be built around making stuff.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.860
When a recession hits, factories need fewer
workers to meet demands.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.640
Or the plant’s owners might decide that
it’s cheaper to use machines rather than
workers to produce their goods.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.140
And just as vulnerable to economic downturns,
if not more so, is the lower class.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.760
Lower class Americans are blue-collar workers
at the bottom of the income distribution.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.760
They make less than $25,000 a year and tend to work hourly jobs that are part-time, with unpredictable schedules and no benefits, like health insurance or pensions.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.360
About 20% of Americans, or the bottom quintile,
fall into this group.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.620
The majority of these families don’t own
their own homes and are more likely to live in
neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.340
lower quality school districts,
and higher crime rates.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.160
In contrast to an upper-middle class family,
whose children are likely to go to college,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.640
only 9% of children born in the bottom income
quartile complete a four-year college degree.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.720
And the lower class also includes many
Americans who are living in poverty.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.220
The US government sets an income
benchmark called the federal poverty level,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.960
a threshold that’s used, in part, to determine
who’s eligible for public assistance programs,
like food stamps or help with health care.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.240
As of 2017, the federal poverty level for
a family of four is $24,600.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.540
And 13.5% of Americans live in households
below that.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:41.300
The government arrives at this figure by estimating
the minimum annual pre-tax income that’s needed to
pay food, shelter, transportation, and clothing costs
for a given household size.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.860
Of course, what’s poor in the United States
won’t be the same as in another country

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.000
– the US federal poverty line is a measure
of relative poverty, based on a standard of
living in the US.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.500
Relative poverty is used to describe a lack
of resources compared to others who have more.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.580
But absolute poverty is a lack of resources
that threatens your ability to survive.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.820
The federal poverty level gives us an indicator
for which Americans have the fewest resources
and lets us examine trends in groups that are the
most economically vulnerable.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.300
For example, groups that can’t work, like
children, the severely disabled, and the frail elderly,
are particularly vulnerable to poverty.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:21.800
But many working Americans are vulnerable to
poverty, too – 12% of working-age adults in poverty
work full-time, and another 29% work part time.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.340
These are the working poor.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.440
You can see how it’s quite possible to work full
time and still live in poverty, when you do the math.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.380
The federal minimum wage in
the United States is $7.25 per hour.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.920
A 40 hour work week for 50 weeks a year
would net an income of $14,500, which is well
below the poverty line for a family of four.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.580
It’s hard enough to pull yourself out of poverty on a
low-wage income, which is partly why more than half
of families in poverty are headed by single mothers.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.080
Higher rates of poverty among women,
known as the feminization of poverty,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.560
is related to the increasing number of
women who are raising children on their
own, and who work low-wage jobs.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.600
But in addition to gender, you can also can
look at poverty by race.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.920
Contrary to popular belief, most poor
Americans are not Black; in fact, two-thirds
of the poor in the US are white.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.680
Black Americans are, however, more likely
to be poor than white Americans:

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.060
24.1% of Black Americans, who make up
about 13% of the total American population,
were living in poverty in 2015.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.960
Compare that to 11.6% of white Americans,
who make up about 77% of the total population.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.030
Now, the causes of poverty are many.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.640
And it’s not easy to understand why some
groups are more vulnerable than others.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.220
America likes to think of itself as a nation that
values self-reliance, where anyone can succeed.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:34.500
And this view is partly why some argue that
poverty is the result of an individual’s own
failings, or of certain cultural attitudes.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.980
One of the most famous proponents of this
idea was Daniel Patrick Moynihan –

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.320
former US senator, ambassador to the
United Nations, and, by trade, a sociologist.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.060
A report he wrote while Secretary of Labor
in the Kennedy administration, known as the
Moynihan report,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.020
blamed high rates of poverty among African
Americans not on a lack of economic opportunity,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.020
but on cultural factors in the Black community,
like high rates of birth outside of marriage.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:03.060
By contrast, American sociologist William Julius
Wilson – who you might remember from episode 7 –
has provided a counter to this idea.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.500
Wilson has documented how Black Americans
are much more likely to face institutional barriers to achieving economic success,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.820
and are more likely to live in areas where
jobs are scarce.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:20.740
He argues that in order to understand poverty, we
have to look at wider economic and social structures,
as well as the history and culture of racism in the U.S.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.460
Next week, we’ll talk more about how social class
structures affects how Americans live their lives.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.080
But for now, you learned about the five
different social classes in the United States:

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.640
the upper class, the upper middle class,
the average middle class, the working class,
and the lower class.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.820
And we discussed what poverty looks
like in the United States.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.920
