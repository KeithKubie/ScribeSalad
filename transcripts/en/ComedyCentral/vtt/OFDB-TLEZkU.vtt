00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.736
Hey, remember how Trump tweeted

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.439
that Obama wiretapped
Trump Tower during the election?

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.441
Well, according
to FBI Director James Comey,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.443
there's no evidence for that!

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.245
In other obvious Internet news,

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.647
you totally cannot add
three inches to your (bleep),

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.718
and even if you could, there are
zero horny MILFs in your area.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.286
(laughter)

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.255
-All right?
-(cheering, applause)

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.927
FBI director and national
spoilsport, James Comey,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.897
testified to congress today
about Trump's claim, saying...

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.099
I have no information
that supports those tweets.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.268
Yes, we're at the point
where the director

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.836
of a federal
law enforcement agency

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.439
has to take time out of his work
to talk about tweets.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.441
-(laughter)
-Do you... I don't re...

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.510
I don't know if I remember
J. Edgar Hoover

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.512
having to deal with Grindr.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.116
All right, bad example.
That is a bad example!

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.885
-(applause)
-It is a bad example.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.321
-Now, comedi... Yes?
-I actually do remember him...

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.024
You do remember him.
Okay, great, you actually do...

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.692
It was a long night.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.460
(Hardwick laughing)

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.297
I'm obviously gay.
What are we talking about?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.733
-No! -â™ª Thank you...
-(cheering)

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.135
-No!
-I know.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.803
What's something else
you could tweet

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:12.339
to prompt that response from
FBI Director James Comey? Dom.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.341
Women marry me
for my giant hands

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.311
and my tolerance of them coming
from <i>any</i> country on the planet.

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:18.612
(laughter)

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.948
I have no information
that supports those tweets.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.851
-(laughter)
-Yes. Gina.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.620
I have
the most diverse cabinet ever.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.624
We have every shade,
from pasty to bloated corpse.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.092
(laughter)

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.128
I have no information
that supports those tweets.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.331
-(laughter)
-All right, points. Matteo.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.534
Kellyanne Conway
is not a waterfall with eyes.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.002
(laughter)

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.538
I have no information
that supports those tweets.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:44.638
(laughter, applause)
