00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.935
- I'm John Levenstein,

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:05.838
and today we're going to be
talking about Wayne Wheeler,

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:09.141
the man responsible
for Prohibition.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.210
Cheers.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.211
- Cheers, John.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.847
- Wayne Wheeler
would have hated that.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:19.152
<i> Wayne Wheeler's family
 had a farmhand who was drunk,</i>

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:23.122
<i> who was swinging a pitchfork--
 a hayfork--wildly.</i>

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:27.960
<i> He said, Mom,
 that farmhand's acting sloppy.</i>

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.430
<i> The farmhand
 stabs Wayne Wheeler in the leg.</i>

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.333
<i> Wayne Wheeler said</i>
 Ouch.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.333
Hey.
<i> - Yeah.</i>

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.401
- What are you doing?

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.370
You just stabbed me in the leg.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.339
What, are you drunk,
you farmhand?

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.642
<i> Wayne Wheeler decided,</i>
 Alcohol's bad.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.443
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.046
fighting against alcohol.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.749
And that's the fornd--
the formative event

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.152
of Wayne Wheeler's life,
with--of, okay.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.688
The--
[laughs]

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:56.956
Okay.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.291
The--
[laughs]

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:03.829
The formative event
of Wayne Wheeler's life.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.934 line:0%
<i> Wayne Wheeler, in 1893,
 graduated from college.</i>

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.204
<i> He goes to see
 Howard Hyde Russell,</i>

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.640
<i> from the Anti-Saloon League,
 speak.</i>

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.342
I'm against alcohol.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:20.012
I'm against the way alcohol
affects the American family.

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.048
Men should not
drink at the saloon,

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.084
waste away
their family's money,

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.587
come home, hit their wives,
hit their children.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.022
That shouldn't happen.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.157 line:92%
<i> After the speech he said,</i>

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.459
I'm going to
join your movement,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.529
and I'll devote my life
to making people not drink.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.865
Now, Wayne Wheeler,
with the Anti-Saloon League,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.000
was a dynamo.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.036
He was just biking everywhere.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.538
He was biking
from town to town,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.206
going door-to-door,

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:50.376
getting people
to vote against candidates

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.044
who opposed Prohibition.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.780
<i> And Wayne Wheeler would say,</i>
 People shouldn't drink.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.017 align:start position:0%
I was stabbed by a fith--
a pitchfork when I was a child.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.518
<i> And then they would say,</i>

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:04.724 align:end position:100%
Oh, people can be stabbed
by pitchforks as children?

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:09.428
<i> And Wayne Wheeler would say,</i>
 Yes.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:13.032
[laughs]

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.200
- Why did you laugh?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.935
- Because I was seeing
two of you.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:16.969
- That's okay.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.170
[laughs]

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.638
I--
[laughs]

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.609
<i> Wayne Wheeler was going
 to churches to raise money.</i>

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.311
<i> He was going
 to arrange demonstrations,</i>

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.746
<i> and he was always on his bike.</i>

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.248
<i> He was always
 pedaling furiously.</i>

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:32.551
<i> Wayne Wheeler
 invented pressure politics.</i>

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.120
<i> Wayne Wheeler would say,</i>

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.991
This person is not strongly
enough in favor of temperance.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.293
<i> Then that person would go down.</i>

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.729
<i> Every time--70 for 70.</i>

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.432
So Wayne Wheeler
comes to Washington, DC

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.869
and starts fighting for
a constitutional amendment

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.403
against alcohol.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:54.140
<i> Everyone is afraid
 of Wayne Wheeler.</i>

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.843
<i> Wayne Wheeler is the most
 successful lobbyist</i>

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.278
<i> in the United States.</i>

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.181
There was another
thing that happened

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.017
that I'm forgetting right now

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.618
that I'll get back to.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:06.919
That I'll get back to, Derek.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.889
But, in the meantime,
Prohibition was passed,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.425
and Wayne Wheeler won the day.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.460
<i> Wayne Wheeler was
 such a zealot,</i>

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.228
because once
Prohibition happened--

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.664
that wasn't enough
for Wayne Wheeler.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.800
<i> He goes to see
 the head of the KKK.</i>

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.204
I'm a national figure.
I can't do my own bidding,

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.674
but you, Ku Klux Klan, can.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.142
<i> So the Ku Klux Klan did it.</i>

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:32.278
They were Wayne Wheeler's
private security force.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.713
<i> And they would go into bars</i>

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:37.116
<i> and just tear
 the [bleep]ing place apart.</i>

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.519
<i> The Ku Klux Klan
 was a violent organization.</i>

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.487
<i> They were
 tarring and feathering</i>

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.489
<i> people who were bootleggers.</i>

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.926
[laughs]

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.528
Wha--
[laughs]

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.230
[laughter]

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.298
Wha--
[laughs]

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.000
Wayne Wheeler--
[laughs]

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.302
- Great name.
- Wayne Wheeler.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:58.871
Wayne Wheeler is so crazy

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.507
because there was
still industrial alcohol

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.243
that was used
to clean engine parts,

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:05.844
to make nail polish.

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:08.714
<i> Wayne Wheeler said,</i>
 We need to find a way

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:12.818
to make
that legal alcohol poisonous.

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:15.821 align:end position:100%
We're going to add
methanol to ethanol,

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.257 align:start size:81% position:19%
call it formula number 30,

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.859 align:end position:100%
and then anyone
who drinks ethanol--

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.396 align:end position:100%
not to clean engines,
but to get drunk--

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:25.598 align:start size:28% position:72%
will die.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.500
And that's when
the [bleep] hit the fan.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.804
<i> People who were drinking
 ethanol mixed with methanol</i>

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.706
<i> didn't know that
 that's what they were doing.</i>

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.208
<i> It made thousands
 of people sick</i>

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:38.043
<i> and hundreds of people die.</i>

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:40.246
<i> And Wayne Wheeler was saying,</i>
 Well, it's your own fault.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.981
You know about Prohibition.
You know alcohol's illegal.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.517
You're dead now.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.386
<i> And people started thinking,</i>

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.521
Why would my own government
do this to me?

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:51.824
Wayne Wheeler,
who had been pretty much

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.494
running the government
as a lobbyist, was discredited.

00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:58.164
<i> And that's when
 he went to Michigan.</i>

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.400
<i> And then died a few weeks
 later.</i>

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.338
<i> Just because Wayne Wheeler
 was stabbed in the leg</i>

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:09.509
<i> by a pitchfork by
 a drunken farmhand as a child,</i>

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.444
<i> he had to spend
 the rest of his life</i>

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.947
<i> making sure no one else
 had fun, no matter what.</i>

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.849
[laughs]

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.217
I mean--
[laughs]

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.919
Oh, God. I just spilled.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.054
- Oh, you got it.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.624
I love that
you're collecting the ice.

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:28.761
- All right.
This is as drunk as I get.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.697
[laughter]
