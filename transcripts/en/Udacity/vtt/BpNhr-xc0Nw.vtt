00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So before we do the work in our Editor, I need

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to teach you another little bit of HTML.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So we've seen the value parameter on some form elements,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and let's talk about how we use it in the text element case.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is our normal text element that we've been using.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, of course, this will all be familiar to you:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And this part is new--this is a value attribute,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and this causes the text box, when we render it,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to have this "cool" as the default value.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So you can see, this might be useful for rendering our form

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
with the values that the user just typed in--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so they don't have to keep reentering things all the time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And you can also use this to fill out form fields

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with default values, if you know what the user is probably going to enter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Okay--so I hope you can see the direction we're heading.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We're going to populate our form s with what the user typed in.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So which of these little bits of HTML

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is the correct for preserving the user's month?
