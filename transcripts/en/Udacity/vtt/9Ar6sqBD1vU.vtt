For one hour we can see that both the car companies would cost $15, so this

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:09.276
one's correct. For ten hours, it's not on my graph, so I have to think a little

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:13.864
bit harder. I could plug in the value of ten in for x. If x were equal to ten,

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:18.940
Carz-to-Go would cost $60, and Numerator Cars would also cost $60. That's pretty

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.028
simple because, well, they have the same equation. The same would be true for 15

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:28.447
hours and 20 hours and it turns out, this is true for every hour. We know the

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:33.030
equations are identical so their cost should always be the same. This question

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.450
was pretty tricky so don't worry if you didn't get it right on your first try.
