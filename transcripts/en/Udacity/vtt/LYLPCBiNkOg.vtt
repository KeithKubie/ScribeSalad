00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.450
So far we've been talking a bit about
Grand Central Dispatch, or GCD but

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.780
without getting into too many details.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.940
Time to put an end to that.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.940
GCD is an open source framework
from Apple for both iOS and OS 10.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.340
It's one of the crown jewels of
the Apple's programming stack.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.760
For reasons that are beyond this course
dealing directly with threads in

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.400
inherently dangerous and complicated.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.140
This is one of the reasons
why concurrent programming

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.400
has always been available only to gurus.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.650
Not anymore.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.580
GCG makes concurrent programming
approachable by mere mortals

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.450
by hiding threads, and
using queues of closures instead.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.350
How on earth does this help?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.950
Patience young padawan,
let's start with a queue.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.610
A queue is like a line
at the super market,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.270
each customer is a closure
waiting to reach the cashier.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.660
The cashier is a thread that
picks a customer, or closure, and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.550
allows it to run.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.400
Once the closure finishes running,
it is removed from the queue, and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.860
the next one in line runs.
