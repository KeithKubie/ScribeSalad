00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this next problem, imagine you're the captain of a ship on the high seas.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And you know there's some enemy ship about 200 m away.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You want to aim your cannon at some angle α,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and shoot the cannonball with some initial velocity of v¬ such that you hit the enemy ship.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Unfortunately, there's this 40-m tall iceberg about 110 m away from you,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which makes your shot a lot more difficult because you have to go over the iceberg.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So what angle α and initial speed v¬ should you use such that you hit the enemy ship?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, there are actually a lot of answers here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But we're just looking for one that works. The one that works will hit the enemy ship.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And not hit the iceberg.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To answer this question, we're going to use a slightly different form of input than we normally do.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This one though here contains a computer code, and you may have used this one though before

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if you've taken a Computer Science class at Udacity.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We're only going to focus on these two numbers here. These two are the important ones.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You don't need to worry about this line up here and this line down here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You will only need to look at these two, and you're going to take this line initial velocity = 50,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and replace the 50 with what you want your initial velocity to be.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So if you wanted your initial velocity to be 60 m/s, then you replace the 50 with a 60.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You don't need to include the units.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And if you wanted the launch angle to be 20°, then you need to replace this 10 with 20.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Again, you don't need to write the word degrees or anything like that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So once you're ready to fire the cannon with this initial velocity and this launch angle,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
go down here and press the run button.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Though after you press run, you'll be able to scroll down and see a nice graph

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
of what the trajectory of your cannonball looked like.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So I've scrolled down and now I get this nice graph of my cannonball's trajectory.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And as you can tell, it looked like it was doing all right.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It was headed towards the ship, but unfortunately it hit the iceberg.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So next time I'm going to have to aim either a bit higher

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
or give it a bit more oomph to try and hit the enemy ship.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So feel free to toy around with your values and try and hit the ship just by guess and check.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Or you can solve it directly and then hit the ship that way.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Either way, once you've hit the ship, you'll get this nice boom animation,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and then you know you have the answer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So once you've hit the enemy ship, you should scroll up

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and then press submit to submit your homework for grading.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, currently, my cannonball doesn't work quite right because it hits the iceberg

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
so I get this try again message but once you hit the ship you should get a "you got it correct" message.

00:02:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In that way, you know your homework's been counted.
