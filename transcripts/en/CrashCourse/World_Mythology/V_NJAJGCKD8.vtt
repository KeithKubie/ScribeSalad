Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse mythology.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.080
Today, we’re going to tackle one of the
most difficult and fascinating pantheons in

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080
all of mythology.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.089
It’s got dancing dwarves, buffalo demons,
and some many armed folks.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.090
Yessir there’s a lot going on in this pantheon!

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.640
Maybe even more than in the Egyptian pantheon.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.900
Sorry Thoth.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.230
In this episode, we’ll talk about the pantheon
of deities in Indian myths.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.419
Unlike myths from Egypt and the Ancient Near
East, there are living people for whom these

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.469
stories have deep, personal, religious meaning.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.730
Remember how it got a little uncomfortable
when we discussed the Bible’s creation story?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.870
Well, it’s gonna be a bit like that.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.860
But we’re gonna try to minimize the awkwardness.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.700
Just ask--wait, there’s no god of awkwardness?!

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.800
Ruh roh.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.700
INTRO

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.360
Discussing the Indian pantheon is tricky for
two reasons: first because it remains a living

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.740
belief system for about a billion people.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.060
And second because Indian religious and mythic
traditions are not only abundant but also

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.130
ancient.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.770
As in Egypt, there are different sets of gods
and goddesses that were worshipped at different

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.090
points in time.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.619
But unlike Egypt, India was and is home to
many different languages, which means we have

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.360
a lot of different stories, each with many
different versions.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.600
We are going to focus mostly on stories that
have been written in Sanskrit, the sacred

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.420
language of Hinduism.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.479
Sanskrit first appears in written form around
150 CE in a series of rock inscriptions that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.590
look much more complex than what I’ve inscribed
on rocks.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.469
This probably doesn’t say “Parvati wuz
here!

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.510
Vishnu + Lakshmi 5eva.”

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.270
Let’s remember that Sanskrit is a complex
language and its poetry may sound unusual

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.450
to English ears.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.590
But we can handle it.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.860
Lead the way, Bragi, Norse God of poetry.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.079
In the earliest Indian traditions, Dyaus the
sky father, and Prithvi the earth mother were

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.079
central.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.340
Hey, sky dad and earth mom!

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.440
Nice to see you over here, too!

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770
Do you mind if I drop off some cosmic laundry?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.940
Later, however, Surya the sun god, Agni the
fire god and Indra the warrior king of the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.210
gods took top God Billing from mom and dad,
who were arguing all the time!

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.070
Sky dad, earth mom, knock it off!

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.440
Just stop the fighting!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
We can all get along.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.220
Indra was the child of the sky and the earth,
and was responsible for keeping them separate,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.920
but had his own beef with another god, Varuna,
who may once have been the ruler of the gods,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.470
but was supplanted by Indra.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470
Hey, even god’s got beef, right?

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.750
Wonder if one of them recorded a diss track...

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.160
Anyway, the most well-known myth about Indra
is about his battle with Vritra, a giant serpent

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.440
or dragon, whom Indra kills, thus creating
the sun, the dawn, and they sky.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.290
(Yeah, I know – you thought we had sky covered
but, mythology is tricky.)

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.430
The death of Vritra also gave form to chaos.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.430
Which is nice.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.810
So yup, it’s our old friend the creation
story, but with violence instead of sex.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.600
In a number of stories, Indra is described
as battling and destroying hostile minor deities

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
and demons.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.990
I mean, someone has to, right?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.010
And so maybe, you’re thinking yay, Indra.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.530
He fights the good fight.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.770
But… he also breaks oaths,kills family members
and commits adultery with Ahalya, the wife

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.170
of the sage Gvautama.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.860
For which he lost his testicles.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.860
Cherries emoji.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.860
Scissors emoji.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.200
Face Screaming in emoji.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.040
But hey wait, it’s OK. in another myth he
has them replaced with those of a ram.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040
Emoji.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040
So...um...guess that worked out.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.740
Indra’s weapon of choice is a thunderbolt,
similar to Zeus, and by India’s classical

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.530
age he becomes a god of rain.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.560
And this changing function over time is generally
emblematic of Indian myth.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.660
Like the Egyptian pantheon, it’s difficult
to pin down one canonical set of myths or

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.530
characters because they appear in so many
forms, often with multiple names.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.350
Here’s another version of how things get
going: In the Vedas, which are the most ancient

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.470
Hindu scriptures, Prajapati was the creator
god, but over time, and especially in the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.470
Upanishads, another collection of important
Sanskrit texts, the less anthropomorphic concept

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.390
of Brahman developed.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.860
Brahman isn’t a GOD so much as the all-encompassing
essence of reality, the supreme cosmic spirit.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.500
Pretty cool, right Thoth?

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.750
It’s not something you can easily represent
on a sandstone relief, but then again it’s

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.360
not that dissimilar from “god” in monotheistic
religious traditions.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.780
Brahman has sometimes been translated as the
“world soul” and all individual souls

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.280
are one with it.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.690
Don’t get too comfortable, though, because
Brahman, in later classical Hindu mythology

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.130
and religion, is embodied and personified
as three deities: Brahma, the creator, Vishnu,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.190
the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.020
They are all distinct, with their own stories,
and yet also represent aspects of the more

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.600
esoteric and universal idea of Brahman.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.660
This triumvirate?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.690
Trifecta?

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.950
Divine Hat Trick?

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.160
Hindus call it the trimurti and Vishnu and
Shiva loom largest in Indian myths.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.660
So then, why is Brahma third banana?

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.530
Well, once the universe is created, the work
of the creator is done.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.780
True, The concept of cyclical existence is
central to the Hindu and Buddhist worldview,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.160
so you’d think a creator would be considered
among the most important gods.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.030
Still, Brahma’s significance declined in
comparison with that of Vishnu and Shiva,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.890
perhaps because, according to John Brockington:
Essentially he is a fusion of a creator deity

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.220
with the impersonal Brahman propounded in
the Upanishads, which see the goal of religious

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.410
endeavor as some kind of union with the absolute,
whereas the popular forms of religion attested

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.680
to in the epics prefer a more personal and
devotional approach.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.410
In other words, Brahma doesn’t really get
involved in the juicy stuff-- battles and

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.750
quests and adultery.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.920
So let’s turn to Vishnu, the preserver.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.230
Stories of Vishnu often involve his consort
Shri, also called Lakshmi, a goddess of prosperity

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.690
and good fortune, which is pretty terrific
as dowries go.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:22.150
Vishnu protects the world from evil, and he
often appears in different forms called “avatars”.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.260
Avatars are the human or animal form of a
god on earth and they are very, very rad.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.040
By the classical period, Vishnu had 10 or
so avatars:

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.850
Matsya, the fish, who we’ll hear more about
when we talk about floods

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.880
Kurma the tortoise, who played a role similar
to the tortoise in the earth diver myth that

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.550
we saw
Varaha, the boar who is a boar and does boar

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.690
stuff
Narasimha the man-lion who kills the demon

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.389
Hiranyakashipu
Vamana, the dwarf who defeats the demon Bai

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.220
through trickery
Parashurama who kills the hundred-armed Arjuna

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.419
with an ax and probably has amazing biceps
Rama and

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.210
Krishna who are central to the Mahabaratha,
one of the great Sanskrit epics

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.350
The Buddha who is the Buddha.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.350
You know.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.460
From Buddhism.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.950
Kalkin who is a future avatar and a millennial
figure that will establish a new era.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.690
But not like, a millennial millennial.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.920
Kalkin is not on Snapchat.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.750
Shiva, the destroyer, had his origins in the
Vedic era as a storm god who was a “wrathful

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.260
avenger” and a “herdsman of souls,”
which definitely sounds trickier than sheep.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.090
Shiva is also associated with yoga, asceticism
and erotic love.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.770
Which definitely sounds contradictory.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.770
Or maybe just flexible.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.321
This erotic aspect manifests most concretely
in Shiva’s symbolic form as a linga, which

00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:43.460
is self-explanatory if you look at it, and
might explain why Shiva has numerous female

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.530
deities as either wives or consorts, including
Sati and Parvati, and sometimes Durga and

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.530
Kali.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.449
Basically, Shiva has game.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:59.310
One of the best known images of Shiva is his
depiction asl the lord of the dance–no,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.850
definitely not, yes.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.889
According to one scholar:
“His steps are intended to relieve by enlightenment

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:12.470
the suffrage of his devotees: hence he balances
on the back of a dwarf who symbolizes ignorance.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.130
His gestures and the attributes he is holding
symbolize aspects of his divinity; the drum

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.360
in his back right hand [symbolizes creation],
the tongue of flame in his back left hand

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.810
[symbolizes destruction], the gesture of protection
[of his front right hand symbolizes] protection

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.240
and his raised leg symboliz[es] release.”

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.969
Has Michael Flatley ever balanced on the back
of a dwarf?

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:37.400
I rest my case.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.860
Now we’ve spent most of the episode discussing
the three key gods of the trimurti and their

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.589
amazing dance moves, but Indian pantheons
feature goddesses, too, who usually have qualities

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.600
that complement their husband’s powers.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.640
I mentioned Parvati and Uma and Sati, the
wives of Shiva, and Laskshmi, who is married

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640
to Vishnu.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.671
But other traditions describe the goddess
Devi, which translates to “goddess” or

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:05.920
Mahadevi, the great goddess, who is occasionally
associated with these other consorts and sometimes

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.310
seen as a world creator in her own right.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.040
In some traditions Devi is essentially the
same as Brahman.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.930
Like many of the deities we discuss, Devi
can be many things to many people.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.470
We haven’t seen too many female warrior
goddesses yet.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:26.330
So let’s wrap up with a story that features
one: Durga, also known as Kali, who is unapproachable

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.760
to her suitors and invincible in battle.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.779
Also she rides a lion.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.570
So clearly - no one is cool enough to date
her.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.760
Thoughtbubble, do your thing.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.160
One of the main stories about Durga is that
of her killing the buffalo demon Mahisha.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.350
Mahisha conquered the other lesser gods, the
Devas, and then the Devas went to Vishnu and

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.510
Shiva for help, who listened and grew angry.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.440
And you wouldn’t like Vishnu and Shiva when
they’re angry, because their anger takes

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.760
the form of Durga, who confronted Mahisha
and the other demons.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:02.070
“The demons rushed towards the goddess who
killed them in hundreds, felling some with

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:09.800
her club, catching others in her noose, slicing
others with her sword, and piercing others

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.940
with her trident.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.980
Meanwhile, Mahisha himself, in buffalo form,
terrorized her troops.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.370
Then he attacked her lion, and Durga became
furious.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:27.960
She caught him in her noose, whereupon he
quitted his buffalo shape and became a lion

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960
himself.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.110
She cut off its head and he emerged as a man,
sword in hand.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:39.890
As she pierced the man, he became a great
elephant, seizing her lion with its trunk,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.649
but she cut off his trunk with her sword as
he resumed his buffalo form.

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:50.140
Lightly tossing aside the mountains he hurled
at her, she leaped on him, pinned his neck

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.899
with one foot and pierced him with her trident.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.150
Then she cut off his head with her mighty
sword.”

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
Thanks, Thoughtbubble, that was... harrowing?

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.380
I guess it’s always the second beheading
that sticks.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.310
CONCLUSION
This episode could only scratch the surface

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.910
of the complexity of Indian mythology.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:12.000
Not only does it come from so many sources,
but for many people these are living myths,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.850
unlike the deeds of Egyptian gods that we
saw last week.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:21.890
These stories are complex because people associate
one god with one or two attributes or phenomena,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.399
like wisdom or storms.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:28.990
And these gods take many forms and are often
seen as versions of each other, or maybe of

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.960
a single universal god.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.600
Hinduism is a fascinating religion and a rich
source of myths, but it’s also quite the

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600
web.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.000
Emoji.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.440
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
