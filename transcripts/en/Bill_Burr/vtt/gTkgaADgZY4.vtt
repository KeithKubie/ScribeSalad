00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.610
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.910
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
February 8th, 2016 what's going on everybody else,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.890
Huh? All my Darlin, Oman, Darlin, Oman, Darl in Denver,

5
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.300
Colorado,

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.530
bunch of hippies and some miners and the womb boat trophy.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.130
I'm congratulations to everybody in rocky,

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.010
Matt and Colorado.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.330
Keelan fuck and calves and Stinky Greeley,

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.170
Greeley, Colorado. Man. If you ever want to know,

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.770
you know what a bunch of murdered cow smell like for the next time you eat a

12
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.790
burger. I suggest you go there on a bad smell day.

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.800
That's where they call it. Bad Smell Day.

14
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.810
And then you call up the slaughterhouse. You're like, hey, could you fucking a,

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560
could you fucking tone it down a little?

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.960
You know the winds blow it down to my house.

17
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:01.840
Why don't you lay off killing those fucking cows? You know, not saying that.

18
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.550
Don't like Burke Burke

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
in San Francisco and all those limousine liberals out in Hollywood.

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.110
I'm out there eating them. Fucking Tofu patties.

21
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.920
You know that shit causes cancer, don't you? The fuck is it Tofu?

22
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.420
I'm sorry. Congratulations to the Denver Broncos. And guess what?

23
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.050
All Billy bred face. He wanted a little bit of money, but none the old,

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.340
the old man. Yo Man, Moo River. I'm

25
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.670
sorry. I'm very happy for a Peyton manning man.

26
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.511
I though I just,

27
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.620
I didn't want to see him go in there and get his fucking ass kicked and I won't,

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.120
I know what you guys are thinking. Hey Bill, why did you bet on the Broncos?

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.800
You didn't say shit predict in one way or the other? Um,

30
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.260
I didn't have a, I didn't have any feelings one way or the other on the, uh,

31
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
on the game. I thought what a lot of people thought.

32
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:02.880
I just thought the fucking panthers were gonna if they got up early it was going

33
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.690
to get ugly and uh, I don't know.

34
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.840
But then just everybody was saying it, everybody kept fucking saying it.

35
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.800
You know, dude, the panties dude fucking cake, right?

36
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.630
Everyone was just saying that the panthers were going to fucking destroy.

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.740
They went to win by 17 two. It's gonna be 17. Nothing by Uni the first quarter.

38
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.210
This is what all my friends was saying.

39
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.810
So I came up with this quick theory because I wanted to put money on the game,

40
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.960
you know, cause my team wasn't in it and I wasn't really excited about it.

41
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.460
So I figured I, well if everybody is saying the panthers are right,

42
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.250
how does Vegas make any money?

43
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.500
The only way Vegas makes monies is if the Broncos went,

44
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.640
Vegas always says the lights on. Even during the day, they never shut them off.

45
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.190
They got the AC on what the fucking door is open.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.260
And I don't see anybody concerned out there. Right. Is it making money?

47
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.240
So I said, fuck, I'm going to go against the grain.

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.340
I didn't even take the points. I just bet it.

49
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.640
I bet the line 100 and make one 90 through 100 bucks on it.

50
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.110
And I'm the Jesus Christ.

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.570
I guess that Denver Broncos defense was,

52
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.230
was as good as they were saying. I just thought like,

53
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.110
I thought we made them look better than they work cause our offensive line was

54
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.450
fucking beat up. But, um,

55
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.100
I don't know if you noticed the entire time when the Broncos beat the Patriots,

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.000
at no point was Tom Brady comfortable. He wasn't screaming and yellow light.

57
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910
<v 1>Yeah, let's go man or whatever the fuck he yelled.</v>

58
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.580
<v 0>You said his receivers [inaudible]</v>

59
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.310
<v 1>you know, it was supposed to be a pub pattern,</v>

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.380
<v 0>right? Whatever the fuck it is, he yells at him. He didn't do that.</v>

61
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.620
Once he had his eyebrows down and he looked fucking uncomfortable.

62
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:52.030
He felt people at his feet, the whole fucking game. They never felt comfortable.

63
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.320
And um, you know, von Miller would do that little fucking little,

64
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.870
the little I'm, I'm, I'm going this way. Oh No, I'm not.

65
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.900
And the guy fell for it every fucking time on the Patriots. Right?

66
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.220
And I'm thinking like, Jesus Christ,

67
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:06.670
how much does that dude on the Patriots stink that he keeps falling for that?

68
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.743
And low and behold,

69
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.810
I watched von Miller do it all game against Carolina Panthers and dfe.

70
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.780
I don't know if you noticed this, there's a lot of stats.

71
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.660
How many times did you see Cam Newton celebrate? I got to, I,

72
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.500
as far as I can remember, zero.

73
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.690
He didn't do one of those little first down fucking point things. Eating,

74
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.030
not one kid got a ball.

75
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.340
He never fucking ripped off burn off his suit to show the superman s underneath

76
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.733
you know,

77
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.590
<v 1>diary now. No, he said more fun.</v>

78
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.230
<v 0>You didn't see that watch Cam Newton had zero fun. In fact,</v>

79
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:47.500
if I remember correctly, cause I had a lot of Budweiser's um,

80
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.510
I probably drank as many Budweiser's as fucking Peyton man.

81
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.630
He said he was going to drink, um, by the fourth quarter.

82
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:59.550
The only thing I remember Cam Newton doing was fallen down when they miss the

83
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:03.690
fucking, uh, when they miss that a, that field goal attempt,

84
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.960
it just wasn't there fucking day, but he got mugged, fine mill kids.

85
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.650
You see, just give me that fucking ball.

86
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.490
So like fucking Lyman running after like a bunch of craze dogs or whatever that

87
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.050
classic NFL quote goes.

88
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:23.051
That was just complete fucking domination by the Denver Broncos.

89
00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:25.380
Defense. Uh, to the point,

90
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.520
I think Peyton manning only had about 40 more yards passing than I did.

91
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.320
But you know what, when it counted, when it counted, he got it done. So, uh,

92
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.050
congratulations to them. And I actually, I went against everything that I said.

93
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.740
I not only, I didn't take the game, I forgot to tape it like a fucking asshole.

94
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.060
And I went to a super bowl party, which I always say I'm not going, you know,

95
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:50.300
cause there's always 50 fucking people there and only like, you know,

96
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.740
12 of them give a shit about the game and everybody else is running around.

97
00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:58.310
And you know, all the fucking shit that I fucking had a Tampon

98
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 2>at my ass above for fucking ever with those things. But I actually said,</v>

99
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.220
you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to go to a party cause you know,

100
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.010
I'm just not into the fucking game or whatever.

101
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.120
And then I showed up and I realized I was totally into the game. Unfortunately,

102
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.490
the party I went to, it was great. Everybody was into it.

103
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.620
Everybody was watching, people were saying stuff about the game that made sense.

104
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.820
You know, it was football fans and the food was fucking tremendous.

105
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.180
And um, had a great time.

106
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.380
I've got to tell you going into the Super Bowl party though, uh,

107
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.370
something that I never noticed was, uh,

108
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.790
the just general open hatred for Coldplay.

109
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.510
Why does everybody a call there? Why does everybody hate that bed?

110
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.540
They're not that bad. Right?

111
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.920
Everybody's are told they're so fucking lame. They get like,

112
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.970
they get like half like Nickelback hate. You know what I mean? Hang on a second.

113
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.680
This fucking curtains messed up driving me fucking crazy and just stare at it

114
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:02.240
the entire time. What is the problem? There we go. Sorry.

115
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.920
I apologize. Yes. So, so called play comes out.

116
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.770
I don't know what they was singing. They were jumping around a lot.

117
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.310
I immediately left cause I didn't want to watch beyond say Sass it up.

118
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.540
You know what I mean? It just, I I cannot f the same way.

119
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:20.180
You know,

120
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.600
the way she behaves on stage as the way a lot of athletes behave after they make

121
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:27.110
a great fucking play. And somewhere that that happened during my lifetime,

122
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.820
it went from fucking score to touchdown.

123
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.020
Just giving the ball to the ref to absolutely. You know, just fucking,

124
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.010
I dunno what you do.

125
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.540
You start line dancing and you just can't believe how amazing you are.

126
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.380
Right? And everybody claimed that he's having so much fun now. He isn't.

127
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:45.860
He's marketing himself. He's whoring himself out right now. All right?

128
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:49.250
You should literally have to put on a pair of fucking stilettos when you do it

129
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:52.940
and just walk the fucking block after you fucking dunk or score a touchdown or

130
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.400
whatever. Right? So I didn't want to watch her, you know,

131
00:07:55.401 --> 00:08:00.401
you know that fucking stupid walk the divas do play sort of stomped down the

132
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.190
stage as they cross one leg over in front of it,

133
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.080
hair swinging their fucking hips.

134
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.770
I always just want somebody to just give him a big fucking leg sweep. That's me.

135
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.320
You know what I mean? So I was like, I don't want to watch that shit.

136
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.310
So Coldplay comes up and everybody says, ah, yeah, Jesus crazy.

137
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.560
You know, no one wants to see him. It wasn't that bad, but I could feel it.

138
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.870
You know, I just want to say, you know,

139
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.020
I don't understand these fucking bands that sell millions and millions of

140
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.920
fucking records yet.

141
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.600
You cannot find one person that will admit that they were fan, right?

142
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.510
All you guys right now who are nodding your heads going, oh yeah,

143
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:39.170
they're so fucking lame. Scroll through your fucking phone right now.

144
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.850
Go to the CS, go down to CEO.

145
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.640
You're going to find you got one song admitted. You've got,

146
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.690
you must have one song, right? What's that one there firsthand? I said, oh,

147
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.550
that's fine. Look at me face as I walked down,

148
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.050
<v 0>we would always do it.</v>

149
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.540
It was all yellow. I married a chick,

150
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.480
she had yellow hair. I didn't wear a Bra.

151
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.070
[inaudible] boast and I'm still

152
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.150
paying child support. Um, does he pay child support to her or is it

153
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.430
<v 2>the other way around? That's a close one.</v>

154
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.020
So the name of that broad there that he married [inaudible] she looks fucking

155
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.680
moody. All those good looking chicks that do fucking yoga. They're,

156
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.980
they're fucking basket run in the other directions, you know?

157
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:38.070
And they had like those stones that are for their ci and they put them around

158
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:40.500
the fucking house and I think they thinks it makes them spiritual.

159
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.320
You just gotta get the fuck away from them. You know,

160
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.730
anybody with a yoga room and it is at least an eight as far as being good

161
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:49.800
looking. You just got to get the fuck away from. Yeah,

162
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.050
they're too good looking to be spiritual,

163
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.703
<v 3>you know what I mean?</v>

164
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.110
<v 2>He's never had to buy a drink for yourself in your life.</v>

165
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.090
I don't give a fuck how much yoga you do.

166
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.130
You're not going to be able to have any sort of self analysis, you know,

167
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.570
like, I don't think the thought of, you know what I mean?

168
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.820
Maybe I was being a cut there.

169
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.910
I don't think that ever fucking goes through your head. Um,

170
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.350
so I gotta commend that guy in Coldplay for not writing a lot of angry songs.

171
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.960
He just kind of has like, does he just have nice sign?

172
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:22.830
I think that's what I think that's a big problem with that band. It's just nice.

173
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:23.960
Right? These sinks.

174
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.443
<v 3>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.700
<v 2>Generally in a good mood. No,</v>

176
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.280
the guy seems like a happy guy that makes you pretty hateable.

177
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.720
You know what I mean? But if put on a fucking flannel jacket, right?

178
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:37.040
Dress like a lumberjack, you know,

179
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:40.370
mocking that hard work as you go fucking sitting around it and you got damn m

180
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:41.390
and m's and your green room.

181
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.690
You come out and you send some sing something miserable song.

182
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:45.524
Everybody likes you.

183
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.060
<v 3>All right?</v>

184
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.280
<v 2>The is that guy's name. They're saying all those songs. Ugh.</v>

185
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.130
Nirvana. Right. That could Kobe, Matt. Yeah.

186
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.940
I really wish you didn't kill himself so I could trash it more. You know,

187
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.140
fucking guy. I wish I was like, yeah,

188
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.790
<v 0>you easily amused that card. You don't fucking know me.</v>

189
00:11:10.791 --> 00:11:14.240
Go Fuck Yourself. The fucking thing I'm doing, staring at a dre dull over here,

190
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.960
all amazed that it keeps spinning.

191
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.770
I ate well when that shit came out, it was like this,

192
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.410
is it me or is this guy in the most condescending, condescending.

193
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.260
Kondapur he comes out there first fucking video.

194
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:29.900
He's making fun of tap on Solos. Like he could do it.

195
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:31.610
He just didn't feel like doing it.

196
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.121
<v 2>Sorry this,</v>

197
00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:39.121
these are just the ramblings of a man who's Wa who saw the beginning,

198
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.240
the middle and the end of hair metal and he took it all seriously

199
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.950
and that God damn Nirvana,

200
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.690
I just sounded like Giamatti in that fucking Howard stern movie. Howard Stern.

201
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.580
Yeah. Goddamn motherfucker mean, mean to rosary wound that like 15 times.

202
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:57.820
You know,

203
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.880
in the end of the movie when like pig vomits career's just completely in the

204
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.830
shitter and he's like standing outside and he's just dumbfounded at the success

205
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.020
that Howard's had and he's how would start,

206
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.170
he just kind of looks away at God damn motherfucker.

207
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.030
Um, anyways, I'm just saying, you know, how about in 2016,

208
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.030
you know, there's so much, so many real things out there to get your passion up,

209
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.640
up about. I don't think you should go around hating Coldplay.

210
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.810
Oh that pull a bastard.

211
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.820
It poor bastard got married to a beautiful woman that did yoga. Oh my God.

212
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:38.410
It's over. It's fucking over. Ugh.

213
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.370
Some of those self involved fucking human beings you're ever going to find in

214
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.300
your life are going to be in that fucking stinky ass yoga room, you know,

215
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.820
speaking of which, I'm probably going to take a class this week now,

216
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.700
my wife, she stayed with that man seven days in,

217
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.090
she's going to try to do yoga this whole fucking month. Right. And uh,

218
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.300
she actually asked me, I can't remember if she asked me in the podcast,

219
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:03.910
but she asked me cause you want to go to one of my yoga classes? And I was like,

220
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:07.780
no. As like I'll do yoga, but I like doing it here at the house,

221
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.130
you know what I mean? Where like if I feel like stopping doing yoga,

222
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.280
I can just hit pause on the audio, you know,

223
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.330
go out and have some cereal and then come back and just immediately fast forward

224
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:23.350
to the closing poses. Right. There's nothing wrong with that.

225
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.350
I just hate how when you fucking go in there,

226
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.940
they act like they have just the keys to happiness all the time, you know?

227
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.560
And there's not one picture of anybody on the wall, you know,

228
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.120
with these testimonies going like, you know, I was a really miserable cunt.

229
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.930
And then I went down and I took fucking Sally Struthers Yoga class here and I

230
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:44.764
don't know,

231
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.420
she was just rambling and I was in downdog and all of a sudden it just clicked.

232
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.260
And I have been so happy ever since, you know,

233
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.680
I'm not saying yoga is overrated, I just don't need the fucking,

234
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.640
I don't need the chatter from the instructor.

235
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:05.560
Just tell me the next fucking post to do it. Tell me to breathe. Okay.

236
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.670
Stop with you with your goddamn philosophies.

237
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.970
You ever watch a cooking show and they just get off on these fucking tangents.

238
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:14.890
It's like, well, you just tell me the next ingredient.

239
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.210
I don't even know where Bazell comes from and how they used to bring it over in

240
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:22.460
wooden ships. I don't give a fuck. Right.

241
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.240
And it comes from actually comes from Bazell Romania,

242
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:27.970
which is how it got its name. Um,

243
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.450
do you know the amount of people that are actually gonna fucking waste their

244
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:35.650
time tweeting me that there's no such thing as basal, uh, Romania,

245
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.140
you know, is if I don't know that that city is not in Italy. Um,

246
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.470
even somebody did to me the other day, they,

247
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.420
I talked so much shit on this podcast.

248
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.140
Like when people give me shit for stuff that I say half the time I can't

249
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.070
remember what they're talking about.

250
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:56.480
So somebody tweeted at me twittered at me and said,

251
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.850
uh, they said, you know, selves, I guess I supported something.

252
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.070
Okay. For whatever reason they, they took my rambling seriously and,

253
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.963
and they said, yeah,

254
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.403
<v 3>uh,</v>

255
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.000
<v 0>supporting blah, blah, blah. He said something,</v>

256
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.270
do your homework next time you support blah, blah, blah. Right.

257
00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:19.570
And then had a link c right. Right out of the gate. I'm always like,

258
00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:24.490
who the fuck is this fucking asshole coming at me with that tone? Yeah.

259
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.240
Do your homework. Like I work for you. You can't. Right. So he goes,

260
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.740
do your homework and whatever I said about something, his [inaudible], his,

261
00:15:32.741 --> 00:15:34.120
his fuck his homework was,

262
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:39.121
he sent me a link to an article in the New York Times so that,

263
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:40.420
that was his homework.

264
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.450
He fucking looked at one periodical that liens completely one way politically

265
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.670
right. The old liberal fucking New York Times. So like, and I'm actually,

266
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:53.050
I feel like I'm a liberal. Right.

267
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.710
But I would never just read the New York Times and just be like, well,

268
00:15:56.711 --> 00:16:00.580
there you go. That's kind of down what's happening.

269
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

270
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.240
<v 0>Do you know dom that is,</v>

271
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.820
that would be like listening to this podcast and taking it seriously and wasting

272
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.770
the fucking three minutes. You life to tweet me, James his bill.

273
00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:15.570
Did you bring it all back around your fucking old school count? Maybe I did.

274
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.360
Maybe I did. How about von Miller? Huh?

275
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.630
You ever see a more deserving fucking MVP? He just,

276
00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:26.250
he mugged Cam Newton. He came right in fucking cabinet and back to pass.

277
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.750
Give me that fucking thing. Right.

278
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.413
<v 3>Okay.</v>

279
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.050
<v 2>Just ripped it right out of his fucking hands. Um, haven't said that. I think,</v>

280
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:35.560
uh,

281
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.940
I think cam moon actually gonna definitely gonna be back and he's gonna win win

282
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.290
a ring. And I, I said that on, I tweeted that and every week

283
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:47.100
<v 0>do Burrito, right. That default fucking quarterback to shit on.</v>

284
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.510
<v 3>Um, [inaudible]</v>

285
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.430
<v 2>Kim Newton actually has a fucking running game. He actually has receivers.</v>

286
00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:57.480
He actually has a fucking unbelievable defense and a fucking contemporary coach.

287
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.400
Dan Marino had none of those things. He had the receivers to put in Clayton.

288
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.350
Right. Other than, I'm not going to go through this again. Okay.

289
00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:09.351
Just look up the fucking look up running backs from 1983 to 1999 during

290
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.880
[inaudible] during a Marino's fucking career. I told you Delvin Williams, Tony,

291
00:17:14.881 --> 00:17:18.870
Nathan, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the football player, he never,

292
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.810
he never had his Edwards and James, his Tony door setting.

293
00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:24.900
He never had that man. Never had that shit. Okay.

294
00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:26.160
I'm not saying Cam Newton has that,

295
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.980
but he has enough of a fucking team around him. Whatever. Keep talking shit.

296
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.870
You wait. Cam Newton will be back. He needed that as a youngster.

297
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.140
He had to feel that fucking awful.

298
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.920
This is what it feels like to lose this fucking game, you know?

299
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

300
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.910
<v 2>You watched the next time he goes out there, he's going to fucking,</v>

301
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.580
I don't always get to do it, Bill.

302
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:48.250
You don't know what the fuck he's going to do. Your guests,

303
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.350
you guests and your guests, right?

304
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.970
<v 0>Right.</v>

305
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.830
Last year you thought Seattle was going to win the fucking patriots where you

306
00:17:53.831 --> 00:17:57.870
know, you, you've thought your own fucking team was gonna lose. Um,

307
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.600
all right. Let me read a little bit advertising.

308
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.370
Let me stumble through some advertising. Here is I attempt to read out loud.

309
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.430
<v 4>Um, alright. With a fuck out. All right. Oh, this isn't it.</v>

310
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.730
Oh, this isn't it. Oh, here we go.

311
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.230
<v 0>All right. Oh Jesus. Here we had set time a year.</v>

312
00:18:17.231 --> 00:18:22.231
It's that time a year when you can say get me some chocolate covered

313
00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:27.100
strawberries. Sherry's berries, everybody. Ah,

314
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.870
this stupid fucking holiday. Valentine's Day is just a couple of days away.

315
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.203
Huh?

316
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.000
Where are you in your relationship that you're actually nervous that you have to

317
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:39.910
fucking get your broad something on? It'd be nice if he could,

318
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:43.210
I'm not going to read the copy when it'd be fucking Nice if you could just click

319
00:18:43.211 --> 00:18:45.640
on something and go, yeah, you're fucking, you know,

320
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.880
you know what von Miller rip the ball out of Cam Newton's hands.

321
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.490
What if you could just put a box that you could do the exact opposite.

322
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.670
The football is for a box of fucking candies, right?

323
00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:57.280
And rather than ripping it out of her hand, you just place it in there.

324
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.820
Or maybe Sherry's berries is Cam Nunu. You'll give me that fucking thing, right?

325
00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:03.580
And he just frisbeed over to your wife, girlfriend. Hey, you go, huh?

326
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.530
What'd you get? What'd you get on? Oh Gee,

327
00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:13.240
thank you. Where do you go Outta your wake? Um,

328
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.000
valids high states. Just a couple of days away. Everybody is.

329
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.150
And there's only one way to win Valentines to win

330
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.240
Jesus Christ. That's it. We did.

331
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.620
I resent this copy right now that I actually temped to talk to my male listeners

332
00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:30.520
here. Like they have to dance for their women ladies. By the way,

333
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.550
why don't you get you, when she gets your man a box of chocolates, do it.

334
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.870
You're a fucking box of chocolates and just give a little fucking little pitcher

335
00:19:40.871 --> 00:19:44.640
that cheek there. Hey Cutie. Um,

336
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.030

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.940
with a box of chocolates. Jesus Christ health.

339
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:57.190
What is the reading level of the woman you're with it all.

340
00:19:57.191 --> 00:19:59.620
It's gonna cost to some chocolate covered strawberry.

I think it's a complete bullshit holiday. Alright,

343
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.550

344
00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:13.300
to fucking do something for her because there's no day that the lady has to do

something for me. All right, so fuck you. When you strawberries,

422
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.760
It should be right behind and it always just disappears.

423
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.010
This is really an annoying me. No God.

<v 0>Oh look,</v>

428
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:57.260

he's got to have an h in his name. Like if I was on wheel of fortune,

432
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:07.980
I just looked at his name. I'd have for some reason,

433
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.600
age seems like a fat guy name,

434

438
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.550
<v 0>Is that as [inaudible]?</v>

439
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.000
Is that a side piece meal or is that a fucking or side meal?

440
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.250
Whatever the fuck you call it. Side dishes. Hash side dishes that have fucking,

441
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.580
I have no idea. So many fucking meals. When I was growing up,

442
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.920
<v 2>um, I found later were side dishes.</v>

443
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.420
<v 0>Like when I was growing up, Mac and cheese was an entree.</v>

444
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.060
My mother would just make a big fucking tray of it and then she'd make some

445
00:25:49.061 --> 00:25:53.530
toast and it was the shit, the Kraft macaroni and cheese. It was frozen, right?

446
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.900
She did the old right there. Fred threw it. The fucking

447
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.860
threw right in the fucking stove. Right. She made it like Golden Brown on top.

448
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.000
She taken out, scoop it out as the Yoda. Feel your shit fuck out of my face.

449
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:08.500
Right. A little bit of toast.

450
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.893
<v 2>All right.</v>

451
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.110
<v 0>Buttering the toast.</v>

452
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.440
The way old school moms did every fucking inch of the goddamn piece of toast

453
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.520
<v 2>and at least, you know, at least a quarter stick of fucking butter on it.</v>

454
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:24.503
You know,

455
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:29.770
I remember all those fucking meals from the 70s chicken al King chipped beef on

456
00:26:30.511 --> 00:26:32.400
toast. I've talked about this before. Haven't I?

457
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.380
Green bean casserole was just mushroom soup and they threw fucking green beans

458
00:26:37.381 --> 00:26:41.410
in it. Just hated it up there.

459
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.060
He's a fucking worst man. I hate a green bean casserole.

460
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.040
I always had a strategy that was either beginning or end. Anytime it was green,

461
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.130
I was either getting it out of the fucking way or I was just going to put it off

462
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.960
like a term paper. I swear to God into this fucking day, man.

463
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:00.240
It took me a long time to ever eat like mushroom soup again.

464
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.460
You know Paul Versey thinks mushrooms are useless. Tell that to the druggies,

465
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:07.710
man. He doesn't like mushrooms.

466
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.190
He doesn't like corn and he doesn't like peas.

467
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.610
I do not like peas, man. There's something fucking wrong with you, right?

468
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.260
You got fire if you've got mashed potatoes right? That a made right.

469
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.783
Okay.

470
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.550
And then you'd take the fucking disposal and you mush it down and then you'd

471
00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:31.120
take a big clump of butter even though you already put butter in.

472
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.071
You drop it on there.

473
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:35.850
You put salt and pepper on that and then he got some peas right next to it.

474
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.920
The fuck out of here, Paul Versey why don't we hang out with Deca?

475
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:44.190
How did you hang out with somebody that doesn't like peas? You know,

476
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:47.100
God help that best if he ever goes to fucking Scotland, you know,

477
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.180
they're mushy peas. Um, anyways. Anyway,

478
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.160
what the fuck I'm talking about here? Um, you know, I got my car all fixed up,

479
00:27:58.161 --> 00:28:01.580
right? They've got it all fixed up, got all the dents taken out of it,

480
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.080
and I fucking backed into something yesterday. Not hard and buy something.

481
00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:07.310
I mean, somebody else's car.

482
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.090
Not hard but hard enough. I just put a couple of hack marks.

483
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.450
I didn't do anything to their car. They of course had a fucking SUV, so,

484
00:28:17.451 --> 00:28:20.320
you know, they're like a dentist or something and it had like this,

485
00:28:20.321 --> 00:28:24.350
this fucking license plate holder thing that just dug right into my bumper.

486
00:28:24.351 --> 00:28:29.300
So it's already a little hacked up. But uh, I dunno, you know, it's funny.

487
00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:32.360
Ever since I the Prius, right? I used to be really good at backing up and shit,

488
00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:34.640
but ever since the, you had like that backup camera,

489
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.250
like I find myself not even looking anymore. I become worse at it.

490
00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:41.084
You know what I mean?

491
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:42.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

492
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.530
<v 2>It's like when you start delegating power,</v>

493
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.440
you'll have a job and you just start delegating power.

494
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.280
Then all of a sudden you just sit behind your desk and you're like,

495
00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:50.860
I really had nothing to do here. And then you look up in the,

496
00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:55.720
as you superior standing there on the doorway, uh, what are you doing today?

497
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.350
It starts shuffling some papers and no, you get laid off, right?

498
00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:01.960
You just delegated enough fucking apart. That's what I've done with that,

499
00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:02.830
that backup camera.

500
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.960
I've delegated so much of my fucking census to make sure I don't run over

501
00:29:07.961 --> 00:29:10.420
somebody. I really shouldn't say this cause if I ever fucking hit somebody,

502
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.350
how bad would that be if they played my own podcast and court? Right.

503
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.960
<v 5>Uh, your honor, uh, we'd like to submit into evidence, uh,</v>

504
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.330
Jimmy Day, uh, the podcast

505
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.730
<v 2>from a February the eighth,</v>

506
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.080
2016 where we clearly stage that demand does not even look behind his calf when

507
00:29:32.081 --> 00:29:35.920
he backs up clear. What's a matter?

508
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.290
It's a matter of buddy. Do you know? I um, um,

509
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:44.550
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

510
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.540
<v 2>somebody had cleo. Who's here? Cleo. Who's here?</v>

511
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.570
Who she had cleo. Huh? Do you want to eat somebody?

512
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.540
You wagon, you Taylor. You never know. All right buddy. Relax.

513
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.110
Now they got you all amped up, huh?

514
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.110
Nia said somebody here.

515
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

516
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.180
<v 2>Yeah. You know what's funny about being married?</v>

517
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.330
Aside from the fact that you got a whisper on your own podcast sometimes just to

518
00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:22.440
make your day easier. It's just the ups and downs. You know what I mean?

519
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.650
He can see it in your wife's eyes some days she knows why she married you,

520
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.420
married you, and then other days she's like,

521
00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:31.020
what the fuck did I hitch my wagon to? And I know it's early.

522
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.190
I know it's early in the day,

523
00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:33.690
but I'm feeling like it's going to be one of those.

524
00:30:33.691 --> 00:30:37.590
What the fuck did I marry day Cleo? Get up here. Come here. Get up here.

525
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.930
Come on. How are you buddy? Huh? Leon,

526
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.720
could you lead it? Thank you. Jesus. Do you do anything easy? Dude?

527
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.890
Fucking thing just collapses down on me. Um,

528
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.970
we'll do your homework, man. All right. Let's, uh,

529
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.810
let's read a couple of questions here for this week. Was anything else? Oh,

530
00:31:00.811 --> 00:31:02.940
I don't know. I was talking about celebrities.

531
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

532
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.050
<v 2>Talking about fucking candidates. It's like, why the fuck do you think I need?</v>

533
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.540
Like I'm undecided and then like,

534
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:15.370
the guy who created jag comes on TV or like one of the stars.

535
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.023
<v 3>Okay.</v>

536
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:21.080
<v 2>You know, they're always out there fucking, I don't, what do they do?</v>

537
00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:24.080
What are you doing? You're an actor. You're a writer.

538
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.260
The fuck do you know about running the country? Shut up.

539
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.090
Stop ruining the candidate that I like.

540
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.103
<v 3>Right.</v>

541
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.290
<v 2>I like Bernie Sanders because he reminds me of an old fucking club owner that I</v>

542
00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:43.500
had. And when he'd get, when he gets mad and he starts screaming and yelling,

543
00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:47.520
this is clip of him yelling at Alan Greenspan when they was running the Federal

544
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.170
Reserve and it's a classic fucking clip put on the fucking Internet.

545
00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:54.930
There were like Bernie Sanders tastes to fucking, you know,

546
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.720
whatever the fucking guy from, uh, the, the, the big bank there. I just set it.

547
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.540
The Federal Reserve. Yeah. It takes them to task. Right?

548
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.790
So he's reading the Guy the riot act,

549
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.860
and it's just amazing clip and right when it goes for the other guy to respond,

550
00:32:10.861 --> 00:32:13.680
the fucking thing ends. It's like, why? I want to hear with the other guy said,

551
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.670
why am I yelling this week? I want to hear what the other guy says.

552
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.393
<v 3>You know</v>

553
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.110
<v 2>what kind of a fucking dope just watches that clip and then doesn't try to find,</v>

554
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.900
you know what the guy from the Federal Reserve set.

555
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.130
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

556
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.950
<v 2>All right. You guys should at least be able to, to, you know,</v>

557
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.100
point counterpoint. It's kind of like that country. Send me that thing.

558
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:36.431
Look good.

559
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.980
Do your homework or you just sends me the thing from the fucking New York Times.

560
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.070
I like the New York Times,

561
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.930
but I would never just read something that they said and be all well, well,

562
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.440
there you go. Shit. So all I need to know. Doesn't that right, Cleo?

563
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.670
Well, actually I went to the mic.

564
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.810
I've been really doing really good about keeping my energy low,

565
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.290
trying to around the dog, um, to get her to be a little more,

566
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.100
a little more mellow. Yours.

567
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:05.650
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

568
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:10.360
<v 2>try and do eat the guest. Um, am I torturing you guys with the fucking thing?</v>

569
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.100
You know what? That's the only Coldplay song I know.

570
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.840
I know that some other ones, I go see those guys in concert.

571
00:33:16.841 --> 00:33:20.590
You know what I mean? I'm watching some soccer moms losing their fucking minds.

572
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.173
Huh?

573
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.680
Doing some fucking dance moves from the fucking, well, wait a minute.

574
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.890
There actually be younger than me. The hell am I talking about?

575
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.790
I think I need to shut the fuck up. You know, I think in general,

576
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.730
I think general bill. Thank you gentlemen. You might need to shut the fuck up.

577
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.430
Um, no, I'm actually psyched because, uh,

578
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:44.600
I was trying to write this thing and I just kept procrastinating. All right,

579
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.160
Cleo, I'll see ya. Um, I kept procrastinating.

580
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:51.290
I finally just said fuck it. And uh,

581
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.150
I just broke it down into three segments and over the course of like four days,

582
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:58.190
I was able to finish it and now it's fucking done.

583
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.540
And it's like this giant weight off my chest and I don't have to do shit today.

584
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.490
And, uh,

585
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.230
<v 3>okay.</v>

586
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.440
<v 2>Oh, you know what? I'm going to do today.</v>

587
00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:11.640
I'm actually bringing my truck over my old truck. I, I found this, um,

588
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.740
this, uh, spare tire assembly, you know, a lot of them don't have it.

589
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:18.670
Um,

590
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.050
or at least my didn't have and I was able to find it was off this guy's f two 50

591
00:34:22.051 --> 00:34:24.690
that he was gonna fix up. I just kept offering him money for it. He goes, no,

592
00:34:24.691 --> 00:34:27.870
I don't want to get rid of it. And I finally way over paid for it. I got it.

593
00:34:27.871 --> 00:34:30.200
And they, uh, powder-coated it,

594
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.210
whatever the fuck that means to match didn't match my truck and everything.

595
00:34:33.211 --> 00:34:33.691
So finally,

596
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:36.720
I'm actually gonna have a spare tire underneath the fucking thing the way it's

597
00:34:36.721 --> 00:34:40.890
supposed to. And I'm like, that's my fucking day.

598
00:34:40.891 --> 00:34:42.420
That's all I gotta do today. You know why?

599
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.270
Cause I sat down and I got that fucking thing done.

600
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:49.410
Although the door locks at my fucking house, I still haven't done,

601
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:54.300
I bought the shit premium paint remover and epoxy remover,

602
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:56.400
whatever the fuck that is. I got my little brush.

603
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.590
I'm going to try and get that fucking lockout today.

604
00:34:58.591 --> 00:35:01.920
Cause I told you I got this old ass house as I've mentioned a zillion times,

605
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:05.820
and I wanted the interior door locks to work because I think it would be fucking

606
00:35:05.821 --> 00:35:09.060
hilarious if when I left one time,

607
00:35:09.061 --> 00:35:13.290
if I locked all the fucking doors in the house and then somebody broke into my

608
00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:16.560
house and every fucking room they had to like try to break down another door,

609
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.890
they just got to turn it into just like, fuck man, it's doors locked.

610
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.640
Let's go around the other side. Fuck you know, 10 minutes in.

611
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.170
Then not even trying to be quiet. And we were like, dude,

612
00:35:25.171 --> 00:35:28.410
what the fuck the fuck is going on in that? Right. And then,

613
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.850
then he goes in and I just have, you know,

614
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.250
a bunch of fucking hats and teach free tee shirts from fucking comedy shows.

615
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:40.951
You know,

616
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:45.210
there's such a f an intelligence to just not having really anything of value in

617
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:47.250
your house. You know what I mean?

618
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.420
I've got a couple of fucking like antique tables and shit like that stuff that I

619
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:51.991
kind of liked.

620
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:56.340
But who the fuck's going to steal that little cat Virgo coming out with a

621
00:35:56.341 --> 00:36:01.070
fucking table on his back? You know, they liked the fucking, uh,

622
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:05.250
they like the little shit. They'd come in wearing their yoga pants, right.

623
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.960
Rappelling down from the fucking roof.

624
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.350
I just think it would be hilarious who's getting who the ultimate thing is is

625
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.550
you had like security in your fucking house, right? And somebody comes in,

626
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.640
right? And they get to that certain point.

627
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.550
I know I've seen this in movies and they'll all of a sudden there's just that

628
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:22.770
metal thing comes down so then they can't leave.

629
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:27.540
Just frightened to sit in their fucking panicking. You know what I mean?

630
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.730
I always thought that that would be great.

631
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:33.330
And then like I was thinking like in like a giant room, right?

632
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:34.590
When they're in the living room with some shit,

633
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:37.150
like all of a sudden they can't fucking get out and they're freaking out then

634
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:41.010
then just sit in there and they think worst case scenario is that the cops have

635
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:44.460
shown up and they're going to get fucking arrested and they're kind of mentally

636
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:48.900
giving themselves into that. And then you just like, you have like a Cobra,

637
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.500
right? And you just fucking let it in the room. You know, generally speaking,

638
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:55.860
those things aren't that fast. You just have it just, just,

639
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.550
maybe you defang the fucking thing. Well that's not, that's cruel dd animals.

640
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:03.300
Right? But it's a reptile. They're not really animals. Right? Um, no, you don't.

641
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.870
You just let the fucking thing come in the SD show in the hood.

642
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.350
Nobody can fucking hiss like a goddamn reptile man.

643
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.250
You have gone to those alligator farms. Are you down in Florida?

644
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.460
You know what I mean? And you're the, first of all,

645
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:19.020
you're looking at the people who go in there and like, dude,

646
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:23.100
half of these people have murdered somebody and fed their victim to one of these

647
00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:24.760
fucking things. I mean, just Florida is just,

648
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.250
especially in the northern part of Florida, I mean,

649
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.310
it just gets really fucking shady. Um,

650
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.440
but when you get those fucking things, when they hit each other, Jesus Christ,

651
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.130
I mean it just taps into back.

652
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.160
I get that just shit that's left over from when you were a caveman,

653
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.170
you know what I mean? Like, just like, I can't even explain it.

654
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:48.360
Like when I went, I was, what the fuck was I?

655
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.740
I can't remember. I went to a classic one too.

656
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.040
I think it was just outside of Tampa. No, maybe not. So I ramped the road. No,

657
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.450
in Miami or just south.

658
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.590
It's that one that has the alligator mouth that you will walk right into. Right.

659
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.840
And I heard that thing fucking hiss. And Dude,

660
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.780
from that tip of my head to the end of my toe, a tip of my toes,

661
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.410
the top of my head, it fucked it up. It just went just fucking like,

662
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.790
I can't explain the feeling. Just that,

663
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.080
that feeling when you lean back in a chair and you almost fall like my entire

664
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:16.914
body did that.

665
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.380
And the thing was way far away from me and I knew logically that it couldn't get

666
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:22.920
to me.

667
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.420
But I still think that from all those years of when we just walked around living

668
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:30.750
in caves, that your body's just still trained.

669
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.750
That if it hears that fucking noise there reminds me when I saw this three towed

670
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.260
slot from one time I was in Costa Rica, right.

671
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.920
And we'd taken the zip line tour. Um,

672
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.290
it was like the most northern tip of, of the fucking rain forest and the guide,

673
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.040
you know, these fucking trees were unbelievable. It was like, we were like,

674
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:57.910
it felt like we were 150 feet in the air and we weren't even mid tree.

675
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.340
You looked up, it was like another 300 feet above you.

676
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:03.850
It was fucking unbelievable. It was a, uh,

677
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.690
other than the fact that we were there, you know,

678
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.940
doing a zip line tour and shit and had cell phones and stuff.

679
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:13.010
It was a fucking paradise. So this guy did it everyday,

680
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.770
so he knew with his three towed sloths was,

681
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:19.720
and he looked up and he made this noise of a, I forget what the bird is called.

682
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.280
It's not an albatross, but it does begin with an a and as a giant wingspan.

683
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.270
And did not even in that area anymore because we killed all of them.

684
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.500
But to this day, he imitates in the second he fucking imitated the thing,

685
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.070
the fucking three towed slots just like got up and started fucking looking

686
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.370
around and then look down at us like, dude, what the fuck? You know,

687
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.820
just be like, dude, don't do that. It's not funny. Right.

688
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:48.190
Cause I guess those birds are so fucking big that they would swoop down into the

689
00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:50.440
trees and with their talents,

690
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:55.240
they would just fucking just basically grab these fucking monkeys and just yank

691
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.160
them out of the tree and you're just completely fucked.

692
00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.413
<v 3>Okay.</v>

693
00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.770
<v 2>Jesus Christ, those poor things, man. What a fucking way to go.</v>

694
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.630
Imagine me and that fucking slow. Actually I can, I'm a classic White Guy.

695
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.250
Can't jump, can't fucking run fast. None of that shit. Right. Um,

696
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:10.830
<v 3>okay.</v>

697
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:15.670
<v 2>Doesn't understand dancing, um, by men anyways. Um,</v>

698
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.060
um, then I don't even care if you're good at it.

699
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.130
I don't care if you're good at it. I just don't get it.

700
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:29.700
It just makes me laugh when I see a man dancing. It just makes me fucking laugh.

701
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:30.390
I'm sorry.

702
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.810
It's really immature and I and I need to grow up when it comes to that,

703
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:35.460
but I'm just, I'm just being honest. So anyways,

704
00:40:35.461 --> 00:40:40.461
I just can't imagine being that fucking thing like his slow and is fucking awful

705
00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:43.600
as I am. I just can't imagine if there was, can you imagine it?

706
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.640
There's just some giant burden you are on it's fucking menu and you lived

707
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:52.641
outside in fucking trees where birds are Jesus fucking Christ and you want to

708
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:57.330
times, you just sit in there as a tree towed slots, just chilling,

709
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.270
talking to a buddy of yours going like, hey man,

710
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:02.670
what do you think in the next couple of days? Maybe a

711
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.340
<v 7>no, no, you could,</v>

712
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.980
<v 2>yeah, your buddy is sitting there talking to you and be like,</v>

713
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:11.600
<v 3>okay,</v>

714
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.433
<v 2>oh man.</v>

715
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:18.060
Maybe like maybe like next Thursday it's Thursday and I'll start this fucking

716
00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:23.000
thing just grabs your friend in it.

717
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.430
You think your friend is just fucking gone. Just go on.

718
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.890
You just see it disappear.

719
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.980
What about monkeys doing [inaudible] and then you're

720
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.970
<v 0>fucking sitting there.</v>

721
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

722
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.990
<v 0>Like what the fuck? Right? Your heart racing. Like he just did some blow.</v>

723
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.990
But you only got the speed of a fucking three toed sloth

724
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.340
and you just sit there with the other three toed slough doing what?

725
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.770
Just looking at each other like, you know, thank God that wasn't me,

726
00:41:55.771 --> 00:41:58.110
but what the fuck? Please make it quick.

727
00:41:58.111 --> 00:42:01.380
Just fucking sliced it things neck already. Sorry man.

728
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.730
He's had a lot of empathy when I saw that. The way that fucking,

729
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.480
it's almost like you had to see the fucking things face when he made that noise.

730
00:42:09.481 --> 00:42:12.120
When he fucking looked around and looked down and saw that it was us,

731
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.640
he should have seen the look on this fucking thing face. It was just like,

732
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:19.050

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.660
but you don't want to go to the grocery store.

776
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:51.960
You don't wanna have to fucking deal with all that shit, right?

777
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.480
But you need to know how to cook. Not only do you need a,

778
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:56.850
not only do you feel like you know your way around the kitchen,

780
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.880
But cooking at home means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering

781
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:09.150
expensive. Take out again, but where do you start?

Spiced salmon with black rice, avocado and blood orange salad.

792
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.200
I didn't know it was a such thing as black rice.

793
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.530
I knew that was brown rice and white rice, right?

Korean Americans, Korean Koreans, South Koreans, North Koreans, Huh?

800
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.850
I wouldn't do that to you in North Korea. I wouldn't do that to you.

801
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.160
Fucking boss's son. There's not letting you have any food. Right?

802
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.160

809
00:46:48.921 --> 00:46:51.960
that's fucking great man. Bring it right to your goddamn door.

810
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.680
They show you how to cook it. You learn how to cook a little bit, you know,

811
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:57.690
eat healthy. Stomach gets flat, you know,

812
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.970
and next thing you know you get somebody's device and fucking chocolate

813
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:03.780
strawberries for. All right, let's get to the questions for this week.

814
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.670
Okay. Trusting water. A Billie filter face.

815
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.290
I like that one a don't trust drinking water.

816
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.860
I don't trust drinking water. He goes, my friends think I'm nuts.

817
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.790
They always point to the fact that public drinking water is tested time and time

818
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:23.520
again. Now there's Flint, Michigan fiasco,

819
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.420
a its surface that officials lied about testing,

820
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.100
did slow drip tests from faucets in order

821
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.580
<v 2>to get lower levels of whatever horse shit shouldn't have been there to begin</v>

822
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:37.720
with and even wrote it off because most complaints weren't were coming from

823
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:41.200
minorities. Dude, how do you do that and go to sleep at night?

824
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.700
How do you do that? How do those companies do that? Fracking,

825
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.370
and I'm not saying I don't know anything about fracking, but you know,

826
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:51.340
I've seen that in some cases it's fucked up. The drinking water.

827
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:55.270
How do you not go, oh my God, we fucked up. What do we do here?

828
00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.080
Oh my God, we like sat in fact up. I'm the worst, but I'm, how do you,

829
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.430
I don't know. I fuck you do it.

830
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:05.730
The best water comes in glass and it's fresh from a natural spring that doesn't

831
00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:10.060
neighbor a dow chemical plant. I stick to this as much as possible.

832
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:11.560
I know I'm not nuts.

833
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.740
I saw a civil action with John Travolta in the theater once I saw, oh,

834
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.780
he's about 20 years ago and it's hired me sense.

835
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.950
What's your level of trust when it comes to water and what kind of water do you

836
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:28.570
drink? Thanks for the Thursday podcast. Love the music. Uh, that's Andrew.

837
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.650
Fabulous. Um, go check. Go check in on yourself.

838
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.720
<v 4>All right. Uh,</v>

839
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.230
<v 2>I dunno what is my feelings on it? Um, yeah, it's probably a scam or whatever.</v>

840
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.970
I really feel that I try to be as healthy as I can.

841
00:48:45.971 --> 00:48:49.460
I have this weird thing where, you know,

842
00:48:49.461 --> 00:48:51.680
I'm trying to be healthy and live as long as I can.

843
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:56.710
While I also feel that like most people on earth dying would be a great thing.

844
00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.913
<v 4>Um,</v>

845
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.770
<v 2>because I just think we're, yeah, we're just putting too much stress on all the,</v>

846
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.130
on the natural resources. I believe that personally I do now,

847
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.180
have I read enough? No. Do I know what I'm talking about? No,

848
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.220
it's just what I do. What you guys do.

849
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.020
I get a little bit of information and I just run with it and my brain. Um,

850
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.280
and then someone reprimands me on fucking Twitter, do your homework, me. And,

851
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.340
um, I actually had an acting gig with one person one time and they,

852
00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:33.320
they, they actually got their water delivered. Um,

853
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.950
and rather than being in those giant plastic fucking things that you gotta tip

854
00:49:36.951 --> 00:49:40.550
upside down, they actually were in glass. Um,

855
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.880
which anything tastes better in a glass? It always does.

856
00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:47.240
Beer in a bottle tastes better than beer and a can. Personally I feel it does.

857
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.800
Um, but as far as where they get the water,

858
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:57.870
I don't think it matters as long as they fucking treat it right. Does it?

859
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.520
I it can't. I don't know. I don't fucking though. I have no idea.

860
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:05.110
I try to drink water as much as I can when I'm not fucking booze and, but uh,

861
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.580
no, I don't have any faith

862
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.290
<v 4>in anything anymore. I, I don't,</v>

863
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:15.090
<v 2>I went to this little fancy fucking pet store today to get my dog some food and</v>

864
00:50:15.091 --> 00:50:18.390
they were like, are you in our system? And I'm like, no, I'm not. And they go,

865
00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:20.730
okay, just so you know, whenever you want to be in the system,

866
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.660
will you get a 5% discount every time? And I just want to be like, yeah,

867
00:50:24.661 --> 00:50:25.560
and what do you get out of it?

868
00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.040
<v 4>What do get out of it? You know</v>

869
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.790
<v 2>you sell my fucking information to somebody and it go, well, no we don't.</v>

870
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.910
Well I know you don't. Why would you do that?

871
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:38.150
Why would you just give me a 5% fucking discount forever?

872
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.870
That means you read them marking the shit up. There's no fucking way.

873
00:50:43.871 --> 00:50:48.120
Nobody goes out of their way to fucking make 5% less on some shit. You know,

874
00:50:48.121 --> 00:50:52.070
forever. I could say, hey, we're having a sale. You get people in there at a,

875
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.600
they kind of get used to going into the store and then you phase it out.

876
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.040
You get 5% off every fucking time. You know?

877
00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.330
I think being a paranoid con works. It really does.

878
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.640
Except sometimes in relationships it isn't.

879
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.020
<v 0>I said he was just a guy at the post office.</v>

880
00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:15.700
I gave him the mail. I'm all right, turn up turn offs. Hey Billy buttercup.

881
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:20.280
<v 2>My friend and I were having a discussion about what turns us off about girls,</v>

882
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.440
the usual gross things and physical appearance. Things came up. A I threw out,

883
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.610
I threw out there. Yeah,

884
00:51:26.611 --> 00:51:31.230
and I hate it when girls throw themselves at you with the disclaimer that if

885
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.810
you're, if you're a quality,

886
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:37.530
if you're equally as into the girl, it's not a problem.

887
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.820
What do you think about this isn't me or does it feel weird when a girl just

888
00:51:41.821 --> 00:51:44.100
puts it all out that out there,

889
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.880
you said out that out there and starts casually mentioning her badge cause she

890
00:51:49.891 --> 00:51:51.810
thinks it's going to interest you or something.

891
00:51:51.811 --> 00:51:55.290
Some of my friends thought I was nuts. The other sort of agree,

892
00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.370
thanks and go crush yourself. Um,

893
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.243
<v 3>okay.</v>

894
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.890
<v 2>It all depends. It all depends on the, on the person,</v>

895
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.630
you know what I mean? Generally speaking,

896
00:52:06.631 --> 00:52:10.710
if you just meet somebody you know and you have no idea who they are and they

897
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:14.010
just start throwing themselves at you, you know, and you look how I look,

898
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:18.750
you like, ah, I don't think this is their first Rodeo. It makes me nervous.

899
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.200
That would make me very nervous as far as like a, what's that beach?

900
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:29.370
<v 0>We saw him. She's been around all over town. Oral</v>

901
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.350
[inaudible]. Um, I would, uh, yeah,

902
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.890
<v 2>yeah, I can see what that would, that would freak you out. But if I'm</v>

903
00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.653
<v 3>okay,</v>

904
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.570
<v 2>you know, I don't know. She's like in her thirties and she's just like, look,</v>

905
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:48.404
I'm okay.

906
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.280
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

907
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.870
<v 2>You know, I'm not looking for a relationship. Just want to kind of, yeah. Okay.</v>

908
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.020
<v 0>It's going to be fuck buddies here. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

909
00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.160
Went on fucking that's what I do too. I go, yeah.

910
00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:01.570
You know that always turns the ladies on nothing gets them turned on like crack

911
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.180
on your voice. Yeah. Does that feel good?

912
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:09.820
<v 2>Um, that just made me completely think what,</v>

913
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.060
forget what I was going to say. Oh fuck. I had a funny story too.

914
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.050
God dammit.

915
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:16.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

916
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:17.930
<v 2>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh yeah. You know,</v>

917
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:22.850
I don't like when women try to be dominant either. You know what I mean?

918
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.880
<v 0>I just, I don't know. They fucking,</v>

919
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.750
they get on top of you and the like grabbing your wrists and they got this

920
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:32.700
stupid look on their face and you just thinking like, you know,

921
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:35.580
if I wanted to I could just throw you off the bed. Not for nothing,

922
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.080
but if you're into it, um, yeah. I understand what you're saying here. Uh,

923
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:41.363
if,

924
00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.270
<v 3>okay.</v>

925
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:47.410
<v 0>It's all how they do it. If they just coming up confident in their rent to you.</v>

926
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.740
Yeah. But if they just start talking about their fucking who, Huh? Yeah.

927
00:53:50.741 --> 00:53:52.810
A lot of it is the same. It'd be like for a woman,

928
00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:56.280
if a guy just came out and he just flops his dick on the bar. Ah,

929
00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.240
who wants it come again. Um, yeah,

930
00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:04.570
I would think that would turn anybody off. All right. Global warming scam.

931
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.113
<v 3>Okay.</v>

932
00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.540
<v 0>Um, all right. Global warming scam. Okay. This is like a,</v>

933
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.780
some that people keep sending me, um,

934
00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:19.130
and they keep sending it to me as if my opinion has any sort of scientific

935
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:23.300
background. I'm just basing it on scientists.

936
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:26.750
That's all I'm basing it on.

937
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.560
And that fucking two and a half times the size of Texas and two miles deep swirl

938
00:54:33.051 --> 00:54:35.570
of garbage in the fucking Pacific Ocean.

939
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:40.850
That how just about every fish has some degree of plastic in their fucking

940
00:54:40.851 --> 00:54:44.630
system. Uh, okay. But even number, none of that has to do with temperature.

941
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:45.710
I love his show.

942
00:54:45.711 --> 00:54:49.100
It's really refreshing to hear someone in show business actually talk about some

943
00:54:49.101 --> 00:54:53.660
very important social pertinent things. When the fuck do I ever do that?

944
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:57.500
Like what? Football? Three toad slots

945
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.630
flopping your Dick on the Barth. This, these are important to you.

946
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.860
I agree with everything you talk about on your show. I don't need you to,

947
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.460
he goes except or she says he or she accept global warming.

948
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.180
The global warming scam is another system of control.

949
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.870
I agree. We should stop using oil and coal.

950
00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:21.640
These carbon sources are highly polluting and release toxins and mercury into

951
00:55:21.641 --> 00:55:25.090
the biosphere, but this has nothing to do with global warming.

952
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.410
I know you love documentaries at God. Can,

953
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:32.110
can you guys just and my mom take it in a country way.

954
00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:35.050
I know you love documentaries. God knows you don't read.

955
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:40.240
Now he's probably right. Uh, look up global warming swindle on Youtube,

956
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.350
a little taste into global warming, the global warming rat hole.

957
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:49.450
There's a ton of other information on the web that exposes this bullshit scam.

958
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:54.490
Good luck. And looking forward to hear what you have to say about this. See,

959
00:55:54.491 --> 00:55:55.690
I don't get that.

960
00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:01.690
I'm supposed to just look up a bunch of shit that all agrees with the other side

961
00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:04.180
and then the other side's wrong. That's like me saying to you,

962
00:56:04.181 --> 00:56:07.930
look up all these shit about global warming and how we're affecting the climate

963
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:12.130
and I'm looking forward to see what you have to say. Um,

964
00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:17.530
I would think that, uh,

965
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.440
the fact that in France,

966
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.780
all the leaders of the world just got together with all these scientists and all

967
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:33.781
that and even on the right they for has been saying it's bullshit from day one.

968
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:38.980
From day one they were saying it's fucking bullshit. Um,

969
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:43.030
even they finally came out and they said, yeah, it's, we are affecting it.

970
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.480
And then they were like, but it's too late to do anything now. Like,

971
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:50.020
that's what they came out with. So why would they be doing that?

972
00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.393
<v 3>Okay.</v>

973
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.180
<v 0>Why would they, why? Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.</v>

974
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.570
You're saying that they're doing it to try to control us.

975
00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.900
It's such a long way to go, isn't it? Okay.

976
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.810
They just control this by scaring the shit out of us. The normal way. Like, oh,

977
00:57:06.811 --> 00:57:09.810
there's this group of people that doesn't have planes or a boat and they're

978
00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:14.040
coming over here to get us like they'd been doing for 15 fucking years.

979
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.950
Can't they just do that? Um, I'll watch those things, but I will,

980
00:57:18.951 --> 00:57:23.790
I would like to know who paid for those who finance those documentaries.

981
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.380
Because if they're companies that are getting attacked for it, you know,

982
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.810
there's obviously, you know,

983
00:57:30.811 --> 00:57:33.620
getting attacked for the pollutants that they're putting into the atmosphere and

984
00:57:33.621 --> 00:57:35.070
then, you know, they could be gone. Well,

985
00:57:35.071 --> 00:57:39.480
we need to get this off of us by putting the real information out there.

986
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.600
But generally speaking, I is a rule.

987
00:57:42.601 --> 00:57:46.050
I don't believe corporations, I just don't,

988
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.700
people in general, I mean, I'm full of Shit, right?

989
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.030
Why the fuck would I believe? I'll watch it. You know what?

990
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.510
I hope you know what? This is a thing. I actually hope you're right.

991
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.020
Cause then I get to have a lot less guilt and just go out and buy some fucking

992
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.880
Goddamn v eight man. Get out there and fucking drive around.

993
00:58:02.881 --> 00:58:03.870
There's some doubts.

994
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.180
A PS global warming carbon credits are controlled by the same crooked bankers

995
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:12.170
that are fucking up the world economy. Well,

996
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.370
I kinda think like the bankers don't, they control everything.

997
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.750
They kind of own everything, right?

998
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:20.010
Are we still making payments on the White House? Do they have to refinance that?

999
00:58:20.011 --> 00:58:23.310
I know it burned down in the 18 hundreds who knows? I'm new girlfriend.

1000
00:58:23.311 --> 00:58:27.180
Bullied by friends. Girlfriend. Okay,

1001
00:58:27.181 --> 00:58:29.100
so your new chick gets bullied by

1002
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.280
WHO's from Atlanta. I guess I've got to read it. All right.

1003
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:37.690
I wanted your advice on something minor yet difficult for me to figure out on

1004
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:41.320
how to approach. I've just done pretty well for myself. Getting a bug,

1005
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:43.630
beautiful girl recently,

1006
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:48.130
like she's physically attractive and has an ass I could balance a beer on.

1007
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.070
Good for you anyway. Our friend,

1008
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:54.970
our friend group is a pretty good size even though some of our friends have

1009
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:59.410
moved 30 minutes to an hour away, but a problem came up recently.

1010
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:04.770
A friend of mine from out of town recently came by with his girlfriend and after

1011
00:59:05.111 --> 00:59:06.160
a night out of drinking,

1012
00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:11.161
my girlfriend informed me his girlfriend bullied her and treated her like shit

1013
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:16.150
in high school. All right, well that was a long time ago. Oh,

1014
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.490
that's the next thing he goes. I told her that was a long time ago.

1015
00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:22.070
That's what I want to say. He goes, we're 20 now and that

1016
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.260
<v 2>she shouldn't, should try to approach her too.</v>

1017
00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:28.310
Which you applied that when the girl in question said hello to me,

1018
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.010
she looked at her and just walked away.

1019
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:32.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1020
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.260
<v 2>Totally. That was a long time ago. Wait,</v>

1021
00:59:34.261 --> 00:59:38.880
wait and that she should approach her to which my girlfriend applied that when

1022
00:59:38.881 --> 00:59:42.150
the girl in question said hello to me,

1023
00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.040
she looked at her and just walked away.

1024
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:45.563
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.510
<v 2>Wait, who walked away?</v>

1026
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.890
Then when the girl in question said hello to me.

1027
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:55.283
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1028
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.720
<v 2>dude, I dunno who's saying what here.</v>

1029
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.310
She also told me her high school was quite small and the girl in question and

1030
01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:03.870
many others made it hell for her.

1031
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:07.440
Here's my question for the freckled Fucko of La.

1032
01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.740
How would you approach this situation? Keep in mind,

1033
01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:15.300
I'm not the best of buds with the dude. We're just in the same friend circle.

1034
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:20.420
Well, what happened? You're 26. You probably going to see her like what?

1035
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:24.520
Once every couple of fucking weeks. Yeah, I don't,

1036
01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:25.750
I don't think it's a problem.

1037
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:27.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1038
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.530
<v 2>I, I would just look in and just be like, Hey,</v>

1039
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:33.940
can you stop fucking making a big deal out of nothing before I stick your

1040
01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:36.550
fucking head and I stick in a coward or you start bullying her.

1041
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.230
I Dunno what I would do. I would just be like, um,

1042
01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.730
yeah. I would just say, look, you're 26 years old.

1043
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.850
High school ended eight years ago. Um,

1044
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.230
I just let it go because she doesn't give a fuck.

1045
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:57.370
Bullies never remember this shit that they did to you and she's probably jealous

1046
01:00:57.371 --> 01:01:00.610
because you beautiful with an ass. She could balance a drink on, right.

1047
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.660
That's probably what it is. I Dunno.

1048
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.260
In the meantime, why don't you take some, a Jujitsu classes. Alright.

1049
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.030
Bul Israeli, a fucking martial arts.

1050
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.480
I always want to take that shit, you know,

1051
01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:20.570
a little Jujitsu and then that fucking Israel or whatever the Israeli martial

1052
01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:24.050
arts shit is the fuck is that shit called.

1053
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.550
I don't even fucking know. I, we should start like, that shit is just like,

1054
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:33.050
you know, because of the level, the stakes going on over there.

1055
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:35.990
Like this just, there's no, I guess they're all a fish.

1056
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:37.370
I don't know fucking shit about fighting,

1057
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.410
but I was just felt like that that would be the shit, you know,

1058
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:44.060
just because of where Israeli is and how they never have planes get hijacked or

1059
01:01:44.061 --> 01:01:45.830
anything. They just got shit on lockdown.

1060
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.230
You would think that their martial arts would, they would be,

1061
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.560
they would definitely be a lot of interesting,

1062
01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:53.630
I would think I gouging just fucking,

1063
01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.810
you take your fucking index and your middle finger and you just fucking,

1064
01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.080
they probably know how to do that. That macgruber throat snatch thing, you know,

1065
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.200
snatching throats. Um, anyways.

1066
01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:07.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1067
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.150
<v 2>Yeah. I don't know what to tell you. I'm not, I'm not good at that shit, dude.</v>

1068
01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.980
If you haven't noticed, I don't know a lot about women. I really don't like I,

1069
01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:18.820
I grew up, you know, uh, with way too many. It was,

1070
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.830
it not balanced. You know what I mean? It was not, uh,

1071
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.600
it was just fucking

1072
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.360
<v 3>okay.</v>

1073
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.100
<v 2>I Dunno to this stage, it's still, you know,</v>

1074
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:33.360
I had all brothers for the most part and then the dog in the dog was a fucking

1075
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.180
boy, you know what I mean? It was just total overload,

1076
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:39.120
a testosterone and then my mom and we lived up on a busy street,

1077
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:42.330
so we just all interacted with each other and um,

1078
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:45.610
<v 3>okay.</v>

1079
01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:49.210
<v 2>Yeah. This is one of those fucking, this is one of those,</v>

1080
01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.070
that's one of those chick moments where I'm just really bad. I'm just like, uh,

1081
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:55.950
well did she try to punch you? Did she ever beat you up before then?

1082
01:02:55.951 --> 01:03:00.690
Like what's the fucking problem? Just tell her to go fuck herself. Right.

1083
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:06.750
You don't want us to do, you know, can cause feel frustrating.

1084
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.580
I know, I know. It's not you. I know it's not you.

1085
01:03:08.581 --> 01:03:12.030
I know you're trying and I appreciate that. I just feel like,

1086
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.440
and they start talking to me and I sit there and I'm nodding and I'm listening

1087
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.330
and just over their shoulder,

1088
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:21.960
there's a TV with a game on and I start looking at it and looking at them.

1089
01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.213
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1090
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.880
<v 2>Starting like I'm rubbing my forehead, you know, blocking their view,</v>

1091
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.770
one of my eyes so I can look at the fucking TV.

1092
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:33.260
I start doing that shit and then eventually I get busted and then they get mad.

1093
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:35.720
You know what I mean? Um. Anyway,

1094
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.690
so if you would like to donate to this podcast, it's very easy to do.

1095
01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.720
It won't cost you any money. It just cards. She an extra couple of clicks,

1096
01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:45.480
CV index finger. You just go to [inaudible] dot com and a,

1097
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.320
you click on the podcast page, does it link to Amazon?

1098
01:03:48.321 --> 01:03:50.390
Next time you want to buy something on Amazon, you can do this.

1099
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:54.020
You just click on it. And I get credit for driving traffic to Amazon.

1100
01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:58.010
And what if you buy something? They kicked me a couple of bucks or whatever.

1101
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:59.170
And uh,

1102
01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:03.370
and then I used to kick it to this fucking charity that people sent me enough

1103
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.080
shit that said it was a scam. So now I give it to St Jude

1104
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.300
saying you [inaudible]. Um, that's what I try to do.

1105
01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.340
I give a portion of the proceeds. Well, what portion bill?

1106
01:04:16.341 --> 01:04:19.190
We talking like an NFL portion. No way better than the NFL.

1107
01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:24.150
I take 10% and I'd throw it to the fucking, uh, to St Jude's. Alright,

1108
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:26.900
that's pretty good, right? Considering fucking the NFL does what,

1109
01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:28.310
what do they do?

1110
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:32.690
They do like 3% of that hundred dollars Jersey and then they give it to the pink

1111
01:04:32.691 --> 01:04:37.490
lady so she can go out and get herself a pink Cadillac.

1112
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.850
All right, that's the podcast for this week. Everybody once again,

1113
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.540
congratulations to the, uh, Denver Broncos and pate man.

1114
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.520
It was so fucking great to see that guy go out of winter, man. Um,

1115
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:52.500
I did not want to see him, you know, you know what I mean?

1116
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.360
I don't know. I just, I didn't want to see him get fucked.

1117
01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:56.790
I didn't want to see me as fucking ass kicked to get on a Superbowl.

1118
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.410
I really did not want to see that. And I'm,

1119
01:04:58.411 --> 01:05:01.230
I could don't says to the panther fans, you know,

1120
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:06.060
you guys had a hell of a season. I'm riverboat. Ron. Is that his name?

1121
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:08.820
Someone's tweeting me. He said, is that the best fucking nickname and sports?

1122
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:10.500
I didn't even know the guy's name to be honest with you,

1123
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.110
but I saw him on the sideline at one point the second quarter.

1124
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.280
And I said to my buddy, I go,

1125
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:17.620
that guy looks like the winning coach of a super bowl. Um,

1126
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.270
that's what I felt like when I saw the guy.

1127
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:22.430
So obviously you guys are going to be back a blot of time.

1128
01:05:22.431 --> 01:05:24.730
She get there and you don't win it the first time.

1129
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.910
And then you remember what that feeling's like and then you come back and uh,

1130
01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.540
<v 4>I dunno, you guys should be all right. You'll get one right.</v>

1131
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.500
<v 2>We at all paint manic. He fucking hung in there.</v>

1132
01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:41.501
We got one John Elway came in now and this Denver's the fucking place to go for

1133
01:05:42.381 --> 01:05:45.860
old fucking quarterbacks to get one more. What do you guys think?

1134
01:05:45.861 --> 01:05:46.970
Do you think you were tires?

1135
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.300
<v 4>He should. He should. Yeah.</v>

1136
01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:53.180
<v 2>There's already rumors that he's going to be coming out here to the Los Angeles</v>

1137
01:05:53.181 --> 01:05:58.040
ramps. You know, which you'd be very Joe Nemeth. Joe Willie.

1138
01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:03.440
Joe Willie ended. That's actually, that's a good fucking quiz, Huh?

1139
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:08.950
He named hall of fame quarterbacks in teams that they ended with Joe name at the

1140
01:06:08.961 --> 01:06:13.550
end of what? The rams. Johnny John Unitas. Johnny Unitas ended with San Diego,

1141
01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.470
I believe.

1142
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.863
<v 4>Um,</v>

1143
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:19.340
<v 2>it's hard man.</v>

1144
01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.970
Once you think once they fucking disappear and they go off the fucking radar.

1145
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.330
<v 4>Let's pick another one here.</v>

1146
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.120
<v 2>Drew Bledsoe. Who did he finish with? Drew Bledsoe.</v>

1147
01:06:30.121 --> 01:06:30.990
Went to the bills.

1148
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.170
Then he went to the cowboys and I want to say he went somewhere else.

1149
01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.610
Brett Farve. Where did he add vikings.

1150
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:41.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1151
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.560
<v 2>Who was going to go to the vikings at the end of his career at the last second</v>

1152
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:48.730
said, fuck that. I'm not doing it. And was a smart move. I mentioned earlier,

1153
01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.730
Dan Marino, Dan Marino had an offer and he said, no, fuck it. I'm not doing it.

1154
01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:57.550
And what's great is all of his highlights. He's wearing the dolphins uniform.

1155
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.170
He doesn't have that sad,

1156
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.160
you know the last team I fucking played for uniform

1157
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.350
Emmett Smith. Where did he finish?

1158
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.103
<v 4>Huh?</v>

1159
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.610
<v 2>Arizona Franco Harris.</v>

1160
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.220
Seattle Seahawks.

1161
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:16.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1162
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:18.560
<v 2>You know what? I think I invented a good drinking game.</v>

1163
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.430
Might you just go through, then somebody's got to look it up.

1164
01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.750
Then that means somebody knows all the answers. You know what I think?

1165
01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:30.960
