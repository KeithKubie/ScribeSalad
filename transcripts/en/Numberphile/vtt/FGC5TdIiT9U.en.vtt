00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.520
[Music]

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.120
Alex: Hola, hola Brady.
Brady: Hola.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.020
Alex: Hola Brady, aqui el secencia, I think that's what sequence is in Spanish,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.160
de Bernardo Recamán who is a Colombian, a friend of mine actually. Hello Bernardo if you're watching

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.320
He is a teacher in Colombia and he invented the sequence called the Recamán sequence

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.220
which has got all the sequence people crazy because it's like really interesting and really fun.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.439
So it's really much easier to explain how this works on a number line.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.460
Okay, so just say this is naught and this is one two three

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.290
Four, okay, five...eleven twelve thirteen and we go on okay

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.210
So what we're gonna do we're gonna go in hops

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.200
We're going to start at zero and the first hop is one and then the next hop is two

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.400
Then the next hop is three.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.900
So each iteration you add one to the hop. Okay dead easy and the rule is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
"atrás siempre" always back

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.960
But if you can't go back because the number has already been used then you got to go forward

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.620
We start at zero, so then we add one, we hop one. One.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.229
I've got to go two we've got to go backwards

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.070
Can't go backwards, so got to go forwards. Two

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.000
Three. Can we go backwards? One, two, three? No

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.940
We can't do that. Yeah, so we gotta go forwards one, two, three. We got to get to here

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.380
Now four

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.160
One two three four--yeah. We can, so we can go back there. What about five?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.440
Well can't go back, so we have to go five. One, two, three, four five. Yep, and go there five

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.780
Six one two, three, four five six, no can't do that. So gotta go here. One, two, three, four five six

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.539
Okay, you can see how that's gonna go. We're kind of gonna do these little weave in and out

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.160
The question is, which is of interest and no one knows, is every number accounted for?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.040
So will this ultimately get in every number? And it's been tested up to some like some really high number

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.160
But testing it's not the same as proving it. It's assumed that this will this will be the case.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.820
Yeah. I think it's cause you've got to go back. So you're going back and you're kind of clearing up for yourself.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.879
Now what's interesting about this is because it's very very simple. You're just jumping backwards

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.080
and if you can't you go forward and you get this it's not chaotic, but it is...

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.300
It's ordered for a bit. Then it is a little bit, not all over the place. Then it gets ordered again.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.160
And this is easier to see rather than just looking at numbers.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.920
Visually, and aurally.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.900
Either with your eyes or with your ears.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.760
Edmund Harris the mathematical artist who I work with a lot has done this gorgeous representation.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.780
And to me this looks like you know in the 1950s and 60s you would get these

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.819
artists doing things that looked a bit like this.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.460
[Music]

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.560
Kind of bit geometrical but also you got something a bit human in it also.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.620
Brady: It looks like it should be a wallpaper in Mad Men.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.880
Alex: Yeah, definitely. It totally could, you've got that mixture of something,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.780
which is just a circle, you couldn't get more simple than that, and it's got circles of different sizes and they all fit in together nicely

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.060
But when you look in there's like a bit of a mess of how are they joining. There's a bit of chaos.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.760
It's standardly beautiful, but with a little bit of the unknown.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.280
[Music]

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.800
In fact, if you saw here, this bit here, where it starts off with a Loch Ness monster, and then doubles back and goes on

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.080
You've got that there. So the actual number line is the diagonal along here.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.460
Well what he's done, wherever you're joined, you actually have a proper semicircle. Whereas I've just done it with a sort of,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.540
I don't know what this is a kind of

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.200
human sort of grasping at a circle. Where as when you when you do it

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.380
And obviously, if it's a semicircle the radius is getting bigger. So the bit the bigger the size that the higher it's going to be.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.640
It's kind of getting bigger, but then it gets smaller again, but then he gets bigger and then it has getting smaller again

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.720
Brady: Where does it end? It jumps out here, but it ends over here somewhere.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.060
Alex: Yeah no, so we've got the end there. That would be because there you can't go back and so you'd have to go on here

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.240
And it's to keep it nice within the page looks like about a hundred that isn't it?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.860
I'll give a free book to whoever wants to tell me exactly where it ends. I'll give them a free book.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.700
Brady: They've got to buy the book to figure out where it ends.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.360
Alex: No, they don't even need to buy the book, they can make a screen grab of this

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.100
But the thing is, you actually want to have two of these books because you want one to color in and like ruin and make your own.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.680
And you want to have one to have the perfect image

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.360
Brady: By the way, I think Alex means he'll give a free book to the first person, not every person who does it.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.520
[laughter]

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.120
Brady: Giving out 300 thousand books.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.980
Alex: Yeah.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.560
Alex: I first heard about the Recamán sequence from Neil Sloan.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.800
And Neil Sloan is the guy who invented, who founded, who runs the online encyclopedia of integer sequences.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.380
And there are about 300,000 different sequences.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.060
And I said, can you give me some example of sequences that you really liked?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.060
And one of the very first ones that he said was the Recamán sequence, and I said "Why is that?"

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.220
He says because it has this interesting clash between order and chaos.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.100
And actually the best way to discover that is to listen to it, and on the online encyclopedia

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.340
there is, on each sequence, well most of the sequences, all the ones that I've looked at

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.500
There is a button, listen to, and if you want to listen to it you press it.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.700
So what it's gonna do, is that imagine on the number line

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.570
Here we've got the numbers

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.340
Imagine if this was a scale

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.760
So that was the bottom of the scale and then you go up each one is a semitone going up bum-bum-bum-bum

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.820
And you've got a sequence of I think it's six octaves, which is what most pianos might have.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.900
What you would do is that you would imagine that the first

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.879
Sort of six octaves, so 48 numbers are

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.320
These ones, going up.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.440
And then the next 48 go back to the bottom.

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.348
So what you do is that you are playing the sequence as if it is a piece of music

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.479
Every number the sequence comes exactly one after the next. It's not syncopated. It's like bang bang bang bang bang. One, two, three, four five six

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.420
That's the world's most boring sequence. just goes 1,2,3,4,5

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.460
What you're gonna get is the scale [rising in pitch] doo doo doo doo doo doo

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.960
When you get to the top: [falling in pitch] doo doo doo

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.500
It goes grgrggrhrgh. I go at the bottom again, then carry on going up, really boring.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:55.300
[notes with steady increase in pitch]

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.400
[sharp fall then steady increase again]

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.480
If you're gonna do the sequence which is one-two, one-two, one-two, that's gonna be duh-nuh duh-nuh duh-nuh

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.680
[rapid oscillation between two pitches]

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.340
This interesting sequence, and how it sounds, and then we're gonna think, well why is that interesting? And I have it prepared here

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.960
Brady: So here we go we're gonna listen-
Alex: Just downloaded it.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:30.060
[Rapid, somewhat chaotic notes with quick bursts of short-lived patterns]

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.540
Alex: It sounds like someone is playing it

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.140
[strange notes continue]

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.000
And, you've got lots of things going on.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.820
You can see at the same time it's going up, but then it's going down.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.300
Then there's a bit that feels kind of like order, we know where it's going.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.620
And all of a sudden, just out of the blue and it's all a bit discordant.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.880
[rapid switching between pitches]

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.140
I don't know, it's going up, it's going down and it's you know, it gives you the the chills.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.700
Brady: What does it remind you of?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.940
Alex: It reminds me of a horror movie or something that you know, maybe someone's going into a room.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.929
They gotta find something and you're supposed to be feeling nervous and tense and you'd be listening to that.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.090
There is something that feels there's a human hand behind it, but there is no human hand.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.250
We've got this incredibly simple rule, which is just back, but if you can't go back go forward

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.410
And also the obviously the distances between the numbers are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.020
[notes seem to fall into flourishing pattern]

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
There's a little twiddle there, where did that come from?

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.380
Brady: Now if you're anything like me

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.620
This video is gonna have sparked even more questions in your mind. And if that's the kind of person you are

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.800
Maybe you should check out today's sponsor: Brilliant.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:56.560

And everything on brilliant is guided by eight principles. You can see them here and there at number eight last but definitely not least:

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.460
Sparks questions

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.520
It says the culmination of a great education isn't knowing all the answers, it's knowing what to ask.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.100
And I don't think there's anything truer than that.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.640
If you'd like to go and check out Brilliant, I really recommend that I especially like their kind of puzzle of the week. What have we got this week?

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:36.289
There's basic intermediate and advanced. The basic one this week's really fun. It involves this rotating rod and light being flashed on it

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.380
I recommend going and having a look.
