00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.266
- [Voiceover] So we've
got an equation here,

00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.433
it says five times x minus three

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:09.321
is equal to four times x plus three.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.867
So, what we want to do
is we want to figure out

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:13.234
an x that satisfies this,
so there's some number

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.233
that if I take five,
multiply it by that number,

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:17.533
subtract three from it, that's going to be

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.166
the same thing as if I
take four times that number

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.101
and add three to it.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.402
And, before we go into how to
solve these types of things,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.433
let's just first see
if we can test whether

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:32.066
something does satisfy this equation.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.900
And so, I have three options
here, I have x could be

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.933
equal to five, x could be equal to six,

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.966
and x could be equal to seven.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.700
And your goal is to pause
this video and figure out

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
which of these x's
satisfies this equation,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.366
which of these values would
make this equation be true.

00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:55.700
So, I'm assuming that you have tried that,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.033
so let's work through each
of them, step one by one.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.333
So let's see this first
one: if x is equal to five,

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.933
then in order for this to
be true, five time five,

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:10.666
right, five times x, so
five times five minus three

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.533
needs to be equal to four
times, everywhere we see

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.066
an x we're going to put a five there,

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.666
four times, actually
let me do it this way.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.133
Let me just color code it.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.866
So this is the same thing as saying

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:26.866
five times five

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:33.133
minus three, let me do
that in that same color,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.300
minus three, needs to be
equal to four times five,

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:44.712
four times five plus three, plus three.

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.500
Color changing is hard.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.633
Plus three.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:49.700
Now, is this true?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.666
Let's see, five times five
is 25, it's going to be

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:57.666
25 minus three, needs to
be equal to 20 plus three.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:03.334
25 minus three is 22,
needs to be equal to 23.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.000
No, this is not true.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So, x does not equal five,
so this is not a solution.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.833
Let's try x equals six.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.700
So, once again, we're going
to do five times our x,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.283
which is going to be six,
actually let me just write it out,

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:22.283
minus three needs to be
equal to four times our x,

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:26.309
plus three, and in this case our x is six,

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.033
so it's going to be five
times six minus three

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:30.466
needs to be equal to four
times six plus three.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:32.566
What's five times six?

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:36.500
Well, it's 30 minus
three, needs to be equal

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.900
to four times six is
24, and then plus three.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.033
Well, this is true, 30 minus three is 27,

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:47.600
which is indeed equal to 24
plus 3, it's equal to 27.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.133
So x equals 6 does satisfy our equation,

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.233
it is a solution, and actually
as we'll see in the future,

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.033
the solution to this
equation right over here.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:58.966
X equals six satisfies this.

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.800
Now, just for good
measure, let's just varify

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.033
that x equals seven will not satisfy.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.633
So I'm going to move this up a little bit.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.600
So if x is equal to
seven, we're going to get

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.466
five times seven minus
three needs to be equal

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:16.866
to four time seven plus three.

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.533
And so, we're going to
get, and in all these cases

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.100
we do the multiplication
first, order of operations,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.733
and it's very clear
when you see it kind of

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:26.833
in the algebraic notation up
here, so we're going to do

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:31.833
35 minus three needs to
be equal to 28 plus three,

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:36.433
35 minus three is 32, 28 plus three is 31,

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.466
these do not equal each other.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:43.300
So this is not a solution
to our original equation.
