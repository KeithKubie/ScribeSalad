00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.980
 
what we do is we get your saliva sample

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990
what we do is we get your saliva sample
 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.420
what we do is we get your saliva sample
back so all you have to do is spit into

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
back so all you have to do is spit into
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.970
back so all you have to do is spit into
the tube and then we get the DNA out of

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980
the tube and then we get the DNA out of
 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.060
the tube and then we get the DNA out of
the saliva and generate about 600,000

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070
the saliva and generate about 600,000
 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.370
the saliva and generate about 600,000
data points that are yours and then when

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380
data points that are yours and then when
 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.710
data points that are yours and then when
you log into your 23andme account we

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720
you log into your 23andme account we
 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.150
you log into your 23andme account we
have these web-based tools that we've

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160
have these web-based tools that we've
 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.249
have these web-based tools that we've
plugged into your DNA so you can explore

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259
plugged into your DNA so you can explore
 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.320
plugged into your DNA so you can explore
it and learn all of the things that we

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330
it and learn all of the things that we
 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.060
it and learn all of the things that we
know that we're currently translating

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070
know that we're currently translating
 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.130
know that we're currently translating
for lay people who don't understand

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140
for lay people who don't understand
 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.470
for lay people who don't understand
genetics so we that's our role is to be

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480
genetics so we that's our role is to be
 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.910
genetics so we that's our role is to be
that interface between you and your

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
that interface between you and your
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.309
that interface between you and your
genes
