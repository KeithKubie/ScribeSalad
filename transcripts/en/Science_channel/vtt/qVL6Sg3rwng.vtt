00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:05.667
AIRPLANES HAVE BEEN TRAVELING

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.033
THE SPEED OF SOUND FOR YEARS.

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.234
TAKE OFF THE WINGS,
ADD SOME WHEELS,

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:12.033
AND YOU'VE GOT A GREAT PLATFORM.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.734
Combs:
IMAGINE SITTING IN THE COCKPIT
OF AN F-104 STARFIGHTER JET,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:16.968
AND THAT'S EXACTLY

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.868
WHAT THE COCKPIT
OF MY LAND SPEED CAR IS.

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.501
Bodden:
THIS IS BASICALLY A MISSILE.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:22.400
YOU ARE DRIVING A MISSILE

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.067
AT SPEEDS APPROACHING
THE SPEED OF SOUND.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.701
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY NICE
AND COMFORTABLE. [ LAUGHS ]

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.601
BACK AROUND
THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY,

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.067
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT
YOU COULDN'T GO

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.467
MORE THAN 20 OR 30 MILES
AN HOUR, AND IT WOULD KILL YOU.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.868
I DON'T THINK THAT
TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE.

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:42.167
SO IF YOU'RE IN THIS
LAND SPEED RACER,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.767
AND YOU'RE MOVING ALONG,

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.634
IT'S GOING FAST ENOUGH TO WHERE
IT COULD ACTUALLY TAKE OFF.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:49.968
YOU DON'T WANT TO FLY
IN A VEHICLE THAT CAN'T FLY.

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.601
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WIND
PUSHING IT DOWN ONTO THE TIRES

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.033
BY THE WAY THE FRAME IS MADE.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.934
A LAND SPEED CAR HAS CANARDS.

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.033
NOW, THESE ARE THE LITTLE
MINI WINGS YOU SEE UP FRONT.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.501
AN AIRPLANE,
THE WING IS CURVED ON TOP,

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.067
WHICH CREATES LOW PRESSURE
AND PROVIDES LIFT.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:05.868
ON A CAR, IT WOULD BE
THE OPPOSITE.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.601
YOU WANT TO CREATE DOWNFORCE
RATHER THAN LIFT.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.400
THE TRICK IS NOT TO CREATE
TOO MUCH DOWNFORCE

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.968
BECAUSE THEN
THE CAR'S DOWNFORCE,

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.033
IT COULD ACTUALLY DIG THE CAR
INTO THE GROUND,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.300
WHICH WOULD BE HORRIBLE.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.133
NOT ENOUGH DOWNFORCE
COULD CAUSE THE CAR TO FLIP,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.067
CARTWHEEL, OR JUST COMPLETELY
GO OUT OF CONTROL.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:26.267
AS IN SO MUCH ELSE
ON THE LAND SPEED RACER,

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:29.534
IT'S ABOUT PUSHING PHYSICS
TO ITS ABSOLUTE LIMITS.

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:33.634
THIS WHEEL ARRANGEMENT HAS
TWO MAIN WHEELS IN THE BACK,

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.901
TWO STABILIZING WHEELS OFF
TO THE SIDE IN THE MIDDLE --

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:40.334
YOU CAN THINK OF IT ALMOST AS
TRAINING WHEELS ON A BICYCLE --

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.934
AND THEN YOU HAVE
YOUR FRONT WHEEL,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.601
WHICH PROVIDES YOUR STEERING.

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:45.501
IT'S NOT LIKE THESE CARS
HAVE SUSPENSION.

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.234
THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO HANDLE
THE END OF THE LAKE BED

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.601
OR THE EDGES OF THE LAKE BED,
THE BUMPY PART.

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:52.434
BECAUSE WEIGHT IS A BIG CONCERN,

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:55.767
THE ONLY SUSPENSION
IS ON THAT FRONT WHEEL.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.434
Narrator:
AND LOW WEIGHT IS IMPORTANT

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.667
DUE TO NEWTON'S
SECOND LAW OF MOTION --

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.367
ACCELERATION IS EQUAL TO FORCE
DIVIDED BY MASS.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.667
SO WHEN YOU INCREASE THE MASS,

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.067
AS WITH A HEAVY CAR,

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.567
YOU DECREASE THE ACCELERATION.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:12.801
BUT WHEN YOU DECREASE THE MASS,
AS WITH A LIGHTER CAR,

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.467
YOU INCREASE THE ACCELERATION,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.467
GETTING CLOSER TO SETTING
A NEW LAND SPEED RECORD.
