00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640
has been put into the actual world yes I
 

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.850
has been put into the actual world yes I
really like that idea what comes before

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:17.860
really like that idea what comes before
 

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.220
really like that idea what comes before
that and yeah yeah I can be like talking

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:20.230

to her in an office I could have had I
can agree at that I did think if they

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:23.650
can agree at that I did think if they
 

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.850
can agree at that I did think if they
somehow like could somehow mash up the

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:26.860
somehow like could somehow mash up the
 

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.410
somehow like could somehow mash up the
free to make like the ideal ending

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:28.420
free to make like the ideal ending
 

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.660
free to make like the ideal ending
that's also an issue is that they really

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:30.670
that's also an issue is that they really
 

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.040
that's also an issue is that they really
couldn't figure out how to end this

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.050
couldn't figure out how to end this
 

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.690
couldn't figure out how to end this

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:33.700
movie yeah there's a lot of theories
 

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.370
movie yeah there's a lot of theories
about this movie and what it really

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:35.380
about this movie and what it really
 

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.910
about this movie and what it really
means the symbolism behind it who sent

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:38.920
means the symbolism behind it who sent
 

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.370
means the symbolism behind it who sent
the postcard that kind of thing what or

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:41.380
the postcard that kind of thing what or
 

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.040
the postcard that kind of thing what or
who is Olin you know is he the devil is

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.050
who is Olin you know is he the devil is
 

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.450
who is Olin you know is he the devil is
he like a gatekeeper to Hell or whatever

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:45.460
he like a gatekeeper to Hell or whatever
 

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.270
he like a gatekeeper to Hell or whatever
the way that I sort of view his

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280
the way that I sort of view his
 

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.950
the way that I sort of view his
experience in the room is probably

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960
experience in the room is probably
 

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.430
experience in the room is probably
likened through Dante's Inferno which is

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440
likened through Dante's Inferno which is
 

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.430
likened through Dante's Inferno which is
mentioned in this movie when he's in the

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440
mentioned in this movie when he's in the
 

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.770
mentioned in this movie when he's in the
cold part like the freezing cold part

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:58.780
cold part like the freezing cold part
 

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.810
cold part like the freezing cold part
he's like I'm in I'm in this circle

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:00.820
he's like I'm in I'm in this circle
 

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.160
he's like I'm in I'm in this circle
what's a circle of Mayan right now and

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.170
what's a circle of Mayan right now and
 

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.250
what's a circle of Mayan right now and
he's thinking about Dante's Inferno and

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260
he's thinking about Dante's Inferno and
 

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.510
he's thinking about Dante's Inferno and
there's the parts where it's really

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520
there's the parts where it's really
 

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.370
there's the parts where it's really
burning hot there's parts where it's

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:08.380
burning hot there's parts where it's
 

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.050
burning hot there's parts where it's
really burning cold then he goes through

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.060
really burning cold then he goes through
 

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.700
really burning cold then he goes through
grief and all kinds of things and

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:11.710
grief and all kinds of things and
 

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.710
grief and all kinds of things and
there's also this theory that's

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720
there's also this theory that's
 

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.860
there's also this theory that's
developed about the stages of grief the

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:16.870
developed about the stages of grief the
 

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.020
developed about the stages of grief the
five stages of grief oh you're in denial

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.030
five stages of grief oh you're in denial
 

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.840
five stages of grief oh you're in denial
and your eventual acceptance of it that

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:21.850
and your eventual acceptance of it that
 

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.880
and your eventual acceptance of it that
he goes through all stages of grief as
