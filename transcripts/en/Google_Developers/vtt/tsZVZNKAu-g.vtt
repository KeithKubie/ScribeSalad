SAM DUTTON: We're standing in
front of the device wall here.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.230
And yeah, we're going
to see how our app did.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.340
Now we've been working on
building something for WebRTC.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.210
Justin can tell you a
little bit about that.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.510
And we're going to see
how the app performs

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.215
on a whole range of devices.

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.090
JUSTIN UBERTI: Right.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.820
So we just did a
talk about how AppRTC

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.797
is our sample app for WebRTC.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:25.880
But it's trying to be a
really polished sample app

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880
and trying to be
really, really fast.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.150
And so Sam and I were just
talking about the device wall.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.010
And we thought, hey,
what would happen

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.889
if we tried to fire
up 100 video chat

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:37.680
clients on every single
device we have here

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
on the device wall?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.040
What would actually happen?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.342
And it turned out to be,
actually, quite interesting.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.550
When we fire it up, you can
see that these things all

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.091
come to life.

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:46.980
It's all pretty fast.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.540
But some come to life
faster than others.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.350
And you can also
see some variances

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.080
in terms of which ones
actually show a better frame

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.500
rate, a better camera feed.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.020
And so being able to compare
the optics, the cameras,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.641
of all these devices
side by side,

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.349
we've never even had
this ability before.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.050
It's actually quite--

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.508
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:09.135
We're getting really
different-- like the color,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.280
you're getting color
casts on this one.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.470
Some of them are
sharper than others.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990
We've got a whole range.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.520
Movement is-- some of
them are handling movement

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.010
much better than others.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.200
And here we're saying the
classic user interface

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.830
problem, which is on
landscape telephones-- what

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.580
have we done here?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.905
We've got the button is
halfway off the screen,

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:33.680
a really common problem
for user interface.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.430
And, oh, here's another problem.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.330
The Join button has gone tiny.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.480
But in fact, the video
quality is great.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.300
What really blows
me away is we've

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.130
got a stack of
different devices,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.542
and WebRTC is working
really well on all of them.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.000
Do you want to talk a bit about
the hardware and stuff that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.377
does that?

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.210
JUSTIN UBERTI: Yeah.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.090
So internally, we're calling
down to the Android camera

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.680
API, which is doing
all this work for us.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.060
And since every single
device is different,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.670
we see different
performance coming

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.250
from these different devices.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.760
But it's quite interesting
in that in the same lighting

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.180
conditions, everything
here is the same amount

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.260
light, same shutter and
everything like that.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.130
SAM DUTTON: Check this one out.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.280
JUSTIN UBERTI: Yeah.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.230
This one's super dark.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.250
This one is really,
really jerky.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.240
And then this one here is really
nice, a really good experience.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.570
So it's just very interesting
just to see this visually.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.490
Like all these specs
that people talk

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.670
about in cameras and
everything like that really

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.880
are displayed in terms of
what is the actual user

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.796
experience that you're
going to get out of it?

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:32.440
Well, here, you can
actually see it.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.023
And Sam, you mentioned
the whole thing

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:36.680
about, what did we do
right on the app side

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.390
to make sure things are usable?

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.180
In some cases, we did
better than others.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.680
But also, for the devices, like
how do these things actually

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.477
fare in a real world scenario?

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:46.810
What would the actual people
using these things actually

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.660
experience?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.020
Well, you could actually see
this in a real world mode.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.755
And I think it was
a great experiment.

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.520
SAM DUTTON: No, that's right.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.630
What really interests me
is, we had a lot of talk

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.990
in the keynote today about
the next billion devices.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.750
Well, a lot of those people
on the next billion devices,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.810
in fact, they're coming onto
more affordable data plans.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.860
And some of those
people are going

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.330
to be using video
on mobile devices.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.600
And so you can see along
here what we really

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.975
need to be able to
do is do great video

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:23.250
and audio experience, but
with low CPU, low power usage,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.130
and all the rest of it
that goes into making

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.372
it work well on a low-spec
device with limited bandwidth.

00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:31.080
JUSTIN UBERTI: Yeah,
I mean, you can just

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080
think of a number of ways
that we could take this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.371
in a further direction, though.

00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.760
It would be really
interesting, just seeing--

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.460
doing this, what's the
actual power consumption

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.720
of every single device here.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.700
And we got these great
scores for how fast is it

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.950
or some of the other things.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.422
SAM DUTTON: Check this out.

00:03:45.422 --> 00:03:46.963
This is-- I'm really
happy with that.

00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:47.954
99, 99, 100.

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:50.370
JUSTIN UBERTI: But what if we
could also measure in power?

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.310
What is the actual
power usage of the site?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.929
Or what is the FPS that we're
getting across each site?

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.220
I'm just like-- my mind's
going through a lot of cycles

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.402
now thinking about this
is a fantastic tool.

00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:02.110
What else could we
actually do with this?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.210
And I know that some
of the announcements

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.780
that were made this morning
about the actual cloud

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.956
laboratory for doing testing
on different devices,

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.330
I wonder if you could get
these same sorts of benchmarks?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.370
And I know you mentioned
the next thing.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.220
These are all calls in the
waiting state, where it's just

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.829
displaying it on local video
while it's waiting for the user

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.870
to join the call.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.720
But then if we could have
some other way of connecting

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.971
these devices to some other
center of remote endpoint,

00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.470
we could start seeing what is
the actual performance of them

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.230
when they go to
actually send that video

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.962
from the camera across the
network and that sort of thing.

00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:32.670
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.836
And one other thing, something
you said this morning

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:38.190
was that messaging apps
are becoming, really,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.560
the dominant apps
on mobile devices.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.610
And I think you said something
like 6 out of 10 of the most

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.047
popular apps on mobile--

00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:48.130
JUSTIN UBERTI: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.070
SAM DUTTON: --are now
apps that do messaging.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.200
So it it's hugely
important, this.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.920
JUSTIN UBERTI: Yeah, the
new Mary Meeker report

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.200
said the actual usage, the
top 10 apps in terms of usage,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.397
six of them are just
pure communications apps.

00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:06.980
There's other apps in there that
have some other functionality

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.427
and that are social networking
apps, but six of those apps

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:10.510
are actual communications.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.160
And the point to
take away from this

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.030
is that the number
one thing that people

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.795
are doing on mobile
devices is communicating.

00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:19.670
And I guess that's not
really that surprising

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.810
if you think about it.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.100
They're phones, originally.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.325
But still, we've gotten to
this thing of there's email,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.526
and there's all
these other things.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:28.900
First and foremost,
these devices

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.274
are being used
for communicating.

00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:33.080
And so we've been out to
deliver great communications

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.730
experiences.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.272
And this is a great way of
actually visualizing that.

00:05:37.272 --> 00:05:37.980
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.760
And that's something we
really need to do really well,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.860
especially in these
conditions of low bandwidth

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.345
and low-spec devices.

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:46.690
And it's great to
see this stuff.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.040
