[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.720
SPEAKER: I am super
excited to have

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.760
Clara Hemphill, founder of
Inside Schools, here with us

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.260
today.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.540
She's a font of knowledge,
and it's exciting.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.560
So just a little bit about
Clara so you know who she is.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.390
She leads the Center of New
York City Affairs policy work

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.030
on economic segregation
of the city's schools,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.730
examining why there are schools
with high concentrations

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.030
of poverty even in
mixed-income neighborhoods.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.310
The "New York Times" called
her three books designed

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.330
to help parents choose
good elementary, middle,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.030
and high schools
for their children

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.270
the most definitive guides
to the city's schools.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.310
And "New York"
magazine called her one

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.860
of the 200 most influential
New Yorkers for her work

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.960
in empowering parents.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.150
Previously as a reporter
and editorial writer

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.880
for New York "Newsday," she
shared the Pulitzer Prize

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.689
for local reporting.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.230
"New York" magazine called her
writing on the homeless worthy

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.767
of Dickens.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.100
She was a foreign correspondent
for the Associated Press

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.780
and a producer for CBS
News based in Rome.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.760
She has two children,
both now grown,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100
and they both attended New
York City public schools

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.800
from kindergarten
through high school.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.950
So please join me in welcoming
Clara Hemphill to talk

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.930
about the public
schools and navigating

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.180
the very segregated and
ridiculously complex

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.380
New York City school system.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.203
Thank you.

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:25.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:30.540
CLARA HEMPHILL: Thank you.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.740
I'm really glad to be here.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.690
I wrote the first edition
of this book 20 years ago

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.880
when my children
were three and one.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.290
They're now all grown up.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.010
And I thought, gee, I can
figure out this bureaucracy.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.590
I was a foreign
correspondent in Rome.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.830
I covered the Vatican,
which I thought

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.780
was the most secretive
bureaucracy on the planet.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.530
And then I realized
the Board of Education

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.420
is even more
secretive and complex.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.900
So I thought if I had
trouble, other people

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.060
might have trouble too.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.120
And I started writing
the books then.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.990
A couple years later, we set
up the Inside Schools website.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.860
And we just released the fourth
edition of the "New York City's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.440
Best Public Pre-K and Elementary
Schools" on sale in the back.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.300
I hope you buy it.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.200
Thanks very much.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.470
Why should you
choose public school?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.140
Why do public schools matter?

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.720
And one of the things that
the last election showed us,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.370
the national elections, is how
divided we are as a country.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.270
And public schools,
when they work,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.980
have the ability to
bring us together,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.800
to help us understand
one another.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.160
And we need the public
schools now more than ever.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.200
This picture here is
an example of a school

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.700
that I think brings
people together.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.440
It's Dos Puentes in
Washington Heights.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.360
If you know Washington Heights,
on the east side of Broadway

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.680
is mostly Dominican
Spanish-speaking kids.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.890
On the west side is mostly
English-speaking kids.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.840
Dos Puentes brings
these kids together

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.720
in a dual-language program,
where they speak English

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.550
half the time and they
speak Spanish half the time.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.580
And it's a really
lovely, lovely school

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.860
and an example of how
children can learn together.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.440
One of the things I like
about it is that the parents'

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.120
meetings are given--
sometimes they're

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.550
given in Spanish with
English translation,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.280
and sometimes they're
given in English

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.140
with Spanish translation.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.540
And one of the things I liked
about going to that school

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.030
was having the experience
of being somebody

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550
who didn't understand the
language that was spoken

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.450
and had to have the translation.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.360
So that's one of the schools in
the book that I can recommend.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.300
Public schools are just
about the only place

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.840
besides jury duty
and the subways

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.210
where people of different races,
incomes, and backgrounds mix.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.300
This is Ella Baker
School on the Upper East

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.860
Side, which is open
to children by lottery

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.310
from all five Boroughs.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.540
So it's not a zoned school.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.850
It's a city-wide school.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.050
And the great education
philosopher John Dewey,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.150
at the turn of the
last century, wrote

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.920
that "schools should
teach children

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.060
to be social beings
trained for leadership

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.470
as well as obedience, trained
so they can be voting citizens

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.400
in a multi-ethnic democracy,
not passive subjects.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.820
"Teachings them to be social
beings without letting them

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.810
mingle with other
children," Dewey wrote,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.590
is like teaching them
to swim without letting

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.750
them go in the water.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.280
I remember talking
to a Jewish father

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.120
some time ago who was
choosing between a Jewish day

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.750
school and a public school.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.490
And I told him,
yes, I understand

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.820
you want your child to
learn about your religious

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.370
traditions, Hebrew.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.010
Your values are very
important to you.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.000
But if you send your
child to public school,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.410
I guarantee he will meet
at least one child who

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.840
celebrates Ramadan.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.230
And a child who
celebrates Ramadan

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.610
will meet at least
one child who--

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.390
he interrupted me.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.800
He said, yeah, I get the idea.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.000
I get the point.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.070
And that clinched
the deal for him.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.600
This is PS 75 on the
Upper West Side, which

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.480
serves both Columbia
University professors' children

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.225
but also children who live
in public housing nearby.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.260
A lot of the schools in the book
are ordinary zoned neighborhood

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.030
schools, no special application.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.130
You just sign your child up.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.070
This is PS 180 in Harlem.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.710
In some ways, it's
an ordinary school.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.430
Test scores are nothing special.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.590
It's just sort of
an ordinary school.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.740
But a mother told
me, I feel like I'm

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.860
part of a community and
a neighborhood in a way

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.390
that I never expected--

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.940
the pleasure of making friends
with other parents, sharing

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.250
babysitters and
after-school pickups,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.170
even sharing holiday meals.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.830
So I live on the
Upper East Side,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.590
and I never felt I really
lived in the neighborhood

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.680
until I had children and sent
them to the public schools.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.000
And there's something about
sharing the responsibilities

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.170
of parenthood with other
people in the neighborhood that

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.210
really makes you feel like
you belong in a neighborhood.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.347
Now I know some of
you will say, oh,

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:54.930
that's all very well
and good for you.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.700
You live on the Upper East Side.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.290
But what if you live in the
Bronx or in central Brooklyn?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.780
One of the questions I got ahead
of time for this talk was--

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.820
this is a quote from one of you.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.990
"Public school is not a viable
option for every New Yorker."

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.610
This parent was zoned for
133 in District 5 in Harlem.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.640
"I cannot in good conscience
send my children to my zoned

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.630
school.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.060
Charter is also not
an option if you're

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.630
against rote memorization and
some other very regimented

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.350
tactics they use
to teach students."

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.310
It's true that there
aren't as many good schools

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.530
in poor and working-class
neighborhoods

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.630
as there are in
rich neighborhoods.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.840
And racial and
economic segregation

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.910
is a reality, as
those of you who

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.080
were at Nikole Hannah-Jones'
talk some time ago remember.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.840
But in researching
the book, we found

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.150
good schools in every one of
the city's 32 school districts,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.420
not as many as we'd
like, but at least a few.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.850
And we found some
pleasant surprises.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.960
You don't have to live on Park
Avenue to find a good school.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.030
I also want to say that
not all the charter

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.820
schools are rigid places
where children are

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.350
expected to act like robots.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.080
There are some
progressive schools,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.680
where children learn through
exploration and play.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.920
And not all the charter
schools are the same, just

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.430
the way all the ordinary public
schools are not the same.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.020
What about segregation?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.559
It's true, and it's really
the shame of our city.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:40.289
But even predominantly white
schools or predominantly Asian

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.419
schools or predominantly
black and Latino

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.430
schools still have lots
of different religions,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.810
lots of different languages.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.160
I was at PS 189 in Crown Heights
the other day in Brooklyn.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.200
It's 97% black and
Latino, but the children

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.620
speak Spanish, English, creole.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.870
There's even some
Chinese kids there.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.760
There's a range of incomes.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.320
There's a pediatrician.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.220
There's a cab driver,
a home health aide.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.950
It's a school that
has served generations

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.470
of parents in Crown Heights.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.870
And they have dual language
programs where children

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.640
can learn Spanish and creole.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.960
They even learn Latin.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.840
So that's a school
which in some ways

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.850
is indeed highly segregated
and in other ways is diverse.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.470
I remember going to an all
black school in Brooklyn

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.660
and asking the kids what
they liked about it.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.240
And they said, oh, I
love the diversity.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.980
And I said, what do you mean?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.370
And they said, oh, we have
kids from every single island

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.240
in the Caribbean.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.580
Another reason to
choose a public school

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.890
is kids need parents
who aren't stressed out.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.110
Commuting time really matters.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.350
If you're trying to decide
between a great school 20

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.920
blocks away and a pretty good
school across the street,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.680
I would choose the
one across the street.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.710
Another question is, if
you're working 60 hours a week

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.590
to pay private school
tuition, maybe you're

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.560
better off sending your
child to public school.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.650
If working part time means you
can go on an occasional field

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.080
trip, volunteer
at the school, you

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.940
may enjoy being with
your child, and that time

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.730
can be very important.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.330
I also want to point out
that education is not

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.790
just what you have from 9:00
AM to 3:00 PM 180 days a year.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.930
Just living in the
city of New York

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.500
gives you access to resources
that people elsewhere

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.820
don't have, the Natural
History Museum, the Bronx Zoo.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:54.490
My children danced with the
National Dance Institute.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.770
There are huge
numbers of resources

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:02.470
that you can take advantage of
just by living in the school.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.380
Of course the argument
about the 60 hours a week

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.610
may work the other way.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.900
If you're already working--

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.540
I realized I'm talking
to Googlers here.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.580
If you're already
working 60 hours a week,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.370
you may want to choose private
because you don't have to be

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.920
on top of everything at school.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.210
But what my point is is
consider your own convenience

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.520
and your own levels of stress
when you're deciding on school.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.650
The children are made
of rubber, and they

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.800
can adapt to lots of
different situations.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.320
Another thing I
want you to remember

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.500
is that no school is perfect.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.590
As a parent, you have to
decide what you can live with,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.654
what you can supplement at home.

00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:47.195
There's some things you can fix,
and there's some things that

00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:48.269
you can't.

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:50.560
You certainly don't want to
send your child to a school

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.410
where there's lots of bullying,
or where the adults yell

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.710
at the children, or where
teachers have low expectations

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.940
and the children are overwhelmed
by the problems of poverty.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.880
My children's school had
physical education just one day

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.110
a week.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.990
So what did we do?

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.230
We supplemented with West
Side Soccer League, which

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.730
is a volunteer, moms and dads
will coach kids on the weekend.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.535
They take up most
of the park space

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:15.660
in the city on the weekend.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.130
You've probably seen them.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.750
If there's not
enough math drill,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.670
you can have flashcards at home.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.860
If there's not a
foreign language,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.660
you can take the
whole family to France

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.720
for three months for the price
of private school tuition.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.222
It also depends on your child.

00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:34.930
Some children are
like-- a nursery school

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.550
teacher described this to me.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.100
Some children are
like dandelions.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.850
They're robust, and they can
flourish in lots of places.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.440
Others are more like orchids.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.380
They're delicate, and they need
just the right temperature.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.580
Some schools do a good job with
children with special needs.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.470
Others do not.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.330
So it depends a little bit
on your own family situation

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.860
and on the what
your child is like.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.800
The most important thing,
a friend once told me,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.830
is to find a school
that doesn't kill

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.890
your child's natural curiosity.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.450
A lot of what children
learn in the early years

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.400
is not-- particularly
in kindergarten,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.120
it's not cognitive.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.780
It's social, learning how to
sit in a circle, how to share,

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.489
how to develop
independence, things

00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:25.780
like how to tie your own shoes.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.410
The tone and climate
of a school may

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.930
be more important than
the children's scores

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.135
on standardized tests.

00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:36.760
Oh, and the scores, by the way,
tell you where a school's been.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.670
It doesn't tell you necessarily
where a school is going.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.100
A school that's promising
and on its way up

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.680
may provide a better
experience for your child

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.490
than a complacent,
well-established school that's

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.300
coasting on its reputation.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.854
So that's my pitch
on why public.

00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:57.770
Now I'm going to give
you the sort of the nuts

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.240
and bolts of how to navigate
the New York City public school

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.450
system.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.400
The good news is that all
four-year-olds are guaranteed

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.680
a seat in pre-kindergarten.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.440
The bad news is it may not
be in the school closest

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.664
to your home.

00:14:13.664 --> 00:14:15.080
If you're willing
to travel a bit,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.660
you'll definitely get a spot.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.630
The applications
open in mid-January.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.880
The deadlines are at
the end of February.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.370
But if you're looking for
a school for your child

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.380
this fall, take heart.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.600
Seats open up in the
spring and the summer.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.720
For your child to
be eligible, he

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.260
needs to have his fourth
birthday by December 31.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.570
That means, and say if
he has a fall birthday,

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.410
he'll actually start
pre-kindergarten

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.620
when he's three.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.870
de Blasio has also
promised that he's

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.290
going to have
pre-pre-kindergarten

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.270
for three-year-olds.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.350
They're going to start in two
high-poverty districts, one

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.580
in the South Bronx and one in
central Brooklyn in the fall.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.460
They haven't got money
for anything else,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:07.239
so I think asking the
federal government

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.530
and the state for extra money
right now is probably not

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.196
going to happen.

00:15:10.196 --> 00:15:13.730
But we do have pre-K
for four-year-olds.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.280
Not all of the
pre-kindergarten classes

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.440
are in ordinary public schools.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.940
In fact, most of them
are housed in child care

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.400
centers or private nursery
schools or religious schools.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.740
You can see the pie chart here.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.730
The cities also opened what
they call pre-K centers.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.040
These are standalone
schools that your child

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.290
will attend for just one year.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.870
We list some of our
favorites in the book.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.370
It's certainly a
good idea to visit,

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.030
but most of the programs
we visit are pretty good.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.340
So that's pre-K.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.370
Elementary, this is where
the big kid school begins.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.120
And this is when
you're five years old,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.250
if you are five
before December 31,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.650
you're entitled to start
school in that September.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:09.590
So for the pre-K, you're
guaranteed a seat someplace,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.040
but not necessarily in your
zoned neighborhood school.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.950
In fact, most of
you will not have

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.750
a seat in your zoned
neighborhood school.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.960
Some of them just have
18 seats for pre-K

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.584
and 125 seats for kindergarten.

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:25.250
So most of you are
going to have to look

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.440
outside of your zoned public
school for pre-kindergarten.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.440
However, for elementary
school, most of you

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.340
have a zoned elementary
school, and your child

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.920
is guaranteed admission there.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.170
One of the questions that
you gave me in advance

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.820
was about wait lists.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.950
There are some schools
have wait lists.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:51.320
But honestly, almost all
of the wait lists clear.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.580
They ask parents to sign
up early, and many do.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.610
And they tell you that you're
on a wait list in March.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.920
But by September,
an awful lot of kids

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.870
have either moved
out of the city,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.420
or chosen a private
school, or gone

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.650
into a gifted and
talented program.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.890
So I would not worry
about-- there's

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.200
a couple of schools that have
serious wait lists in Sunset

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.910
Park, a couple in Queens.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.170
But by and large, it's
not going to be a problem.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.440
The timeline is in--

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.260
do I have another
slide for this?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.034
Nope, this is the districts.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.930
The timeline is you
apply in November

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.910
if you want your
child to be considered

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.850
for a gifted program.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.100
I'm not a big fan
of gifted education,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.270
but if your zoned neighborhood
school isn't adequate,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.880
it's certainly an option
that you should consider.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.720
The testing for children
for the gifted program

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.480
is in January and February.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.590
And by January, then you submit
applications for other schools.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.020
Honestly the deadline
is way too early.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.210
Most people in the city
don't know in January

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.220
what they're going to
be doing in September,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.160
and they almost
always extend it.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.930
By the end of March,
you'll find out

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.790
where your child's
been assigned.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.070
If you're interested
in charter schools,

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.030
the deadline is April 1.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.410
And then in April, you find
out if your children-- you

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:24.910
know what?

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.243
I'm making this too complicated.

00:18:26.243 --> 00:18:26.890
Read the book.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.270
Ask questions afterwards.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.270
I can see that the eyes
are getting a little bit

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.430
panic-stricken here.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.015
Zone maps.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.060
Sorry.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.830
OK, the city is divided
into 32 districts.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.160
One of the questions was, why
are the districts so weird?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.310
Why don't they just
make them according

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.260
to the voting districts?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.770
The answer is buried in history.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:02.230
The districts were
set up in 1969

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.945
as part of an experiment
in community control.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.429
They're all set up
for political reasons.

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:13.720
Some of them were designed
to keep all the white people

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.230
together.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.300
Some of them were designed
to give Puerto Ricans

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.610
power in East Harlem.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.100
Some of them were designed to
dilute African-American power.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.950
Some of them were
designed to concentrate

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.820
African-American power.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.810
The reason you need to
know about them today

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.990
is that your child is
guaranteed a seat in one

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.510
of these in the district
in which you live.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.520
And some of the districts
are really first rate,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.530
and some of them are not
ready for prime time.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.040
One of you said that the--

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.110
whoops, I seemed to have
missed the Inside Schools.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.100
All right, well, one of you
said that the Department

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.270
of Education website
is very hard to use.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.170
We agree.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.870
We at Inside Schools have
been working very hard

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.090
to develop a new website.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.260
We have it in development now.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.400
We plan to launch it
in the end of May.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.520
And I'm hoping to get some
Google volunteers to help us

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.420
with a guided search
that will go through,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.090
help parents answer a
certain number of questions.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.570
I don't know what
happened to that slide,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.010
but if you go to
insideschools.org,

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.840
you'll see our old slide.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.821
And if you go to the--

00:20:40.821 --> 00:20:42.770
ah here it is.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.760
What we're hoping to
get is a guided search.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.384
So instead of searching by
finding your zoned school

00:20:49.384 --> 00:20:51.050
or finding schools
in your neighborhood,

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.020
we would also ask a
couple of questions

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.900
like how old is your child?

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.330
How far are you
willing to travel?

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.760
Are you interested in a
dual-language program?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.159
For pre-kindergarten, do
you need care from 8:00

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.950
in the morning to 6:00
at night, or are you

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.320
able to pick up your
child after school?

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.210
That kind of guided
search we would

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.680
love to have some help
with from any of you.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.930
We have a couple
of other projects

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.050
for volunteers,
which [INAUDIBLE] has

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.350
put on the Google Give.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.890
The best school guides and
the Inside School guides

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.430
are projects of the
Center for New York City

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.050
Affairs at the New School.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.840
We're not for profit,
and we rely on donations

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.210
to keep providing this
service to parents.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.850
So if you'd like to help us
out by making a donation,

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.060
or buying the book, or
both, we'd be very grateful.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.970
The New York City public schools
helped make my own children

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.300
the adults they are today,
intellectually curious, morally

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.270
grounded, ever-generous, and
able to get along with people

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.080
of all races and backgrounds.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.110
We wrote this book
in the hopes that it

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.080
can help you have the same
experience with your children.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.648
So I will answer questions now.

00:22:10.648 --> 00:22:11.622
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.010
SPEAKER: Could I just
go to the next slide?

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.280
OK, so I just wanted
to let you guys

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.310
know that Inside Schools,
as you mentioned,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.270
they operate on a
shoestring budget,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.590
and they have a few
interesting projects that I

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.200
put in for Google
Serve for June,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.850
some engineering projects, some
marketing strategy projects.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.480
Really if you want
to get involved,

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.720
I put a go link, Inside
Schools dash volunteer.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.980
Check them out.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.540
Also, as I mentioned,
they're a nonprofit,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.860
so I put a go link
for donations.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.630
There's also books
in the back if you're

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.840
interested in
reading Clara's book.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.180
It's fascinating.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.750
I also wanted you guys, if
anyone has questions, please

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.950
come up to the mic and ask.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.466
I think we can spend
the rest of the time

00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:09.299
on questions, because
I know you have a lot.

00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:19.050
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.270
Thank you, Clara,
for coming here.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.380
I have a quick
question about, I know

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.480
many parents, including my
wife actually, six years ago,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.190
I believe, told me that
we should move to a place

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.480
where the school is 9 in 10.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480
I said, what is 9 in 10?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.780
She said that Inside Schools
had the ranking system, 9 in 10,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.530
and that's how we ended
up buying a house.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.730
That was long, long ago.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.860
Now my son is five years old.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.910
So that was too much
planning towards the ranking.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.120
It But I still don't
understand how the numbers go,

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.070
because that 9 in 10 became 6
in 10, then that became 8 in 10.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.830
So I learned that it's
not really test scores.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.650
And really, is it worth
giving that much weightage,

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.520
depending on how--

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.770
CLARA HEMPHILL: That's
a good question.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.150
We don't rank schools.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.410
It's our dread competitor,
greatschools.net.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.980
The difference between
greatschools.net and us

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.670
is that we live in New York,
and we actually visit schools.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:26.520
And we base our reviews
on our visits to schools.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.590
Greatschools.net uses
two-year-old national data.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.680
It's a national website,
and it's largely

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.640
based on test scores,
which is, as I said,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.790
where a school has been and
not where a school is going.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.180
I think test scores
are a rough--

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.220
we have test scores
on our website,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.760
and I think they
are a rough measure

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.010
of the quality of a school.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.310
If you have single digits of
children passing the tests,

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.630
that's a problem.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.390
If you have 80% passing,
that's a good thing.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.010
On our website, we draw the
data from the Department

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:15.640
of Ed surveys, which are given
to a million parents, teachers,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.450
and children themselves
at the schools.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.270
And the data that we
consider important,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.730
aside from the test
scores, is attendance--

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.040
do most of the children show up?

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.460
Teacher attendance-- do most
of the teachers show up?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.190
Teacher satisfaction--
do most of the teachers

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.070
like the principal,
respect the principals?

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.140
Do they work together as a team?

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.640
So those are some of
the-- we have that data

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.530
for every school in the city.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:50.850
And we have qualitative reviews
for about 800 of the schools.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.480
Does that help?

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.767
AUDIENCE: Yep, thanks.

00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:56.350
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you weren't

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.639
a big fan of gifted education.

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:59.680
I was just wondering if
you could expand on that.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.805
Do you think the whole idea
is bad, or just the way

00:26:01.805 --> 00:26:03.645
it's actually implemented?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.020
CLARA HEMPHILL:
There are clearly

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.332
some children who
need gifted education,

00:26:08.332 --> 00:26:09.790
as there are some
children who need

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.860
any kind of special education.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.530
And in a room of Googlers,
there are probably

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.380
some very gifted
children, I would guess.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:30.700
If your child is two standard
deviations from the mean,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.560
he may need gifted education.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.490
The problem is that
the tests are set up

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.150
on national norms,
not local norms.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.340
So your child might
be two or three grade

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.560
levels-- you might
live in the Bronx,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.140
and your child is two or three
grade levels ahead of the kids

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.120
in the Bronx.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.120
But the city test
wouldn't recognize that.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.100
So there's almost
no kids in the Bronx

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.760
who are considered eligible
for gifted education.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:06.550
And I think the tests also
reflect socioeconomics

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.810
as much as they reflect
some kind of curiosity

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.320
or natural ability.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.120
In more wealthy
neighborhoods, your child

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.820
may be two standard
deviations from the mean,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.260
but everybody else is the
same in that neighborhood.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.390
So that District 2 on the Upper
East Side is like Lake Wobegon.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.620
Everybody's above average.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.530
But that doesn't mean that
they all need gifted education.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.010
I can always tell when I've
got a real one on the phone.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.100
The parent says that the
child has taught himself

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.910
algebra at the age of three,
and he's having a little trouble

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.920
making friends.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.890
And the parents desperately
want their children

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.764
to be invited to
birthday parties.

00:27:49.764 --> 00:27:51.430
That's an example of
a child who I think

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.500
needs the gifted education.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.030
Now, if we all had good
neighborhood schools,

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.860
there would be a
very, very small need

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.570
for gifted education.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.250
Unfortunately, the quality
of schools is really uneven.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.940
And gifted education is
a particularly good way

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.800
to get out of a nasty
neighborhood school

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.710
that you don't want
to send your child to.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.930
The other problem with
the gifted education

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.670
is I think children
need to learn

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.170
that hard work is what
matter, and you're not

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:27.762
born with gifts as much.

00:28:27.762 --> 00:28:29.220
I mean, you may be
born with gifts,

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.330
but what counts is
how hard you work.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.770
And in these gifted
programs, there's

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.900
kind of a fear of falling.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.600
There's a fear of failure.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.800
Also I think the tests
measure a rather narrow range

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.900
of academic skills.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.030
They don't test if
you're a great musician.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.160
They don't test if
you're a great artist.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.140
They don't test if
you're athletic.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.790
They don't test if
you're particularly

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:58.430
good at making friends and
ending playground squabbles.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:04.520
So I want my children to be
exposed to all of those things

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.275
and not just to kids who do
well on a particular test.

00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:09.650
The other thing
is I think giving

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.970
the test to four-year-olds
is really too early.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.890
I just think that the predictive
quality of these tests

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.410
is not that-- the tests
are not that accurate.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.290
And the divide between
the 99th percentile

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:28.370
and the 98th percentile
of kids at the age of four

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.955
is kind of ludicrous.

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:31.580
The other thing is
a lot of what you're

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.250
learning in elementary
school is not cognitive.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.860
It's how to tie your shoes,
how to sit in a circle,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.770
how to make friends,
how to get along

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.190
with the classroom routines.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:46.560
So this is what I think about
early childhood education.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.150
I think by third, fourth,
fifth, sixth grade,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.340
a very good teacher can
reach a range of children.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.840
But the wider that
range is, the harder it

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.000
is for a teacher to reach that.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.040
In my kindergarten,
what you'd want

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.420
to ask of the school is, how
do you challenge children

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:17.480
at the top, and how do you
give help to kids who need it?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.170
And your child might
need both, right?

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.210
Your child might be a math whiz
who has trouble making friends.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.530
Or your child may be reading
"Harry Potter" in kindergarten

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.120
but can't add, right?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.780
So your child can be
simultaneously gifted

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.490
and struggling at the same time.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.190
My son was very good at puzzles.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.930
And when in kindergarten he
finished the 100-piece puzzle,

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.980
the teacher would pull down
the 500-piece puzzle for him.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.480
When you look in classrooms, you
want to see a range of books.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.760
If everybody is
reading the same book,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.580
that's probably
not a good place.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.200
But if some kids are reading
"Frog and Toad" and other kids

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.920
are reading "Charlotte's
Web," that's a sign.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.140
If you look at the
writing on the board

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.600
and you see some kids
are writing five pages

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.000
and some kids are
writing three paragraphs,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.610
that's a sign that
the school is adapting

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.890
to kids with different needs.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.259
So of course you want your
child to be challenged

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:21.800
if he's very bright,
and you want him

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.440
to get the help if he needs it.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.120
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.660
he needs to be
segregated in a classroom

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.359
with other kids who do
well on this academic test.

00:31:33.359 --> 00:31:35.654
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:35.654 --> 00:31:38.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.461
So the school that we're
zoned for is relatively new.

00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:43.460
It was just launched like
four years ago, maybe,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.660
so I think there's not a lot
of information on it yet.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.290
CLARA HEMPHILL: Which school?

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.165
AUDIENCE: It's the School
for Social Action--

00:31:48.165 --> 00:31:49.498
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, I know it.

00:31:49.498 --> 00:31:51.130
AUDIENCE: --527, I think it is.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.550
So we ideally want to send-- our
daughter is only 7 months old.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.620
But we want to send
her there, but we're

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.870
being told by a lot of people
to keep our options open

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.869
and make sure we're
planning for the possibility

00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:04.970
of a gifted and talented
program or a private school.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.580
So I guess my
question is twofold.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.302
What are your thoughts
on that and knowing

00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.510
that our daughter's so young?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.530
What are the things
that we should

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.238
be thinking about
right now to set her up

00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:14.470
for whatever options?

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.512
But ideally wanting to
send her to public school,

00:32:16.512 --> 00:32:19.011
are there things that we should
be thinking about doing now?

00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:21.820
CLARA HEMPHILL: If you can
afford to stay in District 2,

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.560
I'd stay put.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.530
District 2 not only has
terrific elementary schools.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.290
It also has good middle
schools and good high schools,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:34.000
which is not universally
the case at all.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.322
Then I like 527 a lot.

00:32:38.322 --> 00:32:40.280
It's a shade more
traditional than some-- well,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.610
I won't get into details
about individual schools.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.472
But in your
district, I like 527.

00:32:45.472 --> 00:32:46.180
It's in the book.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.230
You can read about it.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.200
There's also a gifted
program a few blocks away.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.380
There's two gifted programs a
few blocks away, both of which

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.215
I like very well.

00:32:54.215 --> 00:32:55.840
AUDIENCE: So are
there things we should

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.760
be thinking about doing,
though, to make sure

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.010
that she's prepared
for the application

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.504
process for gifted and
talented or for getting her

00:33:02.504 --> 00:33:03.670
ready for elementary school?

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.650
Because I've just heard from
people in the building who

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.080
are saying they send their
kids to gifted and talented,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.430
and they're like, oh there's
all these things you have to do,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.221
these classes you have
to take to make sure

00:33:11.221 --> 00:33:14.710
that they're on the
resume for a two-year-old.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.080
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, I
think it's kind of sick.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.475
I want to let children
be children, right?

00:33:19.475 --> 00:33:20.590
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.730
CLARA HEMPHILL: And I will
encourage you to resist that.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:28.480
My son, I thought he was gifted.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.960
You know, he was doing the
big puzzles in kindergarten.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:36.040
But at the age of four, he
was still throwing blocks.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.780
And the thought of
having him sit down

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.650
with a stranger and a pencil and
paper test just seemed insane.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:47.080
So yeah, sure,
there are people who

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.080
will charge you lots of money
to prepare for this test.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.920
But I would strongly
discourage it, particularly

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.690
because you live
in a neighborhood

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.379
where the zoned
schools are fine.

00:33:57.379 --> 00:33:59.670
In neighborhoods where the
zoned schools are not fine--

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.890
I don't mean to trash gifted
and talented across the board.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.030
Easy for me to say.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.880
My kids went to the local
school, and it was great.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.868
For a lot of people, the gifted
schools are a good option.

00:34:10.868 --> 00:34:12.409
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
one last thing then.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:15.919
If the baby-- you mentioned
that the cutoff is December 31.

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:18.210
There's a lot of theories
about keeping your child back

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.230
or advancing them.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.855
But it sounds like
my reading showed me

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:23.229
that in public schools you
don't really have that choice.

00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:25.250
Is that true, or can you
hold your child back?

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.790
CLARA HEMPHILL: You cannot.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.934
CLARA HEMPHILL: You're
stuck with the--

00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.059
AUDIENCE: Starting at four.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:31.490
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, so this
is called redshirting, where

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.864
you hold the kids back a yeah,
with the idea that they'll

00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:35.830
be bigger and
stronger and smarter.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.219
And it's the same
group of people

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:38.510
who are telling
you to get the test

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.320
prep for your seven-month-old.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:39.986
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:34:43.198 --> 00:34:44.989
CLARA HEMPHILL: I have
a November birthday,

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.060
so my daughter was
the November birthday.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.590
And she was pretty
tiny for kindergarten,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:52.800
and she was pretty exhausted
at the end of the day.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.922
So I understand the--

00:34:55.922 --> 00:34:56.630
AUDIENCE: Theory?

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.960
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, I
understand the impulse to--

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.340
I mean, I think it's actually
there are political reasons why

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.500
these things are set up
that don't necessarily

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.310
have to do with pedagogy
or child development.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:18.140
I hope the question you could
ask at 527 or any other school

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.865
is, my child has a
November birthday.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.907
How do you adapt for
younger children?

00:35:28.907 --> 00:35:30.365
You know, do they
have a rest time?

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.760
Can they accommodate a child
who's a little bit younger?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.930
And see what they answer.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.970
I mean, I think that's
a valid question.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.530
But they won't let you
redshirt them, unfortunately.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.113
AUDIENCE: We don't
have an option, OK.

00:35:47.113 --> 00:35:48.106
All right, thank you.

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:48.522
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:48.522 --> 00:35:49.313
CLARA HEMPHILL: Hi.

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:51.320
AUDIENCE: A couple of
questions, if I may.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.560
First, I'd love to hear your
thoughts on non-zoned district

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.370
schools.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.980
Why do they exist,
and what steps

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.730
can one take if there's
a great one nearby

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.980
that you want to
get your kid into?

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.910
And then second, the
school in my zone

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.900
appears to not be a good school.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.780
I haven't looked.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.310
I'm going to buy your book
because you've convinced me.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.340
But I've looked
at School Digger,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.894
and the ranks aren't good.

00:36:15.894 --> 00:36:17.310
CLARA HEMPHILL:
What's the school?

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.576
AUDIENCE: Alfred Aux.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.450
CLARA HEMPHILL: OK, I
know that school, yeah.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.400
AUDIENCE: I mean,
my kids are four.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.066
They're already signed
up for preschool,

00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:26.210
but I'm thinking about
kindergarten for years

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.290
down the road.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.060
Realistically, are
there things that I

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.880
can do as a parent who wants
to be involved to really make

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.030
an impact on the school nearby?

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.184
Or is my time better
spent thinking about

00:36:36.184 --> 00:36:38.100
how I can get my kids
into a different school,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.490
whether that's the non-zoned
district school, or moving,

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.480
or something else?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.021
CLARA HEMPHILL: I
love that question.

00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:45.170
That's a really good one.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.231
Yes parents can
make a difference.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:58.006
You have to talk
to other parents

00:36:58.006 --> 00:37:00.380
and see if you've got other
people who can work with you.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.130
And then you have to
talk to the principal

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.980
and see if he wants you to work.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.299
And you can't say,
this a terrible school.

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:08.090
We're going to save
you and make it better.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.586
For some reason, that approach
is not really welcomed.

00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:12.710
AUDIENCE: I don't know why.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.010
CLARA HEMPHILL: But, you
know, we love the school

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.093
and we want to support it.

00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:16.496
Can we do x, y, z?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.170
So some of the districts have
district-wide school choice.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.470
So again, this is
Hell's Kitchen.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, 212 is right by.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.650
CLARA HEMPHILL:
Yeah, and there's

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.280
Midtown West, which is a
school that accepts kids

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:40.144
from all over the district,
and supposedly by lottery.

00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:42.560
Same as-- I don't know if you
read the piece in the Sunday

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.820
"Times" about 165 and
Manhattan School for Children

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.870
on the Upper West
Side, another case

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:51.290
of a sort of
unfavored zoned school

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.970
and a favored cool,
groovy, boutique, hipster,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.670
millennium school.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:03.890
And how they got
set up was parents

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.540
who were zoned for
the unfavored school

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:10.040
were dissatisfied and
created something new

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.220
under the auspices of
the Department of Ed.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:22.560
And these district schools
used to have their thumb

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.620
on the scales for parents
who wanted to volunteer.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.420
The last administration,
Bloomberg

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.210
thought that was
not really fair.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.240
I think there was one--

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.920
Joel Klein, the
previous chancellor,

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.020
may have read in my
book where I said

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.860
one family had two mothers,
and they promised two mothers

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.040
in the PTA, and that got
them into the school.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.560
And the school's
chancellor thought

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.140
this kind of string pulling
was really not very nice.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.510
So he made it everything's
done by lottery now.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:57.690
However, after the first
round of admissions comes out,

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.060
the admissions reverts
to the local school.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.240
And at that point,
pleasant persistence

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:07.140
can make a difference.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.820
111, your school, I
didn't put it in the book,

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.060
but it's moving in
the right direction.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.290
So I would give
it another visit.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.680
And I also want to encourage
you to go to insideschools.org

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.611
and not School Digger
and, you know--

00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:23.361
AUDIENCE: Will do.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:26.007
Thank you.

00:39:26.007 --> 00:39:28.117
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming today.

00:39:28.117 --> 00:39:29.950
We're a big fan of your
books and your site.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.140
CLARA HEMPHILL: Thank you.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.556
AUDIENCE: Just a
general question.

00:39:31.556 --> 00:39:33.950
What's a trend that you
like in public schools,

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.715
and what's a trend you're
not so happy about?

00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:38.090
CLARA HEMPHILL:
Oh, well, I think

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.070
pre-K is wonderful, right?

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.199
I mean, I paid $12,000
for nursery school

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:44.240
when my kids were little.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.990
So I think that's
a wonderful trend.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.690
I think the trend towards
progressive education

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.470
is a good one.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.290
I think children
learn through doing.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.180
They learn through play.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.850
They learn by putting
together blocks.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:03.140
They learn engineering and math
skills with blocks and Lego.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.160
So I like classrooms that
have a lot of blocks and Lego,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.910
rather than classrooms
for the little kids

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.580
that have lots of pencil
and paper exercises.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.670
I like schools where
the children read what

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:15.050
they call authentic literature.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.000
That is children's
picture books and books

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.560
that you might read for fun.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.710
I think the extent to
which that's increasing.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.590
I think is a very good idea.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.390
What I don't like
is the obsession

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.520
with standardized tests.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.330
Some schools have become
just test prep hell

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.200
where the kids work for
hours and hours and hours

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.774
learning how to fill
out bubble sheets.

00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:40.482
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.310
I have maybe two
questions, if there's time,

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.200
about reading between
the lines on a school.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.610
One question is,
how do you determine

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.480
if a school is improving?

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.200
Because you mentioned
how it's not about

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.440
where the school has been.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.450
CLARA HEMPHILL: That's
a really good question.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:07.840
In terms of data, I look to see
if enrollment is increasing.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.740
That's usually a sign of
parents voting with their feet.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.930
I look to see if
attendance is improving.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.885
Before the test scores
go up, you've got to--

00:41:16.885 --> 00:41:19.480
some of the public schools
have very, very high rates

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.400
of absenteeism.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.380
And that's a sign
that the kids are not

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.660
happy to be there,
and so when you

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.190
see the attendance going up.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:33.500
The most important thing
is an effective principal,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.280
hands down.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.690
A good principal will
attract good teachers

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.720
and encourage them to
work together as a team.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.780
A bad principal can dismantle
a good school just as quickly.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.030
So leadership is all, and you
can usually feel the difference

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.570
within about a couple of weeks
of the new principal coming

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.590
to town.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:42:00.260
So in terms of the data, we do
look at teacher satisfaction

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.690
with the principal is
one thing to look at,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.480
which we have on our website.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.650
And those are the
signs that a school is

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.560
moving in the right direction.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:20.150
Again, schools
that are improving

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.850
start getting better
in the lower grades

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:24.920
and build up one by one.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.960
So if you see a good
pre-K and kindergarten

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.010
but the fifth grade is not
so hot, that may be OK.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.880
It could be that they're
building from the bottom up.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.870
So look for the lower grades.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.550
Is that helpful?

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.591
AUDIENCE: That was great.

00:42:41.591 --> 00:42:43.130
Another quick question then.

00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:49.090
So speaking of someone
who would be parents

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:54.110
of mixed-race children,
I'm thinking of,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.710
how could you determine if
there's the educational quality

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.769
available for all children?

00:42:58.769 --> 00:43:00.560
Because sometimes some
schools we looked at

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.760
we'd think some anxiety if, oh,
their rating on School Crusher

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.750
or whatever--

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.900
their rating on some
other website is high,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.810
but then they see like really
significant segregation

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.060
at the gas levels
of other things.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.820
So how could you read into
whether it's a good education

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.120
for all of the students there?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.310
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, I
talk to parents about that.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:22.910
It's funny.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:26.180
I went to PS 75, which
was one of my slides,

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.300
with an African-American
staff member, and 166.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.290
75 is mostly black and Latino,
and 166 is mostly white.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.200
And she felt right
away a different vibe

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.210
in the building
about how welcoming

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.120
they are to people of color.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:50.960
But a lot of the schools
that are multi-racial do

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.140
have lots of
multi-racial families

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.060
also, because for them
it's very important.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.710
You know, if you have a black
mother and a white father,

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.980
you may not want your child
in an all black school,

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.590
but you don't want your child
in an all white school either.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.995
So I would ask for the parents.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.530
I should have brought--

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:19.070
I'll send you a link to our
report on integrated schools

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.650
that work, which is on the
Center for New York City

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.700
Affairs website.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.760
And one of the things
that really matters

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.584
is that the principal wants
the school to be integrated.

00:44:30.584 --> 00:44:32.500
You'd be surprised at
the number of principals

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.410
who really don't care and are
happy with whatever the status

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.242
quo is.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.360
I'm in the middle of
going through the process

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.465
with my four-year-old.

00:44:46.465 --> 00:44:48.590
So I was just wondering if
you had any more insight

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.100
or could explain more about
the wait list situation

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.200
and how that movement works.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.170
Because being in
May now, and we're

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.294
on the wait list at
five different programs.

00:44:59.294 --> 00:45:01.460
CLARA HEMPHILL: Wait list
at five different programs

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.570
for pre-K, or for--

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.110
AUDIENCE: For pre-K,
and our wait lists,

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.380
when I call the schools,
we're like 114 on the list

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.070
and number 42 on the list.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.682
And--

00:45:12.682 --> 00:45:14.640
CLARA HEMPHILL: For pre-K
you're talking about.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:14.910
AUDIENCE: For pre-K.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.493
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah,
when I was being

00:45:16.493 --> 00:45:19.160
blase about the wait lists, I
was talking about kindergarten.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:19.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.229
CLARA HEMPHILL: Pre-K it's a
whole different kettle of fish.

00:45:22.229 --> 00:45:26.910
You might have 18 seats and
500 kids, applying, so--

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.224
AUDIENCE: So those
lists don't move then.

00:45:29.224 --> 00:45:30.390
CLARA HEMPHILL: They don't--

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.090
let's talk afterwards
a little bit

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.804
about your particular situation.

00:45:33.804 --> 00:45:35.720
AUDIENCE: And then how
do you manage between--

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.050
so because pre-K is so
different than kindergarten,

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.336
my understanding from
everyone I hear that is you

00:45:41.336 --> 00:45:43.669
have to go through this all
over again for kindergarten.

00:45:43.669 --> 00:45:45.200
CLARA HEMPHILL: Isn't it awful?

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.450
Do you believe it?

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.620
Yeah, and then middle
school and high school too.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.420
AUDIENCE: So how
do you even plan

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.410
what pre-K you would want
to go to for consistency's

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:55.847
sake for your kid?

00:45:55.847 --> 00:45:57.680
CLARA HEMPHILL: I mean,
consistency is nice.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.380
It would be great.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.370
AUDIENCE: So you just--
it's not realistic.

00:46:03.535 --> 00:46:04.910
CLARA HEMPHILL:
I talk to parents

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:08.870
who have private nursery
school for the three-year-old

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.630
and then public pre-K
for the four-year-old

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.960
and then a public school
for when he's five.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.130
And moving three times in three
years would drive me nuts.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.710
So I can understand--

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.780
I think continuity
is probably worth

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:26.367
spending a little money for if
you have to, but more for you

00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:27.200
than for your child.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.320
I mean, I think your child
will probably adjust.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.770
The pre-K situation, it's only
been around for two years.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.460
They created 70,000 seats
practically overnight.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.525
That it's functioning
is a miracle.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.169
But certain
neighborhoods this city,

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.460
there are just long wait lists.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.300
And they haven't
figured it out yet.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.300
AUDIENCE: It's shocking.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.050
But thank you.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.320
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, sorry.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.710
Yeah.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:52.990
AUDIENCE: So you
said several times,

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.698
the principal's the
most important thing.

00:46:54.698 --> 00:46:56.990
And you said, the principal
can make it happen.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.950
The school across
the street from us--

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.122
it's PS 38, the
Pacific in Brooklyn--

00:47:01.122 --> 00:47:02.580
all the comments
talk about trouble

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.060
with the administration and
the principal not being good.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.559
Is there something that you can
do about that, or is it just

00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:10.316
you avoid the school,
or I don't know--

00:47:10.316 --> 00:47:11.690
CLARA HEMPHILL:
Parents can lobby

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.580
to get rid of a principal.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.880
They succeeded at 282,
which is in Park Slope,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.180
not too far from you.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.270
At 38, they're trying to
work around the principal.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.040
There are a couple
of schools that

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.010
managed to build
a cohesive staff

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.580
despite an inadequate principal.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.470
But then you have
to figure out why--

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:38.060
some parents have also gotten
rid of terrible district

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.290
superintendents.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.040
In Washington Heights,
parents united to get rid of.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.512
So, yeah, get rid of or work
around are the two answers.

00:47:46.512 --> 00:47:47.970
AUDIENCE: Does
working around work?

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.295
Would you think that
school can be functional,

00:47:49.295 --> 00:47:50.920
or is it really it's
kind of in trouble

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.154
with a principle like that?

00:47:52.154 --> 00:47:54.570
CLARA HEMPHILL: I think you
should talk to the parents who

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.740
are there every day.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.965
I agree with your assessment.

00:47:59.965 --> 00:48:01.340
That said, there
are some parents

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.923
who are very happy
with the situation.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.570
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
go back a little bit

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.920
to the gifted and very high
functioning district school

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.420
question.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.682
So I went to a public magnet
school that was amazing,

00:48:14.682 --> 00:48:16.390
and it was a really
good experience, very

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.935
along the lines of Stuyvesant.

00:48:20.725 --> 00:48:22.630
And where I came from,
there was definitely

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.280
a concept of feeder
schools, that there

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.117
were middle schools
that gave rise

00:48:26.117 --> 00:48:27.700
to most of the high
schools, and there

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.283
were elementary
schools that gave rise

00:48:29.283 --> 00:48:30.640
to most of the middle schools.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.190
Is there a feeder
school style setup

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.580
here for the high schools?

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:35.860
CLARA HEMPHILL: Alas, yes.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.530
CLARA HEMPHILL: Another
one of our reports

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.630
on the Center for New
York City Affairs website

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.250
shows you what middle school
feeders there are to Stuyvesant

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.830
and Brooklyn Tech and the
specialized high schools.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.120
So yes, but you don't have
to worry in kindergarten.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:52.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.670
CLARA HEMPHILL: I think.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.086
AUDIENCE: But I
guess do they tend

00:48:55.086 --> 00:48:57.940
to be the sort of really
good neighborhood schools,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.735
or do they tend to be gifted
schools, or is it a mix?

00:49:00.735 --> 00:49:02.860
CLARA HEMPHILL: Don't worry
about it in elementary.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.419
CLARA HEMPHILL: You know,
call me in five years,

00:49:05.419 --> 00:49:07.330
and we'll work it out.

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.790
I'm not pretending the system
is equitable and works well

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.450
for everybody.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.484
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:12.484 --> 00:49:14.650
CLARA HEMPHILL: We have
three more minutes, I guess.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.249
Yes.

00:49:15.249 --> 00:49:16.790
AUDIENCE: OK, so I
grew up in Europe,

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.206
and I'm a lot more familiar
with the school systems there.

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:20.920
A lot of things
are different here.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.795
Two things that we
haven't really touched on.

00:49:22.795 --> 00:49:27.730
One of them was that we learned
that classes get new teachers

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.600
every year instead of
one teacher taking them

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.120
throughout the first
five years of school.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.440
Is that true across the
board in most public schools,

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.020
or are there differences,
or what's your opinion?

00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:45.250
CLARA HEMPHILL:
Some schools have

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:49.090
what they call looping, which is
I teach kindergarten this year

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.016
and first grade next
year, and then I

00:49:51.016 --> 00:49:52.890
go back to kindergarten
and then first grade.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.420
So you have the same
teacher for two years.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.107
And if you put looping
into our search engine,

00:50:00.107 --> 00:50:01.690
you might find some
schools like that.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.670
Or in the book you can see some.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.560
The other thing that
a few schools have

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.810
is what they call
bridge classes, where

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.440
you have both kindergarten and
first grade in one classroom,

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.960
and you stay in that classroom
with the same teacher for two

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.010
years.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.670
So we do have some of that.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.820
Rudolf Steiner
School is private.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:23.290
It's the only one I
know of that keeps

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.500
the kids for the whole of
their elementary school.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.780
The New American Academy might
do that as well in Brooklyn.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.530
I think they may have
that European model.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.696
AUDIENCE: But you don't
think there's value in that,

00:50:34.696 --> 00:50:37.370
or it's just not common, or--

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.020
CLARA HEMPHILL: Oh, sure, I
mean, like any of these things,

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.017
there's advantages
and drawbacks.

00:50:43.017 --> 00:50:45.100
AUDIENCE: And the other
thing I wanted to touch on

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.410
is about the PTA,
where people ask

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.490
how they can get involved and
do something for the school.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.840
I sort of want to
ask the opposite.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.270
In Europe, schools work, and you
can get involved a little bit.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:51:00.190
But I sometimes feel there
is an expectation or pressure

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.780
for people to get involved.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.760
And even though this isn't
like a private preschool,

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.237
that parents who don't get
involved are called out,

00:51:09.237 --> 00:51:09.820
or it's like--

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.891
I'm wondering how this happens.

00:51:11.891 --> 00:51:13.390
CLARA HEMPHILL:
This, I think it's--

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:16.360
I mean, the other difference
between the United States

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.750
and Europe is that
our schools are

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:24.220
supported through local
taxes, mostly property taxes.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.730
And in most countries
of the world,

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.610
it's a national system
where all the teachers

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.070
get the same pay and the schools
all get the same resources.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.280
So what we do in
New York City is

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.440
we have these insane PTAs that
raise a million dollars a year.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.600
I agree with you
that it's lunacy.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.500
Some schools will pressure you.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.710
Some actually have a kind of
parents stay out attitude.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.122
So it varies from
school to school.

00:51:57.122 --> 00:51:57.950
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.260
CLARA HEMPHILL: Yeah, I
mean, I agree with you.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:51:59.950
It's ridiculous.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.374
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:03.790
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on dual-language programs

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:08.242
and how effective they are for
native speakers of English?

00:52:08.242 --> 00:52:09.700
CLARA HEMPHILL:
Very good question,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.920
so in the index of
the book, you'll

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.330
find dual-language programs.

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:20.020
There's Chinese, Spanish,
Polish, Italian, Haitian

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.320
Creole, French, Mandarin.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.470
There's even one
in Korean as well.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.790
And the way they're
supposed to be designed

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:34.960
is half the children speak
English at home, half of them

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.320
speak the other language, and
they alternate the language

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.150
of instruction from day to day.

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:43.510
And the kids are supposed to
be fluent in both languages

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.150
by the time they're
in fifth grade.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.450
Some of them work
very well indeed.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.090
It also depends on the language.

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:55.900
I think Chinese
and Korean are very

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.330
hard for non-native
speakers to learn just

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.920
in that six hours a day.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.640
Some of the successful
Chinese dual-language programs

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.989
continue until 5 o'clock
in the afternoon,

00:53:05.989 --> 00:53:07.030
particularly for writing.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:08.170
That's difficult.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:11.350
For Spanish, I think
non-native speakers

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.470
come out doing pretty well.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.050
And there's also,
like everything else,

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:18.337
there's a range of quality.

00:53:18.337 --> 00:53:20.420
Some of them it's just
sort of a little smattering

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.340
in the language.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.430
You'll learn to sing some songs.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.720
Others are you really learn
to write and spell and speak

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.860
about science in
the second language.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.160
So there's a range there.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.550
So it's 1 o'clock.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.300
I think we have to wrap up.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.910
So thank you so much for coming.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.060
[APPLAUSE]
