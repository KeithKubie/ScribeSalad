00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Hey guys, we are back in the lab again for another silicone casting experiment

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.980
You might remember in a previous video, I tried casting some of these pokéballs with silicone.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.080
And the problem we ended up having was bubbles that got trapped in the rubber, which transferred to all the success of castings.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.260
So in this video, we're gonna try recasting these pokéballs, and see if we can get rubber molds that are completely bubble-free.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.960
So in a follow up video, we made this thing, this is a vacuum chamber that's designed to suck the air out the silicone before we pour it.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.080
So in this video we're gonna put it all to the test, we've got our vacuum chamber, we've got our pokéballs and we've got some more silicone.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.540
So let's get busy in making some more rubber molds.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.100
Now I showed you in a previous experiment that you could use glass cookie jars as your vacuum chamber, but for this experiment I'm going back to my pressure pot.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.180
Because its wide enough to accept this popcorn dish that I found at the dollar store, this is only about a buck

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.240
And it fits perfectly inside the container here, you can see the lid fits on and everything's flush.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.720
And because it's paper, it's disposable which means a very easy cleanup.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.900
Alright, update guys we got our pokéballs set and positioned and I took a little bit of a different approach this time, let me show you what I did.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.540
First of all I took the Pokéballs and set them upright, so the button is facing towards the ceiling, this way if there are any accidental air bubbles trapped inside, they should be able to follow the lines and escape.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:24.560
Second of all I took some clay and made and made a big base around the bottom, and this is to help form a reservoir, so when we're pouring molten gummy, wax, or molten aluminium it'll have a reservoir to draw from as it cools and keep the pokéballs full.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.360
Hopefully with those improvements, we can make ourselves some perfect silicone moulds.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.300
So now we can mix up a new batch of silicone and use our vacuum chamber, to suck the air bubbles out, then as we pour it we want to pour it in a long thin stream far away from the Pokéball itself.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.580
As the liquid level rises, it should push any trapped air out and give us a perfect silicone casting.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.460
Oh, it's so satisfying.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600
We've got our silicone and our catalyst blended, but it's full of air bubbles.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.120
So now we're gonna transfer it to this popcorn container, stick it inside our vacuum chamber and suck those air bubbles out.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.800
Now we actually wanna fill this up about a third of the way for my understanding, cause the air bubbles are going to go crazy! And unfortunately that's more than a third of the way.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.660
So we're gonna have to be very careful.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.500
Let's go ahead and extract these bubbles.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.760
[Vacuum chamber starting]

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.420
Now I can actually regulate the airflow here.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.320
You can see its digging deep down the silicone now and pulling out all those bubbles.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.220
[AHH]

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.200
It's not giving them the chance to pop

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.160
Oops, uh oh.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.440
(laughs)

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.560
Made a mess!

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.600
Ok, so lesson that we just learned, when you're putting silicone in a vacuum chamber you only want to use about one third of liquid, because the bubbles will rise up and contaminate everything.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.460
If there's not enough space for the bubbles to come up and start popping, they're gonna hit the lid and everything will deflate it's just gonna repeat the process.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.320
So you need to leave enough of a gap that the bubbles come up, and have a chance to escape.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.940
Ooh, that was close, that was close...

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.520
And that right there my friends is the magic.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.800
So that's kind of cool, if I move it around I can actually like access different parts of the silicone and get that going faster.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.200
Oh wow, that looks amazing!

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.220
Its very cool, the way that, that churns.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.420
You can see its digging deep down in the silicone now and pulling out all those bubbles.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.660
The longer we let this sit, the more air is gonna come out.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:09.700
And ideally it'll get to the point where there are no more bubbles whatsoever. But I'm a little nervous on timing because I wanna get this silicone poured before it actually sets up, so I might just take it out now and pour it, there we go.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.560
It looks like it"s ready!

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560
We've sucked out quite a few of the air bubbles here

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.560
and now i'm excited to see what difference this makes

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.700
now as we pour this, the key is to pour a long thin strand next to the Pokéball

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.460
but as far away from it as we can get

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.120
we don't actually want it going on the pokeball itself

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.960
you can see that I've painted a thin layer of silicone

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.400
into some of the problem areas

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400
so that as the bubbles rise it wont get trapped up there

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.740
Slow and steady wins the race

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.000
that might even be too much

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.820
slow down Grant

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.780
Oh dang!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.480
I'm messy

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.040
that's looking beautiful

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.040
oh my gosh that is looking beautiful

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.380
so cool guys our molds

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.340
are filled up to the top

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.600
and these are actually looking better than I've ever seen before

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
in fact if you look if you look at the surface of these molds

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600
it almost looks like a crystal clear lake

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.340
reflecting everything perfectly

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.960
which is a really good sign it means we probably don't  have any bubbles in there

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.000
now there are a couple of lessons I learned while doing this experiment today

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.020
number one I wouldn't of mixed the whole batch of silicone at once

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.380
working with so much silicone is very difficult

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.520
and we are fighting the clock because this stuff sets up in about 30 minutes

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.780
so if you try this yourself divide your silicone into different batches

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.780
mix them one at a time

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.660
number 2 when your mixing this it's been suggested to mix it by hand

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.660
because you will introduce less air by doing that

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.760
by using something like these mixing beaters that I was using

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
it's actually pumping a ton of air into there

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760
which means it takes a lot longer in the vacuum chamber

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.640
to extract all those bubbles back out

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.260
so if you have the option don't use a mixing beater mix your silicone by hand

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.660
so that's it for today because these things are gonna need about 24 hours to cure

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.060
so we are gonna let them set over night and we'll take a look at the final result tommorow

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.860

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.060
shoot... made a mess

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.860
