00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:12.296
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hey Dude, how are you?

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.606
&gt;&gt; Dude: I'm not doing too well.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:18.246
I'm trying to figure which device to
use to turn off the gas-o-matic module

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.426
and stop Buddy from growing too big.

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:22.486
But I don't know how to choose!

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.986
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hmm, well choosing the right
device for your system can be pretty hard.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.766
Why don't we work on this together?

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:32.106
&gt;&gt; Dude: That would be great.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:34.516
I am just going around in circles here.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.346
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well I'd suggest
that you use a digital device

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:42.176
to turn off the gas-o-matic module
when Buddy got to a certain size.

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:43.106
&gt;&gt; Dude: What's that?

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:49.616
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well let's start with the basics,
all digital devices have inputs and outputs

00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:54.136
that are always in one of
two states: either ON or OFF.

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:59.116
People who work with electrical devices
sometimes call the two states HIGH

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:03.686
and LOW because of the high or low voltages
that the devices receive or produce.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:09.626
Other people think of the two states as
true/false or as the numbers 1 and 0.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.045
It really doesn't matter.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:15.186
What's important for us is that if you
hook up the output of a digital device

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:19.936
to the gas-o-matic, when the device
produces a high signal, Buddy will inflate.

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:23.946
When the device produces a low
signal, Buddy will stop inflating

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.186
and he'll just stay the same size for a while.

00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:28.806
&gt;&gt; Dude: That's cool but
why make just two states?

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:32.726
Wouldn't it be cooler to make buddy get
bigger really fast at first and then slowed

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.836
down when he's close to full size?

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:37.596
I really don't want to see him
growing out of control like before.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.666
Couldn't we build an even more
interesting system from devices

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.166
with more states, like three or even ten?

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:48.765
&gt;&gt; Sally: Those are all really interesting ideas
but here's why two states makes the most sense.

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:54.246
Let's imagine that you're measuring the output
signal from your digital device over time.

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:59.196
Depending on what the input to the
digital device is, the output will switch

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.636
between its two possible states ON and OFF.

00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:06.826
But of course, this drawing
is actually a bit misleading.

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:12.076
See all digital devices, whether they are
genetic devices or electrical devices,

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:17.356
never produce a signal that is perfectly
ON or perfectly OFF like I've drawn here.

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:20.546
There are always some minor
fluctuations in the signal.

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:24.406
These fluctuations aren't real
changes in state of course.

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:29.336
But sometimes, if the fluctuations are too
big, then they might tell the gas-o-matic

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:31.796
to switch on when you really want it off.

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:33.406
&gt;&gt; Dude: Oh no.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.756
I definitely don't want that.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.566
It took forever to clean up the
lab last time that happened.

00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:42.886
So the reason we limit the devices to two states
is because they work better when there's noise?

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:44.216
&gt;&gt; Sally: Exactly!

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:46.986
&gt;&gt; Dude: And you think Buddy's growth is noisy?

00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:47.996
&gt;&gt; Sally: Definitely!

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:50.386
He changes a little just when he breathes.

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:54.966
And he can grow and shrink a lot depending on
how much food he has and what's around him.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:59.055
And sometimes I think he
changes size just to show off...

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.156
&gt;&gt; Dude: So it sounds like
digital devices are the way to go!

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:07.236
It will tell the gas-o-matic device to turn
on if Buddy's really growing and turn off

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:11.326
if he's full size, but ignore those
in between size fluctuations he likes

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:15.966
to make...but how big are the
fluctuations that the device will ignore?

00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:17.736
How does it know?

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.836
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well the device
only knows what we tell it,

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:24.246
and we can split up ON and
OFF the way we choose.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:28.016
&gt;&gt; Dude: OK then...I'll put
the ON/OFF border here!

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:30.746
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude, weren't you listening!

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:35.616
If the signal is somewhere near this boundary
and noisy, then the device will from switch

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:39.396
ON to OFF or OFF to ON when
you don't want it to.

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:40.136
Here's what we can do.

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:43.366
Let's call just this small
part the "valid" signals

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:47.026
and leave all this in between
as "invalid" signals.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:52.606
That way the device won't confuse ON signal
values with OFF signal values so easily.

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:54.516
&gt;&gt; Dude: Aw Sally.

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:56.296
Maybe I'm not getting this at all.

00:03:56.746 --> 00:04:00.596
It looks like you just put in two boundaries
and now you've got twice as much trouble.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:06.026
What's to stop the noise from switching between
valid and invalid signals here AND here?

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:09.356
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude, I actually think
you've got the hang of this.

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:15.576
Here's the trick that engineers use: make the
valid output ranges smaller than the input!

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:20.036
This way the quality of the output
signal is always better than the quality

00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:25.426
of the input signal and even if there is noise
on the input, the digital device will get rid

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:28.036
of it but producing a better output signal.

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:33.196
This trick even has a name: Engineers call
the difference between the valid input

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:35.566
and output ranges the noise margin.

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:37.196
&gt;&gt; Dude: Noise margins.

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.016
I like it!

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:41.736
Digital devices sound wicked useful.

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:43.856
But can we really build them out of DNA?

00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:47.726
&gt;&gt; Sally: Some have already been
built I can show you how they work

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.596
in some cells I've got growing in the lab.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:53.576
The DNA device you want may be
there already and ready to go.

00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:56.146
Do you have some time to come to the lab now?

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.356
&gt;&gt; Dude: Can I answer in digital?
