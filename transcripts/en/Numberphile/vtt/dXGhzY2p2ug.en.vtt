00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.560
BRADY HARAN: I want to share
with you some more one roll

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.650
Yahtzees, which have been sent
in by a number of our viewers.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.090
And there's a few reasons
I want to share these.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.380
Firstly, because
I said I would.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.710
People have gone to a lot of
trouble making these videos,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.800
and I really think we
should share them.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.470
Secondly, it's a pretty
cool thing to see.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.940
You'll remember from previous
videos, there's only a 1 in

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.690
1,296 chance of rolling one,
so when you get it, it's

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.960
pretty good.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.190
And lastly, I think it's
fascinating to see how people

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.310
react when they finally
roll one.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030
MALE SPEAKER: Yes!

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.990
BRADY HARAN: So let's
go through some

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.380
more of your videos.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.960
Some of them are quite funny.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.800
Some of them, well, some of
them are a bit strange.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
Here, Anthony rolls five 4's.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.025
ANTHONY: There it is.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.830
BRADY HARAN: A bit over par
there, but what an effort.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.310
And how's this for a reaction
from Bill Vincent?

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.794
[GASP]

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:04.044
BILL: I did it!

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.640
Did you actually?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.860
BILL: Yes!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.000
BRADY HARAN: Now, here's the
Benton family going for glory.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.790
I'm not sure the kids were too
into it, to be honest perhaps

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.390
it was a chance to
stay up late.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.870
If so, their luck was out,
because it only took 54 rolls.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.020
Jacob here hit pretty much a par
score of 1,300 rolls, but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140
what a reaction.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.480
JACOB: Oh!

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.540
Oh!

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.080
Oh!

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.886
I did it

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:36.893
MALE SPEAKER: Oh my god!

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:37.859
JACOB: I didn't pay attention.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.308
I was about to pick it up.

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:40.760
I was about to pick it up.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.600
BRADY HARAN: James Foster
here hit the jackpot

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.770
with his 802nd roll.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.010
And I know it took him 802
rolls, because he sent me

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.710
every single one of
them in real time.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.430
Jesse Davis thought many hands
would make light work.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.870
Clever thinking, but remarkably,
it took them a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.710
combined 5,064 rolls until
this happened.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.990
17-year-old Josh looks like he
broke out the fancy bowl for

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.910
this attempt.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.470
Now, Lorenzo here did
it with software.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.780
I don't think that's quite
getting into the spirit of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.000
things, but clever anyway.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.250
Here's Matthew.

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:20.730
MATTHEW: I did it.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.900
I did it.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.080
BRADY HARAN: Yes, yes you did.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.055
And another Matthew, who really
put in the hard yards.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:30.710
MATTEW: 1639.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.910
And 1639, there it is.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.610
BRADY HARAN: And now,
two Tylers.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.580
1,471 rolls, and two handed
Tyler, who did

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.820
it in just 245 rolls.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.590
TYLER: Yes!

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.830
BRADY HARAN: Now, Mike Tilly
here started with a plate.

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:59.780
He clearly got sick of the
noise, and there was a lot of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.490
it, because here we go.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.214
3,951 rolls until this.

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:08.705
MIKE: Yes!

00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:10.075
I got it!

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.340
BRADY HARAN: Now, patient Pauli
was rewarded with my

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.980
favorite Yahtzee.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.230
Five 6's.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.330
And another all sixer, but this
one took just 143 rolls.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.460
Hello, Rochelle.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.110
RACHEL: Hi, Brady.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.410
I'm sitting around at
home waiting for the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.480
police to call me back.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.800
I filed a report about some
credit card, my online report

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.760
didn't get accepted for some
reason, so I'm waiting for an

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.830
officer to call me back.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.520
That always takes forever.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.540
So I figured, while I'm waiting
around, I my as well

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.850
try to roll a Yahtzee.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.490
BRADY HARAN: Rachel's effort
took so long she even changed

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.780
hairstyles.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.790
RACHEL: 1,116 rolls.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.140
It took me two days.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.500
Here are my hash marks.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.920
So let's recap.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.970
After only 106 rolls, the
police called me back.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.700
BRADY HARAN: Robson here gets
extra points for the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.950
Numberphile branding.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.970
And for over 3 hours
of effort.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.220
Here's William Alves.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.745
And I don't know how to
pronounce your name, uh,

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:23.230
Frumet, but you were definitely
one of our more

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.310
excited dice rollers.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.190
FRUMET: I got it!

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.630
I got it!

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.854
I got five 3's!

00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:30.224
I got a Yahtzee!

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:31.474
Oh my god!

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.460
Oh my god!

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.430
BRADY HARAN: Now, Simon from
Germany, who's already

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.250
forgiven me for not being able
to pronounce his surname, did

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.355
the business in less
than two hours.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.590
SIMON: Yeah.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.180
BRADY HARAN: And here's Javier,
who rolled these

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.960
strange poker dice
2,559 times.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.420
JAVIER: Yeah!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.321
BRADY HARAN: Steven Christie
rolled these five 5's in 1,190

00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.620
rolls, but he thought that last
die looked a bit dodgy,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.080
so he had another go at
rolling a Yahtzee.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.190
And the second time, it took
him about 400 rolls.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.270
Stoe Farrell took an impressive
525 rolls

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.380
to roll five 5's.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.330
STOE: Yes!

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.400
BRADY HARAN: And he tells me
he hit 4 of a kind 11 times

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.650
before the big moment.

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:29.474
JONATHON: Oh.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:31.450
I did it.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.810
BRADY HARAN: And finally, fellow
Australian Simon Brown,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.345
and this reaction, well, it
sounds a bit familiar.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.470
SIMON: That's it.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.470
I've done it.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.360
I've rolled a Yahtzee.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.960
BRADY HARAN: I've done it.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.680
I have rolled a Yahtzee.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.630
That must be an Australian
thing.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.130
Feel free to keep sending in
your 1 roll Yahtzee's.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.577
I actually really enjoy watching
them, and you know

00:05:54.577 --> 00:05:55.827
I'll make another video.
