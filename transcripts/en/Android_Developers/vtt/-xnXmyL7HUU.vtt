00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.000
female narrator: Expanding to
new markets around the world

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.266
is a great way to find new users
and increase your revenue.

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.933
We've gathered ten tips
developers have used

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.966
to be truly local
while they go global

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.966
in order to find success.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.300
Many of these tips
apply to apps too.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.000
Going global starts with the
design of your game's code

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.800
and its screen layouts.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400
Allow for variations in
language, sentence structure,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.533
characters,
and number presentations

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.233
that you'll encounter
when localizing.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:33.533
For example, building in 30%
extra space in UI elements

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.600
will help avoid issues
in other languages.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.433
Store all the content
you'll change when localizing

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:39.733
in a resource file

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.966
so you don't have to recode
when you localize.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.700
Use system provided formats
for dates, times,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.166
numbers, and currencies

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.100
so your app automatically
matches the user's selection.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.400
Cheap, reliable data connections

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.100
aren't yet available
to everyone.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
A game that continues to run
without a data connection

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.133
can dramatically increase
its potential audience.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.500
Make your game's installation
package as small as possible.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.366
Users sometimes skip
installing big games

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.733
due to device memory
or bandwidth concerns.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.900
Understand your audience and
everything that matters to them.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.133
Look out for significant
cultural differences,

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.066
game characters, levels,
or scenarios

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.933
that could possible jar
with local sensitivities.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.800
Look out for local interests
in specific game genres--

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.333
casual games
featuring cute characters

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.500
do well in Japan and Korea,
for instance,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.766
whereas war strategy games
are big in Germany and Russia.

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.433
Look out for how local users
pay for games

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.300
and in-app content.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.333
If carrier billing is common,

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.933
monthly limits might affect
how many and how often

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.166
users make in-app purchases.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.766
There are many common
expectations

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.500
among Western markets.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.633
Here, users are more engaged

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.800
by simple character-based
game icons without words;

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.466
prefer screenshots
showing actual gameplay;

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.900
like to get started quickly and
discover new features gradually;

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.666
and a deep meta-game can keep
them coming back,

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.833
respond to item prices
ending in .99.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.933
There are also many common
expectations

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.433
among Eastern markets.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:22.400
For example, in Japan
users like casual games

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900
to have icons with cute,
colorful characters

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.633
in the anime and manga styles,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:28.433
but more hardcore game's icons

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.200
should reflect
their game's theme;

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.866
prefer colorful screenshots

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.433
that illustrate game world
content and theme;

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:37.533
engage with casual games with
a fairly steep learning curve;

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.800
expect app prices
to end in zero;

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.100
often preregister to get in-game
items as rewards.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.966
Consider this a starting point
for your own research.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.400
You should try to engage
a professional third-party

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.966
app translation service
or even your local fans

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.466
to do a high-quality translation
of your app.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.400
You can also make use
of the app translation service

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.766
in the developer console.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.866
Simply send your original text
in resource files.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.466
You don't need to amend
your development processes

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.233
to accommodate the translator.

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.066
You should also add
your Play Store listing text

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.800
so that, too, can be localized.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.566
Testing is still essential

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.866
because even small translation
errors can prove embarrassing

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:26.100
and no matter how good your
internalization efforts are,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.566
they may leave some text
truncated

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.000
or incorrectly formatted.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.966
Test via locals.

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.133
Reach out to
your user community.

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.833
You'll find a wealth
of language skills

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.800
and local knowledge there.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.600
A localized app
needs localized marketing.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.133
Local marketing can include
a localized store listing,

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.633
support from local
user community members,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.900
spreading the word in their
language on global social media

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.500
and local channels, too,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.000
a localized press pack sent out
to key media and bloggers,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.333
and localized ad campaigns

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:03.100
to kick-start local installs
and boost local launches.

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.400
Users like to get a good idea
of a game's gameplay

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.700
before they install it.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000
Adding a trailer
to your Play Store listing

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
will help them decide.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.866
When you're creating a trailer,

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.933
make sure you create
market-specific versions.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:22.533
Highlight features of the game

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.500
that will hold
most local appeal,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.300
go for a localized voiceover,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.100
or use translated subtitles
if you can't.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:36.000
The developer console
automatically translates

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.400
Google Play reviews

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.266
so you can read reviews
from users around the world.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.800
Respond to these users.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.633
Let them know
their opinions matter

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.833
and how you're incorporating
their feedback.

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.800
Users will appreciate the effort

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.700
if you can respond
in their language.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.866
You can also use beta testing

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:54.200
to test your game
and game's localization

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.966
with enthusiastic users
in a specific country

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.866
before launching more widely.

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.400
For more information
on localizing your app

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.000
and launching in local markets,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.766
head over
to the distribute section

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:06.733
of the Android developer
website.

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:09.066
If you want more tips
on how to improve your app

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.433
or game's performance

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:12.533
and build a better app business,
