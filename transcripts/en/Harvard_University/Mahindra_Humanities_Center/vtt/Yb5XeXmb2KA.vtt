00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.360
Good evening.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.510
I'm Homi Bhabha.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.420
And it's my great
pleasure to welcome you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
to this fascinating
event on origin stories.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.460
And my thanks to our
remarkable group of speakers.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.205
Stephen Greenblatt is John
Cogan University Professor

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.710
of the Humanities at Harvard.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.850
His most recent book is The
Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.550
His previous book, The
Swerve, won the Pulitzer Prize

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.480
in 2012 and the 2011 National
Book Award for Nonfiction.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.450
Kimberley Patton is Professor of
the Comparative and Historical

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
Study of Religion at the
Harvard Divinity School.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
She specializes in ancient
Greek religion and archaeology

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.890
with research interests
in archaic sanctuaries

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.950
and the iconography
of sacrifice.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.710
Her most recent book is
Religion of the Gods--

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.350
Ritual Paradox and Reflexivity.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.300
Meredith Reiches-- did I get it?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.020
Beautifully done.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.980
All right, Meredith is Assistant
Professor of Anthropology

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.100
at UMass, Boston.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.900
In her interdisciplinary
work on adolescence,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.390
she seeks to tease out
the narrative elements

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.260
in the acts of conducting
and communicating science

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.700
and to analyze the side-by-side
with literary narratives

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
of coming of age,
asking the question,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.530
what does it take to make
the transition from childhood

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
to adulthood in human society.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.940
Richard Wrangham is
Ruth B. Moore Professor

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.700
of Biological
Anthropology at Harvard

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.490
and founder of the
Kibale Chimpanzee Project

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.420
Did I say that right?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.030
He's best known for his work on
the evolution of human warfare,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.180
described in the
book, Demonic Males.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.050
And on the role of cooking
in human evolution, described

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.850
in the book, Catching Fire--

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
How Cooking Made Us Human.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.780
Amongst the many wonders of
Stephen Greenblatt's new book

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.780
is the belated invitation we
receive to the garden party.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.030
After being expelled
from paradise

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.690
at the very start of the
story, the epilogue finally

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.910
lays on the garden party at
Uganda's Kibale National Park

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.940
in the company of
the chimpanzees.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.630
And here in the Ugandan
research station,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.390
at a great distance from
Harvard's heart of darkness,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.730
for a brief fleeting
moment, time stands still.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.910
And Stephen experiences a
kind of a hedonic tranquility.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.225
Let me quote him.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:50.190
"This then I thought is what
Paradise must have been--

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.420
no permanent address, no
planting and cultivating,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.120
and, at that dizzying
height, the chimps

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.250
are up in their nests,
no predators and no fear.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.160
I had glimpsed a part
of that ancient dream

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.500
of every tree of the garden--

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.620
thou mayest freely eat.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.910
A paradisal moments,
originary and mythic,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.510
so compelling to our sense
of identity and belonging,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.410
our ancestry and its tradition,
because they are naturally

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.850
and historically
vicarious and voyeuristic.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.610
If hell is other
people, Paradise is also

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.760
other people or other places."

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.960
Reading Stephen left me
with a stray thought.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.720
Are myths of origin less
about the primal moment

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.560
of being or becoming and
more about constructing

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.910
a narrative about
recovery or rediscovering

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.530
the self, the legitimation
for a cultural and political

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920
self-fashioning?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.030
The political
identification with myths

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.250
of origins in our
times, at least,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.470
have an unnervingly atavistic
and iterative address.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.890
The fundamentalist return
to the unchanging reality

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.600
of Hindu scriptures, fables,
and myths of origin in India

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.579
today are formulated as the
recovery of a pure Hindutva

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.710
identity in the face of a
predatory secular modernity

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.840
and what they see as an
expanding Islamic hegemony.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.400
I think you could make
this argument for many

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.530
of the revivals of
origin myths now.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.980
They are the recovery
of a self in the face

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.880
of some kind of pursuit
or some kind of predation.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.030
When we ask
ourselves, who are we,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.260
why are we here, what is
the purpose of our lives

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.640
and deaths, the seeming
emphasis on origin and ontology,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.270
on person and place,
is a strange tangle

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.320
of temporality, a future
anterior whose complex

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.760
representation is of course the
aspiration of great narrative

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760
art.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.400
The poiesis of literature,
painting, ritual,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.670
and even scientific discourse.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.320
Stephen's inspired portrait
of DÃ¼rer at work on The Fall

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.580
of Man-- and I quote him, "A
figure made up of beautiful

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.180
pieces of bodies stitched
together to an idealizing

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.620
geometrical scheme,
drawn from a pagan idol,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.330
is a motif of the [INAUDIBLE] of
aesthetic assemblage that gives

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.020
the myth of Adam and
Eve its narrative powers

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.000
of refreshment, of permanence,
as well as iteration

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.370
at the same time."

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.470
Myths of origins
are often located

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.170
in spaces which become sites
of transgression and expulsion.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.550
They are concurrently
temporalities of transition.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.790
Balanced on the liminal
edge between transgression

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.790
and transition,
originary narratives

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.840
have the tensile capacity
to endure the pressure that

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.800
is required for them to
be extended, repeated,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.800
and revised in time and space.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.990
Stephen's fascination
with the trace

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.200
of loss as the locus of
invention or reinvention,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.120
of repetition as the
locus of re-recognition

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.020
is at the heart of his
work, both in The Swerve

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.080
and his reworking
of Adam and Eve.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.620
But a loss of this kind,
a loss to be found again,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.280
is strangely a gain.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.090
Recovering what is lost,
Stephen once wrote,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.780
requires that, and I quote
him, "one to venture out

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.060
to unfamiliar cultural texts.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.910
And these texts, often marginal,
odd, fragmentary, unexpected,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.180
and crude, in turn could begin
to interact in interesting ways

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.620
with the intimately familiar
works of the literary canon."

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.390
The panel today, of
course, precisely

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.860
illustrates this point.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.190
Unfamiliar cultural
texts that Stephen

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.920
has turned into
neighbors and friends

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.910
and sometimes antagonists coming
together for what I'm sure

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.100
will be a very
illuminating discussion.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.288
Thank you all very much
for being here today.

00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:32.264
[APPLAUDING]

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.260
Thank you.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.000
Thank you so much, Homi, for
the eloquent introduction,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.440
and to the Mahindra Center
for hosting this occasion.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.410
Homi asked me now
some time ago if I

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.640
would like to do something
at the Mahindra Center

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.874
to mark the publication of
my book on Adam and Eve.

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:00.290
And that was very
gracious of him.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.020
And I said, I would
love to do something.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.670
If we could possibly think
of a way of bringing together

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:13.670
my particular literary
interests with theology

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.570
and with evolutionary biology
and with anthropology.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.100
And marvelously here we are.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.850
What we propose to do is speak
very, very briefly, each of us,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.400
for eight to 10 minutes.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.419
And then have some
conversation among ourselves

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.230
in the mode of the garden party.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.280
And then open the floor
up to questions from you.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.740
So I will say just a few things
briefly about my own interests,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.160
which--

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.930
as I suppose, befits my
disciplinary training--

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.850
have to do with fascination
with stories, with narrative,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.140
and with extremely powerful
stories of which this

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.330
is probably the single
most spectacular

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.090
in the Western tradition
of a story that

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.950
had enormous impact,
consequences,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.140
and diffusion in the
world of the Near East

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:24.140
and the West, especially
the Christian world.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.870
The story which
originates, as you I'm sure

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.440
know, in the Hebrew world,
probably in an oral culture

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.480
that precedes the invention of
what we think of as Judaism,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.860
but goes back probably
well before that.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.040
The story gets picked up,
told, in the Book of Genesis,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:50.510
gets embraced after considerable
argument by Christianity.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.010
Gets transmitted and enters also
the Muslim world, and therefore

00:09:55.010 --> 00:10:00.200
penetrates very fully over
an enormous population

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.870
and a huge amount of time.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.990
It's a story that,
as origin stories do,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.200
it's a story, in this case,
and in the very tiny compass,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.960
attempts to explain a great
many things, almost everything.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.210
Certainly, the origin
of our species, also

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:30.890
species dominance, which is
announced in the Genesis story.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.650
It attempts to explain,
or at least give you

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.570
a depiction of the
origin of pair bonding,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.370
culminating in that moment
at which the woman is brought

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.220
to the man, evidently
taken from the man's body,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.530
but brought back to him, after
what the ancient rabbis thought

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.590
was possibly an abortive
attempt to introduce Adam

00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:00.830
to the other animals and have
one of them chosen as his mate.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:06.690
Then, of course, transgression,
and then the origin of shame--

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:12.030
so that a somatic, as well as
a moral or ethical problem.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.320
The nature of labor--

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.110
why we have to work and sweat.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.170
Why women experience
excruciating pain

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.740
in childbirth.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.150
Why we die.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.840
Why the world
doesn't keep us going

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.510
and we can't continue
in the world.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.420
And then a suite of
issues, as so many

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.570
of these issues that
I'm describing have,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:43.600
problems that are in the
boundary between ethics

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.790
and biology,
including what appears

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:57.900
to be a curse or a punishment,
as it's described in the Bible,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.750
of male domination of women.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.940
And then what again
the Bible singles out

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.370
is something to
think about, the fact

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.720
that women continue to
desire the creatures who

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.030
dominate them.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.900
It's one of the strangest
things about the Genesis account

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:23.370
is that strange half
a verse, Genesis 3:16,

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.711
in which whoever told
the story thought

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.960
that it needed explanation,
that it shouldn't be taken

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.570
for granted, that
men dominate women,

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.750
or that women desire men
in those circumstances,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:40.050
but needed to be explained as
a punishment for transgression.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.290
That's worth
reflecting, I think,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.960
on, at least it is for
me, a source of surprise.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.030
And it was even a source of
surprise for many commentators

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.030
in the 17th century.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:01.500
In 17th century, a era when this
issue was focused on, of course

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.080
it upset the male
theologians who

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.440
said of course the men were
intended to dominate women,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.030
even in paradise.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.580
It's just that women would
have enjoyed it more then,

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.690
The experience of
finding it disagreeable

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.310
must be part of the punishment.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:22.800
In any case, these issues
are among the reasons

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.690
why Joseph coronary
in Art History

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:34.050
and I have taught this course
in the general education

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.420
program of ethical
reasoning, because you

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.210
can watch the
story as it evolves

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.520
as a story about a long-term
project of human attempt

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.840
to understand ethical life.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.580
That project, which
continues actually

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.610
into the 19th and 20th
century, and much of Homi

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.810
said in introducing us about the
liminal or transitional moment,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.130
is precisely what obsessed,
for example, Kierkegaard

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.670
in thinking about how you would
get from innocence to guilt

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.540
or culpability, what kind of
threshold you'd have to cross.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.480
That kind of ethical thinking,
philosophical thinking,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.590
doesn't involve believing
the story in any sense

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.880
is literally true.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:28.080
But my own book is about the
long-term and extraordinary

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.940
project, especially
in Christian culture,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.100
and especially in Christian
culture after St. Augustine,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.800
to believe that
the story can make

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.700
people believe that the
story is literally true.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.360
So to defeat, in
effect, the allegorists,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.820
whether they were
Jews like Philo

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.960
or Christians like
Origen, and to make

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.070
a central doctrine of the faith
be the literal interpretation

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.690
of the story of Adam and Eve.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.870
And that continues all the
way into our present world

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.550
in which, if we can
believe the polls,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.970
40% of our fellow countrymen
in the United States

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.340
profess to believe in the
literal truth of the story,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.870
even though it's
rather difficult

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.100
to coordinate that literal
belief with virtually

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.330
everything that we know about
the world since at least

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.300
the late 18th century.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:31.230
So the project of making it
literal, of making it real,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.910
as it was understood
by the Renaissance,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.180
is at the very
center of my book.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:42.540
And that plot, which I won't
take the time to describe now,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.260
has to do with serious
people grappling

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.030
with what it means to
make anything real,

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.620
but particularly
this story real,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.190
a story about a naked man
and woman and a talking

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.690
snake in a magical
garden with weird trees

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.350
is not obviously to
be taken literally.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.850
And that was true 2,000 or
3,000 years ago, as well.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.280
They weren't actually
dumber than we are.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.250
So they understood that the
story has all the elements

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.740
of a fairy tale or myth.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.190
And to make people actually
think that it is literally true

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.730
required an enormous
effort of will,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.930
but also of intelligence,
symbolic intelligence,

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.690
and also of art-making.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:37.620
So that it's a triumph finally
of Renaissance technology

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.945
to actually give us DÃ¼rer's
Adam and Eve or Michelangelo

00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:44.940
or Titian, but also to give
us Milton's Adam and Eve,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.670
to give us creatures who seem
actually to be taken literally,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.940
to be evidence of the
reality of this story.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.200
And those attempts
had to grapple

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.530
with the set of things that are
extremely difficult, difficult

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.099
already before Darwin came
along in the 19th century

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.890
to blow the whole thing open.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.579
But questions, for
example, about how

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.000
creatures who evidently
did not know what death

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.970
was, because there was
no death in the garden,

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.310
could ever understand
what death was.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.380
Or how you begin to speak
if you are apparently

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.020
born into the world as an
adult without an infancy

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.340
or a childhood.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:38.100
Or what it would mean
to obey a prohibition if

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.540
the prohibition
actually kept you

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.300
from knowing the difference
between good and evil--

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.400
just lies at the very
center of the story.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.310
That is to say,
people grasped already

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.500
several thousand years
ago that this was

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.770
a story written by Franz Kafka.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.850
And they struggled
for centuries,

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.940
many of the most
interesting, I think, people

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.870
in the whole Western tradition
struggled with how to explain,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.730
how to grapple with
things that are

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.680
built-in in a deep way,
hardwired into the story.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.330
We will turn to the other
members of the panel now.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.730
But I just want to say that,
hovering at least for me

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.890
over our own relation to
the story, my own relation

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.570
to the story in
the 21st century,

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.460
is to try to understand
when the moral features

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.300
that figure so prominently
in the Genesis story--

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.410
disobedience, the search for
knowledge, the experience

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.800
of shame, the feeling of not
being in the place that you

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.450
should be, a feeling of exile--

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.520
when did these appear, if, in
the world that we now believe,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.350
must have been the
world of our ancestors,

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.320
not Adam and Eve in
the paradisal garden,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.240
but the world of primates.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.320
When could these have
come into the world?

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:07.500
And when into the world did
we get, and how did we get,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.170
symbolic acts?

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.110
Did we get aesthetic acts?

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.190
Were they already in
our primate ancestors?

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:25.890
Did we get varieties of
cooperation and collaboration

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.600
that lead us to the
creatures that we are now?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.970
This is just a way of beginning.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.710
And I'm excited to turn
the microphone over

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.270
to Kimberley Patton, who
will pick up from here.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.450
Thank you, Stephen.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.280
I'm honored to be here.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.950
It's always a pleasure
to be in a space

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.050
at Harvard that
allows religionists

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.440
and scientists to actually
talk to one another.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.970
These are the
conversations we need

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.460
to be having, especially now.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.240
As a reminder in the news this
week by a pending Supreme Court

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.790
case for a wedding
cake never baked

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.130
for two grooms in Colorado,
the story of Adam and Eve

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.000
is alive and well in our culture
and protected by the mantle

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.080
of religious belief--

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.040
or is it?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.500
Adam and Eve, not
Adam and Steve,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.180
continue to run a parallel
race alongside the changing

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.210
and contested global
understanding of the range

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.210
of human sexualities, the ethics
and political discourse that

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.020
result from that, and the civil
protections of legal marriage.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.750
In another lane runs
evolutionary biology

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.050
and our evolving
understanding of it.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.630
Yet no one seems to be
staying in their lane.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.730
Reality and our
experience of it continues

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.440
to be interdisciplinary, a
palimpsest of many layers.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.940
Freud wrote in
Future of an Illusion

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.109
that religion would be
outgrown as science ascended

00:21:07.109 --> 00:21:08.900
and human beings became
more willing to let

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.150
go of their
paternalistic god figure,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.210
embracing our terrifying
vulnerability and existential

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.840
aloneness in an
uncaring universe.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.190
The sociologists of
the 1960s predicted

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.440
that religion was atrophying
into a colorful set

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.490
of illuminations in the margins
of the pre-Enlightenment.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.790
And my own wonderful
Professor of Paleontology,

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.920
Stephen Jay Gould, did not
share Darwin's unhappiness

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.970
with the increasing
ascendant role

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:43.020
that evolution plays in the
thinking of some of the world.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.230
And he invited humanity
to get real and grow up

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.710
in a world of stasis and sudden
replacement, a world free

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.260
of fantasy, free of story--

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.390
the real world.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.740
None of this happened.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.540
And lived religion
remains stubbornly

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.300
persistent in many areas, more
fundamentally dug in than ever

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.760
before.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.990
In the rise of Adam and
Eve, Stephen Greenblatt

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.680
is both fascinated and troubled
by the persistence of a tale

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.310
that he says bears
the hallmark, and I'm

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.880
quoting, "of the imagination
at its most extravagant,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.306
a magical garden, a
naked man and woman

00:22:16.306 --> 00:22:17.930
who are brought into
existence in a way

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.630
that no other human
beings have been born.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.370
People who know how
to speak and function

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.900
without the prolonged
childhood that

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.110
is the hallmark of our
species, a mysterious warning

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.200
about death that no such newly
created beings could possibly

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.560
understand, a
talking snake, a tree

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.070
that confers knowledge
of good and evil,

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.390
another tree that
confers eternal life,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.690
supernatural guardians
wielding flaming swords."

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.460
This is fiction at
its most fictional,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.580
a story that revels in the
delights of make-believe.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.120
Joni Mitchell, left out of
Woodstock through a scheduling

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.760
error, wanted it both ways.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.460
We are stardust,
we are golden, we

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.950
are 50 billion year old carbon.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.945
And we've got to get
ourselves back to the garden.

00:23:04.945 --> 00:23:06.320
The author's
fundamental question

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.750
is why Adam and Eve,
whom he argues epitomize,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.500
quote, "the weird, enduring
power of human storytelling

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.590
began to bear insistence on
the literal truth," which

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.680
he attributes, as he says, to
Christian orthodoxy following

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.130
Augustine, and then
into the Renaissance.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.440
How does something made
up become so compellingly

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.280
real, he asks.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.050
What happens when
fictional creatures

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.210
behave as if they were alive?

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.200
Are they fated for that
reason to begin to die.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.420
Professor Greenblatt gives
us some masterful, deeply

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.450
researched tale that allows
us to peer both backwards

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.940
and forwards in its
genealogy of stories

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.000
about the origin of the
cosmos and of humankind,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.430
shedding light on its past
in the ancient Mesopotamian

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.580
epics, the Enuma Elish
and the Atra-Hasis,

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.590
and later continuing
its story in the Great

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.020
Flood of the Sumerian
tale, the Gilgamesh,

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.610
which informs the story of Noah.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.620
Many historians find this
story of Adam and Eve

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.830
was the [INAUDIBLE] response
to the exile in Babylon,

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.590
the Torah being redacted at
the time of Ezra and Nehemiah

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.200
in the sixth century BCE.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.710
It appropriates, rewrites, and
ethicizes the creation myths

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.030
to which the Jewish
people return,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.420
and to which they were exposed.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.480
The warrior-creator Marduk,
who, when his own grandmother

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.690
Tiamat and her chaos
monsters rise up against him,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.960
the salt ocean deep, who was
primordial and never created,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.380
splits her in half to create
the heavens and the Earth.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.100
And out of the god Quingu, who
incited grandmother to riot,

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.170
Marduk creates
human beings, Lullu,

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.340
to be slaves to the gods.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.870
The Adam and Eve story,
on the other hand,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.540
has one sovereign god who broods
upon the face of the deep,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.610
[NON-ENGLISH],, who, after
creating all the other living

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.360
things in the sea and on
earth, as Lyle actually noted,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.250
makes the first pair of human
beings in his own image.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.420
[INAUDIBLE] Elohim, troubling
plural as that remains

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.180
in the text, male and
female together in the first

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.380
creation--

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.140
Adam from the Earth, and
the woman whom he will

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.850
name Eve, life, in the second.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.750
They're given dominion
over the creatures.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.190
Adam is tasked with naming them.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.690
They're prohibited
only from eating

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.240
the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil,

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.190
for they will die.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.280
The serpent tells Eve
that they will not

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.620
die, but instead become like
God, knowing good and evil.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.150
And in the heartbreaking
sequence that follows,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.900
including all the terrible
punishments of the pair,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.550
God's preoccupations
become clear.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.750
He says to himself, after
his terrible litany, see,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.420
the man has become like
us, knowing good and evil.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.230
And now he might also
take out his hand

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:48.210
and stretch it to the tree of
life and eat and live forever.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.820
Greenblatt argues that
Genesis as a whole,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.980
and in particular the
Adam and Eve story,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.220
is one that gives us an etiology
of all that afflicts us,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.010
creation and innocence,
lost of temptation,

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.150
wrong choices, shame,
sexual desire, labor, death,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.540
and, most tragically of all,
deep alienation between creator

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.060
and his created beings.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.460
Durkheim or Foucault
might call it

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.860
a reflection of
social engineering,

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.410
created from the remains of
ancient Near Eastern stories,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.510
and now patrolling
the boundaries

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.730
of the social
realities that matter

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.110
to the royal state of Israel.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.920
He gives us not only the
past of the story, where

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.200
following recur in the
midst of anteriority,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.440
there is no real beginning.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.190
I would argue that
Adam and Eve of Genesis

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.330
do, in fact, have parents.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.970
They're just camouflaged
in the narrative.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.780
Tiamat lives on in
Tehom in Genesis 1.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.820
She's not created,
she's simply there

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.560
at the beginning, the deep.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.330
And the shadow of
Marduk is clearly

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.640
seen in God the
creator, who separates

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.910
the heavens and the Earth, who
orders the lights of heaven,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.920
who makes man from the Earth
and breathes life into him.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.660
As Greenblatt says,
this is a story

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.750
in which innocent turns
into wickedness in a flash

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.600
without any fair chance
for moral development.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.430
Unlike its predecessors, it
offers an etiology of creation

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:14.090
and, what he calls
so brilliantly,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.320
a reversal of stories, such as
Gilgamesh, where clothing means

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.200
belonging, where strife,
love, and encounter with death

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.060
and the struggle
over immortality

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.570
lead to a restored, not a
lost kingdom, and to wisdom.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.600
Genesis turns this
upside down and, quote,

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.870
"rewrites initiation
as transgression."

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.720
And it is hard in that powerful,
ritual phrase in this book

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.750
not to hear an echo
of the childhood story

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.420
that he is brave enough
to share with us.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.480
Looking up, defying
the prohibition

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.700
during the blessing
of the Kohanim

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.630
during the Jewish liturgy,
because God would be seen,

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:57.340
because that would be
death, instant death.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.100
And Professor Greenblatt
shares that he

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.220
sees when he dares look up and
is willing to sacrifice that he

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.830
sees not God passing overhead,
but also only empty air

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.790
and gossiping adults.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.980
And he writes, "I
had been lied to."

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.960
For him, transgression was
initiation into this question.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:31.380
Now let us think about the word
story versus the word myth.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.650
Story occurs far more often in
this book than the word myth.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.890
But myth means something
different than story.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.290
Muo in the Greek,
or [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.600
means, I tell in a special way.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.120
It is cognate with
the word mystery.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.980
A myth is a sacred
history, a tale

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.730
of origins with moral force,
but often involving-- in fact,

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.010
always involving
supernatural creatures.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.070
It has no normal
moral parameters.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:00.060
It is neither true nor untrue,
right nor wrong, in the sense

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.940
that we normally
mean these terms.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.710
Creation stories exist because
of the human commitment

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.580
to causality,
Aristotelian or otherwise.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.400
They almost always involve
separating, differentiating,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.990
and demarcating.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.660
Chaos is almost always
replaced by order,

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.240
ancient pieces almost
always ruptured,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.690
paradisal gardens are
almost always lost,

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.320
ancient unending intercourse
is almost always disturbed.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.540
The fire is almost
always stolen and given

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.400
to whom it should
not be, or else that

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.220
gift is eternally contested.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.460
The angels protest
and are incinerated.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.530
Iblis protests and is
cast out of heaven.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.380
Something is broken,
something is stolen.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.380
And try as we might to
restore it or replace it,

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.020
it is not accomplished.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.860
So the creation story of
Genesis can and should,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.390
I would argue, be studied
alongside other creation

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.890
stories from the
world's history--

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.880
myths paradoxical, in
some ways beyond ethics.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.860
In many, there is
one creator god,

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.130
or there's two, as in the
case of Izanagi and Izanami,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.200
the divine couple,
brother and sister,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.700
who draw the Japanese islands
from the bottom of the sea.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.010
In the Yoruba tradition,
winged beasts sent by Obatala

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.080
scratch the Earth
into existence.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.880
Earth-diver pulls it
up from the bottom

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.640
of the sea in Native
American mythologies,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.890
or the gods create it
with primal sacrifice

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.180
from an egg, or a primal
person, as an Indo-European myth

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.470
themes.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.110
There can be many creator gods,
as in the case of the Mayan

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.434
Popol Vuh.

00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:31.350
Sovereign plume [INAUDIBLE],,
along with heart

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.240
of lake and heart of sky.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.570
At a time when only the sea
is pooled under all the sky,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.630
there is nothing
whatever gathered under.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.190
Despite differences, all
of these tales almost

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.380
always involve, as
I said, creation

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.790
of order from chaos, a
kind of differentiation.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:55.110
And here we enter into the
question, why make people.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.690
In the Popol Vuh, the gods
say, how should the sowing be

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.580
and the dawning.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.190
Who is to be the
provider, the nurturer?

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.270
Let this be this way.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.120
Think about it-- the
Earth should be removed,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.200
the water should be
removed, emptied out

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.890
for the formation of
the Earth's own plate.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.130
And then comes the sowing
and the dawning of sky earth.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.560
But there will be no high
days and no bright praise

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.190
for our work, our design, until
the rise of the human work,

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.800
the human design.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.840
Maker, modeller,
begetter of the Mayans,

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.930
create humans to sow the
land, as Marduk does.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:32.950
Although in a gentler way,
God takes multiple tries,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.460
unlike the god of Genesis.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.790
Human generations are mud,
wood, and finally maize people,

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.520
the final draft.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.530
Yggdrasil, reversing
the Genesis story,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:48.090
hides the primal couple,
Lif and Lifthrasir, life

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.810
and life's partner, after all
of the gods and the whole world

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.770
are destroyed.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.930
The Pacific Northwest
trickster figure, the raven,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.740
creates people on the beach
just because he's bored.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.090
Often, we hear that God
needs laborers, but he also,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.670
or they also need company.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:09.510
They need a way to be known
and understood, to be mirrored.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.860
Ibn Arabi writes in the Fusus,
"I was a hidden treasure,

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.250
and I yearned to be
known in God's name."

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.400
Another feature of
creation epics--

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.590
and I don't have time
to go into this--

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.920
is the notion of alienation
of god, the god who

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.900
is removed, or removes himself.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.730
And we find this
not only in Africa,

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.930
but in many other myths of
creation, including this one.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.270
Just to give one example,
among [INAUDIBLE] people

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.900
in Togo, [INAUDIBLE]
ends up removing himself

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.647
from a very intimate
space with humans

00:32:42.647 --> 00:32:44.730
because people keep hitting
him with their pestles

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.840
when they grind.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.080
The smoke of the cooking
fires gets into his eyes.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.410
And worst of all, an old woman,
anxious to make a good soup,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.200
used to cut off a bit of
him at each meal time.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.050
And God, being pained at
this treatment, went higher.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.280
So there is a way in
which the loss of intimacy

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.500
and God's loneliness
at the exile

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.590
figures as well into the
sadness and the sorrow

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:12.366
and the disruption, although
the book does not dwell on that.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:16.140
In conclusion, I would
argue that theologically

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.730
the notion that
we have to choose

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.980
between a story of
randomness and lost

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.040
rivulets of dead-end evolution
on the way to the sea,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.400
of traits only inherited
because they're envelopes of DNA

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.760
more likely to be passed on
to other envelopes of DNA,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.000
and so that they will
not be annihilated,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.410
versus a fairy tale
of primal parents

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.600
and talking snakes
with a gardener

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.960
god who builds a
booby trap for them,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.210
is perhaps a false dichotomy.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.080
And I wish The Rise and
Fall of Adam and Eve,

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.460
this brilliant book, did
not cleave so closely to it.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.740
Myths often encodes or
responds to history.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.280
It is not necessarily
a story told apart

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.920
from historical experience.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.640
Plato's Cave, as it turns out,
as I discovered to my shock

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.050
in Greece, ends up
being an actual cave.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:11.530
And it exactly resembles the one
as mentioned in The Republic.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.100
Plato played there as
a child, for example.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.469
There is evidence of
an enormous flood.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.380
Geologist William
Ryan and Walter Pitman

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.949
worked on it for 30 years.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.570
It happened around 5,600
BC in the Black Sea.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.080
And it involved the
collapse of an earthen dam

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.440
in the Bosphorus.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.250
They called their book Noah's
Flood and thereby set off,

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.816
I would argue, it's dismissal,
which is unfortunate,

00:34:39.816 --> 00:34:41.440
because it could be
that the many flood

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.210
myths do carry at
least some trace

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.480
of historical memory of it.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.000
And perhaps we could
flip that notion

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.360
and we could say that why should
we not think of evolution not

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.290
as a story or a parallel
story, but as a myth,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.320
with all of the
paradox and wonder,

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.010
with all of the
strangeness and beauty

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.440
that the story of
Adam and Eve holds,

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.210
a story told in a special way.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.370
As surely a story that can
be manipulated to evil ends,

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.800
just as Adam and Eve can
be, as Stephen notes,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.690
the eugenics movement,
the randomness,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.770
the causal randomness,
bringing with it

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.710
its own form of despair, such
as perhaps Darwin experienced.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.760
From the standpoint of
sheer evolutionary biology,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.910
we human beings are actually
a predatory invasive species

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.880
that's radically dominated
our environmental niche.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.270
But that means that religion
and storytelling and myth-making

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:42.280
and meaning-making is as much
a part of evolution as anything

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.830
else that we readily
identify with it,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.620
as much as stasis and
sudden replacement.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.760
So turning the tables,
we delude ourselves

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.910
if we see scientific inquiry
and knowledge as not a story,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.940
and by which I mean
not a sacred history.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.600
Perhaps this was Stephen
Jay Gould's insight.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.260
Perhaps we do live in a
magical universe in which time

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.390
can bend, the trees
in a forest can

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.120
communicate with one another.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.840
Where my parakeet has an
ancestor in massive dinosaurs

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.840
120 million years ago.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.880
Where those same
dinosaurs turn out to have

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.950
had feathers and could sing.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.860
A magical universe where
dung beetles known as scarabs

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.380
turn to use the stars to
navigate their perfectly

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.530
straight routes across
the desert at night

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.363
so that when their
little heads are covered,

00:36:30.363 --> 00:36:31.920
they run in crazy zigzags.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.300
Where the Neanderthal
versus Lucy,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.390
the Neanderthal is
my direct ancestor--

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.920
4%.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.937
Where giraffes turn
out to have a form

00:36:39.937 --> 00:36:41.020
of communicative language.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.260
It was just too pitched too high
for us to be able to detect it,

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.740
until recently.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.760
Where creatures living
near sulfurous vents

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.335
seven miles below
the Earth's surface

00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:51.460
can thrive in pressure that
would make a human head

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.212
explode.

00:36:52.212 --> 00:36:54.670
Where the coelacanth that was
supposed to have gone extinct

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.520
30 million years ago turns up
in a fish market in Sulawesi.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.840
Where chimpanzees dance before
a waterfall in Tanzania.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.390
When it rains and rabbits
kick their feet in the air

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.010
when they leap for no reason.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.650
Where invertebrates such
as giant Pacific octopi

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.060
show individual personality
traits and facial recognition.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.120
A magical universe
where pregnant mothers

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.270
and their fetuses swap
entire populations of cells

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.950
across the placental barrier,
osmotic as it turns out.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.870
And those cells, called
microchimera, little monsters,

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.320
stay swapped and subdividing
so that none of us

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.570
is a hermetically
sealed individual.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.630
And Homo sapiens mothers
and their children

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.440
represent an unbroken
enchainement, all the way back,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.580
not to four female
individuals who

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.540
lived between 160,000
and 200,000 years ago,

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.970
as was believed in the
1980s, but it's now

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.970
been shown to be only one,
living almost certainly

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.220
in what is now Ethiopia.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.010
Is this fiction at its
most fictional, a story

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.930
that revels in the
delights of make-believe?

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.220
This is perhaps instead the
random, purposeful, mystical

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.370
world that we have
inherited, the garden that we

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.120
are trying so hard to
exile ourselves from.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.720
And as we know, geneticists have
given our common grandmother

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.980
a name--

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.520
Mitochondrial Eve.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.220
Stephen Greenblatt's
beautiful book

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.430
shows that perhaps they
could not help themselves.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:19.366
Thank you.

00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:24.226
[APPLAUDING]

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.480
OK, well, thank you, Kimberley.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.560
And thank you, Stephen.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.150
Thank you, Homi.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.241
It's great to see an attempt to
bring humanities and scientists

00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:43.740
together.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.440
I'm meant to be a scientist.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.250
So I haven't had time to
read all of Stephen's books.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.170
So in order to do some research
for this, I did what all of us

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.680
would do--

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.670
I turned to the web.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.980
If you look up Adam
and Eve on the web,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.460
then you find yourself looking
at a page all about sex toys.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:14.730
So I went back to nature.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.200
Nature Communications this
week had a paper published

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.035
about hunter-gatherers.

00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:24.810
"Hunter-Gatherers" is a
very sad story, of course,

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.390
because we come from
hunter-gatherers.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.000
And hunter-gatherers living
in the wild in the way

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.720
that our ancestors once did,
we are in the generation

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.020
that is seeing the end of that.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.150
We're losing that tie to
our evolutionary past.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.600
But people are quickly
getting data where they can

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.210
on people living as close to
a real hunter-gatherer life as

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:45.820
possible.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.500
And there were 18 groups
in the Philippines of Agta

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.560
who were studied
for storytelling.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.240
And the stories
they tell seem to me

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.700
to resonate exactly
with what we're hearing

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.680
about with Adam and Eve.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.449
They are mythic in
all sorts of ways.

00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:03.240
And in fact, in this
particular study, what

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.950
they were able to show is
that among 18 different camps,

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.700
they varied in the quality
of the storytellers

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.350
as rated by other people.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.480
They looked at
200 or 300 people.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.530
And it turns out that
the better storytellers

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.980
have camps in which there is
more cooperation, as measured

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.680
with economic games.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.780
And by the way, the
better storytellers

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.970
have more children.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.490
They benefit themselves.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.705
And the stories they tell are
like, Kimberley was saying

00:40:35.705 --> 00:40:38.320
and Stephen was saying,
they bring social order.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.030
They tell stories of
hierarchy and organization

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.930
and division and
indeed cooperation.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:51.810
So when we find that 56% of
people in the United States

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.300
believe that Adam and
Eve were real people,

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.980
and that 44% of them believe
so with strong or absolute

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.750
certainty, then that to me
is something about the way

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.390
that people organize
themselves to cooperate

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.510
in terms of their shared
belief in something that

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.704
is incredible.

00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:13.620
Well, I'm a scientist.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.810
Scientists tell stories.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.750
Kimberley was trying
to suggest that we tell

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.916
equivalent kinds of stories.

00:41:18.916 --> 00:41:21.510
I think in some ways they
are equivalent because they

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.510
are beautiful and creative.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.510
But I think in other ways
they're not equivalent

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.885
because I don't think they
have the same social function.

00:41:29.885 --> 00:41:31.530
They have different
social functions.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.080
I don't think they serve to
help bring people together

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.130
around a specific kind of shared
belief, only about the belief

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.920
that science matters.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.330
And I'll just draw
attention to two ways

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.630
in which we can tie the Adam
and Eve story to science.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.150
One is the genetics,
so just building

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.060
on what Kimberley
was saying, actually.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.930
In 1987, Rebecca
Cann used the fact

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.980
that mitochondria have
very little recombination.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.100
They're in all our cells,
and the occasional mutation

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.440
happens, and we can work
out the mutation rates.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.570
And you can work out
when it was that you

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.680
have the last individual
who was the common ancestor

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.350
for everybody living
on the Earth today.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.620
And what Cann did in 1987 was
say it's about 200,000 years.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:25.830
And now the estimate is
150,000 to 200,000 years ago.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.670
And I'll add to that
by looking at Adam.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:34.500
So mitochondria passed
through the maternal lines,

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.480
and then you have the Y
chromosome passed down

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.610
the paternal lines.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.730
And they only very rarely
have any crossing over

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.620
with the matching X chromosome.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.380
So again, there are
some uncertainties

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.520
in the calculations,
but the last Adam

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:55.380
who gave rise to all the
people living today, it

00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:00.450
was estimated to be between
200,000 and 300,000 years ago.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:07.500
So whether or not Eve
actually met Adam is unclear.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.330
Whether or not they lived
at the same time is unclear.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:14.560
They might have lived as
much as 150,000 years apart.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.750
So we have to just adjust
the story just a little bit.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.150
So that's the genetic angle.

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.480
Let me just mention briefly
about the social behavior

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.770
angle.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.870
Stephen mentioned
about Adam and Eve

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.620
being a story among
many different things,

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.790
but partly it is about bonding.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:40.136
And the fact that there is
only one Eve and one Adam

00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.760
pushes one in the
direction of thinking

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.610
it's about monogamy,
which it seems very

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.030
strange because the ancient
Israelites were certainly

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.250
not monogamous.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.500
But it can be said to
be about pair bonding,

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.030
and then that fits with what
the Israelites were like.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:01.380
But still just to think about
monogamy just very briefly,

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.430
and one could really say the
same thing about bonding,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.490
about bonding in
general, it's not

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.020
very common in the
primates as a whole.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.090
Most of the primates have a
much more liberal attitude,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.590
a sort of Harvey
Weinstein attitude

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:23.200
to their sexual relationships.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.250
Something like 10%
can be said to be

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.920
monogamous, that sort of thing.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.160
If you survey human
societies, then monogamy

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.135
is common within the societies,
but rare between societies.

00:44:35.135 --> 00:44:39.890
That is to say, the great
majority of human societies,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.850
75%, 80% that sort of thing,
are polygynous in the sense

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.070
since that they welcome
polygyny, they allow it.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:51.430
But most people, in fact,
end up monogamously married.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.950
Now there is a difference
between the bonding

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.650
that you see in
humans and the bonding

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.650
that you see in
non-human primates, which

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.820
is due to the way
that they move about.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.720
In the monogamous primates, they
travel together all the time,

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.460
the male and the female.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.635
It's like what happens
after you retire.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.580
I'll leave you to get
the implications of that.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:26.990
But the reason appears
to be that when

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.320
a primate male bonds
with a primate female,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.160
he does not trust what she is
up to, unless he is with her.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.030
He has to guard her as a mate.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.270
So now then think about humans.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.150
If you look at any
hunter-gatherer population

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.970
in the world, or any
population of humans anywhere

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:51.200
in the world, regardless
of their subsistence type,

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.990
males and females do not
spend all their time together,

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.870
especially in their
reproductive years.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.410
The women go one
way, and the men

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:04.217
go another, if you're in
hunter-gatherer society.

00:46:04.217 --> 00:46:06.050
And then they come
together in the evenings.

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.966
In fact, they spend very
little time together.

00:46:07.966 --> 00:46:10.460
It's very difficult
to find a photograph

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.310
of a male and a
female hunter-gatherer

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.650
who are married to each
other being together.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.860
You only do it by asking them,
please, will you sit together.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.830
They say, what, that's crazy.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.660
So in order to have a mate
guarding a relationship,

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.180
how do humans do it?

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.440
The answer is we do
it through language.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.060
We have gossip that allows
us to check what each of you

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.629
are doing during the day.

00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:40.170
And so there's lots of evidence
that that's what's happening.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.210
So if you're going to
think about the evolution

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.620
of human bonding, you have
to think about mate guarding

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.410
and you have to
think about language.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:55.140
Well, for my own part, I
will take a view on language.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.790
But different people might
take different views.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.060
But for various
reasons, I'm impressed

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.920
with the evidence that language
is the key to understanding

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.840
the evolution of Homo sapiens.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.640
Thanks to a paper
published last year,

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.530
the date of the
evolution of Homo sapiens

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.960
has been pushed back
from 170,000 years ago

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.450
to 315,000 years ago in Morocco.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.650
And you never find literally
the earliest things.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.320
So probably it's a little
bit earlier than that.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.630
And if language
indeed emerged then,

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:33.110
that would be the time
when, for the first time,

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:37.720
humans were able to meet God.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.790
They could not do
so before, I think,

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:43.840
because we know what the
toddlers looked like.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.570
We know enough about
locomotor mechanics

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.990
to know that the toddlers
were walking extremely slowly

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.122
and basically had
to be kept in camp.

00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:53.830
And that means that
the women and the men

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:55.700
really had to be doing
something different.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.220
It's not like the
non-human primates

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.750
where a male and
the female gibbon

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.570
can swing cheerfully from
tree to tree together,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.030
and their baby comes with them.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.060
So the story that
I want to convey

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.930
from the evolutionary
anthropology perspective

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.550
is that if we think
about Adam and Eve

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.240
from the point-of-view
of bonding, then

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.420
there is a convergence
with the notion of story,

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.740
because the language that
emerged enabling people

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.650
to check what each other
were doing during the day

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.310
is the same language that would
have produced the stories that

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.630
were told around the campfire
from at least 300,000

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.750
years ago, stories that
would have included

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:41.170
hunter-gatherer equivalents
of Adam and Eve.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.754
Thank you.

00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:47.634
[APPLAUDING]

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.100
Many thanks to
Homi and to Stephen

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.750
for including me
in this occasion,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.370
and to Kimberley and Richard
for your beautiful papers.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.000
In the final paragraph of
On the Origin of Species,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.580
Charles Darwin guides
the reader in an exercise

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.890
on how to look at
nature through the eyes

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.440
of evolutionary theory.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.100
It's interesting, he suggests
with characteristic mildness,

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.610
"to contemplate an
entangled bank, closed

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.820
with many plants of many
kinds, with birds singing

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.820
on the bushes, with various
insects flitting about,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.430
and with worms crawling
through the Earth,

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.060
and to reflect that these
elaborately constructed forms,

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.210
so different from each
other and dependent on each

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:44.200
other in so complex a manner,
have all been produced

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.920
by laws acting around us."

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.220
Though Darwin's words share
with invocations of Eden,

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.640
their imagery of
proliferation of an exhaustive

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.100
and teeming roster
of all that lives,

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.070
this is no deliberately
staged garden.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.770
Divine law is
nowhere in evidence.

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.500
The blind and soulless actors,
Darwin goes on to name, are--

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.920
and these are all
capitalized in his text--

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.910
Growth and Reproduction,
Inheritance, Variability,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.970
the Struggle for Life,
and Natural Selection,

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.440
leading not only to divergence
of character or speciation,

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.320
but to extinction.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.320
This is a story
that extinguishes

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.470
as much as it creates.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.580
There exists an eerie similarity
between Darwin's language here

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.650
and the words chosen
by Stephen Greenblatt

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.330
to describe the
experience of visiting

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.660
a paleoanthropology
lab and contemplating

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.870
the dizzying nonlinearity of
fossil evidence for hominin

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.560
evolution.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.740
"It is difficult to find the
story in a tangled bush,"

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.280
he writes, playing on the
branching, tree-like structures

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.250
that evolutionary thinkers use
to illustrate relationships

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.970
of ancestry and
descent among species.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:01.180
The narrative of human evolution
looks from this perspective

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.510
less like an act of creation
or a march of progress

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.780
than, quote, "a wilderness
of discontinuous

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.100
and criss-crossing
tracks," end quote.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.080
Despite the
confidence with which

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.540
Darwin imbues his
final paragraph,

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.750
the idea that a properly
attuned act of looking

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.810
will yield the truth of
the evolutionary story,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.660
Stephen identifies an
unavoidable feature of Darwin's

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.320
theory as it applies to
human origins, quote,

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.830
"that this account happens to
be true according to our best

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:35.950
scientific lights
does not in itself

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.860
make it good to think with.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:42.520
On the contrary, its
difficulty, its uncertainties,

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.190
its resistance to
narrative coherence

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:48.900
makes it one of the great
challenges of our age,"

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.770
end quote.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.310
Although Darwin himself did not
address human origins in print

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.730
until 1871, other
19th century thinkers

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.980
were eager to work through
evolutionary theory's

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.900
human implications.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.990
They began to ask another of
Stephen's central questions,

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.580
one that Renaissance
artists took up

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:12.060
with particular passion, what
were the first people like.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.740
While naturalists
like Thomas Huxley

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.110
drew their favorite evidence
from the anatomical and

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.360
embryological similarities
between humans

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.910
and other primates,
cultural evolutionists

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.520
began to think through what
the earliest humans were

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.860
like using a different source--

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.920
ethnographic reports, their own
and those of others-- and this

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.400
is a pretty heterogeneous group
of documents-- on the life

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.160
ways of small-scale societies.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.210
The words I just used, life
ways and small-scale societies,

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:42.540
would have been neither familiar
nor coherent to a 19th century

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.680
thinker.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.720
Instead, those
thinkers described

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.780
the conditions of those
outside the ambit of Western

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.000
Europe and its
cultural offshoots,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.660
or the lower races of man
with taxonomic gradations,

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.290
including savagery
and barbarism.

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:01.620
These labels were as technical
and anthropology as lunatic

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.100
and idiot were in late
19th century English law.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.160
Lewis Henry Morgan
explains in Ancient Society

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.830
that they serve to classify
both peoples and time

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.410
periods according to
modes of subsistence,

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:16.650
technological innovations,
geographic distribution,

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.480
and degree of literacy.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.990
The overlap of social
and temporal categories

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.460
is crucial here.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.450
It underlines a cornerstone of
cultural evolutionary logic,

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.150
small-scale societies
are atavisms,

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.190
living examples
of earlier stages

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.980
through which civilized
19th-century populations once

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.000
passed.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.900
And we see what can sometimes
be a complicated echo of this,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.300
though much updated in
contemporary evolutionary

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.790
anthropology's engagement with
hunter-gatherer societies.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.710
"In the sciences of
law and society,"

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:50.930
John Ferguson
McLennan wrote, "old

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.140
means not old and
chronology, but in structure.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.270
That is most archaic
which lies nearest

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.340
to the beginning of
human progress considered

00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.660
as a development.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.580
And that is most modern
which is farthest

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.810
removed from that beginning."

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:06.760
Subsistent strategies,
technologies,

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.680
and language
capabilities, that is,

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.590
could be arranged in a hierarchy
from primitive to complex.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.040
The developmental sequence
of any given society

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:19.270
would be charted as a
journey up that hierarchy.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.430
There was, however, a problem.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.970
Morgan admitted in his
taxonomy of human development

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.100
that there existed
no human population

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.960
in the late 19th
century that persisted

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.050
in the most primitive human
state, known as the lower

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:34.960
status of savagery, in
which humans first used

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.660
fire and began to
speak, but had not yet

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.170
invented the bow and arrow.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.290
So perhaps something of
what Richard is imagining

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:43.660
with the first Adam and Eve.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.240
Conjuring this period,
quote, "the infancy

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.490
of the human race,"
end quote, therefore

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.280
required an act of
imagination, the generation

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.540
of a coherent narrative.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.130
A strategy adopted by
several prominent cultural

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.230
evolutionists,
including Morgan, relied

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.630
on a form of deep reading.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.880
Human rituals and
words, they claimed,

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.570
move along a trajectory from
the literal to the symbolic.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.700
The more civilized
we become, the more

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.980
distant our cultural
practices and words

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.570
from the utterly concrete
form in which they originated.

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.100
A father used not to walk
his daughter down the aisle

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.920
in a gesture emblematic of
the end of her childhood

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.410
and the beginning of
sociological maturity.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:25.930
He literally gave her away,
though probably in exchange

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:27.520
for something of
value from the family

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.710
of his future son-in-law.

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:32.830
A groom did not carry his
bride over the threshold

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.380
of their new home for
reasons of romance.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.930
He had to bind her in his arms
because he had captured her

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:41.050
from her tribe, and
she might run away.

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:44.020
It was even easier to infer
the earliest human version

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.780
of a practice from a more
primitive society, one closer

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.670
to the source.

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.370
Morgan and colleagues,
including Sir John Lubbock,

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:53.900
took their methods
a step further.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.140
Not only did the kinship
arrangements and marriage

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.090
practices of savages
and barbarians

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:02.470
provide a window into human
prehistory, but they proposed,

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:04.480
contained in the
terms of kinship

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.820
themselves, in the
words people use

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.530
to describe their
relationships to one

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.230
another, the keen
observer could find

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:14.890
the key to primordial
human social structures.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.310
Europeans use a form
of kinship terminology

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.950
that they label
descriptive, in which

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.850
terms like aunt, grandfather,
stepmother, and son-in-law

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.400
give precise information
about the nature and degree

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.380
of connection between parties.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.070
But compared to Mandarin,
from what I understand,

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.870
romance and Germanic
languages are actually

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:36.460
pretty generalized.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.310
For example, we
use the word aunt

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:41.810
to describe our mother's
sisters, our father's sisters,

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:45.070
and the wives of our mother's
brothers on both sides.

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:48.010
So it's descriptive
only to a point.

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:51.190
But at the other extreme,
small-scale societies

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.710
that Morgan and others
encountered employed much more

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.570
inclusive terminology.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.730
And they called this
not descriptive,

00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.560
but classificatory.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.510
The same word might
be used to identify

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.030
a man's wife, his wife's
sister, his brother's wife,

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.560
and his wife's brother's wife.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.950
So these are all kind of
the same kinship term.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.340
At the most inclusive level, the
only kinship terms recognized

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.880
would translate as mother,
father, wife, husband, son,

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.930
and daughter.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.510
Vertical generational
differences and differences

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:23.970
of sex were the only ones
preserved by these terms.

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:26.710
If rituals of gift giving,
marriage, and diplomacy

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.320
were distant echoes
of literal enactments,

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.880
then the language
of kinship surely

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.770
symbolized the
actual relationships

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.380
it originated to describe.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.920
In the earliest days of
classificatory kinship, terms

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.880
and societies, Lubbock
claimed, all the men and women

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.150
of a single generation not
only called one another wife

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:49.150
and husband, but in fact
behaved as wife and husband

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.940
to one another, participating
in what he delicately

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.030
called promiscuous marriage.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.210
Paternity would have been
unknown, and maternity

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.750
inconsequential, because the
children belonged to the tribe.

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:05.300
Lubbock's version
of early society,

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.690
titillating foreign to the
sexual mores of his readership,

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:11.990
reinforced the narrative of
amorality and backwardness

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:13.970
among largely
brown-skinned people

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:18.200
that helped to justify
British colonial projects.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.880
When Darwin came
at last to write

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.980
about human origins
in The Descent of Man,

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.650
and Selection in Relation
to Sex, much of his book

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:26.690
did not concern humans at all.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:30.030
The vast catalog of evidence
for sexual selection in insects,

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:32.840
fish, birds, and mammals is
bookended by two discussions

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.430
of Homo sapiens.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.710
The first establishes
human antiquity

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.800
and biological continuity
with other species.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.140
And the second, which
occurs at the end,

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.330
takes the differences
in physical appearance

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:47.630
among human populations as
evidence for sexual selection.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.240
Different people find
different things attractive.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.200
And this has resulted in
population differentiation.

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.900
To make the case for
sexual selection in humans,

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.300
Darwin engages the theories
of prehistoric marriage

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.680
and kinship articulated by
Morgan, McLennan, and Lubbock.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.200
He treats them respectfully,
but in the event

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.280
he disagrees with them.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.260
Perhaps because his
own experiences,

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.830
which Stephen describes, of
savages from Tierra del Fuego

00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:17.160
did not include evidence
of promiscuity, or perhaps

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:21.090
because the idea that early
humans made it indiscriminately

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.790
was for Darwin an
ethical bridge too far.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:26.700
To go back to the ethical
resonances of these stories,

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:31.140
he turned to what he knew
of non-human primates.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.450
Close-range, longitudinal
field studies

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:36.170
of primate behavior of the
kind that Richard conducts

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.220
were still a century away.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.310
So Darwin had very limited
evidence to work with.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:44.820
And drawing on what
he had, he concluded

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.190
that male apes
manifested the same kind

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:50.280
of pair-bonded sexual
jealousy and protectiveness

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.090
of their young as did civilized
modern European human men.

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.640
So he's kind of
projecting this image.

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.300
Female primate's sexuality
thus was and always had

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.220
been restrained.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:08.120
This story conferred for Darwin
a form of narrative coherence.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.920
I want to close
with an observation

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.250
and then open discussion with
a question for the panel.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.260
The observation is this--

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.810
in both broadly
Judeo-Christian and Western

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.600
scientific imaginings
of human origins,

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.480
the question of how our
species came into being

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.760
is closely linked with
visions of our earliest

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.360
reproductive arrangements.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.410
Whether we are made of dirt
in the image of the divine

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:34.000
or descended from clever,
arboreal knuckle walkers,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.810
our mating systems
in these stories

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:39.440
are governed by
hierarchy and by rules.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.020
What do any of our
panelists think drives

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.300
this particular fascination?

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.250
Are we merely describing
the inevitable?

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.050
Is this a descriptive act?

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.740
Or are we grappling
with something

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.670
that, as Claude Levi-Strauss
claimed about incest,

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:55.390
has to be regulated,
has to be narrativized

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:59.420
because instinct unbounded would
threaten a fundamental tenet

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.510
of human society.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:04.310
So in shorter terms, are
these stories we have to tell?

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.750
Thank you.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:10.070
[APPLAUDING]

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.140
Well, I can perhaps just
start by, first of all,

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:26.080
thanking the three of
you, again, and responding

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:33.280
to Meredith's last
question by resuming

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.000
a conversation I had very,
very briefly with Richard.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.780
And I'm sure I'll get
all of this wrong.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:50.090
As far as I know, what
happens to early humans,

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:52.870
to mark early humans
as bipedalism,

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:56.680
we come down from the trees
and start walking on two legs,

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.390
we stopped knuckle-walking.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:03.061
And that seems to be associated
with also a reduction in size

01:02:03.061 --> 01:02:03.560
of canines.

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:09.310
Our canines, we have
them, but they're

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:15.850
much smaller than those
of our primate cousins.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:22.010
And I said, rather
rationally, that it must be,

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:23.950
to pick up Meredith's
point, that somehow

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:27.130
the reduction of canines must
be a sign of a renegotiation

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:35.020
of sexual relations, because
the canines in chimpanzees

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:41.740
and gorillas must be used in
establishing male dominance.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.210
And then you said, no,
I was completely wrong.

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:47.980
So let's start there.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:51.580
And then we can maybe figure
out the deeper question

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.600
that Meredith is
asking, why we care

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.640
so much about these arrangements
anyway in our origin stories.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.380
Well, that's the great segue
about what Australopithecines

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.130
were doing.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.670
So what you're talking about
is three or four million years

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:10.810
ago.

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:13.820
The genus Homo came out
about two million years ago.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.670
And then six million
years ago, we

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:17.750
came from a
chimpanzee-like ancestor.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.970
And you said, we came
down from the trees.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:25.900
Excuse me for this aside,
but we didn't come down

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.070
from the trees.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.790
What we did was to shift from
quadrupedal walking in forests

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.650
to bipedal walking
in more savannas.

01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:34.600
But we still went
up in the trees,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.120
and the chimps spend a lot of
time on the ground right now.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.036
So there's no reason to
think that we actually

01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:41.730
changed the amount of time
we spent on the ground.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.729
The point, though, is that
the Australopithecines

01:03:46.729 --> 01:03:49.020
by the time you get to three
or four million years ago,

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.870
though not earlier, have got
these very reduced canines.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.650
And as you say,
absolutely rightly,

01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.250
they have been attributed to
reduced fighting among males,

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:04.030
which they associate
with more monogamy.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.460
I gave my reasons a few minutes
ago for why you wouldn't

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.500
expect monogamy at that time.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.960
And the logic about the reduced
teeth is now, I would say,

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.560
predominantly
referred to eating.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.470
And what's going on is that
this shift into more open areas

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:25.530
is associated with
a change in the diet

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.510
to things that you'd
spend longer chewing

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.570
and that you need stronger
muscles to be able to chew,

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:36.580
and namely roots, roots
and tubers coming out

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.910
of the ground.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.650
And if you look at carnivores
or ungulates or primates,

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.320
where they are
doing more chewing,

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.980
then the muscles come
forward, the gape of the mouth

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.030
is reduced, and therefore the
weapons at the end of the mouth

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:54.040
just get in the way.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.950
You can't afford long
canines because you

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.900
have a relatively
narrow gape in order

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.830
to be able to accommodate
really effective chewing.

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:07.930
So I would say
that many people--

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.660
I mean, I hesitate to speak
for the whole discipline--

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:16.810
but a popular view is that
the reason for the reduction

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:21.910
in those canines is to do
with better chewing and not

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.620
reduced fighting.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.130
So in terms of the
Genesis account,

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:35.650
it's God's words about being
vegetarians and eating as many

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.500
of the fruits, except for
one, that really counts,

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:44.295
and not the ecstatic sexual
bond between the male

01:05:44.295 --> 01:05:44.920
and the female.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.580
Well, you can say that.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.130
Of course, the
ancestry of primates

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.940
goes back a long
way of eating stuff.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.000
But this is eating
roots, in particular,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.040
that enforces the chewing.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.355
I wanted to challenge
the premise.

01:06:01.005 --> 01:06:03.580
I'm sure I'm wrong,
but I know of a number

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.430
of cosmological stories
which do not involve mating.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.110
Absolutely.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.230
And I wanted to draw attention
to the fact that a lot of them

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:14.890
seem to me to refer
to relationships

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.360
between men and
women of dominance,

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.650
as was being discussed earlier.

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:22.170
And that seems to me to
be really fascinating.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.700
And Kimberley, you
drew attention to this.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.570
It's certainly puzzling-- in
a world in which men always

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.806
are dominant, why do you need
stories to reinforce that?

01:06:32.806 --> 01:06:34.430
That was Richard--
that was Stephen's--

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:35.150
Oh, is is Stephen?

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.650
Sorry.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:37.390
Stephen's concern.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:42.950
And I agree, Richard, that
creation stories always

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:48.525
reflect the preoccupations
of the society telling them.

01:06:48.525 --> 01:06:53.214
And when we say that, we need
to be not overly sociological,

01:06:53.214 --> 01:06:55.130
because the relationships
between human beings

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.790
and supernatural beings
is, I would argue,

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.830
usually the most important.

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:04.400
We tend to, because we
live in the age we do,

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.760
be extremely anthropocentric.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.790
But that does not mean that
these stories were negotiating

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:13.900
relationships with
the powers that

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.830
live us, that we
pretend to understand,

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:19.550
as [INAUDIBLE] said,
was the central concern.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:24.050
And so one of the sadness,
the breakages that

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:27.250
occurs in the Genesis story
that Stephen doesn't dwell on

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.870
is God remaining in the garden.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.440
God is lonely, he remains there.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.700
And what's interesting is that
the Jewish mystical tradition

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.070
argues that part of God
actually gets split off.

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:41.030
The lowest [INAUDIBLE],, the
Shekhinah, the feminine part

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:44.120
of God actually goes
into exile with Adam

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.710
and Eve, weeps with them, is
cut off from the rest of God.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.450
And so you end up
with this yearning

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:52.160
for reunion and return.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.220
And that is what it ends up in
the temple between the Keruvim,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.010
between the Cherubim,
the holy of holies.

01:07:58.010 --> 01:08:00.200
And that is what goes
into exile when the temple

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.500
itself is destroyed and ends up
being incarnate as the Sabbath

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.250
queen at Shabbat.

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:08.670
So God himself is
left lonely as well.

01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:11.390
But anyway, the negotiation
of human relationships

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:13.580
with invisible powers,
if we're thinking

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.590
about the Paleolithic
or Neolithic period,

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:19.430
we have to include the dead
who are metaphysical, who are

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.069
much more powerful than living.

01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:23.859
That relationship
has to be negotiated.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:26.270
And what's interesting--
for example,

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.020
I was working at CatalhoyÃ¼k
for three different seasons,

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.060
working with
archaeologists there--

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.430
is the way that that ends
up getting literalized, too.

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.200
The dead have to
be under the floor,

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.420
or you can't build the house.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.430
There has to be a dead
baby in the southwest

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.779
corner of the house,
or you can't build it.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:46.930
Nowadays?

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:47.689
Oh, no, no, no.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.229
This is 9,000 years ago.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:50.330
OK, yeah.

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.029
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:53.590
So the dead--

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:54.800
Just to be clear.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.420
We tend to think of the dead
as different from the gods--

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.170
but we shouldn't.

01:08:57.170 --> 01:09:00.290
In most societies, the dead are
powerful, metaphysical beings.

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:03.649
In fact, they may have been
the source of later theologies

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:04.670
that are more developed.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.910
So I would agree,
not all cosmogonies

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:11.750
are interested in patrolling
sex or reproduction.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.120
Many of them have
other concerns.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.526
Well, I'm aware of
this from reading

01:09:16.526 --> 01:09:18.109
some of the
hunter-gatherer literature

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:25.910
where you often find this story
of why it is that men end up

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:27.520
controlling women.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.560
And you get the perspective
that it's an endlessly used

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.380
justification.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.770
And the idea that seems
to me to be appealing here

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.979
is that in the public
arena it's clear

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:43.460
that men are dominant to
women, but in the private arena

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.660
it's not.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.170
In other words, within a
husband and wife relationship,

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:50.450
then either the man
or the woman might be

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:51.871
socially dominant to the other.

01:09:51.871 --> 01:09:52.370
Right.

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:54.140
But it's not true
in the public arena.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.470
And so these stories
enable the men

01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.969
to appeal to a wisdom that is
agreed in the public level.

01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:01.760
That's patriarchal.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.010
To justify their
patriarchy within the home.

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:06.440
It's so interesting you say
that because for example

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.200
at CatalhoyÃ¼k, the
anthropologists were

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.761
so startled to discover that men
and women have the same amount

01:10:12.761 --> 01:10:15.260
of stress in their bones, the
same amount of weight-bearing,

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.290
that the labor was in
fact equally divided.

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.690
And I'm not saying it was a
proto-egalitarian society,

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:24.800
but that was very surprising.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.330
They were also
surprised to discover

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:27.950
that the skeletons
that are routinely

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.440
buried under the floors
of the houses, up to 30

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.880
in some cases--

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.270
this was a shocker--
through dental phenotyping,

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:36.810
were not related to one another.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.590
So again, back to
Meredith's notion of the way

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.990
that family and kinship
groups can be very differently

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:44.300
culturally appropriated
and distributed, depending

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.890
on where we are in the world.

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:47.810
It sounds like in
house societies,

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:50.018
there's been recent evidence,
from what I understand,

01:10:50.018 --> 01:10:52.580
in hunter-gatherer societies
even that ritual or fictive

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.040
kinship can be as binding
in a way that people--

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.570
Exactly.

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:58.590
Distribute time and
energy and resources as--

01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:59.090
Exactly.

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:00.380
Genetic forms of kinship.

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:00.880
Exactly.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.970
And child-rearing, perhaps, and
food distribution, all of it.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:12.680
I want to ask, to put
a little pressure,

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.930
this is partly a response to
Kimberley's calling me out

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:23.740
as the village atheist,
which I suppose I am,

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:29.260
because it's true that
the reason I think

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.480
you're right in
observing that in my case

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:42.970
I spend too little time thinking
about the strange haunting

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:46.706
quality of Adam and Eve hearing
the voice of God in the garden,

01:11:46.706 --> 01:11:47.830
and then hiding themselves.

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:49.969
So it's not that God is
withdrawing from them,

01:11:49.969 --> 01:11:50.760
but they're hiding.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.570
They're now in a
position of hiding.

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:56.470
But it has to do
with my difficulty,

01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:02.430
I think, grappling with what
to do with the belief in God

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.130
that I think can't fit--

01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:13.930
but Richard may correct me-- in
our current scientific account

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:15.160
of human origins.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:21.850
It is possible that you could
construct a narrative in which

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:24.331
some part of your--

01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:26.650
how shall we say--
life frame you

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:29.664
can acknowledge the
existence of a god.

01:12:29.664 --> 01:12:31.330
I don't know how, but
I imagine you can.

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:33.490
But not in the
evolutionary story,

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:35.620
if I understand the
evolutionary story.

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.360
There isn't a way in
which the creature who

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.850
was described in this,
in various forms,

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:44.830
in so many of the other
of the origin stories,

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:47.370
there's no equivalent figure.

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.060
I take it that that
was the whole force

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:53.800
of the scientific effort of
the late 18th and 19th century

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.412
to try to get that figure
out of the origin story.

01:12:57.412 --> 01:12:59.620
Well, that's a funny way of
reading Darwin, isn't it?

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.710
Because I thought that
Darwin's point was he

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:04.390
found it rather
agonizing, that you

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:07.180
have to give up God
in order to understand

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.730
the way that evolution worked.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:11.740
All right, I don't mean that
was done gleefully or easily.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.240
No.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.010
But that it was part of--

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:16.446
it was built in.

01:13:16.446 --> 01:13:17.320
It was a consequence.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.320
Right, it was a perhaps
unintended consequence.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.690
And an interesting
moment happened--

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.270
so Darwin is in correspondence
with Asa Gray, who

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:29.680
is a really famous biologist,
actually, here at Harvard.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.670
And Asa Gray is also
a committed theist.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.230
And Darwin is disappointed.

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:38.260
He finds himself disappointed
to see how hard Asa Gray is

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.620
working to try to reconcile
evolutionary accounts

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.940
with some role for God.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.100
And so he does, I think,
what a lot of people

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.260
with faith and also who
believe in evolution do,

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.260
which is he defers God's
role farther and farther back

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.230
in the process, a kind of a--

01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:53.820
Watchmaker.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.020
A watchmaker, but
also his original take

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.410
was that it was God who put the
favorable variations in there

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:01.732
among all the
not-so-favorable ones.

01:14:01.732 --> 01:14:03.190
And Darwin is
getting these letters

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:05.740
from Asa Gray, who
he just loves dearly

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.320
and who has been
his defender here,

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.260
and who has been baiting Louis
Agassiz, like it's his job.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.761
And Darwin is just reading these
letters, saying, oh my god.

01:14:14.761 --> 01:14:16.260
And I think that
for him is actually

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.010
a moment when he sees
how disappointed he

01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.650
is in Gray trying
to fit God in there,

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:23.770
when he really has to come
face-to-face with how, for him

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.990
at least personally, there
isn't a space for God

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.800
in this narrative.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.900
And this is, in his relationship
with his wife Emma, a big deal.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.650
There are two points
in their relationship

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:34.899
when she writes him letters
because she's so agonized.

01:14:34.899 --> 01:14:36.640
One is right after
they get married

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.100
and they've moved
to London and she's

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.209
hoping for rounds of
theater and visitors,

01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:43.250
and Darwin is hoping for
quiet time in his study.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.749
And so they have
all these newlywed,

01:14:44.749 --> 01:14:46.210
figuring-it-out moments.

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.860
And in the midst of
this, she is also

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.920
realizing how much
more committed

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.060
she is to faith than he is.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.430
And so she writes him a
very gentle but really

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.119
heart-wrenching letter
about the goodness in him

01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:58.660
and hoping that
he'll be able to come

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.687
to a place of
reconciliation with God.

01:15:00.687 --> 01:15:02.770
And she doesn't do it again
until after The Origin

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.570
of Species has been published.

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:06.510
And she's starting to
see the consequences,

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:08.676
and they've lost a couple
of their beloved children.

01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:11.890
And she has really needed
God to get her through that,

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.940
and he is walking
farther and farther away.

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.940
So that's the site of
their second moment

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.220
of reckoning on that.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.450
What I take to be
Kimberley's response

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.460
in your beautiful
presentation to this

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.950
is in effect what was Lucretia's
response, which is you

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:31.960
don't have to give up wonder.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.780
You don't have to give up
the sense of the marvelous

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.900
in the world.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:40.097
You just have to
give up the idea

01:15:40.097 --> 01:15:41.680
that there's a
metaphysical order that

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.820
is creating all of this, moving
the pieces around, rewarding

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:46.600
and punishing.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.660
I think, Stephen, and
I don't in any way

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.890
intend to fudge the answer,
but I think all of us,

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.580
and I include myself, are
to some degree held hostage

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.050
to the notion of God as
a really great uncle.

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.210
And I even found it in
your book that he's kind,

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:05.890
that he's merciful,
that he's just.

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:06.880
He's not those things.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.840
He's not even those things
in the Hebrew Bible.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840
He's fighting between his
mercy and his justice.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.730
He prays that his mercy
may overcome his justice

01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:14.580
and all his other
attributes in the Tanakh.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.960
The Hebrew Bible is full of his
arbitrary cruelty, his might,

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.960
endless creative energy.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.740
Yeah, John Levinson has argued
that he never really overcomes

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:30.040
chaos and has to fight
it to the end of time.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:36.210
So he's I think beyond
some of the categories that

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:37.740
tend to emerge.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.290
I think the thing
that gets us hung up

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:43.770
is the notion of
intentionality, right?

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.770
That we see these wonderful and
beautiful and amazing things

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:50.880
that continually confound
us with their awe-inspiring

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.630
dimensions in science, including
some of the terrible things

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:57.120
that science reveals
to us through research,

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.090
and we think that
can't be intentional.

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.310
But my point is,
myth is not about

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.280
rational metaphysical
involvement

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.600
in the world on God's part.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.860
It's not about intentionality.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.350
It's always
paradoxical, it's always

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.580
impossible to understand.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:15.030
But the great mysteries in
human experience are also.

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:22.890
So I don't think that the
split between rationality

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.560
and irrationality that
comes through in the book--

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.080
or fantasy, should
we say-- is really

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.920
the level that we want to stop.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.680
That was my only point.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.730
No, I take it.

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.140
I think I understand.

01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:40.230
In relation to where we
are now, and I don't think

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:42.840
I resolved this at
all in the book.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.730
I can't resolve it.

01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:48.270
I think one key question
about the origin stories

01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:49.820
is who gets to tell them.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.580
Right.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:58.780
And we haven't resolved that
struggle now in our classrooms,

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.310
in our schools.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:05.190
And we're actually
in some ways still

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:10.650
having key arguments about this
that have real consequences

01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:11.430
and stakes.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:15.840
So my goal in the
book is not to--

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.992
I wouldn't have bothered
to write a book about--

01:18:17.992 --> 01:18:19.052
Right.

01:18:19.052 --> 01:18:20.760
The story of Adam and
Eve, even if I just

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.520
thought it was something
that didn't count and should

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.260
be brushed aside, I
think it's incredibly

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.410
powerful and beautiful.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.410
I want it to be powerful
and beautiful as a work

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:33.360
of literature, not as an
origin story that somehow

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.240
has a place at the table
with the origin story

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.710
that Richard and Meredith
are trying to tell.

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:42.990
Yeah, but we know
that when speaking

01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:46.285
to people about the
myths that animate them,

01:18:46.285 --> 01:18:48.280
that give meaning
to their lives--

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.010
and I include myself,
and all of us,

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.790
we all have them,
whatever they are--

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.680
that the presentation of
"facts," quote, unquote,

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.020
is not the way to combat them.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.520
And why do they
have to be combated?

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.170
In other words, what is getting
us so animated and so angry

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:08.280
at this point, for example,
in our country's history?

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.540
Do we really need to fight
the story of Adam and Eve

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.200
with creation?

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.740
Are these two
antagonistic, I wonder?

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:20.280
Even without a kind
of violent synthesis,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.640
does it need to be violent?

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.640
I'm not sure.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.380
But I do know that
sitting at Harvard

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.921
and throwing up our
hands and saying,

01:19:26.921 --> 01:19:28.860
can you believe that 46%
or 50% of the country

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.050
actually believes this
story is not bringing us

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:32.350
into more of a conversation.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:34.140
It's pulling us apart.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:38.554
And perhaps that is
the wrong question.

01:19:38.554 --> 01:19:40.470
Perhaps the battle is
not pitched in that way.

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:41.790
Perhaps it's not a battle.

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:43.160
That's my only point, I think.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.062
And I teach some of that
percent at UMass, Boston.

01:19:46.062 --> 01:19:48.270
And this is something I'm
curious, if the rest of you

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:50.190
have encountered
in your pedagogy.

01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:53.070
I teach the Introduction
to Human Evolution

01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:54.960
in our Anthropology department.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.720
And every semester,
at least one student,

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.440
whether privately on a beginning
of semester questionnaire,

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.800
or publicly sometimes in
front of the entire class,

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.210
asks me a question about
either how their faith fits,

01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:11.520
or sometimes the terms
are really stark-- well,

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.910
what about Jesus is a question
that has been posed to me once

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.640
two minutes before class--

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.250
and as I was scribbling
on the board.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:24.630
And my instinct has been to
try to not be antagonistic,

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:26.655
to try to create a space--

01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:31.500
one story I told was about when
different kinds of evidence

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.583
become available and how
we work with the evidence

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:36.610
that we have in
any given moment.

01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:38.550
But that I think is
unsatisfying to people

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:41.160
for whom particular
forms of evidence

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.230
don't really carry
water, or perhaps they

01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:45.060
carry the water only so far.

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.982
And then like leaky
baskets, it all leaks out.

01:20:47.982 --> 01:20:49.440
So this is something
that I'm still

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.840
very much grappling
with in a practical way

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.710
because there seems
something sacred to identity

01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.580
in those professions of
faith that one does not

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.050
wish to denigrate.

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:03.090
Yeah, and my only point
is that faith also

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:06.030
interacts with history
and historicity in ways

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:07.500
that we're still kind of--

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.700
so on our side the
fact that last week it

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.900
was revealed that the Crusader
tomb at the Holy Sepulcher

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:20.280
was in fact removed to
reveal a fourth century--

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.682
third century-- fourth
century covering as Eusebius

01:21:23.682 --> 01:21:24.390
had described it.

01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.940
Underneath, there was a Jewish
tomb with a shelf in it.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.979
And the response,
if one is discussing

01:21:28.979 --> 01:21:31.020
that, which doesn't mean
that the Resurrection is

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.110
true or untrue, it just means
that that was what was found.

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:36.720
So there's more historicity
to the oral and other written

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.670
accounts than we had thought.

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:41.340
That is met here generally
with an eye roll.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.287
That's still evidence.

01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:44.370
It doesn't mean it's
evidence of the Resurrection,

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:47.010
but it does mean that there's
more historicity to the faith

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:49.260
accounts than we had suspected.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.740
And so it would be good to see
these things in conversation.

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.650
I was thinking about Richard's
points about the ways

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:58.140
that paradigms can
be de-stabilized.

01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:02.730
There's a site at Gobekli
Tepe, which has been excavated.

01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:06.890
It's 11,000 years old.

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:10.710
Heinrich Schmidt excavated
it, one of many tepes.

01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:14.590
But he actually dug into
it about 15 or 20 years ago

01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:18.570
and discovered that it
contained 18 concentric layers

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.550
of enormous stone circles
with anthropomorphic and

01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:22.950
theriomorphic figures on it.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.870
These are 20 feet high,
they're megaliths,

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:26.970
they were extremely
difficult to build.

01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:30.900
We know from incisions in the
rocks around that they were

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:33.450
made and carried great lengths.

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:36.600
The only problem is that they
were made by hunter-gatherers

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.900
and set up at enormous
cost and effort, which

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.600
upends the Marxist
narrative that you have

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.200
to have subsistence and at
least some mode of security

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.760
and guarantee of food
and freedom from attack

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.500
before you can have religion.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.991
And this upended that narrative.

01:22:53.991 --> 01:22:56.490
So it doesn't mean that religion
is true or science is true.

01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:58.281
It just means we have
got to think about it

01:22:58.281 --> 01:22:59.770
in more complicated ways.

01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:03.240
I wanted just to allow
people to pose questions.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.360
And I'm going to
start with Homi,

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:13.870
and then we'll ask you
to pose your questions.

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:18.390
So thank you very much.

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:22.710
I found this to be so
engaging because it

01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:28.290
is such an intersective
conversation with convergences

01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:31.710
and departures in
important ways.

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:36.540
But one of the
issues that I thought

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:40.800
might be addressed
across the panel,

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.865
but found no direct engagement
is the question of desire.

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:52.360
The question of desire--

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:57.090
and I think where I
would root it would

01:23:57.090 --> 01:24:02.790
be in Kimberley's attack--

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.120
Kimberley, hang on, just
hang on for a second--

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.230
on intentionality.

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.620
I come in peace.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:15.920
On intentionality, or the
questioning of intentionality.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.240
And once you begin to question
that, then I think in many ways

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.050
the question of desire, not
simply reproductive or sexual,

01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:26.900
but the question of
desire, the desire which

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:32.960
starts in the Genesis
story, the unboundedness,

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.040
the uncontrolling ability, the
disobedience, the temptation,

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.210
the transgression.

01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:44.000
and in the Darwin account,
this agonizing, somehow

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.300
to keep God out, the
agony of the text

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.860
produces a symptomatic desire.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.470
There's a symptom
being written in that.

01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:59.000
And I just thought that
this is a concept that,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.650
in terms of art,
for instance, even

01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:05.010
the manufacture of
materials to desire,

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.720
to move from what is real,
and may not be to realism,

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.910
and creates that desire
in the work itself.

01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:14.630
So I was just interested,
maybe this question

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:16.220
goes nowhere, leave
it out, but I just

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.420
kept thinking for each of you
in different ways, the notion

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.580
of desire, I wanted--

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.880
One easy place to
start is actually

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.250
sidestepping, as we've done
for a second, the question

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:29.930
of reproductive desire.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:32.720
Whether it is or isn't at the
center of this origin story

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.480
is simply to quote the strange
moment, the moment of truth,

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.220
as it were, the key moment
when the fruit is taken,

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.290
the transgression happens.

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:48.170
The lines in the King
James translation at least

01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:52.170
are, when the woman saw that
the tree was good for food.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.250
So we have Richard.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.730
And that it was
pleasant to the eyes,

01:25:58.730 --> 01:26:01.040
that it was pleasant
to the eyes.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.970
So there's a extremely strange
registering of its beauty.

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:08.490
There's stickers,
little stickers on it.

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:13.460
But it's not only graspable,
but that it's somehow

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.780
visually satisfying.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.130
It's beautiful, aesthetic.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.210
And a tree to be desired.

01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:18.100
There you are.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.310
A tree to be desired to
make one wise, is the line.

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:23.290
She took the fruit
thereof and did eat,

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:24.660
and gave it to her husband.

01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.320
So those three things
that are linked here--

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.780
that it was food, that it
was visually satisfying.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.940
Beauty, in a way.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.610
Visually beautiful that it was.

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:42.302
And that it had some cognitive
power or to be desired.

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:43.760
So I think that's
very interesting.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.051
But the point you make,
Kimberley, which fascinated me,

01:26:46.051 --> 01:26:51.380
was the splitting of God,
the female part goes.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.700
In Jewish mysticism.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.120
And then the male remains.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.670
And the longing for desire
and that perspective.

01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:59.390
And I could go on,
but I just find this

01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:02.660
fascinating, [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.870
One place where I think
desire is really interesting

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:08.044
is another point that
Kimberley made about--

01:27:08.044 --> 01:27:09.710
and this is something
I'm really curious

01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:11.990
about-- the absence
of ethics, and almost

01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:15.680
a prescription for ethics not
belonging in the space of myth,

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.630
or at least not the
kinds of normative ethics

01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:19.590
that we are engaged in.

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:24.200
And so I was starting to wonder
about this desire for ethics

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.440
that we seem to have in
both evolutionary and

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.870
non-evolutionary narratives
in origin stores.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.420
It's not that there's no ethics.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.440
And I think Stephen's
book makes a great case

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.140
for some of the
ethics that emerged

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.530
from the tale of Adam and Eve.

01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:42.650
It's that at another
level there is a place

01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:46.320
that I wouldn't say without
ethics, but is beyond ethics.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.635
So that the fruit is beautiful
and the woman desires it.

01:27:49.635 --> 01:27:50.510
But who put it there?

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:52.880
God-- God put it there.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.460
And it is especially beautiful
because he made it that way.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:58.610
And then as Stephen points
out, told them not to eat it.

01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:02.180
So it's a booby trapped
fruit, and they do,

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.240
and all sorrow breaks loose.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.110
And God himself, even if he
is not this [INAUDIBLE]----

01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:13.970
later Jewish mysticism-- loses,
I would argue, his children,

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:17.060
because I think he does carry
Marduk with him, and I think,

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:17.700
so forth.

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.660
But he loses these creations
and he's left alone

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.100
walking in the garden.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.540
It's heartbreaking.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.350
The liturgies afterwards in
Judaism and Christianity--

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:30.080
and then when we find it
in [INAUDIBLE] in Islamic

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.170
tradition--

01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:34.010
[INAUDIBLE] yearning
for reunion with God,

01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:35.780
how much they miss him.

01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.730
But if we look at some
mystical writings,

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:41.690
we find God yearning for
humans, that he's very sad.

01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:42.600
I see someone.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.110
I think you have the microphone?

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:46.370
I'm just passing it.

01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:47.120
You're passing it.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.580
There was someone
in the back, so.

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:50.190
[INAUDIBLE]

01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:51.057
OK, would you.

01:28:51.057 --> 01:28:53.390
And then here's someone here
you can give the microphone

01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:54.961
to afterwards.

01:28:54.961 --> 01:28:55.460
Please.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.730
I have a question for
Professor Wrangham.

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:02.560
I'm just trying to work
out how Mitochondrial Eve

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.650
and Y-chromosome Adam could
be alive in different times.

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:10.040
So it seems to me that one
solution, and the obvious one,

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:15.690
but probably not the likely one,
is that Eve was messing around,

01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:18.440
so that she would have had
children with four, six, eight,

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.620
who knows how many different
men, who would have carried on.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.590
Another one would be,
no, Mitochondrial Eve

01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:26.930
is the wrong person to look at.

01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:33.330
There was a Eve who had
children with an Adam.

01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:38.960
And all her female
descendants died out,

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.470
except for one line 80,000
years later or something.

01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:45.860
Could you comment on whether
Adam and Eve would have

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.580
been alive at the same time?

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:54.260
Well, as I said, I mean, 100,000
years could separate them.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:57.890
But I don't think you have to
point too much to Mitochondrial

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.690
Eve herself--

01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:02.540
her daughters, her
granddaughters, and so on.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.690
I mean, it just
happened that the males

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:10.820
with whom this lineage
were producing babies

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:14.870
were males who themselves were
remarkably diverse in terms

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:17.500
of their origins.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.180
It maybe happened because the
females were moving around

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.380
into different areas.

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:24.220
It maybe because the
males were moving around.

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:28.760
But there's nothing
logical that says

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.510
the daughters, the
granddaughters,

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:35.030
and the subsequent
descendants of Eve

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:38.530
had to stick to any
particular set of males

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:40.790
they were associated
with at the time

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:45.290
or location of
Mitochondrial Eve.

01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:49.910
But wasn't it the male
line, the Y-chromosome Adam,

01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:51.440
that was earlier?

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.445
Yes, it goes back
earlier, exactly.

01:30:55.445 --> 01:30:56.810
Possibly.

01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:57.640
Well, yes.

01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.040
It could intersect at one point.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:30:59.540
That's true.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.657
Yes, I mean, there's
still a range

01:31:01.657 --> 01:31:02.990
of error estimates on the dates.

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.920
Intersect exactly, so
intersect at one point.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.660
It could at one point.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.618
There's just one point.

01:31:05.618 --> 01:31:10.340
It is possible that
they can be united.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:11.660
Thank you.

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.920
Yes, yes, please.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.840
Thank you.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.960
I'd like to ask about some
ethical aspect of the Genesis

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.460
story.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:23.370
So, as I know, Adam
and Eve suddenly

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:26.990
recognized their shame
when they're being nude

01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:30.860
after eating the apple.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:35.690
So I'm wondering, is there
such a shame on nudity?

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.430
Being nude, is it
common in all people,

01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:42.060
including primitive times?

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:48.120
And if so, is there such a
story about feeling shame

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:51.341
on nudity in other myths
or other [INAUDIBLE]..

01:31:51.341 --> 01:31:51.840
Yes.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.220
Yes, I think this
is also a question

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:56.080
that Stephen and
Richard could speak to,

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:59.140
but part of what
was so upsetting

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.730
to Europeans in the early
modern era, and even to Darwin

01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:06.160
when he visited
South America, was

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.220
that he saw people with really
different conceptions of shame

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:09.880
from his own.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.310
He saw people who went
about pretty much naked.

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.420
So that form of shame was
not, in fact, universal.

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.300
Right.

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:17.800
Yes.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.882
So is there a people feeling
no shame totally nude,

01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:27.860
or they have some
minimal [INAUDIBLE] on?

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.360
Yeah, there are.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.641
Well, yes.

01:32:31.641 --> 01:32:32.140
I think so.

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.840
I'm pretty darn sure.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.260
I'm racking my brain
for photographs.

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:42.070
It reminds me-- this
issue-- of Chagnon's story

01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:47.950
about the Yanomami
in Venezuela where

01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:53.790
the men wear a string that is
tied to the top of the penis,

01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:58.060
and it holds the penis
up near to their waist.

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:01.200
And a man would not be seen
dead without his penis string.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.710
But it covers nothing.

01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:06.780
It's totally symbolic.

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.880
And so what happens is
with missionary histories,

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.710
particular Christian
missionary histories,

01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:17.150
is that ideas of shame
that are drawn from Genesis

01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:20.500
are then imposed on
other peoples who have,

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.840
as Richard said, very, very
different cultural notions

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.740
of dress, of shame,
very different.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.880
And it becomes extremely
difficult to understand those

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.480
because they're coming
out of the story.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.020
I mean, it's possible.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:39.200
There's other questions, so
let's pass the microphone

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:39.700
around.

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.755
I almost hate to bring this
up, but the story of Lilith.

01:33:46.755 --> 01:33:49.645
Did you pay any attention
to that in your book?

01:33:49.645 --> 01:33:51.055
That is so far afield.

01:33:54.589 --> 01:33:57.130
I mean, I mentioned Lilith and
discussed her briefly, but not

01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:57.790
a lot of time.

01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:03.250
But I think it's a fantastically
interesting story, precisely

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:10.320
because it takes to
a more extreme point

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.940
the question of dominance
and disobedience.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:20.820
The Lilith stories, I'm sure
you know, it's not biblical,

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.911
but about a possible, and there
are many speculations about

01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:26.410
this-- and rabbinical
speculations--

01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:30.310
about possible alternative or
earlier attempts on God's part

01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:32.320
to do something--

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.410
in this case, an
extra-rabbinical a possible

01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:43.420
creation of a female who refused
to obey, and in this case

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:44.420
gave up.

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.450
I mean, was threatened
with dire punishments,

01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:49.270
including the killing
of her offspring

01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:51.220
and nonetheless
refused because she

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:58.300
said she was made of the same
or better stuff from Adam.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.720
The reason I don't
talk about it,

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.120
not simply out of
ignorance, but partly

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.670
because what fascinated me
is that the biblical story

01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.800
already, even though it has
this enormously long history

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.060
of misogyny associated with it,
has the counter-argument also

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:20.170
built into it, that what
surfaces in the Lilith story

01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:24.460
is already what looks
like a much more orthodox

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:26.410
and conventional story of Eve.

01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:34.480
There are many people who say
from very early on that Eve

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.350
is the hero of the story, that
the disobedience is correct,

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.090
that Eve is superior to
Adam because she was created

01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:43.480
by the flesh and not
dirt, and because she

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:46.400
was created in the garden
and not out of the garden.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.810
And that is to say, one of the
strange, fascinating things

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:52.590
about the story-- and
it goes back to issues

01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:58.594
that Kimberley also
raised-- is that I

01:35:58.594 --> 01:36:00.760
don't think it's a mark of
a difference between myth

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.610
and literature.

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.370
But I think it is
the mark of what

01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:05.470
is interesting in both
myth and literature, which

01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:08.680
is the possibility of an
alternative interpretation

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.080
built into what looks
like a closed system.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.890
And the Adam and Eve
story is astonishing to me

01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:20.750
because in a tiny compass,
50 or 75 verses, you have--

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.310
Alternative interpretations.

01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:25.210
Violently alternative
interpretations

01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:28.960
that are hidden inside,
including Lilith, strangely

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.390
enough, built into
a story that looks

01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:33.150
like it's a clue excluding her.

01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:37.980
Yeah, please.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:40.930
I have a question
about language.

01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:42.740
You brought up language.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.120
And in the passage
that you mentioned

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.860
when Eve actually gets the
apple, she desires the apple,

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:53.370
she desires to know
and to know beauty.

01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:56.880
We imagine that this
happens through language.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.620
And yet, in the later
iterations of the story,

01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.120
there was a huge question
in the Middle Ages

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.530
and in the early modern
period whether the first word

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.920
was actually uttered
in paradise or outside.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.680
And Dante actually
leaves it open.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.110
He says in the De
vulgari, he says

01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:19.740
the first word was uttered
either inside or outside

01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:20.440
the paradise.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.570
So it's a very interesting,
complicated question

01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:27.780
about the relationship
between language and knowledge

01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:31.260
and beauty and aesthetics
and desire, perhaps, also.

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.670
And I wonder whether
you could speak to that?

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:40.500
I mean, there is, as
you know, as well as I,

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:45.950
there's an enormous history
of painting in which there

01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:50.410
are gestures, in
which all of this

01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:53.350
is acted out without
language at all,

01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:57.900
but with bafflement,
head scratching,

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:01.620
or sexual temptation,
the variety of things

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:05.340
that don't necessarily
involve language at all.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.220
It is the case that the
tradition that thinks

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.690
that the words existed already.

01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:10.350
In

01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:12.660
There are interpretations
of the story that

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.910
imagine that not
only did, of course,

01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:16.830
as Adam gives the
names to the animals

01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:19.140
and imagines it as
linguistic-giving,

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:21.780
but also imagines that
Adam had written already

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.840
a great philosophical
encyclopedia

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.380
about the world, because one
strong line of interpretation

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:31.140
is that humans lost knowledge.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:32.850
Humans once possessed
more knowledge

01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:34.560
and lost it then,
so that Adam must

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.350
have had a much fuller
linguistic capacity.

01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:39.540
And that this goes
against precisely

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:42.330
the alternative theory.

01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:47.250
I don't know enough about the
innumerable alternative origin

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:50.370
stories to know if the
issue of language comes up.

01:38:50.370 --> 01:38:53.620
It does in interesting ways.

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:56.910
And one thing, just to
note, is that the Jewish

01:38:56.910 --> 01:39:00.420
and the Christian and the
Islamic cosmogonic story

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.830
is not the only one
where the gods create

01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:05.340
the Earth through language.

01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:10.440
And so Genesis is very
startling in that way--

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:18.200
God says, he says the world into
being, he speaks it into being.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.640
And this is the case in
the Popol Vuh, as well,

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.000
the Mayan creation cosmogony.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.074
So of course that's picked up--

01:39:27.074 --> 01:39:29.490
and I think you mentioned
this-- with the Christian notion

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:32.029
of the logos, the
words that creates

01:39:32.029 --> 01:39:33.070
at the beginning of time.

01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:34.680
So we even see these
interesting icons

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.330
where you find Jesus Christ
walking in the Garden of Eden

01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:41.310
as the Logos, as God.

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:44.010
I mean, that's a very common
icon in the orthodox tradition,

01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:46.050
as well.

01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:50.670
But yeah, the role of
language is not uniformly

01:39:50.670 --> 01:39:54.570
stressed, or even mentioned
in some cosmogonies.

01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:57.690
My point is it's not
seen in all cosmogonies

01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:04.080
as the primary crowning
achievement of creation

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.760
or of human life.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.282
It's really interesting to
work in a preliterate dig

01:40:09.282 --> 01:40:10.740
where there was no
written history,

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.420
but there had to
have been language.

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:16.920
And to know that histories
were being told and shared,

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.130
and yet not in a way
that we could have access

01:40:20.130 --> 01:40:22.050
to through written
records, but had

01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:26.040
to begin to infer through other
forms of symbolic thought,

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.010
like hand paintings and
architectural arrangements

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:32.040
and the use of wild animal parts
inside houses, and burials,

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.970
and so forth.

01:40:32.970 --> 01:40:41.790
Is it believed, Richard, now
that chimpanzees possess some--

01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:42.600
Language?

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.330
Something that approaches or--

01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:46.770
No.

01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:50.280
What chimpanzees do is a
relatively sophisticated form

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.080
of animal communication,
but it doesn't

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.730
have anything like the
symbolic strength of humans.

01:40:56.730 --> 01:41:05.445
So you can bring chimpanzees
up to use hand signs,

01:41:05.445 --> 01:41:09.390
and they could end up
using maybe a few hundred.

01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:14.550
They can combine them into
two or three word chunks.

01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:16.230
A tweet, in effect.

01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:17.350
Sorry?

01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:21.670
Yeah, exactly, yes,
yes, the original tweet.

01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.960
But it's still
enormously simple.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.710
And so if we're
talking about language,

01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:32.860
I think that there is a very
strong case that only Homo

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.620
sapiens has had language.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.840
The Neanderthals, for all
of their cultural creativity

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.240
in a number of
ways, and they were

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.970
able to do almost everything
that Homo sapiens did,

01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:49.070
but they did it at
incredibly low rates.

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:52.940
And a predominant
interpretation is

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.890
that the big difference
between sapiens

01:41:54.890 --> 01:42:01.152
and our Neanderthal companions
was that they had no language.

01:42:01.152 --> 01:42:04.751
It's special to us.

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.250
Yes?

01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:06.150
I'm over here.

01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:09.270
I want to first thank you
for a fascinating discussion.

01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:11.010
I wanted to turn
to the part of it

01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:15.030
where you were all commenting
on the time period from Darwin

01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:19.440
after, where there is this
sense of maybe disappointment

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.910
or loss or difficulty in
reconciling views of the past

01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:27.270
that have a god in them,
and views of the past that

01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:29.230
have science in them.

01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:32.550
And if you think of
two groups of people

01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:36.360
moving along different
tracks and thinking

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.360
about the tension
between those groups

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:42.630
that we sometimes see
the results of now.

01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:44.040
But that doesn't
necessarily have

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.260
to be so because there is an
interpolation about our origin,

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.770
but that can co-exist,
right, that difference

01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:53.670
an interpolation.

01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:57.810
It's where differences
in extrapolation

01:42:57.810 --> 01:43:01.710
about what our
origin implies, that

01:43:01.710 --> 01:43:05.880
seems to be the cause
of more of the tension.

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.250
So I'm wondering if
any or all of you

01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:12.900
have thought about whether it's
necessary that interpolating

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.810
back leads to the results
of extrapolating forward

01:43:15.810 --> 01:43:20.190
that appear to diverge and
creates such problems for us.

01:43:20.857 --> 01:43:22.440
That's such a great
way of putting it.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.440
Could you say more about the
issue of what it implies?

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.570
How do you see it?

01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:34.260
Well, one tends to think about
these days about legislation

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:38.820
that seems to reflect
strong religious beliefs.

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:42.060
And those religious beliefs
correlate with strong views

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.560
about literalism.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:50.900
In terms of interpretation
of religious texts.

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:56.610
And so to me, the tension
of the two streams

01:43:56.610 --> 01:44:01.710
plays out in a vision
of society that,

01:44:01.710 --> 01:44:05.220
at least on the edges of
those things, seems to differ

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.220
Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to
split hairs, but I would say,

01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:11.430
perhaps a certain
strand of interpretation

01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:12.850
of religious texts.

01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:14.670
For example, the
Quran says, if God

01:44:14.670 --> 01:44:19.810
had wanted to make just one
religion, he would have.

01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:25.320
And there are many other strands
within religious traditions

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:25.980
that are--

01:44:28.889 --> 01:44:31.180
I don't want to use the word
tolerant because it sounds

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:32.971
like poison and I wish
we'd get rid of it--

01:44:32.971 --> 01:44:36.040
but that are
egalitarian, for example,

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:43.210
or not seeking to discriminate,
to divide, to elevate,

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.460
to be hierarchical,
but the opposite.

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.279
So I just wanted
to make that point

01:44:47.279 --> 01:44:49.195
that we're talking about
interpretive strands.

01:44:49.195 --> 01:44:50.980
Right, and I didn't
mean to imply tolerance.

01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:51.640
No, no, I know you didn't.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.556
No, I know you didn't.

01:44:52.556 --> 01:44:57.610
It's just the sense of, can't
we get people into a room

01:44:57.610 --> 01:45:01.480
and try and all get along.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.910
But we don't have to
interpolate the same way.

01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:06.620
We can coexist believing
very different things.

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.430
Apparently not.

01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:08.020
Extrapolation.

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.170
But not, though.

01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:10.130
But so not.

01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:12.380
What is happening?

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.370
And I love your question.

01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:17.680
And a part of me wonders, you
refer to the time after Darwin.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.950
And even while Darwin himself
was very retiring and really

01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:25.300
reticent about this, some of
the proponents of his theory

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.770
actually staged conflict The
really famous conversation

01:45:29.770 --> 01:45:33.610
between Thomas Huxley and Bishop
Samuel Wilberforce at Oxford

01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:37.090
at the British Association
for the Advancement of Science

01:45:37.090 --> 01:45:39.940
meeting, which is the one where
Wilberforce said something

01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:43.660
like, on which side are you
descended from a monkey.

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:45.520
The whole monkey-human
business was nowhere

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:47.394
in Darwin's writing,
but this was a great way

01:45:47.394 --> 01:45:48.800
to publicize these issues.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.300
Right.

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.490
And there was a group of
progressive theologians

01:45:51.490 --> 01:45:53.260
in the Church of
England who published

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:56.020
a set of essays that accepted
transmutationary kinds

01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:56.920
of theories.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.820
Other parts of the Church
of England went haywire.

01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:02.810
It depends on your
interpretation.

01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:04.240
So I'm wondering,
and I genuinely

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.850
don't know this, if
that kind of a start,

01:46:06.850 --> 01:46:09.520
if the theory getting off
to that kind of a start

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.680
laid the groundwork
for the conflicts

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.210
that you're describing
in contemporary stakes.

01:46:16.210 --> 01:46:20.320
I mean, again, not to push us
where we can't live together,

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:27.230
but isn't it the case that you,
Richard, as a primatologist,

01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:31.360
are not, how shall we say,
only happen to be interested

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:34.900
in a particular animal,
namely chimpanzees,

01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.610
that you know a great
deal about, but are

01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:38.740
interested in the
relationship of chimpanzees

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.760
to human origins.

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:45.070
And the kinds of questions that
you ask about from your study,

01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:52.710
what are the origins of human
violence and warfare, or how

01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:55.920
did humans acquire
the brains that

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.770
enable us to process
the things that we do--

01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:03.130
those questions, I won't
say are religious questions,

01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:09.490
but they're not on
parallel tracks.

01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:11.590
I think it's extremely
difficult to keep there

01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:13.660
from being some
kind of collusion.

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.450
Well, I'm bound to
agree, I must say.

01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:21.850
It came home for me
in practice in 2009,

01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:24.280
which was the 200th
anniversary of Darwin's death.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.730
And the British Council
held a meeting in Egypt,

01:47:27.730 --> 01:47:31.510
hoping to have some kind
of synthesis of thought

01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:34.360
with Islamic scholars.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:40.960
And I would say the email chain
went on for months afterwards

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.250
with anyone from an
Islamic country objecting

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:47.680
to the notion of
evolutionary theory.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.610
It was impossible to find
any kind of resolution.

01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:53.800
And I think it's right,
there really is a clash.

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:59.120
I mean, for me, as a classic,
boring, old materialist,

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.110
I think that what
evolutionary theory has done

01:48:02.110 --> 01:48:06.850
is given us a really wonderful
story of human origins that

01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:12.310
reduces God to a personification
of the interests of the people

01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:14.750
who purvey the story of God.

01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:21.310
And it's a really fascinating
use of myth and story

01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:23.640
in terms of its
social consequences,

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:27.126
but it's not a
story about origins.

01:48:27.126 --> 01:48:29.500
Richard, I have many Muslim
friends throughout the world.

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:32.530
I don't know one who doesn't
accept evolutionary theory.

01:48:32.530 --> 01:48:34.390
So perhaps it was
the ones that were

01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:36.940
drawn into that
particular discussion.

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:38.740
No, I just mean I
think we have to be

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:43.020
really careful about assuming
that this dichotomy is

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:43.720
universal.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.820
I want to ask both
of you, if I could,

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:47.380
it's something I've
always been dying

01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:50.410
to ask evolutionary biologists.

01:48:50.410 --> 01:48:53.130
If we were, say, beavers,
and we were building

01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:55.780
dams in the shape
of the Taj Mahal

01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:58.180
or the Western
Wall or the Vatican

01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.900
or the Pyramids of
Teotihuacan, wouldn't

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.070
evolutionary biologists
be interested in those?

01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:07.750
But because of human
exceptionalism,

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:10.480
there doesn't seem to
be a really powerful

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:16.660
and robust and multivalent
exploration of religion,

01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:19.360
religious structures,
as part of evolution.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:23.440
Since we agree we're animals,
we're evolved primates,

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.010
we're interested in wasp
nests and beaver dams,

01:49:27.010 --> 01:49:29.320
but we are not
interested in religion

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.130
as an evolutionary entity,
other than the more basic,

01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:36.250
simplistic theories that say,
oh, it's a coping mechanism,

01:49:36.250 --> 01:49:38.380
or it's say a form
of social cohesion.

01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:40.300
I always want to say, say more.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.380
What else can you say about it?

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.110
I'm not trying to put you on the
spot, but I'm just wondering.

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:45.850
You introduce me to
your Islamic scholars.

01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:47.850
I'll introduce you to all
the religious scholars

01:49:47.850 --> 01:49:50.230
in evolution.

01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:51.350
It's a big area.

01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:53.710
There's tremendous
excitement about exploring

01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:57.820
all sorts of ideas about the
multiple functions of religion.

01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.940
Within an evolutionary
framework,

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:00.831
since we're primates.

01:50:00.831 --> 01:50:01.330
Absolutely.

01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:02.530
OK, that would be great.

01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:05.410
Because I don't hear that,
I hear them carefully

01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:08.830
patrolled and
separated and, yeah,

01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:12.910
human exceptionalism becomes
exhausting, in a way.

01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:13.730
Oh, well, sorry.

01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:17.170
It is restricted to
an analysis of human.

01:50:17.170 --> 01:50:19.340
Yes, yes, yes.

01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:19.870
But I mean--

01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:22.090
Because primates don't do it.

01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:24.840
Well, I think Jane
Goodall might disagree.

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.980
No, I don't think so.

01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.097
OK, well, I've
interviewed her on it.

01:50:28.097 --> 01:50:29.430
But that's OK, we'll talk later.

01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:30.846
I know what you're
thinking about.

01:50:30.846 --> 01:50:31.430
No, I'm not.

01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:33.220
We'll talk later.

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:40.410
Because chimpanzees throw rocks
under waterfalls and people

01:50:40.410 --> 01:50:44.380
have said, maybe these
waterfall displays

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:47.770
are worshipping
nature in some way.

01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:50.320
She said that, so let's
stick to the Taj Mahal.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.590
So you're saying that
those monuments and forms

01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.450
of religious thought,
et cetera, are

01:50:55.450 --> 01:50:58.000
being thought about
evolutionarily, as far as what

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.851
they do for us, for example.

01:51:00.851 --> 01:51:01.350
Yes.

01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:03.250
OK, that's great.

01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:06.490
I think on this note of
simultaneous disagreement

01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:11.830
and concord might be
an appropriate time

01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:16.010
to thank you all, and
thank my fellow panelists.

01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:20.560
