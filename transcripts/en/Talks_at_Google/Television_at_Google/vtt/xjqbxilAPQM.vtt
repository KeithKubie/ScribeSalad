STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I saw
you guys eating lunch.

Well look under your seats.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.190
KATIE ASELTON: You guys

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.564
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
You get a beer.

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:39.910
You get a beer.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.934
MALE SPEAKER: It's just like
a really crazy Oprah show.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.710
KATIE ASELTON:
Beer for everyone.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.590
MALE SPEAKER: So
clearly you guys

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.800
have played fantasy football.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.520
We know this.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.570
Everyone asks you this.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.830
MARK DUPLASS: Yes.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.750
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm
gonna ask you a question

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.240
that maybe you've
been asked a lot.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.365
MARK DUPLASS: Fantasy what?

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.460
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, exactly.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.025
Who's your favorite NFL team?

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.765
Do you have any agreement?

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:56.040
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Personally?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.360
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.401
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: The
New York football Giants.

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.226
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.600
See I made a really poor life
choice when I was like four

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.660
and chose the Jets.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.081
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Yeah, you did.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:03.390
You made a very poor--

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.900
MALE SPEAKER: It's
been really bad.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.440
Really bad.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.690
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: You're
probably a Mets fan too then,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.370
right?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.360
MALE SPEAKER: No I
didn't make that mistake.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.856
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: OK, cool.

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:11.147
MARK DUPLASS: You Interested
in becoming a quarterback?

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.150
They could use one.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.850
MALE SPEAKER: I'm working out.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.850
MARK DUPLASS: OK.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.230
JASON MANTZOUKAS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.930
MARK DUPLASS: I'm a Saints fan.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.860
I'm a big Saints fan.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.000
I grew up in New Orleans.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.580
Also, I'm finding myself
falling in love with the Browns

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.650
these days.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.990
We were kind of the new
Saints, underdog team--

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.180
KATIE ASELTON: He's bandwagon.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.566
MARK DUPLASS: It's time.

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:25.860
It's time.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.110
MALE SPEAKER: Johnny Football.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.420
You love Johnny Football,
the most famous quarterback

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.697
in Instagram?

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:33.780
MARK DUPLASS: I like our
cute little hometown hero

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.164
there making good.

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:36.080
I want him to stay on.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.121
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.650
KATIE ASELTON: I don't
like their pants.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.490
I like the Saints.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.461
I'll stick with them
because they're gold.

00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:44.960
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
I'm the person who

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.334
doesn't play fantasy football
and doesn't follow football

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.230
at all.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.920
But I guess, by default,
being from Boston,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.409
I'm a Patriots fan.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.950
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
sorry to hear that.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.020
JASON MANTZOUKAS: You
want a piece of this?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.520
MALE SPEAKER: So
you guys have a lot

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.980
of NFL stars come on the show.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.396
And you guys have had a lot
of guest stars over the years.

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:05.144
Who, out of those guys, really
has the comic timing down,

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:06.560
doesn't really
need much coaching,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.259
that can really maybe
transition, post NFL career

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.897
to television the way
Strahan has or anybody else.

00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:14.480
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
JJ is good, right?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.765
KATIE ASELTON: Yeah.

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:16.940
I think JJ has got a
really nice presence.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.180
And he's real sweet.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.970
And--

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.720
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Take it easy.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.727
Just take it easy, dude.

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:21.268
Take it easy.

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:22.990
KATIE ASELTON: I got
a real crush on JJ.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.620
What?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.085
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
He's humongous.

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:25.392
He's like baby Shrek.

00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:27.160
KATIE ASELTON: He's ginormous.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.750
I don't think-- The
biggest problem with JJ

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.940
is lighting him though
with a normal sized person.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.490
It was virtually impossible to
get a light on him and on Steve

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.360
at the same time,
like they're just--

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.401
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.252
Although, our heads
are the same size.

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:43.960
KATIE ASELTON: Just
on a different plane.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.070
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.750
JJ's great.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.170
Who else has been great?

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.400
Terrell Suggs was great.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.120
KATIE ASELTON:
Suggs was awesome.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.900
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Really funny on the show.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.430
We've had him a couple times.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.546
I mean Ochocinco, when
he showed up, was great.

00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.670
KATIE ASELTON: Now sound
had a real issue with him.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.010
You couldn't hear him.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.250
MARK DUPLASS: You know,
he was super subtle.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.600
He was throwing it away, man.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.330
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: And
our poor makeup girl.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.219
Sexual harassment that
went on that week.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.510
He's got like five cell phones.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.850
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Allegedly.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.010
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Allegedly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.570
Allegedly, he had
five cell phones.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.250
Allegedly, three of
them were burners.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.450
And allegedly, he rented
out a roller skating rink

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.060
with Floyd Mayweather
for an hour.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.019
Just the two of them.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.060
To couple skate, I guess.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.350
I don't know.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.650
MALE SPEAKER: Were
you guys not invited?

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.270
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
We were not invited.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.320
No, we were not invited.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.605
But he told us all about it.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:29.230
MARK DUPLASS: There
was also the moment

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.420
when he was in just
his underwear playing

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.540
slots in the lobby.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.110
KATIE ASELTON: In the casino.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.450
We were in Vegas
shooting that episode.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.075
MARK DUPLASS: While
we were technically

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:41.310
supposed to be shooting
one of his closeups.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.930
KATIE ASELTON: Socks, no shoes--

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.670
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Underwear, no shirt.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.753
He'd just come from a run.

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:47.609
KATIE ASELTON: --a
lot of jewelry,

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:48.650
and a couple cell phones.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.270
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Two cell
phones, no short pockets.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.169
No pockets, just
holding cell phones

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.710
playing slots at
8:00 in the morning.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.400
MARK DUPLASS: That guy
can come into a character,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.550
let me tell you what.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.550
He can fucking do it.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.450
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: He's method.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.950
MALE SPEAKER:
Speaking of committing

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.626
to a character, Jason, I
think, as someone said to me,

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.000
that some might
say that you have

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.930
the most ridiculous
or repulsive character

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.415
in the history of television.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.290
And can you explain--

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.510
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I'm
taking that as a compliment.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.780
MALE SPEAKER: As you should.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.680
Can you explain the creation
slash evolution of Rafi

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.000
and how much you
really steered that.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.160
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Well,
I mean, the creation

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.460
was, they wanted me to come in
and play this character who,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.320
in the beginning, they told me
was going to be named Sheldon.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.900
And it was going to be that
arc in that second season which

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.160
was, Sofia's brother
comes in the league.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.270
Everybody hates him.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.934
He's in the league
for an episode.

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:41.850
They all kick him out.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.260
He kind of leaves.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.590
And like I said, he's
name was Sheldon.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.490
The Schaffers, who
created The League,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.890
in a lovely way we're like,
what do you want to do.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.940
What version of the
guy do you want to be?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.595
And I was like, oh, I
know what I want to do.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:00.120
MARK DUPLASS: And here
we are six years later.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.860
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
And somehow Rafi

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.170
did not leave after
three episodes

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.190
because every show needs
like a sociopathic murder,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.720
possible rapist, possible
hate crimes person--

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.730
KATIE ASELTON: With
a real heart of gold.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.350
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
--with a real heart

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.340
of gold because that's a thing.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.520
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Who
really knows his football.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.936
JASON MANTZOUKAS: He doesn't
know anything about football,

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.060
loves the gang, and as
much as they hate him,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.397
he loves them twice as much.

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:24.230
MARK DUPLASS: I remember
the first episode--

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.330
I didn't know Jason very
well-- in the first episode,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.570
we were showing up to a party.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.000
And he was supposed
to be our third wheel.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.541
And it was really
supposed to be just

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:34.122
like a joke or two
side character.

00:05:34.122 --> 00:05:35.580
And we show up and
we start talking

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.090
about how we're
going to get home.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.250
And, literally, in
the first 30 seconds,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.460
Jason's like, I'm driving home.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.860
And I was like, where's
he going to go with this.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.151
So I was like, I'll play along.

00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:49.186
I was like, um, well you
can't because you're drinking.

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:50.685
He's like, oh,
that's not a problem.

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:52.650
I'm like, well OK.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.410
So how does this work?

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.250
Oh easy, 10 minutes before
I leave, crap out the booze,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.800
eat a mint, and I'm good.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.180
And everybody on set was like,
he's going to be here forever.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.100
We're never letting him leave.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.480
Then the next season,
while improvising,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.700
he comes up with this
idea that Dirty Randy

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.670
is his buddy who shoots pornos.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.790
All of a sudden, Seth Rogen
is playing Dirty Randy

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.720
and there are multiple
story lines with him.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.344
He makes shit up on set and
then they become like four--

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:24.260
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It
comes to fruiton, yeah.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.290
MARK DUPLASS: --four
season long stories.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.123
KATIE ASELTON: Yeah.

00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:27.762
And all of a sudden
it's a ring tone.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.470
JASON MANTZOUKAS: The
thing they will not

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.710
let me do, or they won't
let me follow through on

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.549
is my incest storyline that
I've started with Sophia--

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:37.590
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.906
JASON MANTZOUKAS: --which
has gotten pretty far

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:39.080
for television.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.860
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
It's got traction though

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.790
because they kept
it in this year.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.760
This last episode that
was on two weeks ago--

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.176
I think the one
you guys were just

00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.950
watching-- when you and I are
in the changing room, he's like,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.700
did you ever get one
of Sofia's blow jobs.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.360
And I was like, what?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.120
And he's like, I
heard they're awesome.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.310
JASON MANTZOUKAS: It's, they
are amazing, I've heard.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.932
So yeah.

00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:03.640
You're not wrong.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.700
It is a repulsive character
that I have absolute love for.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.450
MARK DUPLASS: And I
don't know if you know

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.480
but what's been so great is
that FX has created a brand

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.320
new network called FXX so
that they can just brand out

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.460
for edgier content.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.510
But what really happened is they
needed their own network just

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.150
for Rafi.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.670
You see, he was just
not appropriate for FX.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.045
KATIE ASELTON: We
weren't allowed

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:25.379
to say most of that stuff on FX.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.836
MALE SPEAKER:
Speaking of that, how

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:30.090
do you guys feel about being one
of two shows that's gone to FXX

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.600
and actually survived and
that, like really, you guys are

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.329
like the brand of that
network at this point.

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:38.120
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
It's funny you say that

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.610
during contract negotiations.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.812
Um--

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:42.020
MALE SPEAKER: You're welcome?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.327
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Is this
being sent to FX right now?

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:45.660
Everyone there listening, right?

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.630
The biggest hurdle
for me, personally,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.505
was like getting my
dad to understand

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:55.130
that it was going to
be on a new number

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.440
channel on the television
and what channel

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.190
that number was going to be.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.546
And that's what everyone kept--
well what is the new channel?

00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:03.420
I mean, I don't know.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.412
They'll figure it out.

00:08:04.412 --> 00:08:05.120
They'll tell you.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.980
But for us, I think it's just
we're on a smaller network,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.112
on a sub-- we're on
basic, basic cable now.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:12.820
KATIE ASELTON: It's
like the kid's table.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.260
We're at the kids table now.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.500
And I have always really
enjoyed the kids table

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.925
because then we get to
have our own conversations.

00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:20.550
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
And people watch us

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.830
on Netflix as well too, right?

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.110
KATIE ASELTON: I think
people Google us and find out

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.390
where to find us.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.220
MARK DUPLASS: Yeah,
nice tie-in bro.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.220
MALE SPEAKER: Very nice.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.720
MARK DUPLASS: Nice.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.640
Fucking, see that?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.409
That was--

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.182
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Or they Bing it.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.390
KATIE ASELTON: No they don't.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.600
No they don't actually.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.890
I've dug-- they don't Bing it.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.440
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I always
say, let's just Bing this

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.570
and let's figure it out.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.320
KATIE ASELTON: No.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.900
No.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.730
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: We
told you not to say that.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.850
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Where
are we going for dinner?

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.580
Dude just Bing it and--

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:46.995
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Just Bing it.

00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:48.536
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
--we'll just relax.

00:08:51.005 --> 00:08:52.880
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: You
love a good Bing joke

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.470
don't you, you nerds.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.396
You love it.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.450
MALE SPEAKER: So changing
the subject ever so slightly.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.980
Of all the expressions
that the show has coined,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.470
which are your favorites?

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.770
Whether it be Eskimo brothers--

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.390
KATIE ASELTON: Shit sipper.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.270
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.120
KATIE ASELTON: And FYI, just to
put this out in the interweb,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.590
it's shit sipper, not zipper.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.830
It drives me crazy when
people tweet at me--

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.890
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Do people
think it's shit zipper?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.681
KATIE ASELTON: Yes.

00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:23.131
What the heck does
that even mean?

00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.380
JASON MANTZOUKAS: That would
be a very difficult thing

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.020
to fasten.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.061
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:30.150
KATIE ASELTON: I feel like
that is my most common tweet.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.950
oh, hey shit zipper.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.789
No that's not a--
it's not a thing.

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:35.080
Don't even try and make it one.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.885
It's shit sipper.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.359
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Fear boner.

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:42.650
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Murder boner.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.800
MARK DUPLASS: You know, we
had a really complex situation

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.383
because we're on
basic cable and we're

00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:51.530
allowed to say a lot
of filthy things.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.690
But we were given a very
bizarre list of words

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.920
from FX that we can't say.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.620
For instance--

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.390
KATIE ASELTON: There's
like two you can't say.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.450
MARK DUPLASS: --you can
call somebody a cocksucker.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.000
That's no problem.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.840
But you cannot
say, suck my cock.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.670
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
You can't do it.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.169
The action.

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:08.950
MARK DUPLASS: So,
there's another word--

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.670
KATIE ASELTON: It
can't be-- yeah.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.212
There's no action involved.

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:12.920
MARK DUPLASS: There's
no action involved.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.050
Also, it just came
up in the writing

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.849
that some people wanted to use
the word retarded in the show.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:19.640
And that is definitely
not cool these days.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.670
KATIE ASELTON: That's not OK.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.060
MARK DUPLASS: Which I
don't disagree with.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.830
But we had to come
up with a word for it

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.830
because the characters
in our show are assholes.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.530
And they use it all the time.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.030
And--

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.360
JASON MANTZOUKAS: We
are lovely people.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.017
MARK DUPLASS: Yes,
we are wonderful.

00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:32.350
JASON MANTZOUKAS: We are heroes.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.280
MARK DUPLASS: Yeah.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.463
And so Nick Kroll penned
the term frittata.

00:10:36.463 --> 00:10:38.796
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It's
almost like he had it prepared.

00:10:38.796 --> 00:10:39.010
He's like--

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:39.600
MARK DUPLASS: It
doesn't make any sense.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.400
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah,
he was like, no, no.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.680
It's frittata.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.850
That's what we'll go with.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.725
And we're like, yeah.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.850
That works really well.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.840
KATIE ASELTON: It
makes perfect sense.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.010
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.699
It's the retarded
of eggs, right?

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:51.740
KATIE ASELTON: I also
really like toilet kitchen.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.150
Toilet kitchen is a good one.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.515
And I feel like I call
places toilet kitchens now.

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:59.640
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Does
that answer your question?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.340
MALE SPEAKER: Very much so.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.190
Thank you.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.400
KATIE ASELTON: Shit pig.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.290
Shit pig's another
favorite of mine.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.700
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Shit pig's fun.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.533
KATIE ASELTON: Yeah.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.250
OK.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.920
I'll keep going.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.503
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
We can go all day.

00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:10.997
Vaginal hubris was good too.

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:13.330
MALE SPEAKER: I was a big fan
of the height supremacists

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.579
the other couple of weeks ago.

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:15.730
It was a good one.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.840
KATIE ASELTON: Screw
those short people.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.590
MALE SPEAKER: So
speaking of short people,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.222
Alina Foley plays
Ellie on the show.

00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:23.680
And she's grown up
before our eyes,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.510
as happens on television shows.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.760
But she's grown up on a very
different television show.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.014
And it's a little unusual to
see so much edgier than usual.

00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:34.680
How much of Ellie's
character's actually

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.430
been influenced by her?

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.680
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Her alone?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.430
Well, she's Dave
Foley's daughter,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.090
Dave Foley from
Kids in the Hall.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.220
Which is not to says that
she grew up in filth.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.980
But she understands-- I'm not
trying to pass judgment on him

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.480
as a parent.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.070
But I'm saying like
she understands

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.860
jokes and humor and comedy.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.410
But we have made
her say some things.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.710
KATIE ASELTON: The
pilot episode, there

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.300
is some dispelling of Santa.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.880
There was some talking of-- what
was it in the draft episode?

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.820
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Spoilers for Santa.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.310
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.477
By the way, he isn't coming.

00:12:10.477 --> 00:12:12.226
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Just
in case some people

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.310
don't know in the room.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.935
KATIE ASELTON: Just
Google it you guys.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.190
There was a pilot episode
that was really the big one,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.490
were Jon Lajoie had
to sit down with her

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.190
and be like, I am so sorry that
I have to say these things.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.860
But like, we had fairy
zipper fairy episode

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.012
where she's supposed to
walk in on me giving him a--

00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:33.970
JASON MANTZOUKAS: What?

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.422
What?

00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:34.874
A what?

00:12:34.874 --> 00:12:35.326
MARK DUPLASS: What?

00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:35.980
What?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.770
KATIE ASELTON: --a thing.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.260
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Hey.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.760
Hey now.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.240
JASON MANTZOUKAS: A thing?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.760
MARK DUPLASS: What thing?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.100
JASON MANTZOUKAS: This
is on the internet, where

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.434
everybody looks at those things.

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:43.308
KATIE ASELTON: Sorry.

00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:43.980
It's a blow job.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.290
I was supposed to be
giving him a blowie.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.960
And she walks in the
room and she's like,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.370
what exactly are
they doing in there.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.280
And we were like--

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.090
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Not our department.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.020
That's makeup.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.410
KATIE ASELTON: Talk to your mom.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:56.610
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Talk to makeup.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.619
MARK DUPLASS: Some shows are
really nice and sensitive

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:00.660
to children being on set.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.826
And they say, you know what?

00:13:01.826 --> 00:13:03.470
We'll just let her
be in the green room

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.390
while we shoot this side of it.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.864
She seen everything for
better or for worse.

00:13:07.864 --> 00:13:09.280
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
They wanted me--

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.930
and this I didn't do because
even I was like, Rafi,

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.584
this is too much.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.000
They wanted in
this scene last-- I

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.240
think it was last season--
where me and baby Geoffrey

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:23.510
are having dump-buddy Bible
study, which is learning

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.100
about the Bible while
we're taking shits.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.750
And Rafi shits nude.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.930
Heads up, everybody.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.780
Bing it if you want
to see what's up.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.363
MARK DUPLASS: It was one of your
earliest character decisions,

00:13:36.363 --> 00:13:36.970
yeah.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.344
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Web crawler it.

00:13:38.344 --> 00:13:39.560
Don't worry about it.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.370
Anyway, they wanted me
to be on the toilet naked

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.948
and for baby Geoffrey
to be on my lap.

00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:46.630
And I was like--

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.300
KATIE ASELTON: Baby Geoffrey,
by the way, at this point,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.280
was like six.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.821
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I was like,
there is no way this is gonna--

00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:53.820
this can't, this can't happen.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.190
This shouldn't happen at all.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.020
And we got into like an argument
about whether that was OK

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.540
or not.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.280
And I was like, even for
Rafi, this is too much.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.650
So there are lines guys.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.733
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Do you
remember the creepy kid

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:07.350
that they hired to watch us?

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.434
There's an episode where--

00:14:08.434 --> 00:14:10.808
KATIE ASELTON: I don't know
if they got to work with him.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:11.966
I think it was just us.

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.340
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah, he's
in a closet in our bedroom

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:14.839
watching.

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:15.750
He's Ellie's friend.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.875
He's playing hide and seek.

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:17.950
He's really good at it.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.720
And obviously, we're
in our room doing

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.120
what grownups do in their room.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.190
And he's watching us.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.484
And the kid they hired--
like most people,

00:14:24.484 --> 00:14:25.650
you have to explain to them.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.274
Like, alright, you
going to say Jewhad.

00:14:27.274 --> 00:14:29.490
Like to Ellie, like you're
going to say Jewhad.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.070
OK, great.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.930
She says it.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.210
This kid had already
like stuff prepared.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.812
He looked at me and he was
like, I know what you're doing.

00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:36.770
I know what's going on.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.061
He's really looking at me Jeff.

00:14:38.061 --> 00:14:40.060
And he's on his own thing.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.480
This kid was very
gifted in the art

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.600
of just being in the
moment, of being real.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.808
KATIE ASELTON: He was like
a little Haley Joel Osment

00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:48.950
over there, just
like glaring at us.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.760
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Staring
at me while this is happening.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.800
And he was fine with it.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.420
I tried to talk to him.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.211
This is all a joke.

00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:57.670
He's like, I'm just
an actor for hire.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.140
I was like, you
are 11 years old.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.250
You should not feel
right with this at all.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.740
Very strange, that kid was.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.010
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Was he in
character the whole time?

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.120
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
The whole time.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.820
The whole time he sat there
reading a book by himself.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.060
JASON MANTZOUKAS: He's like the
Daniel Day-Lewis of kid actors?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.000
KATIE ASELTON: I think
he just actually got

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.607
the lead in M Night
Shyamalan's movie.

00:15:13.607 --> 00:15:14.690
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Oo nice.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.590
That poor kid.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.715
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Wierdo.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.266
Yea, we've made kids do
some bad shit on our show.

00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:23.390
That's what happens though.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.674
MALE SPEAKER: It's enjoyable.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.840
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Because,
you know what, fuck kids.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.450
Right?

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.634
Right Google, right?

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:32.952
Who's with me.

00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:34.660
MARK DUPLASS: Fuck
let's go to Bing then.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:34.930
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Are we supposed

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.210
to answer these
questions that are here.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.306
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:36.306 --> 00:15:37.889
We've got some
questions on the board.

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:40.345
Why don't we jump towards those.

00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:41.470
Ooh, we're opening up here.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.560
Ooh, the first one.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.395
What would be a suitable
Google gift to the Shiva?

00:15:45.395 --> 00:15:46.180
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
What's a Google gift?

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.280
KATIE ASELTON:
What's a Google gift?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.557
MALE SPEAKER: I guess a gift
that Google can give you.

00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:50.640
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Money?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.180
Stock options?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.510
What you giving out?

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.000
KATIE ASELTON: Just some of
those snacks would be nice.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.980
Coors lite?

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.410
MALE SPEAKER: We're two for
three, so that's not bad.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.993
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
And this is a-- just

00:16:04.993 --> 00:16:07.870
to clarify-- this is a gift
that's going to the Shiva?

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.750
I believe it's a tribute, yes.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.910
MARK DUPLASS: It's and
unclear question guys.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.540
We need some clarification.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.248
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Get it back together.

00:16:14.248 --> 00:16:16.720
Yeah, gift going to the Shiva.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.130
KATIE ASELTON: Clarify
[INAUDIBLE] and get back to us.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.546
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
be on lookout.

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.720
Did you know that neckties
is a real thing now?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.400
freshneck.com literally calls
itself Netflix for ties.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.925
Who comes up with
Taco Corp ventures

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:27.600
and why has that never
made it to the show?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.030
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Sounds like
they're plugging their product.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.071
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:33.810
Sounds like you did exactly
what they wanted you to do.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.476
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
This is a subtle plug.

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:36.850
And you fell for it.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.350
MALE SPEAKER: You're
welcome Wilson.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.471
MARK DUPLASS: I think if
we click on freshneck.com,

00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:42.970
I have a feeling
there's going to be

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.830
a video of something
else going on there.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.360
KATIE ASELTON: I was
just going to say--

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.165
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: This is
a real lemon party situation.

00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:49.617
KATIE ASELTON: --who clicks
on freshneck.com That is--

00:16:49.617 --> 00:16:51.450
MARK DUPLASS: I have a
username and password

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.075
if we need to use it
for freshneck.com.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.840
$9.99 for the whole year.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.340
Really?

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.360
That's really--

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.985
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
No, that's per day.

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:02.020
This shit is off the charts.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.230
Dark, dark places.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.180
KATIE ASELTON:
That neck is fresh.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.819
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
It's the dark web.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.777
You have a subscription
to the dark web, right?

00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:08.980
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It's
the sub-internet, yes.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.479
MALE SPEAKER: Speaking of Taco
Corp-- I know John's not here

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:14.062
but is he more like high
Taco or non-high Taco?

00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:15.270
KATIE ASELTON: Non-high Taco.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.311
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:18.250
He's a smart kid
from Montreal who's

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.280
been saddled with
us as cast members.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.849
So yeah, he's not an imbecile.

00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:28.240
No he's not.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.270
KATIE ASELTON: And doesn't
dress like a frittata

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.450
from the '70s at all.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.450
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I like
that a lot of questions

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.130
about this show have to mean
that everybody has to be like,

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.920
John is not an imbecile.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.320
Jason is not a monster.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320
No, they're just normal.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.810
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
But NIck is a dick.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.080
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that said,
one of the other questions

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.340
here is, which member The League
is most like their character.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.173
And which one is least
like their character.

00:17:51.173 --> 00:17:53.220
So, clearly you're
not a monster.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:53.930
But is anyone--

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.846
KATIE ASELTON: I would
say Steve this probably

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.530
most like his character
in that he's not

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.105
particularly great
at fantasy football.

00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:01.063
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Whoa.

00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:02.063
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Wow.

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.422
What is this, a roast?

00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:04.505
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Hey now.

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:05.921
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
You Jeff Ross?

00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:06.790
All right.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.220
I feel somewhat close
to my character.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:10.760
I'm married.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.360
I have two kids in real life.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.630
And I play fantasy football.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.747
But I'm not a lawyer.

00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:17.580
MARK DUPLASS: Steve.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:17.788
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Oh God.

00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:18.280
I'm so depressed about football.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.500
MARK DUPLASS: You're scared
of that fucking bird.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.140
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I'm
so depressed about about--

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.090
MARK DUPLASS: Did
anybody see the episode

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.924
with the bird in it?

00:18:21.924 --> 00:18:23.798
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Oh,
I am afraid of birds.

00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:26.190
MARK DUPLASS: Steve was
terrified of the goddamn bird.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.820
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Nobody tells me

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.280
they're going to have a
fucking bird until we show up.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.810
This thing's got no soul.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.490
The eyes were dead.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.860
It's just that they come at you.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.690
And they put their
feathers up real big.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.106
And you don't know
what's going on

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.120
in their fucking bird brains.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.720
I don't when it's
going to attack.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:41.966
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
What's interesting

00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:43.659
is we recently shot
a scene with a bear.

00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:45.200
And you were not
afraid of that bear.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.783
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Not afraid at all.

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:49.260
A grizzly bear, eight
feet, 750 pounds,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.500
I told it to go fuck itself.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.330
But birds--

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.400
MARK DUPLASS: And
it did, right away.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.955
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It finger
blast itself behind a trailer.

00:18:57.955 --> 00:18:58.790
I was like, what?

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.095
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Lady bear.

00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:00.595
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Yeah, lady bear.

00:19:03.784 --> 00:19:04.450
Thank you Jason.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.050
JASON MANTZOUKAS: If you want to
see what that looks like guys,

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.730
just Google it.

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.030
MALE SPEAKER: Freshneck.com.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.840
So, solo projects
aside, if each of you

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.256
could star in another TV show
right now, which would it be

00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:21.190
and why?

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.130
What are you loving out there?

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.280
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Is
Real Housewives of Jersey--

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.090
can I sign up for that.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.890
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I believe
there are some openings.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.848
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yea,
the Giudices are gone.

00:19:29.848 --> 00:19:32.130
I'm in.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.120
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Oh.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.970
Oh, too soon.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.759
Oh, no.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.550
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Oh
my God, tax evasion.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.923
JASON MANTZOUKAS: How dare you.

00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:40.423
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
How can you talk

00:19:40.423 --> 00:19:42.190
about tax evasion like that?

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.930
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
They are beloved.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.850
This is New York.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.270
911.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.315
MARK DUPLASS: But
murder boner is fine.

00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:50.770
Don't worry about murder boner.

00:19:54.232 --> 00:19:56.690
MALE SPEAKER: Why don't we open
it up to the live audience.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.655
There are two microphones
in each aisle.

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:00.780
KATIE ASELTON: We're not
scared of you guys either.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.020
Just to say that.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.310
MALE SPEAKER: If you guys want
to make a little organized

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.774
line, ask a couple
questions to the cast.

00:20:03.774 --> 00:20:04.940
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Perfect.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.481
Look at that.

00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:06.439
That's great.

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:07.230
Oh, here she comes.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.000
MARK DUPLASS: Here she comes.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.290
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
There she comes--

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:09.870
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Better be good.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.245
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
--Ms. Google.

00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:15.780
AUDIENCE: So, the
show is hilarious.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.610
However, whenever I talk about
this with my girlfriends,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.620
I always feel like Jenny
is not a real person

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.530
in any sort of way, even
like a caricature of a woman.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.250
So, I'm curious to hear whether
you have female writers.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.100
And just, Katie, what your
perspective on the character

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.710
is.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.400
And is she meant to be
like this fantasy person.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.980
KATIE ASELTON: We
do have-- the show

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.810
is created by a couple,
Jackie in Jeff Schaffer.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.710
Jackie is a woman.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.480
And she writes a lot for Jenny.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.770
And Jenny is very
much like Jackie.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.362
But I don't think Jenny is real.

00:20:52.362 --> 00:20:53.820
I mean I think
there's a reason why

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.420
Jenny doesn't have
any girlfriends.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.160
She's not a particularly
nice, warm, comforting woman,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.330
you know.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.830
I think Jenny has got a lot
of wish fulfillment for guys.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.830
I think she's sort of
like the dream wife who

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.180
loves to talk about football,
and have sex, and screw

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.870
the kids, and like, whatever.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.480
And she's fun with
the guys and--

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.439
MARK DUPLASS: Wait Jenny
has sex with her kids?

00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:17.479
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Whoa.

00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:18.920
We did not talk about this.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.900
MARK DUPLASS: Did
I miss something?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.233
JASON MANTZOUKAS: It's in there.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.360
But I think she is a
little-- but I mean, look,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.070
I have met so many women after
doing the show where like,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.780
I'm Jenny.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.290
I am so Jenny.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.470
I think it's a little
Sex in the City.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.780
We all thought we were Carrie.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.000
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: We did.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.500
Ugh.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.200
I thought I was.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.250
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I
thought I was Miranda.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.958
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
The amount of dresses

00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.130
I bought the late '90s.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.220
KATIE ASELTON: But yeah.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.000
I personally don't
really relate to Jenny.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.650
I think Jenny is like me if
I were to turn everything up

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.860
to a 15.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.250
You know she's
super competitive.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.160
I'm competitive but I'm
not that competitive.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.790
And she's super sassy.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.490
And I'm sassy but
I'm not that sassy.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.820
And she loves to have sex.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.940
And I like to have
sex but not that much.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.440
No.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.843
But I think you're not--

00:22:10.843 --> 00:22:11.593
MARK DUPLASS: Erm.

00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:16.370
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I would
have left that last part out.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.500
Hey Katie, I would have
left that last part out.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.000
KATIE ASELTON: I think you
and your friends are not alone

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.960
in the world.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.050
You're OK if you don't totally
think that-- you're fine.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.890
You're fine.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.750
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
You're normal.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.570
KATIE ASELTON: Sleep well.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.028
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: You are
right in the sense the Jenny is

00:22:31.028 --> 00:22:34.814
the only character that
doesn't seem real on the show.

00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:36.855
KATIE ASELTON: I think
we're all sort of extreme.

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.460
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Everybody
else on this show is--

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:38.950
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Super grounded.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.870
JASON MANTZOUKAS: --very
grounded, very naturalistic.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.050
We recognize them all.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.980
Jenny though, crazy.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.940
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.523
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:22:49.523 --> 00:22:50.350
Love the show guys.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.785
You do an episode
with Jay Cutler.

00:22:51.785 --> 00:22:53.910
And he's got a reputation
for being a huge asshole.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.480
And I want to know what
you guys think of him.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.690
KATIE ASELTON: I actually
thought he was really nice.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.090
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
KATIE ASELTON: Yes.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.920
He was really nice.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.670
He was reluctantly there.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.700
KATIE ASELTON: He
very clearly said, I'm

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.590
only here because Kristin
asked me to be here.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.840
And we're like, that's cool.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.381
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Kristin Cavallari

00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:12.630
did an episode the year before.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.480
And then we thought it'd be
really fun to bring her back

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.192
and maybe have Jay come back.

00:23:17.192 --> 00:23:19.650
And we could do a thing where
we all go to school together.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.822
And she asked him.

00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:21.530
And he came back.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.152
And he was great, all day.

00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:24.610
KATIE ASELTON: He
was like, I don't

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.693
know why you guys do this.

00:23:25.693 --> 00:23:26.640
It's so boring.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.230
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It's boring.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.880
KATIE ASELTON: And
we're like, yeah.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.870
Sometimes it's boring.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.310
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
This is how it is.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.380
KATIE ASELTON: There
a lot of waiting.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.200
And he's like, this is-- I
mean, he wasn't a jerk about it

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.150
though.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.249
He was nice.

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.290
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.210
It's not his thing.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.470
He doesn't like to talk
in front of people.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.450
If he wasn't a huge
quarterback, he

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.876
would be a quiet person
who kept to himself.

00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:46.500
MARK DUPLASS: If you
guys keep talking,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.800
you're basically just going to
say that Cutler's an asshole.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.216
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
No, he's not--

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:52.980
MARK DUPLASS: You might
want to just-- everybody

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.022
sees where this is going.

00:23:54.022 --> 00:23:55.521
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Super good dude.

00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:56.530
Loved being there.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.970
Real piece of shit.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.830
Loved it.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.110
MARK DUPLASS: An
individual for sure.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.310
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Human
being on the Earth.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.140
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Beat of
his own drummer, I guess.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.070
Hates music.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.180
Fuck.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.805
No, he's great.

00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:12.470
He really is.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.350
He's a great person.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.817
And I love him.

00:24:14.817 --> 00:24:15.650
He's got great hair.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.400
And I asked who his
hairstylist was.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.790
MARK DUPLASS: Just stop it.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:17.870
Stop.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.400
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
And he gave it to me.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.450
And it doesn't come out as good.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.220
Next question.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.299
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:22.340
AUDIENCE: Hey everyone's.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.440
So Paul Scheer, who
plays Andre sort of--

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.810
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Who?

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.726
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Boo.

00:24:25.726 --> 00:24:26.320
Boo.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:26.500
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Sorry?

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.940
AUDIENCE: Answer the question

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.917
MARK DUPLASS: He's at
fucking Bing right now.

00:24:29.917 --> 00:24:30.750
KATIE ASELTON: Yeah.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.880
He's doing Yahoo
talks as we speak.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.497
AUDIENCE: Never mind.

00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:41.080
Beginning of the season, he was
having a bit of a comeuppance.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.400
Turned out to be kind of BS.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.490
Does he, or do you
as characters ever

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.954
mind being crapped on
variously when you're filming.

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.870
Afterwards, do you ever
take it home with you.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.703
MARK DUPLASS: We prefer
the term, shat upon.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.274
And it's the most
fun on the show,

00:24:57.274 --> 00:24:58.440
when you're getting shit on.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.398
That is really where the
attention and the love

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:03.520
comes from in this weird, moral
universe that we have created.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.390
And Paul gets it the most.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:10.200
And he's so very good at
inviting it onto himself.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.010
I mean, I remember we opened
last season at the bar.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.391
And we're always
terrible when we first

00:25:15.391 --> 00:25:16.390
start shooting the show.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.220
Everybody's rusty.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.730
The first takes are horrible.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.480
And something came up about
eating corn and corn cobs.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.390
And you just see
Paul's eyes light up.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.190
And I know in his mind
he's just like, I'm

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.773
going to get myself
into a place where

00:25:28.773 --> 00:25:30.710
I talk about how much I
love eating corn cobs.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.100
And everybody's just going
to pile on the dick jokes.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.790
And it's going to be
magic for everyone.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.280
It's going to be
dick joke Disneyland.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.270
And he just does it.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.228
KATIE ASELTON: A lot of
it does come from Paul,

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:44.080
like the spunk when he
was doing the marathon.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.930
Spunk was all in.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.700
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Sports
Performance Utility Nutrition

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.370
Kick.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.210
He came up with that so quickly.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.735
KATIE ASELTON: In the moment.

00:25:51.735 --> 00:25:52.360
That was great.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:52.985
And that's him.

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:55.140
But it's him being
like, here you go guys.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:55.974
It's a nice platter.

00:25:55.974 --> 00:25:58.514
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: And by the
way, as a person who's getting

00:25:58.514 --> 00:26:01.180
ripped on a lot this year on
the show, it's not as much fun

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.720
as it looks.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.240
And Paul has done a unbelievable
job of accepting that ridicule

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.770
and just gives it
back with earnest.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:09.560
He really does.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.570
He thinks that it's
just you proving

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.910
that he's one of the guys.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:13.700
It's beautiful.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.940
It really is.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.815
MARK DUPLASS: The most
used quote on the show

00:26:16.815 --> 00:26:19.090
is Paul Scheer saying, Ha ha ha.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.356
Laugh all you want.

00:26:21.356 --> 00:26:25.234
That's like the most useful
piece of dialogue on the show.

00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:26.900
MALE SPEAKER: So would
you say that Paul

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.260
is the one who sets
the table the most

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.820
when it comes to
those kind of things.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:29.994
MARK DUPLASS: Yeah.

00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:30.494
I think so.

00:26:30.494 --> 00:26:32.715
I think that Jesus Christ
laid himself on the cross.

00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.090
And it's nothing
compared to what

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.879
Paul Scheer has
done for The League.

00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:37.170
JASON MANTZOUKAS: That's right.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.510
The League is bigger than Jesus.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.650
MARK DUPLASS: That's right.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.050
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Boom.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.570
MARK DUPLASS: You heard it here.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.490
Bing.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.350
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.808
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of Andre, I'd

00:26:47.808 --> 00:26:49.310
like to pull an
Andre and-- advice.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.790
Should I give up Ben
Tate for Percy Harvin?

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.100
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Ben
Tate for Percy Harvin.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.350
AUDIENCE: Do you guys all
play fantasy football, Rafi?

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.890
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I don't but
everybody else can weigh in.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.719
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
That's tough.

00:27:01.719 --> 00:27:02.760
KATIE ASELTON: Go for it.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.465
KATIE ASELTON: No.

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:06.090
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
You know what, if you

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:11.500
want an uninformed decision--
what are their names?

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.280
AUDIENCE: Ben Tate
and Percy Harvin.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.036
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Pussy?

00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:15.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.941
JASON MANTZOUKAS: The
second man's name is pussy?

00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:18.908
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:20.782
JASON MANTZOUKAS: You
gotta choose pussy bro.

00:27:20.782 --> 00:27:21.906
AUDIENCE: Every time, yeah.

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:24.260
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Always choose pussy bro.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.510
MARK DUPLASS: And the best
part about fantasy football

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.970
is that, that's just as good of
advice as coming from Matthew

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.500
Barry who knows everything
because nobody knows anything.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.700
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Ben
Taint or Pussy Harvin?

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.360
Which one--

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.242
JASON MANTZOUKAS: Oo.

00:27:36.242 --> 00:27:37.950
Now we're getting into
a real tough spot.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.760
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Taint or Pussy?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.844
Ben Taint or Pussy Harvin.

00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:42.259
JASON MANTZOUKAS: You're putting
me into a real tough spot

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.960
choosing between
taint and pussy.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.144
MALE SPEAKER: Jason,
honestly, is he a plant?

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:48.810
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I
wish he was a plant.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.000
That would be amazing.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.030
What if everybody just
started setting up

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.590
jokes for me, all the questions.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.590
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.824
Let's jump onto
the screen again.

00:27:58.824 --> 00:28:00.490
Can we scroll down a
little bit, Jordan?

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.200
Ba, ba ba, ba ba.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.510
On behalf of women
everywhere-- Whoa.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.980
Sorry.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.860
Thank you bringing back
Adrien Bro-- and Adam

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.474
KATIE ASELTON: Adrian Brody
has not yet been on the show.

00:28:16.474 --> 00:28:18.640
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you for
bringing Adam Brody back

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.810
to prime time television.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:20.165
KATIE ASELTON: You're welcome.

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:22.290
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: And
then we fucking killed him.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.630
MALE SPEAKER: Take him away.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.245
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
So you're welcome.

00:28:26.245 --> 00:28:27.120
You're welcome women.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.620
KATIE ASELTON: Such a
beautiful corpse though.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.275
He was so handsome
in that casket.

00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:34.540
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Please
have Gronk at the next draft.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.030
OK, who the fuck would want
to shoot with Rob Gronkowski?

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.309
You telling me you
want Rob Gronkowski

00:28:39.309 --> 00:28:40.600
over here hanging out with you?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.040
The guys a neanderthal.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.720
OK.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.380
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Steve Rannazzisi.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.910
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: There it is.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.720
JASON MANTZOUKAS: We're
not going to have Gronk.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.550
MALE SPEAKER: So
that bridge is burnt.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.508
MARK DUPLASS: On this
episode of Making Friends

00:28:49.508 --> 00:28:50.860
with Steve Rannazzisi--

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.175
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah, no.

00:28:52.175 --> 00:28:55.059
MARK DUPLASS: --Rob
Gronkowski and Jay Cutler.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:56.350
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I love Jay.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.820
MALE SPEAKER: When will Andre
start his own fashion blog.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.860
Unlikely to happen.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.585
No.

00:29:04.585 --> 00:29:05.240
KATIE ASELTON: Season 10.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.880
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Oh somebody
in the front row just said, oh,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.490
poor Andre.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:10.800
Yeah.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.890
You feel bad for him, right?

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.258
JASON MANTZOUKAS: But
would you sleep with him?

00:29:15.258 --> 00:29:16.150
No?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.380
She said, no.

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:23.440
MALE SPEAKER: So I
actually want to go back

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.940
to the Rafi, Dirty Randy thing.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.890
The live alone
episode last year,

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:35.187
that was one of the most
mad things I've ever seen.

00:29:35.187 --> 00:29:36.520
JASON MANTZOUKAS: If you say so.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.380
MALE SPEAKER: When do
we get another one?

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.930
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
It just happened.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.200
It came out a
couple of weeks ago.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.687
Part two was-- three weeks ago?

00:29:43.687 --> 00:29:45.020
KATIE ASELTON: It was a prequel.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.561
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
It was the prequel.

00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:49.119
It was the origin story
of Rafi and Dirty Randy.

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:50.910
And it takes place in
a mental institution.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.840
KATIE ASELTON: It's a real
heart breaker you guys.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.640
I'm not kidding.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.223
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
It was so much fun

00:29:55.223 --> 00:29:59.530
to watch because we
don't get that script.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.849
I had no idea beyond what Jason
told me about that episode.

00:30:02.849 --> 00:30:04.890
Besides that, we were in
that for that one little

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.890
quick scene.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.410
And then watching it, it's like
watching a show that you're on,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.660
that you got paid to be on,
that you have no idea what

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.890
the fuck is going to go
on or how these two met.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.570
So that episode is
always my favorite one

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.970
to watch because
I literally have

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.090
no idea what's going to happen.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.381
KATIE ASELTON: And also, you
see Jason without a beard.

00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:26.090
And what the world doesn't
know, but you can Google,

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.490
is how dashing handsome he is.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.240
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Oh, handsomefaces.com?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.350
KATIE ASELTON: That
jawline under that

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.080
beard-- he's a
Grecian god you guys.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.580
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Oh yeah, no beard.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.260
No beard for the first
time in, I think,

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.967
seven years for all of 25
seconds of screen time.

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.800
No, those episodes are
incredibly fun to do.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.250
And they are incredibly
polarizing to the audience.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.900
As I'm sure for those
of you here we've

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.800
seen them, who are
fans of the league,

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.480
it is very much-- people
are either like, oh my god

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.740
this is the funniest
episode, or, fuck you.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.666
You ruined my show.

00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:01.290
MARK DUPLASS: And it
is 50-50 for sure.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.370
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
It is very much so.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:02.870
Yeah.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.500
People are furious.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.310
And I get excited when I
know it's about to air.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.302
And I'll kind of
go on Twitter just

00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:11.260
to see what people are
saying about The League.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.980
And the cold open comes on.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.870
And it's just me and Seth.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.834
And immediately people
are like, fuck no.

00:31:18.834 --> 00:31:20.375
And then the next
one would be like--

00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:22.930
MARK DUPLASS AND JASON
MANTZOUKAS: fuck yeah!

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.690
JASON MANTZOUKAS: And then
it's just hatred and love,

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:26.430
every other one.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.395
It's pretty fantastic.

00:31:29.395 --> 00:31:35.290
In what others show do they give
two, completely side characters

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:39.470
an entire episode of
their own to do whatever

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.322
the fuck we want,
which is madness.

00:31:41.322 --> 00:31:42.405
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: It is.

00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:44.150
JASON MANTZOUKAS: The
idea that, here's a show.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.270
It's about fantasy football.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.400
And it's about this
group of friends.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.316
And everybody's great.

00:31:47.316 --> 00:31:48.344
And some are married.

00:31:48.344 --> 00:31:49.010
Some are single.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.300
Blah, blah, blah.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.530
Except for this one episode--

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.190
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Not this week.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.856
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
--that's about murder,

00:31:52.856 --> 00:31:59.840
vigilante justice, more murder,
pornography, drugs, bath salts.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.445
Like crazy, absolute insanity.

00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:03.820
MARK DUPLASS: And
that's why it's

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.340
a very special
episode of The League.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.631
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Absolutely.

00:32:08.164 --> 00:32:09.080
MALE SPEAKER: Yes sir.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.890
AUDIENCE: So hello.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.223
Thank you guys for coming today.

00:32:11.223 --> 00:32:12.060
This is great.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.140
I had a question about
Jon Lajoie, aka Taco.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.340
Before he joined the show--

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.530
MARK DUPLASS: By the
way, congratulations

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.400
on getting his name right.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:19.985
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Yea good job.

00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:21.940
MARK DUPLASS: Most
people say Jon La-joe--

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.380
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: La-joy.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.540
MARK DUPLASS: La-jo-ee.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.330
So well done.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:24.430
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.000
Thank you.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.940
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Are you Canadian?

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.960
AUDIENCE: I'm not.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.001
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Good.

00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:29.592
AUDIENCE: Is that a problem?

00:32:29.592 --> 00:32:31.860
KATIE ASELTON: It's a plus.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.310
AUDIENCE: So he was a
YouTube star on his own

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.300
before you actually
joined the show

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.779
and had a bunch of hits
like every day guy--

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:41.070
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Normal guy.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.361
AUDIENCE: -everyday normal guy.

00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:43.290
Sorry.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.440
So when he joined
the show, I know

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.870
he brought some of that
element to the cast in how

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.080
he performed.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.250
How much of the stuff
that he does on his own

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.080
does he bring to the
table and puts it

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.150
into the show versus
what's written for him.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.000
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I think
he's finishing up a soundtrack.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.791
I think we're putting
out a leak soundtrack

00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:02.760
that Jon has been
putting together

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.610
for a while with
Jackie and Jeff.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:06.360
So yeah.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.139
As far as music's concerned,
Jon takes the lion's share

00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:12.680
of that work.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.670
I think he kind of-- they
will come to him and be like,

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:15.970
hey we have an idea for this.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.290
Would you want to write a song.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.165
And earlier on, I think
that's how it worked.

00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:22.134
I think we've kind of gone away
from him just performing songs

00:33:22.134 --> 00:33:23.300
in the last couple of years.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.840
But we have enough to,
I guess, make an album.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.140
So Jon's kind of curating that
and putting that together now.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.940
JASON MANTZOUKAS: A lot of
that driven off of his presence

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.857
on YouTube, which
is owned by who?

00:33:35.857 --> 00:33:36.482
AUDIENCE: Bing.

00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:36.590
Bing.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.673
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yahoo.

00:33:39.527 --> 00:33:40.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.300
KATIE ASELTON: Thank you.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.716
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Is that a plug

00:33:42.716 --> 00:33:44.800
for your own self, your
own company right there?

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.735
A roundabout way to be like,
yeah, YouTube too motherfucker.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.760
MALE SPEAKER: Yes sir.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.452
AUDIENCE: So often you guys try
to tie in actual things that

00:33:55.452 --> 00:33:57.410
happened in the NFL since
your show has nothing

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.350
to do with anything about it.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.730
How does some of the real life
things, like Adrian Peterson

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.450
getting kicked out, affect
the show in a season

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.700
as it's currently going along.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.210
And how do you adjust for it?

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.179
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
We, this year-- yeah.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.260
A lot of shit
happened this year.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.420
KATIE ASELTON: So much
material to work with.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.003
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Sometimes we touch

00:34:16.003 --> 00:34:18.150
on things in our own
little way, very subtly.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.469
And then sometimes we'll
hit it over the head.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:24.139
We talk about, this year,
domestic sexual abuse

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:28.810
between Jenny and I. And then
we have figured out a way

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:37.270
to hit upon the recent events
of what's happened in the NFL.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.400
And we can't give it
away, but you'll see.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.263
It's pretty funny.

00:34:43.263 --> 00:34:44.820
KATIE ASELTON: It
is pretty funny.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.570
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
It's pretty funny.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:45.820
And--

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.449
JASON MANTZOUKAS: The way that
what's happening in the NFL

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:47.969
is funny.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.370
Yeah exactly.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.889
Yes.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.489
MARK DUPLASS: I guess
you'd call hilarious.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.004
Right guys?

00:34:56.004 --> 00:34:57.945
Google?

00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:58.950
Good comedy.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.561
Good comedy.

00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:03.060
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: I mean, for
the most part, our creators,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.200
Jeff and Jackie, will come up
with different ways they want

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.991
to touch on stuff at
the beginning of year.

00:35:06.991 --> 00:35:09.260
But we're still shooting
the show right now.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.610
We haven't even shot the
last two or three episodes.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.490
So stuff that happens
today, we can kind of

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.970
find a way, if we can,
to fit in later on.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.210
So we are somewhat current
to what's happening now.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.420
So we'll wedge in our own
little opinions here and there.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.080
But for the most
part, we'll just

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.680
stick to the fucking
comedy, make it funny.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.280
MARK DUPLASS: Well
Jeff, our creator,

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.610
he's really good with not just
fantasy football knowledge

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.234
but just knows
the NFL very well.

00:35:37.234 --> 00:35:38.900
So he'll make these
guesses occasionally

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.940
where he was like, I feel
like Darren Sproles is going

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.510
to have a hell of a
fucking game in this week.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.550
And so when he wrote the episode
about the height supremacists,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.020
it was kind of predicated
on Darren Sproles having

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.800
a pretty good week, which you
took an educated guess about.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.532
Turned of the guy ran from
180 yards and it worked out.

00:35:55.532 --> 00:35:57.240
And then, occasionally,
what we'll do is,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.770
we'll shoot things in a way that
you have some backs of heads,

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.650
like shooting my conversation
with Steve, shooting this way.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.617
And we'll do like three
options of wide receivers

00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:09.700
that we think are going
to shit the bed this week.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.600
So we'll be like, do a
version with Mike Tolbert,

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.266
do a version with
this person, whatever.

00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:15.852
And then you try to pick one
of those three that works.

00:36:15.852 --> 00:36:17.310
And then if nothing
works, we go in

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.887
and do ADR, which is where
we actually just dub over

00:36:19.887 --> 00:36:21.970
a player's name and try
and create some relevance.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.947
So that's sort of the
specific NFL tie-in of it.

00:36:25.947 --> 00:36:27.155
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: We guess.

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:31.120
MALE SPEAKER: Very interesting.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.869
Yes.

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:32.785
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:36.990
MARK DUPLASS: It changes.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.030
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Depends on who you are.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.946
MARK DUPLASS: The
question's about the improv.

00:36:39.946 --> 00:36:42.740
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: 100 percent
at that end of the table.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.370
100 percent.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.286
KATIE ASELTON: Jay Cutler
is totally scripted.

00:36:48.955 --> 00:36:50.520
MARK DUPLASS: Jay
Cutler is so nice

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.140
that we scripted
everything for him.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.430
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
What a great guy.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.080
He really is.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.780
I'm not kidding.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.280
No.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.930
But I remember the
Kluneberg episode

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.530
where we had the painting.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.030
I remember-- this has nothing
to do with staying on script--

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.580
but they were like, Jason,
we only have one of these.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.290
OK, so let's not ruin this one.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:10.860
Great, great.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.270
No problem.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.770
Got it.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.230
Let's not ruin the-- Action.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.100
Comes in, takes the Kluneberg
and smashes it over his knee

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.592
into 100 pieces,
continually smashing

00:37:20.592 --> 00:37:21.930
freaking breaking it up.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:27.370
And at the end, it was just
like, I hope we got it.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.621
We got it?

00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.380
I hope we got it.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.207
And we got it.

00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:30.850
We got it.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:31.889
Every time we get it.

00:37:31.889 --> 00:37:33.180
But we don't know if we got it.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.530
That's the thing.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.200
We're not sure.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.010
KATIE ASELTON: We get
outlines for the episodes.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.010
And those consist of a
paragraph, two paragraphs,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:46.070
sometimes more, of what's
happening in the scene.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.920
And sometimes there's a
line written in there.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.825
A lot of the times, the dialogue
is just sort of left up to us.

00:37:51.825 --> 00:37:53.700
MARK DUPLASS: Or they'll
have good joke ideas

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.170
that they can pinpoint
for us in there.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.300
And they'll lay
them in the outline.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.130
KATIE ASELTON: But
most of the time,

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.960
it's all found in the moment.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.336
And then once you
hit on it, then

00:38:00.336 --> 00:38:01.585
you do that a couple of times.

00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:02.650
You work out the kinks.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.440
MARK DUPLASS: As
we've gone on, we've

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.300
realized that when you
have a six person scene,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.900
it's probably
better to script it

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.632
a little bit more because
it's informational usually.

00:38:12.632 --> 00:38:15.090
And you're trying to get the
machinations of the story out.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.730
And it just takes forever
if you try and move around.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.990
But when it's a really
great two person scene,

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.630
and you just throw
three cameras on it.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.000
You've got a close up on
one person, a close up

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.240
on the other person, and
then a two shot of them.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.280
Then it's just like--

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.160
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
Have fun for an hour.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.700
MARK DUPLASS: --let it rip.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.830
And you're going to
get whatever you want.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:30.990
KATIE ASELTON: And those,
truthfully, for all of us

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.090
are our favorite scenes.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:32.680
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
And that's the stuff

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.170
that I feel like, the
discovery that you

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.790
find through improvising
with people, who are also

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.560
great improvisers, are
the moments and the beats

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.990
and the jokes that
are oftentimes

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.140
the stuff that I feel
like people love.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.100
Because what you're watching
is the joy and delight

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.260
of us discovering.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.340
And I actually feel that
is a weird electric moment.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:54.840
What's that?

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.440
KATIE ASELTON: Michael
Jackson's dead.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.740
That moment between you
and Nick was one of-- it

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.980
still plays as one of
the funniest moments

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.852
I've ever seen.

00:39:02.852 --> 00:39:05.310
JASON MANTZOUKAS: And they cut
together-- the Schaffers cut

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.960
together a thing that is me and
Nick trying to get through it.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.080
Which is very funny
because the scene was--

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.930
this is a couple seasons ago--
and the scene is just Nick

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.520
and I in his study.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.650
And he's asking me to protect
his balls because it's scrote

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.689
season.

00:39:20.689 --> 00:39:22.730
And everybody's punching
each other in the balls.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:26.780
And he wants me-- that's
all that was written, right.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.670
Ruxin wants Rafi to
protect his balls.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.580
OK.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.670
So we do a couple of
takes of just that.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.440
Oh, don't worry.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.595
MARK DUPLASS: Don't every write
just that with Jason Mantzoukas

00:39:33.595 --> 00:39:36.055
in your scene because
you're just asking for it.

00:39:36.055 --> 00:39:37.680
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
And then through that

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.670
takes it became-- it starts
with me improvising like,

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.779
oh I'm Kevin Costner.

00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:46.070
Your balls are Whitney Houston.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.960
I'll be your ballsy guard.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.760
Ha ha ha.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.730
That cracks us up.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:50.490
OK.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.810
So we'll do that.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.430
So we get that far again--
because the surprise of it

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.840
always makes us laugh.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.390
And so OK, ha ha.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.090
We'll go again and that's
what I'm going to do, so good.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.254
So I'm Kevin Costner, your
balls are Whitney Houston.

00:40:05.254 --> 00:40:06.670
I'm going to be
your ballsy guard.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.844
And then he goes-- oh, no.

00:40:07.844 --> 00:40:10.260
I'll be your ballsy guard,
Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.800
And then Nick goes, RIP.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.921
And I go, what?

00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:17.030
No!

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.570
This now makes us
laugh hysterically.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.100
The discovery that Rafi doesn't
know that Whitney's dead is--

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.820
we can't get through it.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.320
We can't get through it.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.500
Nick has to get up and
leave the room for awhile.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.570
MARK DUPLASS: Makeup
touch ups for the tears.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:31.690
Yeah.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.500
JASON MANTZOUKAS: And we're
sweating now under the lights.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.410
And we're laughing.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.730
And we think it's so funny.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.700
The crew is furious.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.720
Why the fuck do you
think you're so funny.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.250
Oh, it's awful.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.581
So then we finally get to a
place where we can get through,

00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:46.080
oh no.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.670
Whitney Houston is dead.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.990
And then, oh no!

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.903
Whitney's dead.

00:40:49.903 --> 00:40:50.610
Oh God.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.610
How is Michael
Jackson taking it?

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.790
This is categorically
impossible to get through.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.000
We end up shooting
that line with Nick

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.240
out of the room
because for a while,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.110
he has to leave his seat.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.180
And he's just off camera,
out in the back over here

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.355
going, [CHUCKLE].

00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:13.230
MARK DUPLASS: Like Blair
Witch in the corner.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.900
And I'm like, I can
still see you shaking.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.030
You have to get out of here.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.190
So to finish this-- so that's
the way The League works best,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.970
building on-- There's an
idea that is already funny.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.430
And then through improv, you
find a better, and a newer,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.570
and a heightening-- a way to
heighten through the scene

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.430
and build something that started
as a very small throwaway bit

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.800
and becomes a very funny piece.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.550
And that's what I think
is great about The League.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.594
Eat shit.

00:41:44.594 --> 00:41:46.260
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.830
Unfortunately, we're
about to run out of time.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:48.610
So if you guys don't
mind hanging out

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.570
for just two minutes.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.760
If we can take some pictures
with you, would that be cool?

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.060
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Sure.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.730
JASON MANTZOUKAS: I feel bad
for this girl right here though.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.760
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI: Yeah. she
stood there the whole time

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.840
while Jason rambled on.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.330
MARK DUPLASS: She's ready.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.040
She's ready.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.660
So I'm a big fan.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.580
Thanks for coming.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.230
And this is a very
specific question.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.780
But I've noticed that a lot
of the actors from The League

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.070
have also guest starred
on Parks and Recreation.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.167
And I was wondering if there's a
relationship between the shows.

00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:11.750
And if we might get some guest
stars from Parks and Recreation

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.830
to show up on The League like
Aubrey Plaza or anyone else

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.039
from the show.

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:17.580
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
Well, I don't think

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.850
they're scheduled to
appear on our show at all.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.610
But a bunch of us have
appeared on that show mostly

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.620
because we all kind of
came out of the same comedy

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.180
background, the
same comedy scene,

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.638
a lot of which is built around
the Upright Citizens Brigade

00:42:29.638 --> 00:42:31.320
Theatre in New York or LA.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.310
So a lot of us all
are friends or have

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.560
relationships with each other.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.860
And I think everybody
just likes to use

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.410
each other in those ways.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.230
MARK DUPLASS: There's
fun scenes with Aziz

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.030
coming on the show for
fall a few seasons back.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.190
If you haven't seen those,
those are worth checking out.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.815
JASON MANTZOUKAS:
And I'm always trying

00:42:49.815 --> 00:42:51.420
to get off from [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.320
Someday.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.270
MARK DUPLASS: But
Offerman, he's a good guy.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.190
I like that guy.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.100
He's--

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.850
KATIE ASELTON: No.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:58.510
He's a great guy.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.135
STEPHEN RANNAZZISI:
He's no Jay Cutler.

00:43:00.135 --> 00:43:01.549
I'll tell you that right now.

00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:02.340
He's no Jay Cutler.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.882
MARK DUPLASS: I don't know.

00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:05.340
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.080
the cast of The League.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.913
Thank you very much.

00:43:06.913 --> 00:43:08.720
MARK DUPLASS: Thank you.
