00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
And the answer here of course is that at least one vertex is added to the potential vertex cover

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.150
each time we go down here in this tree or we branched because there's only three possibilities

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.970
and in this possibility here, we add one vertex, and this possibility here, we also add one vertex,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.470
and here we will add too.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.230
And of course, there then comes data reduction and all that jazz,

00:00:21.230 --> 99:59:59.000
but we're always adding at least one.
