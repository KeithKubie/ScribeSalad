1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Defense mechanisms have two sets of
key characteristics that have important

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,320
consequences.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,790
The first is the distinction
between constitutive and inducible,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,050
and the second is the distinction
between innate and acquired.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,770
Whether a defense mechanism
is constitutive or inducible
depends on its costs,

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,380
its deployment requirements,

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,070
and whether the hostile environmental
factors are present always occasionally or

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,130
only periodically.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,830
Okay.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,060
Most defenses are inducible on demand
because they cost a lot and they are

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,990
unnecessary or even detrimental
in the absence of the threat.

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,890
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,570
They fully satisfy the
functional criterion for
recognizing adaptations that we

14
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,100
discussed in the first lectures.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,130
Yeah.

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,780
The cost of much of the immune system
energy immunopathology collateral tissue

17
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:02,781
damage are too high to allow
constitutive activation in the absence of

18
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,990
infection. This is something that you
only want to turn on when you need it.

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:08,600
Okay.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
It's low cost components.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,580
The secreted defensins and things like
immunoglobulin a are constitutive because

22
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:20,450
they do not damage Dimmitt tissue and
they don't cost very much so they can be

23
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,470
on all the time.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,410
Yeah.

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,900
There were some issues
with inducing a defense.

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,330
Yeah.

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,660
When several defense mechanisms
can protect from a given challenge,

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,560
they should be induced in the
order of increasing costs.

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
For example,
avoidance is cheaper than repair.

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,500
Yeah.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,060
And anticipatory responses can be
induced for challenges that occur with

32
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,580
predictable periodicity.
For example,

33
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:54,581
the seasons or upon detecting a proxy
that signals immediate presence.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,680
Yeah.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,311
For example,

36
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:02,311
starvation in the womb and to neonates
alters metabolism for years for the

37
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:07,600
developing brain, but creating
risks for late life, diabetes,

38
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,900
obesity and cardiovascular disease.
We saw that with Dohad,

39
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,660
the developmental origins
of health and disease.

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,660
This is an anticipatory response.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,620
Okay.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,940
There's some other features of
induction or misses and a climatization.

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,430
Innate defenses can be adjusted to the
environment by individual experience,

44
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,410
a secondary exposure to the
same noxious factor results.

45
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:39,160
Then in a more efficient
and a more rapid response.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,720
This process is called hormesis.
So for example,

47
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,750
exposure to a low level of a toxin can
induce expression of detoxification

48
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:50,864
genes,

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,520
so that subsequent exposure to
otherwise lethal doses can be tolerated.

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,960
This is something that every culture
has used poisons to kill people he has

51
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,070
known about. It's one of the ways to
defend one's self against poisoning.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,710
And it figures prominently in the case
of Valentine to via fort in the count of

53
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
Monte Cristo.

54
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,190
Okay.

55
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,950
Or misses is related to a climatization,

56
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:20,580
but the two off usually operate
on different timescales.

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,080
The term hormesis is usually applied
to a discrete environmental exposure.

58
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:30,450
For example, a dose of toxin. Well,

59
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:34,650
a climatization is usually applied
to continuous exposures. For example,

60
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:38,580
changes in temperature, humidity,
oxygen, tension, things like that.

61
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,190
So here is a figure of Dumont.

62
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,800
Uh,
talking to Valentine,

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,280
he gave her small doe anticipating that
she would be the object of a poisoning

64
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:53,454
attempt.

65
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,510
He gave her small doses of the poison
and when she was actually poisoned in the

66
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:00,120
novel,
she went into a coma and recovered.

67
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,940
So that's an example of four nieces.

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,450
Yeah.

69
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,400
Now what about the reversibility of
defenses and the timescales on which that

70
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,234
can be done?

71
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,780
Most inducible mechanisms are reversible
and they do operate on different

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,633
timescales.

73
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,900
Rapid physiological adaptation operates
on the scale of seconds to minutes.

74
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,530
So that would be hyperventilation,
shivering, increased heart rate,

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,770
all methods of dealing
with temperature change.

76
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,650
My policies,

77
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,650
gluconeogenesis in the immune response
operate on the scale of hours to days.

78
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah.

79
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,410
The climatization operates on the scale
of days to weeks, months, and years.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,010
It can take quite a while to get
used to walking at high altitude.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,210
Yeah,

82
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,920
and developmental plasticity is an often
irreversible form of adaptation that is

83
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,480
usually induced at an early developmental
stage and then it lasts for a lifetime.

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,090
Yeah.

85
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,090
So we have seen this diagram before and
it lays out the idea that physiological

86
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:13,600
adaptation is fast.
Acclimation is intermediate.

87
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,070
Elite mental plasticity is
slow and often irreversible.

88
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,980
There are important distinctions
between immune and behavioral defenses.

89
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,170
Defenses that are mediated by the immune
in the nervous system have two distinct

90
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,050
components,
innate and acquired.

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,900
So this is actually a similarity,
both of them in some sense,

92
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,940
learn, acquired, and learn.

93
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:48,520
Defenses are very flexible and they
can be adjusted to unpredictable

94
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,354
environments.

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,710
So if you don't know what kind of
environment is going to be encountered,

96
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:57,530
it would be good to have a system designed
that can learn to deal with anything

97
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:02,450
that comes along and the kinds of things
that are unpredictable or pathogens.

98
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,330
Predators, toxic plants, venomous insects.

99
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
We need methods of dealing
with all of those things.

100
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,770
Yeah.

101
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,190
Adaptive and acquired systems
also have the benefit of memory.

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,720
We have both neurological memory
and we have immune memory.

103
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,290
Yeah.

104
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,030
The immune system thus resembles the
nervous system in some important ways.

105
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,130
We also know that the two systems can
communicate with each other to share

106
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,480
information on the environment.

107
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,280
There is crosstalk between the immune
system and the central nervous system.

108
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,340
Flint,
this kind of flexibility has benefits,

109
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,110
but it also has costs.

110
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,910
Although most invertebrates rely for
defense on innate immunity in behavior,

111
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,230
whereas vertebrates used both innate and
adaptive acquired immunity and behavior.

112
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,180
Yeah.

113
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,090
Why adaptive systems evolved
in vertebrates is not
completely clear for they are

114
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,450
impressively risky.

115
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,100
Although the adaptive systems of
vertebrates provide clear advantages.

116
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:14,600
They also create vulnerabilities to
disease that are absent in invertebrates.

117
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,860
These vulnerabilities include
autoimmune and allergic diseases,

118
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,220
mental diseases and behavioral
abnormalities such as
severe obsessive compulsive

119
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:28,910
disorder, paranoia and phobia.
The costs of flexibility,

120
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:33,530
those include risks of
new types of disease.

121
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,120
The point being made here is that one
does not often see a mentally deranged

122
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,470
honeybee or a mentally deranged octopus.

123
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Those kinds of vulnerabilities are
consequences of the flexibility and

124
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,060
complexity of our adaptive

125
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,730
behavioral system.

126
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,250
And they resembled the vulnerabilities
that we have in our adaptive immune

127
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,084
system.

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,710
Yeah.

129
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,710
So here's a guy with paranoia and here
are some lesions in the central nervous

130
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,484
system.

131
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,780
Yeah,

132
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,090
so benefits and costs of homeostasis.

133
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,840
Homeostasis is overall a good thing.

134
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:27,970
It keeps the internal
environment constant,

135
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,960
but the mechanisms that produce
it contained vulnerabilities.

136
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,340
The idea of law called Stoltz do media
and [inaudible] comes from Claude

137
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,130
Bernard, the great 19th
century French physiologist,

138
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,303
and

139
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,840
he saw the internal
regulation was important.

140
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:53,170
It is done with systems that
have multiple set points,

141
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,380
so they are Rio static.

142
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,920
They can be set to different
levels of concentration,

143
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,830
different levels of temperature.

144
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,760
And that is one of the ways
that they are flexible,

145
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,360
but those are also set
points that can be broken.

146
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,040
So that is how we evolve to optimize
or adaptation to varying needs and

147
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:16,974
environments.

148
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,820
A single set point system is
resistant to dysregulation,

149
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,750
but it does not lead to
a disease of homeostasis.

150
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,880
But if you have multiple set points is,
for example, with our blood sugar levels,

151
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,440
they are vulnerable to dysregulation
and they permit then the diseases of

152
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,310
homeostasis,

153
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,470
the same mechanisms that evolve to
change the set points with adaptive

154
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:46,880
consequences.
Those permit dysregulation in disease

155
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,420
such diseases include type two diabetes,
gout,

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
and some types of obesity here
illustrated for Gout and obesity.

157
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,610
Some of the features of
these systems are redundancy,

158
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,440
compensation and compatibility,

159
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,280
and it's worth taking a minute
or two to distinguish among them.

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,970
Most defenses have multiple components.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who's deployment is coordinated and it
unfolds in order of increasing cost.

162
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,420
The components can compensate for each
other when one is damaged in that makes

163
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,410
the system robust and efficient.

164
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,933
Okay.

165
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,091
However,

166
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:36,091
the intact components also have to
operate at higher magnitude or for longer

167
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:40,060
duration,
and that can result in immunopathology.

168
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,800
So if one part of the system is
knocked out and another compensates,

169
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,330
it can overcompensate.

170
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,720
Compatible defenses are ones that
neither cooperate nor interfere.

171
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah.

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Synergistic defenses or defenses that
cooperate and incompatible defenses

173
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:03,550
interfere with each other.
So for example,

174
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,970
inflammation is incompatible with
detoxification and cold adaptation and an

175
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,480
immune defense, or both incompatible
with the starvation response.

176
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,220
Okay.

177
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,140
So in thinking about defenses,

178
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:19,990
it's wise to keep in mind
these issues of redundancy,

179
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:24,991
compensation and compatibility because
they are all involved in the diseases of

180
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,224
defense.

181
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,793
Yeah.

182
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,610
So to summarize, defenses are
inducible when they are costly.

183
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,490
Yeah.

184
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,660
Redundant defenses are induced
in order of increasing costs.

185
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,300
[inaudible] occurs when a first exposure
to a threat induces defenses that make

186
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,000
leader exposures less harmful
and we're rapidly dealt with.

187
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,650
Yeah.

188
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,330
Induction of defenses takes time.
It can take from seconds to months,

189
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,880
depending upon the factor
in the type of defense.

190
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,970
Adaptive and acquired defenses have
the benefits of flexibility and memory,

191
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,770
but those also make us vulnerable
to new types of diseases.
