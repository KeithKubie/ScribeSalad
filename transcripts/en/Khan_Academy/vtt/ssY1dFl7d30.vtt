00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.420
Express the area of a rectangle
with the length 4y and width

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.390
2y as a monomial.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.740
So the area of a
rectangle is just

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.900
the width times the height,
or the base times the height.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.060
Now here, the base is 4y.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.350
So let me just
write it down-- area

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.800
is going to be
equal to the width

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.550
of the base times the height.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.590
The width is 4y and
the height here is 2y.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.070
So the area is going
to be 4y times 2y.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.359
Now here we can just
use the associative

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.400
and the commutative
properties of multiplication.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.130
So just swap the order that
we do this multiplying in.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.350
Instead of multiplying 4
times y times 2 times y,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.030
we could say this is the same
thing as 4 times 2 times y

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.500
times y.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.290
And of course, 4 times 2,
that part right over there

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.950
is just equal to 8.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.957
And then y times y, well
that's just y squared.

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:54.790
Or it's y to the first
times y to the first,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.310
which is also y squared.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.070
So it becomes 8y squared.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.030
So that's the area
and it's a monomial.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.270
This is a polynomial
with only one term.
