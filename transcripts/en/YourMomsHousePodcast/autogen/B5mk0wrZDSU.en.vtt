00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 align:start position:0%
and basically you just see the head kind
 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.330 align:start position:0%
and basically you just see the head kind
of<00:03:19.630><c> poking</c><00:03:19.959><c> out</c><00:03:20.110><c> when</c><00:03:20.260><c> it's</c><00:03:20.380><c> flaccid</c><00:03:20.620><c> mm-hmm</c>

and<00:03:21.459><c> it</c><00:03:21.640><c> probably</c><00:03:21.820><c> grows</c><00:03:22.240><c> I</c><00:03:22.750><c> think</c><00:03:23.050><c> probably</c>

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 align:start position:0%
and it probably grows I think probably
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.010 align:start position:0%
