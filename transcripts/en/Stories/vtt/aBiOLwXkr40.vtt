00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.780
MARY TURNER:
There's a great deal

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.520
of prejudice in
the United Kingdom

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.880
towards Irish Travellers.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.420
You hear stories all
the time about how dirty

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.620
they are, how they leave
conditions in terrible places,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.920
how unpleasant they are.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.360
And they were nothing like that.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.870
None of those
stereotypes ever fitted.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.230
NARRATOR: Irish travelers are
a nomadic ethnic group living

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.300
throughout Ireland and the UK.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.450
They traditionally move in
caravans living in encampments

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.985
alongside roadways.

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:28.110
MARY TURNER: Many of the
Travellers are illiterate.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.800
Through years of moving around,
many of them don't read.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
They don't write.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.230
NARRATOR: That's Mary
Turner, a photojournalist who

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.470
spent seven years getting to
know a group of Travellers who

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.410
face marginalization and
are stereotyped because

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.877
of their unique lifestyle.

00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.460
MARY TURNER: They
were far from dirty.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.293
They're the cleanest
people I've ever known.

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:47.010
You'll notice that
inside their trailers,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.468
everything is covered in plastic
so that the children don't

00:00:49.468 --> 00:00:50.970
make anything dirty.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.180
NARRATOR: Laws introduced
in 1994 gave police

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.460
greater authority
to evict Travellers

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.120
from roadside encampments, which
led many Travellers to settle

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.144
at Dale Farm, near Essex,
hoping to form a community.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:05.810
MARY TURNER: They
live tightly together,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.684
away from the outside
world, and they totally

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:08.715
depend on each other.

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.976
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.860
MARY TURNER: Their weddings,
Christmas celebrations,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.150
Holy Communions-- these
celebrations will go on

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.970
for days.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.670
At a wedding, there
are no invites.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.390
It's just whoever wants to come.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.727
They're really
amazing occasions,

00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:30.560
but it's also one of
the most important days

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.060
in a Traveller girl's life.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.850
NARRATOR: In 2011, after
a dispute over planning

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.830
permissions, the
families at Dale Farm

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.160
were evicted, resulting in the
displacement of 80 Traveller

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.320
families and 45 arrests.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.787
After protesters became
involved, tensions escalated.

00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:51.870
MARY TURNER: The eviction
was particularly brutal.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.200
Riot police came pouring down
the hill behind the site,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.215
started tearing down
walls, screaming, shouting,

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:01.350
and I remember my friends'
children standing there

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.580
in tears.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.550
Just-- in their own
country, I think,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.500
feeling something that I
never expected to witness.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.510
NARRATOR: Since being
evicted from Dale Farm,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.250
some Travellers
have wanted to find

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.290
more stability in their lives.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.457
MARY TURNER: I think they
realize the importance now

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:20.706
of settling a little and
allowing their children to go

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:23.340
to school and engaging with the
world around them a little bit

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.970
more.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.147
They have, over the last three
or four years, all got iPhones.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.730
When I first went,
they were terrified

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.419
of the idea of photographs
being put on Facebook.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.460
And now, they quite
regularly do that themselves.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.630
And that's really
helping them to overcome

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.192
some of those challenges
that I've mentioned.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.650
Engaging with technology is
hugely important for the future

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.616
of their community.

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.490
NARRATOR: Many families
have been forced back

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.220
on the road and risk
being stopped by police.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.200
Last year, Mary
traveled with them

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.140
and witnessed the treatment
they face by skeptical and wary

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.917
British citizens.

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:54.750
MARY TURNER: I really
saw for the first time

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.180
then what that was like,
actually driving through town

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.870
and having people look at
you, having the police pull up

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.424
and speak to you.

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:03.840
People are always
afraid of things

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.059
that they don't understand.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.350
That's why I felt it was so
important as a photographer

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.440
to try and show the things
that we have in common.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.690
