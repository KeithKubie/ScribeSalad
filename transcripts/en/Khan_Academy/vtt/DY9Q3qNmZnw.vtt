00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.545
- [Voiceover] We're asked to find the sum

00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:05.167
of the first 50 terms of this series,

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:06.537
and you might immediately recognize

00:00:06.537 --> 00:00:08.118
it is a geometric series.

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:11.098
When we go from one term to
the next, what are we doing?

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:15.108
Well, we're multiplying by
10/11, to go from one to 10/11,

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.798
you multiply by 10 over 11,

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:20.965
then you multiply by 10 over 11 again,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:24.265
and we keep doing this,

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:26.908
and we wanna find the
first 50 terms of it.

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:29.731
So we can apply the formula we derived

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.289
for the sum of a finite geometric series

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.540
and that tells us that the sum of,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.951
let's say in this case the first 50 terms,

00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.023
actually let me do it down here,

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.690
so the sum of the first 50 terms

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:50.623
is going to be equal to the
first term, which is one,

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:53.706
so it's gonna be one times one minus,

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.820
let me do that in a different color,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.903
one times one minus the common ratio,

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.788
so the common ratio here is
10/11, 10/11 to the 50th power,

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:10.902
to the power of how many terms we have,

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:15.358
all of that over one
minus our common ratio.

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:18.405
And so I'm not gonna solve it completely,

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:20.214
but we can simplify this a little bit,

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.286
this is gonna be one minus,

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:24.178
let me put parenthesis
here just to make sure

00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:26.570
we're not just taking
10 to the 50th power.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.737
So one minus 10/11 to the 50th power over,

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:37.292
this is 11/11 minus 10/11 is one over 11,

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.251
and so this is the same thing

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.470
as multiplying the numerator by 11,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.137
and so this is gonna be equal to

00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:48.245
11 times one minus 10/11 to the 50thpower,

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.475
and you can try to
simplify this even more,

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:53.337
but this gets up pretty far,

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:55.717
at this point it is just arithmetic.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:58.516
Let's do another one of
these, this is kinda fun.

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:02.099
So this is more clearly
a geometric series,

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.199
and let's just first
think about how many terms

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.180
we're gonna take the sum of.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.013
You might be tempted to say

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:09.176
"Okay I'm gonna take it to the 79th power,

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:12.087
"there must be 79 terms
here", but be very careful,

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:13.983
because the first term is
when we're taking things

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:17.619
to the zeroth power, we're
taking 0.99 to the zeroth power.

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.146
The second term is where we're
taking it to the first power,

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:23.325
the third term is where we're
taking it to the second power,

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:27.271
the fourth term is where we're
taking it to the third power

00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:31.963
so on and so forth, so this
right over here is the 80th,

00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:34.046
the 80th term, 80th term.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.962
So we wanna find S sub 80, and
so this is gonna be equal to

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.393
our first term is gonna be one times

00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:51.134
one minus our common
ratio to the 80th power,

00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:56.266
to the 80th power, all over,
and I'm leaving a blank

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.278
because we still need to
figure out our common ratio,

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.845
all over one minus our common ratio.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:02.102
So at first you might say

00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:05.071
well maybe the common ratio here is 0.99,

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.320
but notice we have a change in sign here,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.722
and the key thing is to say
well to go from term to the next

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:12.383
what are we multiplying by?

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:15.982
Well to go from the first
term to the second term,

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:18.399
we multiply by negative 0.99.

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:24.420
And then, so we're
multiplying by negative 0.99.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.863
Now to go to the next term,

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:29.280
we're again multiplying by negative 0.99,

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:34.082
so the common ratio is not positive 0.99,

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.994
but negative zero, negative 0.99,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.960
so let me write that, negative 0.99,

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:49.524
and of course that is going
to be to the 80th power,

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:52.274
all over one minus negative 0.99.

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:59.126
And so we could simplify
this a little bit,

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:01.886
this is all going to be equal to,

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:04.449
oh that one we don't have to
worry too much about that,

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.279
and so this is going to be one minus,

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.890
so negative 0.99 to the 80th power,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.376
I should put parenthesis
there to make sure

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:16.543
we are taking the negative
0.99 to the 80th power.

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.429
Well, we're taking it to an even power,

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:21.217
so it's going to be positive,
so that's going to be

00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:24.634
the same thing as 0.99 to the 80th power,

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:30.679
and all of that over, well
subtracting a negative

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:33.181
that's just gonna be adding the positive,

00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:35.264
so all of that over 1.99,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.471
and we could attempt to
simplify it more but,

00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:41.009
if we had a calculator we could

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.327
actually find this exact
value or close value actually,

00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:47.032
most calculators don't
give you the exact value

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:49.153
when you take something to the 80th power,

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:52.715
but this is what that sum is going to be.

00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.984
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:58.511
Alright, so here we have a
series defined recursively

00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:01.056
and so it's useful to just think about

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:02.435
what it would actually look like.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:06.435
So the first term is 10,
and then the next term,

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:11.076
so the second term A sub two is equal to

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:14.231
A sub one times 9/10, alright.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.890
So the next term is gonna be
the previous term times 9/10,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.919
so it's gonna be 10 times nine over 10,

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.018
and then the next term
is gonna be that times,

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:23.237
is gonna be the second term,

00:05:23.237 --> 00:05:25.879
the third term is the
second term times 9/10,

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.618
so 10 times nine over
10, nine over 10 squared.

00:05:30.618 --> 00:05:32.417
And the way it's written right now,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:36.838
we don't have it written as
a finite geometric series,

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:38.549
so let's say we wanna take the sum,

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:41.466
let's say we want the sum of first,

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:46.031
first I don't know 30 terms,

00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:48.715
sum of first 30 terms.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:51.320
So what will this be?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.487
Well we're gonna take S sub
one, S sub 30, oh I wrote ten,

00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:00.042
S sub 30, the sum of the first 30 terms,

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:03.436
is gonna be equal to the first
term, we've done this before,

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:07.436
the first term times one
minus the common ratio,

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:12.253
one minus the common
ratio to the 30th power,

00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:17.462
all of that over one
minus the common ratio.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.853
And let's see we could, one minus 9/10,

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:24.026
this is 1/10 right over
here, you divide by 1/10,

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.991
this is the same thing
as multiplying by 100,

00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:30.158
so this is gonna be 100
times one minus 9/10 to the,

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:36.936
oh let me write it this
way, 9/10 to the 30th power.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.402
And, actually these
parenthesis you always wanna

00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:41.960
put parenthesis there to make sure we see

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.991
we're taking both the nine and the 10

00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.143
or the 9/10, the whole
thing to the 30th power,

00:06:46.143 --> 00:06:49.726
not just the nine, so
there you go, did I..

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:53.869
yep there you go we're done.
