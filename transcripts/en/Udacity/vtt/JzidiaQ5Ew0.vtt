ONC, defines a fourth way of
classifying HIEs, by function.

used to send and

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.650
receive information between
providers for care coordination.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.240

The second is Query-based HIE.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.620
This is data aggregation
among providers.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.180
The third is Consumer Mediated

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.430
