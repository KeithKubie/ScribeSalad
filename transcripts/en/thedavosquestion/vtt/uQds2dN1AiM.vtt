00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.551
&gt;&gt; My opinion on the question of role models
is, yes. I have lived in the region for a

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:14.670
year when I was younger in Kuwait, and then
I now live in Turkey, in Istanbul, responsible

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.430
for Middle East Africa for my company. I met
a wonderful example of role models actually

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.480
coming into this forum. Yesterday, as I was
at a queue next to an African lady and I asked

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
her what she did and she told me she was an
elective member of Afghanistans Parliment.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.249
And I said what do you think your main achievement
has been, and she told me, being a member,

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.749
as a woman, in Afghanistans Parliment. I think
role models can play a very very important

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:50.210
part for the younger generation who look up
naturally to entrepeneurs, to gender diversity

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.379
and ask questions based on the framework of
the older generation as laid around them.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.109
I think it's important for the Middle East
if it is to evolve into a dynamic, vibrant

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.950
model for the world, it must have role models
that break some of the frameworks and more

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.649
archaic systems that are in place already.
It is a natural state for any part of the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.939
world, but one I think is extremely important
for the Middle East.
