00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; The question is can or will India become
a superpower?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.840
And if so, by when?
I believe that none of us have a crystal ball.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
Second, you know, different people have different
definitions of what a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.100
superpower is.
So as I'm concerned, yes, maybe in about 15

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.860
or 20 years' time, not
overnight, we need work to be done.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.579
India will become a superpower, but I'm referring
more to two types of

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.059
considerations which make a country a super
one.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.079
We'll never be a military superpower.
We have no desire to be a military superpower.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.170
We just need enough defensive capabilities
to defend us against

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.300
somebody we fear with an evil design on us.
But we will become a economic superpower because

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.260
of our large
hard-working and entrepreneurial people whether

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.380
in the field of
agriculture or industry or in the service

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.030
sector.
And also what is very important, I think as

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.030
well, apart from becoming
an economic superpower which will require

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.659
a great deal of effort and
work for the Indian people.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.640
It's the Indian people which will make the
country a superpower not

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
just the government.
But government is important it has to add

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.850
value, provide contusive
environment for business to function.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.440
But, unless we're economically strong, you
see, nobody in the world

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.880
listens to you.
So that is important.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.220
But in addition to that, I think, India should
also become a kind of

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.470
place -- and over the last 20 or 30 years,
people get trained, get

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.909
educated in IIT or IIM's and then go abroad
to work.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.200
There's nothing wrong with that.
They earn a lot of money.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.259
They send some of the money back home.
They create a good reputation for India.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.260
But now that's starting to changing a little
bit and they are returning

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.380
to work in India because there are tremendous
opportunities in India.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.119
In that context, I think 20 years down the
line, I would like India to

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.360
become a place where not only are Indians,
maybe some other people from

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.770
other countries would like to come and work
here or even live here,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.610
presuming we take care of our environment,
we take care of our

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.400
infrastructure, and we create conditions which
would make them happy

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.690
and proud to work in India.
An India where, for example, a child meeting

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.290
the top class education,
if he is competent, doesn't have to the depend

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.090
only on his parents'
income.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.340
He should be able to have the kind of education
he wants, whether IIT

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.680
or IIM or what have you based on his capability.
And he should be able to have -- get a scholarship

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.150
or et cetera if his
parents can't afford to send him to a top

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.840
school.
So I think that's the kind of place India

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.030
would become, but the other
countries are also racing to become or remain

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.070
a superpower whether the
United States, China, Germany, Japan, or France.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.940
But I think we have a good chance because
of our population and we need

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.740
to train them, educate them, and provide them
vocational training.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.230
Once we do that, I know that we shall become
economic superpower.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.769
But I must have this warning, if we in our
government do not take

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.629
advantage of our demographic dividend, do
not provide the right kind of

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.900
education and skills to our large population,
you know, maybe we have

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.220
200 million qualified graduates in two years
time, if we don't do that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.909
then we have a problem.
But yes, a lot of great things are happening

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.879
and good luck to India.
All the best.
