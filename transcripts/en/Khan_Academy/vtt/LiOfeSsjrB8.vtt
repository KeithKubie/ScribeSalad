00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.230
In the last video, we learned
how myosin-- and myosin II in

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.370
particular-- when we say myosin
II it actually has two

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.460
of these myosin heads and their
tails are inter-wound

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.040
with each other-- how myosin
II can use ATP to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.550
essentially-- you can almost
imagine either pulling an

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.385
actin filament or walking
up an actin filament.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.930
It starts attached.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.080
ATP comes and bonds onto it.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.370
That causes it to be released.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.650
Then the ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP and a phosphate group.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.795
And when that happens, that
energy's released.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:35.620
It puts this into a higher
energy state.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.910
It kind of spring-loads the
protein and then it attaches

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.070
up another notch on the actual
actin filament and then the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.290
phosphate group leaves and
that's where the confirmation

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.760
change in this protein
is enough.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.660
It generates the power stroke to
actually push on the actin

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.480
filament-- and you could
imagine, either move the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.240
myosin-- whatever the myosin is
connected to-- to the left

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.610
or whatever the actin is
connected to to the right.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.010
We're going to talk a lot more
about what they're connected

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.460
to in future videos.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.130
Now, a couple of questions
might have been

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.800
raising in your head.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.630
This guy had so much effort to
pull on this thing, right?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.870
There's some tension pulling in
the other direction, right?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.870
I said this is what happens in
muscles, so there must be some

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.760
weight or some other
resistance.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.200
So what happens when
this releases?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.990
At the first step when ATP
joined and this released,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.440
wouldn't the actin filament
just go back to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.370
where it was before?

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.180
Especially if there's
some tension on it

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.520
going in that direction.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.150
And the simple answer to that
is, this isn't the only myosin

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.140
protein that's acting
on this actin.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.380
You have others all
along the chain.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.740
Maybe you have one
right there.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.640
Maybe you have one
right there.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.150
They're all working at their own
pace at different times.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.550
So you have so many of these
that when one of them is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.840
disengaged, another one of them
might be in their power

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980
stroke or another one
might be engaged.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.750
So it's not like you have this
notion of, if all of a sudden

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.240
one lets go, that the actin
filament will recoil back to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.210
where it was.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.600
Now the next question that you
might be thinking is, how do I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.990
turn on and off this
situation?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.590
We have command over
our muscles.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
What can turn on or off this
system of the myosin

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.690
essentially crawling
up the actin?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.460
And to understand that, there's
two other proteins

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.900
that come into effect.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.880
That's tropomyosin
and troponin.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:48.270
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.760
And so I'm going to redraw the
actin-- I'll do a very rough

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910
drawing of the actin filament.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.190
Let's say that that's my actin
filament right there with its

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.790
little grooves.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.040
It's actually a helical
structure.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.630
 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.080
And actually, these grooves--
it's kind of a helical-- but

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.010
we won't worry too
much about that.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.550
What we drew so far, at least
in the last video, you had

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.490
these little myosin.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.860
You can view them as feet or
head or whatever that keep

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.490
attaching to it and then based
on where they are in that ATP

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.700
cycle, they can keep getting
cranked back up or

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.650
spring-loaded and go to the
next one and push back.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.650
Now, on top of this actin,
you actually have

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.160
this tropomyosin protein.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.030
And this tropomyosin protein,
it coils around the actin.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.270
So this is our actin
right here.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.760
This is one of the two heads
of the myosin II.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.830
 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.990
And then we have our
tropomyosin.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.972
Tropomyosin is coiled around.

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:55.260
It's a very rough sketch, but
you can imagine it's coiled

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.000
around and it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.400
and then it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.040
So it's coiled around it and the
important thing about it

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.210
is, if there's-- let me
take a step back.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.860
It's coiled around and it's
attached to the actin by

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.260
another protein called
troponin.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.959
 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860
Let's say it's attached there
and-- this isn't exact, but

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.270
let's say it's attached there,
and there, and there, and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.610
there, and there by
the troponin.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.860
So let me write this down.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:40.200
 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.540
So you can imagine, the troponin
is kind of like the

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.790
nails into the actin.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.050
So it dictates where
the tropomyosin is.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.040
So when a muscle is not
contracting, it turns out that

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.970
the tropomyosin is blocking
the myosin from being able

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.690
to-- and I've read a bunch of
accounts on this and I think

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.490
this is still an area
of research.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.690
It's not 100% clear one
way or the other.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.850
Tropomyosin is-- or maybe both--
blocking the myosin

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.880
from being able to attach to
the actin where it normally

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.630
attaches so it won't be able
to crawl up the actin-- or

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.090
sometimes the myosin is attached
to the actin, but it

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.840
keeps it from releasing and
sliding up the actin to keep

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280
that walking procedure.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.500
So the bottom line is that
this tropomyosin kind of

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:42.940
blocks the myosin head-- this
is the myosin head right

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:55.770
there-- from crawling up the
actin, either by physically

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.740
blocking its actual binding site
or if it's already bound,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.480
keeping it from being able to
keep sliding up the actin.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.310
Either way, it's blocking it
and the only way to make it

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.240
unblocked is for the troponins
to actually change their

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.570
confirmation, for them to
change their shape.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.330
And the only way for them to
change their shape is if we

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.380
have a high calcium
ion concentration.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.300
So if you have a bunch of
calcium ions, if you have a

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.350
high enough concentration, these
calcium ions are going

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.750
to bond to the troponin and
then that changes the

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.970
confirmation of the troponin
enough to move the

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.350
configuration of the
tropomyosin.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.260
So let me write this down.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.130
So normally, tropomyosin blocks,
but then when you have

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:52.070
a high calcium ion
concentration, they bind to

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:59.840
troponin and then the troponin,
they change their

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.850
confirmation so it moves the
tropomyosin out of the way.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:14.510
 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.690
So when it moves out of the way,
you have a high calcium

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.360
concentration, bonds troponin,
moves tropomyosin out of the

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.770
way, then all of a sudden what
we talked about in the last

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.860
video-- these guys can start
walking up the actin or

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.180
pushing the actin to the
right, however you

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.210
want to view it.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:38.300
But then if the calcium
concentration goes low, then

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.620
the calciums get released
from the troponin.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.380
You need to have enough to
always hang around here.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.620
If the concentration becomes
really low here, these guys

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.210
will start to leave. So then the
troponin goes back to, I

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.460
guess, standard confirmation.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.920
 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:05.530
That makes the tropomyosin
block the myosin again.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:12.730
 

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.770
So it's actually-- I
mean, I can't say

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.780
anything here is simple.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.820
This was only discovered maybe
50 or 60 years ago and you can

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.210
imagine to actually observe
these things or to create

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.840
experiments to definitively
know what's happening--

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.560
nothing is simple, but
the idea is simple.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.490
Without calcium, the tropomyosin
is blocking the

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.549
ability of the myosin to attach
where it needs to

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.559
attach or slide up the actin so
it can keep pushing on it.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.049
But if the calcium concentration
is high enough,

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.610
they will bond to the troponin--
which essentially

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.970
nails down the tropomyosin
that's wound around the actin

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.630
and when they change their
confirmation with the calcium

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:57.470
ions, it moves the tropomyosin
out of the way so that the

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.590
myosin can do what it does.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.430
So you can imagine already,
we're building up a way for--

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.830
one, for muscles to contract,
but even better, for us to

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.570
control muscles to contract.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.540
So if we have a high calcium
concentration within the cell,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.050
the muscle will contract.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.060
If we have a low calcium
concentration again, then all

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.700
of a sudden, these
will release.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.990
They'll be blocked, and then the
muscle will relax again.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.694
