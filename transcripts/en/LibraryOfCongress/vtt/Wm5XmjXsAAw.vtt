From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mekaella Vailu'u: Hello everyone.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.390
I want to thank you for coming.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.750
My name is Mekaella
Vailu'u and I am here

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.110
from Eastern Kentucky University.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.810
I'm currently an intern in
interpreting services program

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.110
which is housed in the EE ODP.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.600
During my tenure here, I'll be
planning three different events.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.680
The first one is commencing today

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.060
and then the other two
are up here on the board.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.600
Each event is planned all at the
same time just for continuity

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.960
so that everybody can come

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740
and you'll remember this
time, so you can come now.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300
While I'm here I wanted
to look around the Library

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.540
to see the different ways
that language was used,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.800
within each division there
is unique language and I want

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.860
to introduce Alex Richey to you.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.980
He'll be facilitating this
panel discussion today.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.220
So again thank you for coming and
hope you enjoy the presentation.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.190
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Hello everyone.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.520
My names Alex Richey, I'm
a retiree with the Library.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.190
I had almost forty three years
of service here at the Library

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.500
and I'm coming back as a
volunteer with my old job.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.230
So I'd like the other panelists
to introduce themselves.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
Also, where I'm working
is geography and map,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.530
I'm still volunteering there.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.020
&gt;&gt; Gerald Voltman: My
name is Gerald Voltman.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.760
I'm currently in the CALM division
and I have been here for six years.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.240
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering:
Hello, I'm Fred Pickering.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.440
I've worked [inaudible] OIT OCIO.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.200
I've been here for more than forty
years and I work with the people

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.820
with disabilities with
their [inaudible].

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: The first picture on
the left is the original telephone

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.690
that was invented in 1875
by Alexander Graham Bell,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.380
here pictured in the middle
with his wife and his mother.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.820
They were all deaf, I'm sorry,
the wife and the mother were deaf

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.180
and he was working on
inventing hearing aid

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.620
and by accident he
invented the telephone.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.940
And it was something that for many,
many years almost a 100 years was

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.000
of no benefit to the deaf world

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.030
until about the 1970s there
was a man, well, here we go,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.600
1875 nearly a hundred
years until the invention

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.380
of the modem and teletype in 1964.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.860
The teletypewriter is where
the term TTY comes from and man

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.510
who invented was Robert Weitbrecht
and this book was written

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.730
by Harry Lang, a historian,
that chronicled that time.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.970
And Robert Weitbreht was the
adventure of the modem and the TTY.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.970
Does anyone here remember
the sign for this telephone?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.600
Yes, that's the one.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.510
Yes, that's the sign we
used to use that telephone

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.960
and this telephone, right?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.130
Telephone or you actually show it
lifting it up and you will dial;

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.730
it was a dial, rotary
dial phone at that time.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.160 position:56%
So who here had either one of those?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.870
Anyone have the older version?

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.170
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.050
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: No, the other
one, you had the rotary dial,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.750 position:56%
you had the rotary dial phone, okay.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.970
Now, I've seen the
handheld ones in museums

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.160
but didn't see one in real life.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.600
Now, this is the model twenty
eight teletypewriter, it's a TTY.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.770 position:56%
And it was actually a teletypewriter
machine that had to be connected

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.620
with this modem and that was the
invention that turned it into a TTY

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.740
that we could use the
phone to communicate

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.970
from one person to another.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.270
And who's this?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.350
Oh yeah, that's a deaf man, yes.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.150
Someone from the audience asked
me if this person was deaf?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.450
That's Robert.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.170
&gt;&gt; Gerald Voltman: Fred is asking,
where was that machine from?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.260
Where was that made?

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Correct, it was from
the Western Union telegraph company

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.580
and so many deaf people way
back then had those phones.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.040
They had to be refurbished when
they came from Western Union

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.440
and then deaf people
would sell them.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.250
Myself, I had one of this.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.390
How many here had one of this?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.160
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: Yeah,
they were extremely noisy

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.460
and a lot a vibration from them.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.420
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: And the question
from the audience was right.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.300
Some people have seen them
but they never use them yet.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.560
It depends on what
generation you are from.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.570
I remember in my high school,

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.730
it was a mainstream
school, they still had one.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.380
We really got tired of those
large, noisy, loud machines

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.700
and we finally came up
with a portable TTY.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.490
You didn't have to have that big
lugging equipment in your house.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.140
Now, the first teletypewriter
that came out came

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.440
out without paper,
we'll talk about that.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.530
And the second ones came
out with paper and a lot

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.200
of deaf people really preferred
the ones with the paper printout

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.530
because you could refresh your
memory about what was being said.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:16.080
The other ones if the message
scrolled by on the LED screen,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.260
it was really hard to remember
what was said, especially,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.690 position:56%
if English was your second language,
it was harder to keep up with that

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.130
and I guess I'll pass it off
to the panel for comment.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gerald Voltman: Yes that's right,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.470
my TTY had an answering
machine ready inside of it

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.150
and so it would go ahead
and leave the message for me

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.340 position:56%
so if I wasn't home I could see
what was being said while I was out.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.380
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: I used those,
I think a mini com, I believe.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.140
When I would call into
the relay service

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.330
and I'd see its rolling
cross, I would call relay

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.830
and the person will answer the
phone near and would ask me,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.270
what did you say, can
you repeat that?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.840
And I could remember exactly
what I had said before

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.270 position:56%
or what had been said so we typed
something, it was there, it was gone

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.760
and so you didn't have a
record of what you were saying

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.920
or what had been said previously.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.910
So it could be a problem
sometimes once you have the paper

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.230
if someone asked me
to repeat something

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.270
or whatever I could go back in
and get verbatim what I had said.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.340
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Sometimes when
I was typing I had to wait

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.530
for the relay operator to
speak my message in English,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.280
to listen to the other person
and then type it back to me.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.470
It really was very time-consuming.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.770
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: I talked

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.070
with deaf people who've
used the TTY before

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.890
and they didn't like the waiting.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.030
Because you would, the hearing
people also found it very

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.990
frustrating because it was much
slower communication having to wait

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.670
for someone to type
what they were saying

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.500
to hear a response
back, it took forever.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.760
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So technology came
out with new and better things.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.780
Pagers, I think Gerald, you
actually have one, right?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.470
There's still 4 deaf people at the
Library of Congress who use pagers,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.620
it's for emergency notification
because they work in the stacks

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.620
and that's the only reason

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.790
that they're still using
that older technology.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.230
How many even remember those?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.260
Now, Instant Messenger
AOL, I didn't use it much

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.590
but how many of you used it.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.020
&gt;&gt; Gerald Voltman: Yeah, I
used to use that before text

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.490
but then once I have text
message I get rid of AIM.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.630
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Right,
everyone always keeps moving

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.930
to new and better technology.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.670 position:56%
Now, the last one over here was
something specifically for the deaf,

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.030
it was called the sidekick.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.720
How many of you had a sidekick?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.140
Yeah, a lot of folks had
the sidekick at that time.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.310
So let's talk about.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.100
So let's talk about
the signs for these.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.190
So some people would
sign pager like this.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.620
Gerald saying I would sign it here,
right, Alex is showing the sign.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.810 position:56%
Instant Messenger, we always say AIM
and then sidekick, that's the sign

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.530
for the sidekick if I may.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.110
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: As far as AIM
and AOL AIM, it was very popular

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.730
for a lot of deaf people; it
was very easy communication.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.110 position:56%
The person had it, they had
Internet access at home or whatever,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.520
you could just jet back-and-forth,
it was very popular, extremely.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.220
So AIM outside the outside world,
here's the Library for example,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.960
they didn't permit it
for security reasons.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.810
So we couldn't use AIM here
internally, just email.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:56.010 position:56%
And [inaudible] text on a pagers or
things like that but AIM got removed

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.060
and because hackers could
sometimes use those to sort

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.360
of get back into the system.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:13.320
Now we have, the group was there's
a messenger replacement so a lot

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.780
of people really do miss AIM.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.570
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Alright, so
let's talk about other technology

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.960
that improved over the years.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.550
Let's talk about the signs
first, this is a cell phone,

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.010
cell phone will, yeah, but it was

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.560
for hearing people not
for deaf people, right?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.970
Okay, so that's the sign
cell phone and then.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.840
Okay. So there's another
sign, but I'm going to use

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.990
that a little bit later in the
presentation and then this,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.410
these smart phones were
much more easy to use.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.250
Now, this is what we would
classify as a cell phone

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.400
and that was the sign and then
this is the sign for iPhone.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.970
There's the letter I in the
same place is a telephone

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.320
or a mobile phone, well,
mobile that you carry with you.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.310
&gt;&gt; Gerald Voltman: There's another
sign for like the iPhone or an iPad

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.820
but just the swiping
and scrolling motion.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.010
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: And
everyone I'm sure will.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.020
Most deaf people use
some sort of iPhone

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.020 position:56%
or Samsung, some kind of smartphone.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.640
Because you can text back and
forth with that very easily,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:47.840 position:56%
email and now with some of the video
relay they have apps on the phones.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.790
You can contact the video relay
service through your cell phone

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.060
as well through your smartphone.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.640
You can call to ask for directions
somewhere if you're stuck

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.830
at some place, it's very
nice to be able to get

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.690
that access, use it for that.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.990
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So one
thing I wanted to add,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.300
I'm going to step back in
time here a little bit.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.520
At first all of this technology
was set out to hearing people

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.410
and the telephone companies
created that,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.690
but you had to ask your neighbors
to make telephone calls for you

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.260
and so that was a problem.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.620
Anyone else wants to say
something about that about using.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.660
&gt;&gt; Sure, I know in the past
if I was making calls, first,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.120
I would, I saw it at Gallaudet.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:52.250
I saw it back in 1967, 68 something
like that, I saw how supervisor,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.150
then supervisor there had a device,
they were writing something on it.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.450
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: On the screen?

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.750
&gt;&gt; Hand write something and it
would go down into this machine.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.050
They were using something to
scroll round on it and send it

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.350
to another office and they
had a similar machine there

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.650
that was then sort of had a pin
following what they were doing.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.950
So you'll be writing out
messages at the same time,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.250
it was all in handwriting
and they go back

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.550
and forth that way communicating.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.850
TTY is a very different machine,
obviously, typing back and forth

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.150
but I do remember seeing that at
Gallaudet, it was very interesting

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.450
to see, I hadn't thought
about for years

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.750
because the technology
changed so much.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.780
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: I think
that's about writing,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.490
noting, giving them to someone.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.300
&gt;&gt; Sure, I write notes and give
them back and forth to people

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.070
but often I want the person to come
up to me and as me directions here

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.840
or there, things like that,
in case that [inaudible] deaf,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.000
and they start to walk away.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.680
I am so willing to help
and I'm able to help,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.000
I can grab paper whatever
write back and forth,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.200
I can I know where I'm going,
I can give you directions.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.750
So I'm very willing to help.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.360
Today we have so much new
technology with the pagers

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.540
and texting and all of that.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.050 position:56%
You'll be able to type the speech
technology like I can type a message

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.430
and they can speak them to you.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.990
Alex Voltman: Alex is saying,

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.780
my team leader uses Siri
on the iPhone a lot.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.380
We will speak to it and
it types for the person

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.210
and then I read the
message so that works

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.700
out pretty well and
I type back to them.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.090
And that's all part of
smartphone, iPhone technology.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.480
Anything else you want
to add about these?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.650
Toby do you have any
thing you want to add?

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:52.500
&gt;&gt; Do you want to mention
about them about the C phone?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.800
I haven't heard about that.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.790
&gt;&gt; Toby French: Hello everybody.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.300
I'm Toby French and I have
worked with the library

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.250
for thirty four years but as

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.840
of March 15th I will be celebrating
my 51st year in federal service.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.540
So I didn't realize,
thank God I'm alive

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.030
and I would say I have
really enjoyed my time here

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:30.560
but before the time when we had
a mini com, and it was C phone,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:37.080
it was a little TV screen and you
would put a phone up against it.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.470
And I remember one day,
one evening rather,

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:46.480
lightning had struck the C phone
and it didn't work anymore,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.350
but at that time there was a
newer model and so we were able

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.500
to update to that version.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.230
The C phone was about
two or three years old

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.530
when I was able to use that.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.110
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So there's another
question from the audience here.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.360
We're trying to remember
all of our stories.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.260
This is Toby speaking and
saying I remember the C phone,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:23.970
it wasn't like a telephone with
screen but it didn't really last,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.260
it wasn't the best technology.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.220
So you're saying that the
screen was really small.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.350
&gt;&gt; Toby French: Yeah, it was

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.650
like you would put the
phone vertical almost

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.790
up against the screen, it's
not this big foot by foot.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.000
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Yeah, I
think I seen phones like that

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.300
but the screens were like four

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.490
by four inches something
smaller like that.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.310
&gt;&gt; Everything, I've seen
something on a website about one

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.610
of the little phones like that.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.600
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: And Eric
thank you for prompting me.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.580
We were talking about the
stories that we'd remembered here.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.200
Here at the library, when I came

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.810
into the library there were
no telephones they were used

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.240
by deaf people.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.490
So we wrote back and
forth and used telephones

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.460
with our hearing colleagues and
then I think it was about nineteen.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.950
&gt;&gt; Eighty?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.850
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Yes,
somewhere around 1980.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.940
Here's the Library of Congress,
the Library of Congress bought one,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:28.880
one TTY for all of us and
the impact was amazing.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.020
We have three different buildings
and we would all have to trek

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.540
to the one building
where the one TTY was

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.300 position:56%
and sometimes there would be a line,
they were like get off the phone

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.580
so I can make my call and
waiting queue for that.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.480
Then later on we got one in
each building, and then later

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.800
on every deaf employee got
their own TTY at their desk.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.400 position:56%
So at least there was one TTY for
everyone but I think I've got caught

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.370
up on other stories, is that right?

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.520
&gt;&gt; I know, when I originally
got hired and the first day

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.760
that I got here they
had one ready for me

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.570
because you're a newer
employee, that's why.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.660
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: I'm an old timer
and I can remember the days

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.970
when we saw all of this progress
incrementally over time, alright.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.620
Okay so here we are.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.850
We're going to talk
about these devices.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:33.160
We call them now VPs,
videophones, there was a sign

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.650
that we started off using was
like two cameras, two cameras

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.470
and that were used simultaneously.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.820
We got tired of doing that
so we decided to sign it

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.020
with just two letters VP.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.580
&gt;&gt; When I was a student's
at NTID there were a lot

00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:01.190
of different offices that
would have all around campus

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:08.130 position:56%
that would have different videophone
stationed that if we needed to use.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:14.710
And they had phones that we could
just sit there and sign into

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.500
and we could communicate
that way using a video phone.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:27.450
But now that was probably in
like 1994 and that was in NTID.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.880
So now, we have videophones
everywhere.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.090
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Well, who wants
to speak about these next, Fred.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.870
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: I
don't see the difference

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.650
in the TTY and the videophone.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.150
I can speak to that a bit.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:56.710
The TTY deaf persons talking about,
you're typing back and forth,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.820
it's a second language
for a lot of deaf people,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.840
it's very confusing sometimes
having to go back and try

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.400
and reread what they said
in English and English

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.420
and ASL are different languages.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.120 position:56%
So it really did extend the time
that it took to have a conversation,

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.420
they dragged everything out.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.830
The hearing person was having to
wait for often the deaf person

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.360
to get the message typed them
and interpreted themselves

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.000 position:56%
and the operators on the videophone;
it's a very different feel.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.960
These are just one of my
friends that I'm talking with,

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.460
here in the picture we're
having a direct communication

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.060
but I also use this

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.200
within interpreter the exact same
way you see in the other picture.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.690
I'll be, the hearing person will be
speaking same time and I'm signing

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.220
and then interprets managing it
all like the interpreters do.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.920
Normally people can call
me, I can call them.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.170
I can call directly
to deaf people as well

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.470
with the video relay service.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:04.310
It's all coordinated very simply
and easily through an interpreter

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.150
through ASL so there's far
fewer misunderstandings.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.590 position:56%
The interpreters understand what the
deaf person is saying more clearly

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.990
that they are able to
interpret them more clearly.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.720
The video relay service
is a much better option

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:25.690
and it makes us better
communicators and train them to set

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.190
up doctors appointments,
to set up whatever.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.160
For the TTY there was so many
struggles, so many problems

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.330
and so we're very lucky that we
have the videophones nowadays

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.630
and we're very happy for it.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.780
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Jacinda
[inaudible].

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.770
Yes and I used to work on the help
desk support group, tech help desk

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.750
and I remember assisting some
of the staffs with the Sorinsen.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.570
Sorensen, am I saying
that correctly,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:05.400
and I would like to know how much
it has progressed these days.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.450
Am I saying that right, Sorensen.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is there, it
has improved things greatly,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.660
we're using, we're adding
a lot of technology.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.390
And a lot of things
that we use here's

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.320
that people are very satisfied
with it as they add features;

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.760 position:56%
people are becoming very comfortable
with it, so it's tremendous.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.720
I'm kind of old-fashioned, I
don't use lot of the new things

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.020
or features but they are out there.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.320
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: And here

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.200
at the Library every deaf permanent
employee has a video phone,

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.390
it's really great to have
the videophones at our desk.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.650
The communication is
much more facile,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.440
it's faster and it's easier to use.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.230
&gt;&gt; Even when I go outside of the
Library, I'm on my cell phone,

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.670
I have the same technology
built-in, and with FaceTime.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:10.930
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So I think many of
you are familiar with FaceTime and

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:16.170 position:56%
but that's only within the Apple
products within iPhone but it's face

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:21.600
to face time and so if you have
FaceTime you can actually use that.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.300
Now, Androids I'm not sure
if that technology has those.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:33.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have Sorensen the
app actually in my phone,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.280
so that works fine for me.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.960
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: And when you
talk about FaceTime, on the iPhone

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.420
but really other devices use, other
smartphones have a similar system.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.940
It's an equivalent thing anyway
to the iPhone's FaceTime system.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.590
IMO, I don't know if
you've seen that,

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.940
you can download that for free.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.090
It's not an app like that,
my daughter has that,

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:06.640
it doesn't play well with FaceTime
but you can download those.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.970
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: and I'm
wondering about Skype?

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.330
Do you use Skype?

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.910
&gt;&gt; Skype, I don't use
Skype much, no.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.080
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Are
there, is a new technology?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.410
This is a question
from the audience.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.770
Could you talk about
GLIDE, G L I D E?

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you record
yourself in a short message

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:34.230
and you send it that off.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.770
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: It's
much like texting

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.110
for people for hearing people.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.670
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: And
for the video phones,

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.770
we use the video phones
everyday but issues come

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.310
up about what about emergencies.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:53.240
We can, you dial 911 as well on
the video phone, it's very easy

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.010
to do from a video phones.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.650
It's the same process,
the person instead

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.190
of automatically we get it
pushed to the top of the queue

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.900
for anybody to call obviously.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.720
Interpreters there are trained
to handle that and they did

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.630
that to a special 911
process that they go through.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:17.270
The answer right away, we explain
situation, heart attack, whatever,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:25.890
fire and they call,
and they call them out,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.030
but unfortunately but
the system in place.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.160
Here at the Library the interpreter
automatically hold the DC police

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.650
rather than the Capital police.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.240
So we're working on that now,
try and figure out how to get

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.440
that dealt with, get that rerouted.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.930
Someone coming out of the
library should be going

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.840
to the Capital police; they should
be the ones coming to our offices

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.710
to [inaudible] first
responders for us.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.060
So that is dragging
things out a bit,

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.600
if it gets out to the wrong folks,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.210
if it gets out to the DC police
rather than the Capital police.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.800
But we wouldn't really want to
have go in outside the government

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.390
to then be brought back into to
have the DC police trying to get

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.360
into the government
building such so.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.110
We're trying to work around for
that but it's taking a lot of time

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.790
and it is sort of dragging
the process out.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.000
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: And so now, we
talked about all this technology,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.610
but I do you want to ask a couple
questions about clubs for the deaf?

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:40.050
Many of them are closing and
let me repeat that, I guess.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.550
The number of deaf clubs,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.610
some people may not be
familiar with deaf clubs.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.430
These were places that in your
local area you could get together

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:57.090
with deaf people and get together
to talk with each other directly

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.630
in American sign language
but then with the advent

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.970
of technology especially with
the VPs we don't get together

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.210
and socialize at the
deaf clubs anymore

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.970
and so clubs are waning
across America.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:16.940
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: The deaf
clubs were very popular,

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.370
every weekend everybody
went to the club.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:22.670
If you're in different state,

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:26.290
a different town you found a
deaf club and you went there.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.630
Everybody knew where they were,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.910
it was where the community
was centered.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.920
And more and more of them have
been closing; I'm not sure if it's

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.020
that the people just
aren't interested any longer

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.220
or if the technology is sort
of replacing that connection.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.140
People used to go to the club to
catch up on what was going on,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.200
what's happening in your
life, what are we up to,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.500
and what are we not up to?

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.510
Now we've got email, we've got
videophones, we've got texting,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.860
we've got all these things.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.460
All those connections may
be replacing some of that.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.490
The organization still there for
a lot of deaf seniors, the NAD,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.560 position:56%
the National Association of the Deaf
is also still there but it is sad

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.570
to see a lot of that sort of
culture base disappearing.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:16.230
&gt;&gt; I know before like in World War
II there were, everybody went off

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.490
to the war, everybody except for
the deafened, the deaf Americans.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.530
We stayed here and we were
actually housed in machinery

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.600
in fact factory type of
buildings and assembly lines.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.320
The noise didn't bother
us and so that was a time

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.360
that we were all able to
get together and that was

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.200
where a sense of community began.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.710
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: And so
and I think that that's

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.210
where you're saying the deaf
clubs got to start, yes.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.190
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So let's look
ahead and talk about the future

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:58.770
and what you would like
to see in the future.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.240
And we'll entertain questions
from the audience as well.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:15.120
&gt;&gt; Specifically with education and
Gallaudet's still going strong.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:21.010
We understand that cochlear
implants have had an effect

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.330
and now children are growing up
in complete mainstream schools

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.430
and with cochlear implants.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.850
So kids aren't growing up
with that, with signing.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.290
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Is that
a concern that you have

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.550
about the children coming up

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.120
and them not learning deaf
cultures, is that your concern?

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.420
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:54.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; This may be a little unrelated
to telecommunication but I would say

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.320
that captioning on TV
has been really great.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.120
That technology actually
helped us improve our English

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.780
and our comfortability
with written English.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.900 position:56%
And we're finding out that
second-language learners of English,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.310
immigrant communities coming in to
learn the English have benefited

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.850
from captioning on televisions.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.190
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: In the
current technology as far

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.650
as an affect the future,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.190
I don't know what it's
going to look like exactly.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.800
I know we have the pagers,
we have the videophones,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.340
we have captioning
etcetera, etcetera.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.480
That's left, I'm not
sure to meet our needs,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.410
they're fairly well met I think.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.070 position:56%
I'm sure something new will pop up
then will impress the heck out of us

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:44.440 position:56%
but I've looked on some websites and
videotapes things that are going on,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.760
things that are happening.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.510
I know that a lot of
that is not captioned,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.460
so I'd like to see some sort of
technology to help with that,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.560
some of the like online video.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:03.850 position:56%
I know that FTC is wanting people to
require access for the online videos

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.500 position:56%
and such, they need to have
captions by like 2017 I think it is.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.360
They are working on that to
perhaps bring the deaf people on up

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.240
to on par with the hearing
folks watch those videos.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.360
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: I've just
remembered that we used to talk

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.040
about the vlogs, video logs,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.080
kind of like what hearing
people use as blogging.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.850
There's a lot of the deaf people
using logging or vlogging nowadays.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, anytime I want to
make announcement to talk

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.570
about current events, a lot
of the vlogs are being made.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.630
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: The sign for
the vlog is this, video log.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.520
&gt;&gt; You can use that
for announcements,

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.830
you just record yourself
and your signing.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.210
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Or you get a lot
of complaints and people talking

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.550
about the hot topics on vlogs.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.060
&gt;&gt; Or jokes, I mean it can
be something more neutral.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.930
&gt;&gt; It gets pretty thick so
I used to avoid vlogs a lot.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.490
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Any other
questions about the future,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.140
how much you think technology
will do as time goes forward?

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:22.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think the new technology in the
future will be some 3D technology,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:28.970
you know, they will just
have persons pop up.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.930
He has an imagination.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.650
&gt;&gt; I would [inaudible], I can
imagine, that will be great

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.820
to actually have a person
that your signings to a robot

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.290
or a personal interpreter
assistant when I need one,

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.250
that will be great,
a robot interpreter.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.770
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: The thing
that can follow me around

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:59.910 position:56%
and interpret had an communication
like that because currently if I get

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.520 position:56%
in a situation where I need an
interpret, I have to either find one

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.650
or have more limited communication
or writing back and forth

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:06.950
but if there were something there

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.950
to sign immediately,
that will be fantastic.

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:14.330
There will be here to have some
sort of constant interpreter.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:22.840
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: A question from
the audience, let me repeat it.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.870
When you talk about a
personal robot assistance,

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:34.870
something that might be likely
in the future and I'm wondering

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.850
if they would end up
having their own conferences

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.500
of robots interpreters
getting together.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.760
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: I've seen
research says that they work more

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.780
like sign to speech that
is something that kind

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.670
of watch your sign and some sort
of technology that can convert

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.180
that into some kind
of English or speech.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.460
So that can be sent
to a hearing person;

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.040
that will be very nice
in the future.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.370 position:56%
When that will happen, I don't know.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.100
Money is probably an issue,
developing that sort of thing,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.770
that kind of AI kind of stuff.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:16.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: I've seen that and
I know the people are trying to work

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.550
on that kind of technology
either voicing from sign

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.360
or robots doing sign language.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.470
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: There's
a question about,

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.580
in hospitals using video relay
services for interpreters.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.030
I haven't had a lot of
experience with that.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.930
Has either of you had
experience with that?

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.860
&gt;&gt; No, I know I always
have an interpreter there.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I have seen
that the interpreter

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.830 position:56%
in the video there having a person,
having a little cart that they bring

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.160
around with them with
the camera on it.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.610
A lot of people have seen
that and they just use

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.070
like a Wi-Fi connection to do this
here with the picture the person

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.020
in some of the other
office or something.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.210
But it is nice to use it
in a hospital but a lot

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:12.530 position:56%
of deaf people really when they are
waiting to talk with the doctor need

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.970
to have that interpreted.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.730
So they're running to sign them,
they have these little cart

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.870
on wheels with a laptop
with a camera on it

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.670
and they're dragging it around.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.000
Because sometimes if you
call for an interpreter

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.270
in an emergency will say it takes
a while for them to get there.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.700
So it is nice to have that
option there, I have seen that.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, any other questions
or discussions about technology

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.470
in the deaf community
before we close?

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.980
I guess, Toby I think we're ready
for you to come up and close us out

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.780
and will wait a minute, I think
there is another question.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:37:00.020
&gt;&gt; How large will be
[inaudible] how large [inaudible].

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.430
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Which
model are you speaking of?

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:11.250
It was this wide and this deep
and about that tall so about that

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.540
and then some of them
were table top models

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:21.740
but mine was a full floor model,
that's the one that I remember.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.970 position:56%
And Fred's said they were very heavy

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.150
and there's another
question from the back.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:35.280 position:56%
Does anyone still have an old TTY,
no, we got rid of those Gerald said.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.840
They were so noisy,
you wouldn't want

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.140
to have them, they shook the house.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:51.390
I have something to add, I remember
in the apartment that I lived

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:56.160
in way back when, it was a second
floor and I would make calls

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.560
but then all of a sudden
I realized that someone

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:07.090
on the third floor was using
a ham radio that was kind

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.790
of interfering with the signal.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:14.270
And so later on I found out that
is there was another deaf guy

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.960
that was using a ham radio.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.430
I'm sorry, a hand.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.830
It wasn't a deaf person that was
using it, it was a hearing person

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.070
that was using it on the
third floor that interfered

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.430
with the signal that I was using.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.090
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: and we
all had to stop at eleven,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.590
we couldn't use it after eleven.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.200
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: The neighbors
below complained about the noise

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.430
of the TTY so I had to cut it
off, no calls after eleven.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.700
There's another question.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.430
I guess for Fred.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.920
And I'll repeat the question.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.490
Now, I understand that with video
phones, you can't use a video phone

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.060
from one room to another?

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:18.220
&gt;&gt; With the FCC regulation
limits that.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.930
If you're in the same
room with the deaf person,

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:25.080
you should just bring
an interpreter in.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.660
The issue is, they
decided to play it safe

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.260
and require that through the FCC.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.240
If a person is calling
through a video phone you have

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.650
to be somewhere else, you
can't be in the room with them.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.690
If you're in the same room that
is not allowed, it would be nice

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.590
but if you're going to be

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.100
in the same room together you
should have interpreter there,

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.400
is their feeling.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:57.970
The FCC's regulation is
going to eat into their money

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.210
that they are collecting
to pay for that service

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.830
if they're placing people
having interpreters on-site.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because that
services is covered

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.210
by VRI Video Relay Interpreting,
not Video Relay Service,

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.460
remote interpreting not VRS.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.930
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Alright, any.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.300
You would ask the question again?

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.410
So what about personal
communication in a real-life time

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.600
on the video phones or texting,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.970
would you prefer simultaneous
communication?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.240
Excuse me, let me repeat
the question.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.520
You can repeat the question, Fred.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If you have like a cell phone
and a mobile device and you are able

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.450
to put that app up, is
that not the same thing?

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.770 position:56%
Can you use that through your phone?

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.060
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: You have to use
the Wi-Fi if you're really here

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.760
in the building, you
can't get a good signal

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.790
and the Wi-Fi does
not really allow that.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:42.130
So when you're outside of
the Library, you get a signal

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:46.130
that you can use, fine, you
make those calls through an app,

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.360
through a relay service
whatever on your phone.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.580
But when you're inside the Library
you don't get very good signal,

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.410
so the Wi-Fi does does not
allow that kind of bandwidth.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:10.590
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So we need to
repeat the question for the person.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.600
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Okay, alright,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.450
we'll go back to asking
her question directly, so.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:26.130
&gt;&gt; Fred Pickering: I think what
she is saying and correct me

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:34.230
if I'm wrong, when we we're
here at work coworkers,

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.640
if you need an interpreter you
can't get an interpreter working

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.440
with coworkers.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.430
Can I use the video phone there
on my cell phone, make that easier

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:50.160
to do that and if you're
in the same room, you mean?

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.610
I understand what you're
talking about now.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.270 position:56%
Whether it's a videophone on your
desktop or videophone on your phone,

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:05.550
on your cell phone,
it's the same rules.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:14.370
So the videophones, it is
not permitted to do that,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.190
you're not going to be
able to, you can't use them

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.760
in place of an interpreter.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:28.930
So that's a good question,
I don't believe so.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.140
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: So we have
about ten minutes left.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.620
And other follow up questions?

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.880
Any additional questions?

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:44.550
&gt;&gt; Can I ask about the blogging
that he was speaking of earlier,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.760
is there a method for transcribing
that which is being spoken

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.050
in the sign language for
those who [inaudible]?

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.920
&gt;&gt; Well, it's like, you know,
when it's in words and in English,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.890
we don't have captions so now you
kind of know what's like for us.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.180
&gt;&gt; I guess, you know,
there is a discussion

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.550 position:56%
about whether video sign
communication should have captioning

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:23.140
in English and people in
the audience are saying

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.630
that there are some video logs
that they will add captioning

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.650
but they have to, this
is Fred speaking.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.200
They have to definitely be prepared
to have the transcriber ready

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.190
and to have the technology ready
to put the English captions

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.730
on a video communication.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.030
But that's a really good point.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.390
Thanks for bringing that up.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.780
Alex speaking [inaudible].

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.410
Anything else before we close here?

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:50.170
&gt;&gt; Can I ask one follow
up to that [inaudible]?

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.470
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.750
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering, there's
the availability of like,

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.450
for example with virtual
reality where they used

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.540
to have the glove that
use to [inaudible]?

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.710
I'm wondering if that
would be something

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.760
that they should approach
for transcription.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:24.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Possibly, so in other words a
person doing video on their computer

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.830
for persons that understand the
English they can have it translated

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.570
into German, Japanese,
Greek, things like that.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.130
You can do that with the written
language there on your computer

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:42.980
but I'm not sure how that applies
[inaudible] spoken language

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:48.020
but if you have gloves or something
like that you might be able

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.120
to be aware of where you are
and what you doing in space,

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:59.020
but the signing itself how
your hands are in space,

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:06.140
it should be able to capture
that but as far as translating

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.970
that into an English written
English thing I don't know

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.270
that the technology is there yet.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:19.610
So what if I'm signing something,
I'm not sure that you'll be able

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:23.050
to translate that specifically
into an English phrase

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:27.630
but facial expressions,
body language,

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.540
all that sort of stuff would
be lost in the translation

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.890 position:56%
which is a big part of the language.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.190
So people reading sort of reading
my behaviour, reading my emotions

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.140
that maybe something
that comes later.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.130
&gt;&gt; Alex Richey: Alex speaking,
yes facial expressions

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.960
and grammar is very
important not just the hands.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.150
Okay, Toby would you like to say
something else as we close out?

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.450
No, thank you.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.400 position:56%
So Alex is saying thank you everyone
for on behalf of the Library

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.910
of Congress Deaf Association
for coming out to this program.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.900
I think it's been very interesting
and I hope you enjoyed it.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.550 position:56%
And I hope you enjoyed this program,

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.330
and we'll see you at
the next program.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.630
Thank you everyone.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:11.860
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
