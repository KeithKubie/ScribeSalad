00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we know a little bit
about the imaginary unit i,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.091
let's see if we can simplify
more involved expressions,

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:08.340
like this one right over here.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.920
2 plus 3i plus 7i squared plus
5i to the third power plus 9i

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.787
to the fourth power.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:18.120
And I encourage you to pause
the video right now and try

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.680
to simplify this on your own.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.685
So as you can see here, we
have various powers of i.

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.310
You could view this as
i to the first power.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.090
We have i squared here.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.060
And we already
know that i squared

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.330
is defined to be negative 1.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.820
Then we have i to
the third power.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.971
I to the third power would just
be i times this, or negative i.

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.720
And we already reviewed
this when we first

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.140
introduced the imaginary
unit, i, but I'll do it again.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.080
i to the fourth power is
just going to be i times

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.170
this, which is the same
thing as negative 1 times i.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.330
That's i to the third
power times i again.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.100
i times i is negative 1.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.690
So that's negative 1 times
negative 1, which is equal to 1

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.710
again.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.220
So we can rewrite this
whole thing as 2 plus 3i.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510
7i squared is going
to be the same thing,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.950
so i squared is negative 1.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.280
So this is the same thing
as 7 times negative 1.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.490
So that's just
going to be minus 7.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.660
And then we have 5i
to the third power.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.515
i to the third
power is negative i.

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.475
So this could be
rewritten as negative i.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:37.320
So this term right over here
we could write as minus 5i,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.640
or negative 5i, depending on
how you want to think about it.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.080
And then finally, i to the
fourth power is just 1.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.660
So this is just equal to 1.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.960
So this whole term
just simplifies to 9.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.410
So how could we
simplify this more?

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.580
Well we have several terms
that are not imaginary,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.670
that they are real numbers.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.620
For example, we have
this 2 is a real number.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.590
Negative 7 is a real number.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.699
And 9 is a real number.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.419
So we could just add those up.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.750
So 2 plus negative 7
would be negative 5.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.930
Negative 5 plus 9 would be 4.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.030
So the real numbers add up to 4.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.570
And now we have these
imaginary numbers.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.400
So 3 times i minus 5 times i.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.230
So if you have 3 of
something and then I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.960
were to subtract 5 of that
same something from it,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.587
now you're going to have
negative 2 of that something.

00:02:38.587 --> 00:02:40.920
Or another way of thinking
about it is the coefficients.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.180
3 minus 5 is negative 2.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.280
So three i's minus
five i's, that's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.000
going to give you negative 2i.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.830
Now you might say, well, can
we simplify this any further?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.290
Well no, you really can't.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.319
This right over here
is a real number.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.860
4 is a number that
we've been dealing

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.540
with throughout our
mathematical careers.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.650
And negative 2i, that's
an imaginary number.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.170
And so what we really consider
this is this 4 minus 2i,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.150
we can now consider
this entire expression

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.320
to really be a number.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.690
So this is a number
that has a real part

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.850
and an imaginary part.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.920
And numbers like this
we call complex numbers.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.090
It is a complex number.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.210
Why is it complex?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.920
Well, it has a real part
and an imaginary part.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.610
And you might say, well,
gee, can't any real number

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.200
be considered a complex number?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.490
For example, if I have
the real number 3,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.650
can't I just write the
real number 3 as 3 plus 0i?

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.770
And you would be correct.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.920
Any real number is
a complex number.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.280
You could view this right
over here as a complex number.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.980
And actually, the
real numbers are

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.140
a subset of the complex numbers.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.260
Likewise, imaginary
numbers are a subset

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.040
of the complex numbers.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.195
For example, you could
rewrite i as a real part-- 0

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:23.480
is a real number-- 0 plus i.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.430
So the imaginaries are a
subset of complex numbers.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.660
Real numbers are a subset
of complex numbers.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.700
And then complex
numbers also have

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.140
all of the sums and differences,
or all of the numbers

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.900
that have both real
and imaginary parts.
