00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.940
SANDERS KLEINFELD: For those
who have not read the book

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.647
or seen the movie yet, you
went to conversion therapy.

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:12.230
GARRARD CONLEY: I'm
not there anymore.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.490
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
And you're still gay.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.690
GARRARD CONLEY: I am
very much gay, sorry.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.710
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Yes.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.950
GARRARD CONLEY: Not as gay
as those shoes, though,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.990
if you can see those things.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.150
Soon to be, though.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.944
I'm going to buy those shoes.

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:26.360
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Reading
that the scenes from conversion

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.660
therapy, were pretty
harrowing, I think.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.659
And what was
interesting to me is,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.030
I don't think I've ever really
seen a lot of portrayals

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.530
in pop culture of conversion
therapy that actually show it,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.180
what it really is.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.680
I think that there's a lot
of ironic, satirical content.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.820
GARRARD CONLEY: Yes.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.320
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I remember
as a college student,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.520
there was this
cult movie called,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.450
"But I'm a Cheerleader."

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.200
GARRARD CONLEY: "But
I'm a Cheerleader,"

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.810
shake your heads
if you've seen it.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.132
Yeah, you should
watch it, it's funny.

00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:57.590
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Which sort
of turns into a campy satire.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.860
And I think really allows
people to sort of gloss over

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.720
that this is really
serious, that these

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.630
are real teenagers who are
going through real anguish.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.710
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.340
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
And I was wondering

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.548
if you could talk a little
bit about your experience,

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.917
and really explain
what that's like.

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:14.000
GARRARD CONLEY: Well, there
was a lot of pushback.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.130
I mean, there was also
like a "South Park" episode

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.590
about conversion therapy.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.080
There was something
else in popular culture.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.009
Oh, yeah, like an "SNL" skit,
where like, I think it was--

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.300
I can't remember who was in it.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.350
But anyway, it's always been
satirical in pop culture.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.290
And even I was guilty
of brushing over

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.460
the subject really quickly.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.130
Like, I would say, hey, I
went to conversion therapy.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.950
It didn't work.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.990
The end.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.090
That was actually
how I sold my book.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.360
I was pitching to my
agent, and I said that.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.530
And she was like, yes, send
me some pages and let's see.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.890
But I think that flippant
attitude protects us

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.430
in many ways, because to
really look back at the past

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.840
and reposition yourself
as that kid who

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.410
is really vulnerable to
the kinds of brainwashing

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.870
in conversion therapy,
it's really hard.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:15.394
And it's not, you know, it's not
fun, it's not sexy to do that.

00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:17.060
And it was something
that I got pushback

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.810
on when I submitted my
draft, from a few people,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.360
and they said, you know,
this feels really depressing.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.630
And I tried throughout
the book to really leaven

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.140
that with some beauty
and with an attention

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.070
to sentences and an attention
to the kinds of beauty

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.280
that was available
to me in Arkansas.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.470
And you know, it's a
very beautiful state,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
if you just ignore a
lot of other things.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.380
And like Little Rock
is very interesting.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.350
And their pockets of liberalism.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.340
And I was also very careful
not to stereotype the South.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.930
But it was a lot of
tricky territory,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.550
because there hadn't been a real
definitive account, or at least

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
a literary definitive account,
of this type of therapy.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.020
And the question becomes how
do you make conversion therapy,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.800
with it's like constant
torture, something

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.620
that feels like a story?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.470
Because there seems
to be no story there.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.970
Right?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.540
The story seems to
be, hey, this kid

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.310
got sent to conversion therapy.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.540
It sucked.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.050
He's no longer there.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.270
The end, right?

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.060
That's what you see
whenever you see

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.256
mini testimonies of
conversion therapy survivors.

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:32.630
So I knew from
the very beginning

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.412
that I had to make it dynamic.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:35.870
And the only way
to make it dynamic

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.020
is to make the reader
believe that I believed

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.090
in God at that time, that
I believed in my family,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.560
and that I believed
that I could be

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.400
cured at least on some level.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.080
And once you enter into that
experience, like truly enter

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.800
into it, through the text,
hopefully, the stakes

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.730
become much larger, because
it suddenly feels alive again.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.140
And it was sort of unfortunate
to have to write that book.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.080
Because you're almost
brainwashing people along

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.510
with you through the ride.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.050
Like, imagine that this is not
just completely absurd to you.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.740
Imagine that you grow up
in this situation where

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.656
this was the norm.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.114
Conversion therapy
is easy to mock.

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.709
You can say, like,
wow, they place

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.410
people dealing with
bestiality beside people

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.560
dealing with pedophilia
and homosexuality.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.210
And that's crazy, right?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.180
But how many of you
have heard at some point

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.030
in your childhoods or growing
up someone say, like, well,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.220
if we allow marriage
equality, then they'll start

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.620
marrying animals, right?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.370
There's one step from
the kinds of prejudice

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.370
that you encounter in
some of these places

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.350
and the kinds of prejudice you--

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.650
the literal usage
of that prejudice

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.010
in a place like a
conversion therapy facility.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.720
Does that?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.729
That was a long answer.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.270
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
It's good, though.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.230
I think, one thing
that really hit home

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.060
for me as I was
reading the book is,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.540
like, conversion therapy isn't
the disease, it's the symptom.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.950
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.870
SANDERS KLEINFELD: And
it was interesting,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.770
I was reading a lot of the
coverage and interviews

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.280
you'd given around the book,
and they all focus very heavily

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.092
on your experiences
in Love and Action,

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.800
which is the conversion
therapy facility.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.502
GARRARD CONLEY: Great name, huh?

00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:26.210
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Largely because that's

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.430
the really sensational
part of the book.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.215
But you were only in conversion
therapy for two weeks.

00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:32.840
GARRARD CONLEY:
Technically, and then I

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.040
had six months one and one,
which very different, yeah.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.540
SANDERS KLEINFELD: But still,
like, a relatively short time.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.190
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.523
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I was
reading one interview with you,

00:05:42.523 --> 00:05:45.620
that you did, where you were
talking about like-- people

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.600
were questioning,
like, oh, two weeks,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.690
is that like sufficiently
traumatic to impact

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.470
your entire life, et
cetera, et cetera?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.370
Which, OK, well, first that
infuriated me a little bit.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.970
Because two weeks of
concentrated psychological

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.940
torture seems pretty traumatic.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.940
GARRARD CONLEY: Thank
you for saying that.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.130
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
But the response

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.234
that you gave actually,
which was very kind,

00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:12.650
really resonated
with me, which is

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.200
that, I think you said
something like, you felt

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.390
like you were going
through conversion therapy

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.245
your entire life.

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.500
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.590
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
So for me, I'm not

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.130
from a Christian background.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.610
And I did not go to
conversion therapy.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.270
But I do have 20-plus years
being a homosexual in America.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.370
That really hit home for me.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.680
And I was wondering if you'd
talk more about like what

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.140
it was like growing
up in Arkansas,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.960
what those experiences were
that made you feel that?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.660
GARRARD CONLEY: I'm really
glad you brought up that topic.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.120
Because, for me, I
knew writing this book

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.520
I didn't want it to just
be some insular experience

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.310
that people could throw away
and say, well, that was crazy,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.720
next.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.230
I wanted people to realize
that the roots of this kind

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.810
of therapy was in the culture.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.580
And it's been in the culture
for a very long time.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.280
And the more--

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.380
I feel like-- this is my
armchair psychology brain--

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.450
but I feel like the more
likely you are to completely

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.900
outright dismiss it as
crazy and just like not even

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.970
deal with the reality
of it, the more likely

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.305
it is that you're pushing
something away yourself,

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:17.930
like something that
you've experienced,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.820
or something you're
trying to escape from.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.930
And so a lot of the reaction
I've gotten from my own queer

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.200
community has been, like,
well, that was only two weeks,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.460
I've been through worse.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.865
And it's like, maybe, yeah,
but also, this sucks too.

00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:37.250
They did the same thing about
my rape, which is in the book.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.370
And some people said it's a rite
of passage and all that stuff.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:46.640
But growing up in Arkansas,
it was very mixed.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.710
Because I had a very, in
some ways, ideal childhood.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.660
We had enough money
to feel comfortable.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.420
My dad always ran a business.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.680
They were nice people.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.680
They cared about a
lot of good values.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.280
And until I was 16, when
my father became a pastor,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.640
or started to become
a preacher, it

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.390
felt like everything
was totally OK.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.080
I mean, of course, I
knew that I had feelings

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.640
from like third
grade on, because I

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.110
had a crush on my third
grade teacher, Mr. Smith.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.350
But it was sort of like,
I was able to split myself

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.280
into two people, and to think,
like, there's no problem yet.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.620
And if I just keep
acting the good son,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.180
then everything will be OK.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.429
When my dad became a
pastor, when I was 16,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.340
I remember thinking, like,
OK, nothing has to change.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.635
Because he was
actually a car dealer.

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:41.510
So he owned a car
dealership, and then became

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.390
a preacher, and--

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.180
yeah, draw the connections.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.337
I just wasn't going to
go for the old joke.

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:52.920
That's my cousin
back there, laughing,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.460
because she knows my family.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.650
But yeah, when he
became a pastor,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.430
it was like, OK,
nothing has to change.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.730
But then suddenly, we became
much more fundamentalist.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.720
And I would even go so far
as to say a bit fanatical

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.770
in our family.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.560
And my father, like when
we would go to a movie,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.840
for example, that
wasn't G rated,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.720
if there was like a curse
word, he would walk out.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.060
And we'd be like, oh, OK.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.520
And so, within
that atmosphere, he

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.260
was scrutinized very much for
how he handled his family.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.455
You know, it's a very
patriarchal system

00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:30.080
in that church.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.750
And so, if your
child or your wife

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.300
is not in line with
your beliefs, then

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.160
suddenly something's wrong.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.310
And he did something wrong
if that's the case, right?

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.570
So it's like the father has
to control the whole family.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.980
And suddenly there
was this new pressure.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.660
You know, I had a girlfriend.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.790
When that didn't work
out, it was like,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.627
I don't really know what to do
to prove that everything's OK

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:54.710
and there's nothing wrong.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.259
And then the events
of the book happened.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.550
And it all sort of spirals out.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.950
But growing up in
that environment,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.710
there was a casual
homophobia and racism

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.360
that I generally encountered,
even in church spaces.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.180
I remember, I was
sitting in Sunday school,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.700
and I think I was like 15.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.010
And this guy came
in, and he said,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.160
there's going to be a
Pride parade in somewhere,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.870
I can't remember, like
Fayetteville or something.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.110
And we need you to
sign this petition

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.720
to show that you
don't agree with this.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.320
And it was being passed around.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.590
And I remember being old
enough to realize, like,

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.422
if I sign my name to
this thing, I'm just--

00:10:37.422 --> 00:10:38.880
I don't know what's
going to happen

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.100
to me, because I'm a liar.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.020
And it feels wrong.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.360
But also, if I don't sign my
name and everyone's looking

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.790
at me, I'll be revealed.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.010
And so, there was a
lot of that going on.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.690
I remember, just to speak
directly to your question,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.680
during the Matthew Shepard
news cycle, which you probably

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.770
all remember, Matthew Shepard
was beaten and left for dead

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.670
for being gay.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.110
And there are people
in the church--

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.190
and I'm not saying all people,
but all it takes is one person

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.660
to say this--

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.900
and I remember, one
person said, well, I mean,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.610
didn't he kind of deserve it?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.490
Like, if you're
just flaunting it?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.340
And so those
things, those things

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.040
that you hear as
a child, you don't

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.870
have to go through
conversion therapy for that

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.560
to do a number on you.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.560
Because if you hear that,
and you're growing up,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.950
and you know that you're
just like Matthew Shepard--

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.920
I mean, you would be lucky
to be like Matthew Shepard.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.850
If you hear that, and you
know that that's the result,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.840
then that's terrifying to you.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.360
So that's one of
my big messages,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.490
is like, you don't have
to be in a facility

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.690
to be in conversion therapy.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.480
And there's been a
lot of disclosure

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.280
since I've said
those words, a lot

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.070
of emails, a lot of
people coming up to me

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.500
and saying, like, yeah, I
had similar experiences.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.650
And one thing that people
are often wary of saying

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.870
is, like, well--

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.360
they'll say, my experience
was not like yours,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.820
because that was crazy.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.960
But mine-- and then they
tell me what it was.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.840
And I'm like, yours
was too, I'm sorry.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.630
It was equally as
messed up as mine.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.740
So that's one of
my big messages.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.240
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Yeah, I think
one thing, especially about

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.940
your childhood, that was
so moving to me reading

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.390
the book was that you
were trying to communicate

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.720
what you were going through.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.170
But you didn't have
the freedom to.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.990
And you didn't really have
the vocabulary to do so.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.580
So there was so much symbolic
action that was happening.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.440
And I'm guessing
maybe some of it

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.930
is, you are innately a
writer, and you're thinking

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.370
symbolically from a young age.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.540
But I think that also
resonates with queer people

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.930
in general, just having codes
with the way they communicate

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.860
different things.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.100
So I think one scene
that really stuck out

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.180
for me is you became
immersed in video culture

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.690
as sort of an escapism,
became sort of untenable,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.742
and you basically drowned your
PlayStation in the bathtub.

00:13:06.742 --> 00:13:08.700
GARRARD CONLEY: That was
like the hardest scene

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.320
for me to write, actually.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.050
Because I loved--

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.830
I actually really
loved video games,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.480
and still love them to this day.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.660
And like "Final Fantasy" is
always be my favorite series.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.510
And I remember having to
go back into that scene,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.140
and be like, I'm so sad that
I'm drowning my PlayStation.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.320
A lot of-- I think
a lot of actions

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.910
that queer kids do when they're
in this repressed environment,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.880
and I would say any
kid does when they're

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.297
in a repressed environment,
it looks totally insane,

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:38.880
because they're
acting out, or they're

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.660
trying to communicate
something, that they

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.040
don't have the vocabulary
for, like you said.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.440
And so in this one scene, I'd
been escaping from my problems

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.910
through video games
and through literature,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.280
and so I just decide to invite
my parents into the bathroom.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.300
And I just run water
all over my PlayStation,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.610
as sort of a way of
saying like some--

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.760
now I look back, and it's
obviously a cry for help,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.260
saying I'm becoming a zealot
right now, because something

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.820
is wrong in me.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.970
But I felt like by doing
that, that I was sort of,

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.390
I was saying I'm going to
reject this secular world.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.550
To them, it looked
like I was just

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.030
like a really passionate child
who might become a preacher,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.950
like my father, right?

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.840
Like I'm going to reject
the secular world.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.200
I'm going to put away
these stupid toys

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.270
and I'm only going
to focus on God.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.740
And that was sort of like--

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.900
the minute you cut those
connections, you know,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.440
you cut art away from your
life, you cut whatever gets you

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.630
through the day out-- which
I talk about in the book

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.020
as well-- like I stopped
reading secular literature,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.980
because I was told not to--

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.580
that's when you truly go insane.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.400
Because if you do what
Love and Action said to do,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.360
which is to focus only on
your relationship with God

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.390
and read the Bible
constantly, well, like,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.540
there's nothing to bounce
those ideas off of.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.440
And that's how a
cult works, right?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.100
Like, you just are constantly in
a sort of closed-circuit system

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.212
that doesn't actually get
any more information out

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:13.920
from the outside.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.289
And it's terrifying.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.830
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Obviously, there's

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.460
that moment when you're
outed in your freshman

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.450
year of high school.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.860
And then from then on--

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.920
GARRARD CONLEY: College.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.690
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I'm sorry,
freshman year of college,

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.770
I meant, yeah--

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.980
freshman year of college.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.310
And there's this interim sort
of purgatory period between then

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.280
and when you actually set
foot in Love in Action.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.932
And what really
struck me is that--

00:15:38.932 --> 00:15:40.890
and I think you referred
to it as such, as like

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.920
either like a double life or
a secret life, where you're

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.250
in this fairly secular
environment and university,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.630
where you're studying
literature, and just exploring

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.830
culture.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.480
And at the same
time, your parents

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.430
are making you come
home on weekends

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.982
and proselytize
at a prison and--

00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:02.940
GARRARD CONLEY: And hand
out M&amp;M's to prisoners

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.320
if they memorized Bible verses.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.500
That was a thing.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.830
Didn't make the movie.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:11.730
It was too weird.

00:16:14.514 --> 00:16:16.430
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I
didn't see the movie yet.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.700
And I'm sad to hear that,
because it's very memorable.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.908
GARRARD CONLEY: A lot of
the stranger things are cut.

00:16:20.908 --> 00:16:26.190
They had to sort of make it
more streamlined for people.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.340
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
But like, I just, I

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.520
felt you being like torn as
I was reading this book, that

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.560
like, your friends at
school didn't really

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.600
know exactly what was going on.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.590
And it's basically
just sort of like

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.260
this schizophrenic
existence, where

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.900
you weren't being authentic in
an either mode of your life.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.650
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah, I often
balk at the term authenticity

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.160
or authentic, because it's hard
to define what that truly is

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.950
and we're like multiple selves,
performativity, et cetera.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.990
But it was like, I think
whenever you are truly

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.810
hiding something that
big from your friends,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.060
and from your family,
and multiple secrets

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.680
in different ways, it does make
you feel a bit schizophrenic.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.109
And I remember,
and in the book, I

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.520
describe it as I would go
to these therapy sessions.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.460
Basically, for six months,
I went to therapy sessions,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.560
conversion therapy
sessions, where

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.170
I had to list off any
sexual fantasies I had.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.980
And then the therapist
would shame me.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.670
And so I would do that.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.270
It was the first time I
was ever talking openly

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.046
about my sexuality, and
being shamed for it.

00:17:39.046 --> 00:17:40.170
And then I would come back.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.870
And I would like go to
the jail with my dad

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.490
and do the jail ministry.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.930
And then I would
go back to school

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:51.990
and study the "Odyssey" and
evolution for the first time,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.870
because my high school didn't
let me study evolution.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.120
They made us skip over it.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.080
So it was this totally different
world that I was living in.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.590
And I think a lot
of people actually

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.890
end up living in those two,
or like making those two

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.840
different worlds work
to a certain extent,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.430
because you have to.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.610
But I remember once
I was out of it--

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.680
it wasn't that
depressing at the time.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.412
I mean, I didn't know
what was happening to me.

00:18:19.412 --> 00:18:21.120
I just thought this
was how you survived.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.840
And I thought everyone did that.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.830
But after that time
period, it was like, wow,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.560
that was really exhausting.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.900
And now I have energy
to do other things.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.990
But I think that a
lot of people continue

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.410
to live their lives that way.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.830
And there are so many
stories of queer people

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.200
who are waiting, sadly,
for their parents

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.440
to die before they
can live openly.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.650
And I think that's a
kind of schizophrenia

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.920
that is often necessary.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.840
A lot of people,
in addition to--

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.240
I'm making it sound like
there's a lot of criticism

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.640
against the book, but there's
not-- but a lot of people,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.070
in addition to saying, like,
two weeks, that's crazy,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.200
they also say you have
Stockholm syndrome.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.270
Why do you still
love your parents?

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.650
And I think that's usually
an outsider perspective.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:13.710
And it's also a defensive move
for a lot of people, to say,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.840
I'm cutting off ties entirely.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.850
And sometimes people
do need to be cut off

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.350
when they're totally toxic.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.370
But for many queer people,
that's just not an option.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.260
Like, I love my family.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.210
They made a horrible mistake.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.350
They've apologized for it.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.200
And it's not perfect,
but I still love them.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.380
And I think a lot of us
have that experience.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.230
And because of that, I don't
really hide anything anymore,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.620
as you can see.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.770
But even when I come back home,
there's always a readjustment.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.080
And I think everyone feels
that with their parents,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.352
because their
parents don't accept

00:19:51.352 --> 00:19:52.560
their lives in a certain way.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.200
But for queer
people, it's unique.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.810
It's like, you come
back, and you're almost

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.450
wearing like a new heavy
suit that doesn't quite

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.920
fit you anymore.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.500
And you go back, and your
movements are more rigid,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.090
or you're like worried that
your wrist is too loose,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.800
or that you're going
to say something

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.870
that is going to upset them.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.870
And that's a really
hard life to live.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.370
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Your relationship

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.870
with your mother
throughout the book

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.560
is really interesting, because
at least the impression

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.360
I got is, like,
as you were going

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.630
through these experiences,
there was some part of her that

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.600
knew that what was happening, in
terms of what they were making

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.830
you do, was not right.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.991
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:20:34.991 --> 00:20:36.990
SANDERS KLEINFELD: But
she was torn between that

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.320
and, I think, the belief
system in which she

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.262
had been acculturated, and her
relationship with your father.

00:20:44.262 --> 00:20:46.220
I do think there's a lot
of humor in this book,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:46.880
and there is this--

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.090
GARRARD CONLEY: Thank you.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.070
SANDERS KLEINFELD: --one moment
that really struck me out

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.527
as being, like, it's sort
of like gallows bleak humor.

00:20:51.527 --> 00:20:53.110
GARRARD CONLEY:
There's a lot of that.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.484
SANDERS KLEINFELD: You sort
of like set up this book club

00:20:55.484 --> 00:20:57.271
with your mother,
where you gave her

00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:59.520
a book to read so that she
could learn more about you.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.490
So you gave her "The
Picture of Dorian Gray."

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.470
And I have to look up
the name of this book.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.420
She gave you this book.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.360
It's like it's this ex-gay
track, "Where Does a Mother Go

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.520
to Resign," which really details
a conservative fundamentalist

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.390
mother's struggle to basically
cure her son of homosexuality.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.060
GARRARD CONLEY: That was a
very popular ex-gay book.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.160
It's still sold on Amazon.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.540
Crazy.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.210
SANDERS KLEINFELD: So, yeah,
I imagine you sitting there,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.130
and it's like we
trade books, and then

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.110
we have this
discussion, and there

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.470
doesn't seem to be too
much common ground there.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.725
But there was something
very touching about it.

00:21:34.725 --> 00:21:36.725
GARRARD CONLEY: My mom--
like yeah, my mom and I

00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:39.440
have always had like a
weird, quirky relationship.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.530
I mean, I always say, she--

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.800
like she stands out
way more than I do

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.180
as someone who is flamboyant.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.750
And she wears-- she always hates
it when I compare her to Dolly

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.350
Parton, but--

00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:54.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.910
You know, big hair, lots of
jewelry, like big fluffy,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.480
blouses, with like
ruffles and lace.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.410
So she doesn't really fit the
traditional preacher's wife

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:11.450
look, unless you're
watching TBN or something.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:16.340
But she-- I mean,
she married at 16.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.340
She had like one
year of college.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.910
And then she dropped out to work
with my dad at a cotton gin.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.640
And then she just sort
of became my dad's wife.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.120
Like, she really didn't want
to be known only as his wife,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.630
and she didn't want to be known
as a preacher's wife really.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.660
So there was always kind of
a struggle with her as well.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.040
And we shared this really
unique relationship,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.040
where we were honest with
each other, until about 16,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.290
when my dad became a preacher.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.890
And it just felt like the
worst rupture in my life.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.810
Because I was so close to her.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.510
And she was the one that took
me to conversion therapy.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.300
My dad basically
like put it off on us

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.630
to do it while he was getting
ordained as a preacher.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.150
And so she would she drove
me to Memphis, Tennessee.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.470
And she would drive
back to the hotel.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.300
And I didn't learn
this until later,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.040
but she would just
lie down on the bed,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.770
completely in her
makeup and her clothes,

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.880
and like pull the comforter
up and cry until it

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.950
was time to pick me up.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.730
Then she would fix her makeup,
pretend like everything was OK,

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.620
and then take me
back to the hotel.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.570
And, you know, that's--

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.280
something was up
with her as well.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.780
Like she could see
every time that I

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.030
would come back that I
was not the same person

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.190
that she once knew.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.910
I was becoming bitter, mean,
resentful in many ways.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.220
And so I think it was like, at
some point-- well, we escaped--

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.350
we weren't supposed
to see any movies,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.209
or go to any restaurants,
or any secular spaces,

00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:50.000
but at one point she
took me to the Peabody

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.740
Hotel, which is this really
fancy hotel in Memphis.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.520
And we had this really
nice Italian meal.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.140
And she says to me--

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.240
like, you can't
make this stuff up--

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.060
she was like, I've
got this great idea.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.226
She's like trying to have just
normal conversation with me.

00:24:08.226 --> 00:24:09.350
And I was like, what is it?

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.290
And she was like,
preacher's wives gone wild.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.970
And I was like, how
did you just say that?

00:24:19.382 --> 00:24:20.840
But that was the
type of person she

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.560
was when she was able
to be that person.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.630
And so, it was like we
got this taste of what

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.279
it was like to be normal again.

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:30.320
And then when I went back
into therapy, you know,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.220
that sort of helped me to
realize that this was crazy

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.840
and it was tearing us apart.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.640
And when I did go
back into therapy,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.300
and I was asked to sit
across from an empty chair

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.770
and yell at my imaginary father
and say that I hated him,

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.990
it was like, well, first of all,
my mom and I are falling apart,

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.070
and now they want
me to hate my father

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.150
as part of their like
Christian ministry, which

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.100
seems a little insane, right?

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.010
There's only so much
cognitive dissonance

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.620
you can take before
something breaks.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.770
And so my mom, you know,
seeing my mom be happy again,

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.670
plus seeing this sort
of therapy for what

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.420
it was, that's what
really got me to call her

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.010
and get me out of there.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.330
SANDERS KLEINFELD: And she
did, she pulled you out.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.260
GARRARD CONLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.468
SANDERS KLEINFELD: It's this
sort of the thing, where

00:25:23.468 --> 00:25:27.110
you made the first step,
but you needed someone

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.650
to actually drive
you out of there.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.475
GARRARD CONLEY: Well,
if she had said--

00:25:30.475 --> 00:25:31.850
I mean, I think
about this a lot.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.560
If she had said, hey, maybe we
should give this a second shot,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.700
I would have said
yes, immediately.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.610
But instead, I made
that first move,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.340
and she made the second move,
and she didn't look back.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.310
And that's what
counted, you know.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.640
Like, the fact that she never
questioned it after that point

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.520
is really phenomenal,
considering how many times

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.470
I questioned what I was doing.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.020
My mom didn't have any
doubt about whether or not

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.550
it was hurting me.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.400
SANDERS KLEINFELD: So
changing gears a bit,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.370
just sort of more like a
literary geek question.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.250
I was really fascinated
by the narrative structure

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.890
that you chose for this book.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.310
Because you read
a lot of memoirs

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.370
and they're very,
very chronological,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.510
sequence in time.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.759
GARRARD CONLEY: Present tense.

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:18.980
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Yeah, present
tense, start here, end here.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.800
And at first, as I
was reading the book,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.390
it was a little disconcerting.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.640
You were basically
jumping back and forth

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.280
through time at these
various waypoints.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.710
So starting in
conversion therapy,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.360
jumping back to end of
high school, to college.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.690
And there were certain points in
which it was unclear sometimes

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.330
whether this happened before
you were outed after you outed,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.750
that sort of thing.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.810
And as I was reading
it, it was frustrating.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.770
But as I look back and think
about it, it actually, I felt,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.290
was incredibly impactful.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.430
Because it felt like how
we experience memory, which

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.980
is just sort of like
mental connections

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.070
that are not always sequential.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.200
I'd love to hear more
about your thought process

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.400
about how you structured
and organized the book.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.775
GARRARD CONLEY:
Well, a lot of it

00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:09.470
was just limitations,
because I'd only written

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.540
short stories at this point.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.730
And I didn't ever want
to write a memoir.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.265
I was like memoir
is the trashy genre.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.760
It's the one, people who can't
actually write, write memoirs.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.100
But I sort of wrote
them in chunks,

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.530
like they were their
own standalone thing.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.620
So if you read the
chapters that are titled,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.260
they could technically
be excerpted and used

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:33.860
on their own.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.644
So that's how I started.

00:27:38.644 --> 00:27:40.310
And then, of course,
my editor was like,

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.750
do you want to keep it that way?

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.020
And I said, I don't know.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.180
But then I thought about
how each activity that's

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.670
described in the
therapy sections

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:55.730
leads into a sort of extended,
very extended flashback

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.790
and sort of shows you
where that idea came from.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.806
So for example, there's
this thing called a genogram

00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:04.430
that they made us
do, which is actually

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.510
used in regular therapy
sessions sometimes.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:12.900
But in this case, it was used to
identify the sin in our family.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.350
And so we had to put down
any drug or alcohol abuse.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:21.115
But in addition to that, like
abortions, or impure thoughts,

00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:21.990
and things like that.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.555
So we had to look at
that, and say, well,

00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:25.930
that's why we're
here, that's why

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.370
I'm gay, which is crazy, right?

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.530
But I decided to juxtapose
that with my actual family life

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.490
and where my relationship
with my father was really

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:42.230
and what it looked like, to
sort of push against the really

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.660
unhealthy narrative
that I was given.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.960
So each time I gave another
Love and Action section,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.790
I would always try
to like juxtapose it

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.860
with something that
played with it,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.180
or queered it, or
made it unusual.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.200
And I used a quote from
Foucault. I'm a Foucault whore,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.120
I guess.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.840
Sorry, I'm one of those.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.740
But there's this
quote from Foucault

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.330
that I want to actually--
wow, it's upside down again.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.147
I wanted to actually
quote, because I think

00:29:14.147 --> 00:29:15.230
it's a really great quote.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.440
And it's what sort of guided
the writing of the memoir.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.980
I think theory can be
used to guide writing.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.570
I know that's controversial.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.750
"Rules are empty in themselves,
violent, and unfinalized.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.920
They're impersonal and can
be bent to any purpose.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.080
The successes of
history belong to those

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.390
who are capable of
seizing these rules,

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.520
to replace those who have used
them, to disguise themselves

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.060
so as to perfect them,
invert their meaning,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.220
and redirect them against
those who had initially

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.390
imposed them."

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.130
Which was the whole
point of the book.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.520
So like to take the version
of Christianity that

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.300
was used against me
and then to actually

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.440
use what I thought was the
correct form of Christianity,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.700
which is built on compassion,
perfect that, and then use

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.010
that against people who'd
initially imposed that rules

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.420
against me, that was my goal.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:13.580
And so, that's why there's
a constant struggle

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.340
in the book between
what's being told to me

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.620
and what was my reality
before I got there.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.660
And that, then,
informs my decision

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.100
at the end of the
book, to leave.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.270
Because you, as a reader,
have witnessed my family.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.790
And you've seen them
in their complexity.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.260
And so, when they say, hate your
father, like, you as a reader,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.800
like I wanted to
also, but I can't.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.800
And so you begin to
understand exactly what

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.260
that situation felt like.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.039
That was only way I
knew how to do that.

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:47.330
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I think
it was very, very effective.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.350
I'm curious, like, there's
a lot more queer literature

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.210
out, which is wonderful,
than there was at the time

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:54.710
you were--

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.086
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:30:56.086 --> 00:30:58.210
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Like it
feels like distant past,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.500
but it's like 15
years ago or so.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.170
Like, I think back to
late '90s, early 2000s,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.730
there was not a whole lot--

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.740
GARRARD CONLEY: There
was Edmund White.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.240
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
--in pop culture.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.290
Yeah.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:12.890
So I'm curious, like
film, books, television,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.507
what inspires you in--

00:31:14.507 --> 00:31:15.340
GARRARD CONLEY: Now?

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.639
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Yeah, now.

00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:18.680
GARRARD CONLEY: It's still
tough for queer people

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.000
to get published.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.940
You still get told, like, you'll
only make this amount of money,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.231
because it's a queer book,
which is a ridiculous thing,

00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:26.780
but people will say it.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.690
But we live in a time
when there's just

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.710
a lot of gray
literature happening.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.250
And my good friend
Garth Greenwell,

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.010
who wrote this beautiful book
called, "What Belongs to You,"

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.930
he's really a big
influence for me.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:43.610
Because I met him,
I guess, three years

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.620
before I started
writing this book.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.290
And it was like, he'd
only had one small chat

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.490
book out at that point.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.140
He didn't have
like a big career.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.760
He got all these great reviews.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.432
But at the time, it was like
meeting this like superstar.

00:31:58.432 --> 00:32:00.390
No one else knew who he
was really at the time.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.130
But I felt like he
was a superstar,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.360
because he'd written this
really, really gay book, that

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.350
was like just unapologetically
gay and really well written.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.590
And written like the best
literature that's ever existed.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.975
And I just remember being
like, somebody did it.

00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:16.850
They actually did it.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.660
They didn't make it cheesy.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.780
It wasn't like stupid.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.280
You know, like, you look on--

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.590
I keep mentioning other
brands while I'm at Google,

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.070
and I feel nervous about that.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:32.240
But you look on Netflix, and
you see all of the gay movies,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.390
like 75% of them
are cheesy, right?

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.770
They're like, I
would never watch

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.790
that, it's not a good movie.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.690
And that's what I felt
for so long about queer

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.180
books or straight people
writing about queer people.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.749
It was always sort
of in this weird--

00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:47.540
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Pandering, almost, yeah.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.550
GARRARD CONLEY:
Yeah, and so here

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.400
was somebody who'd done that,
and did it for the first time,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.390
I thought, really well.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.687
And so it really inspired me
to just write this book the way

00:32:58.687 --> 00:33:00.770
it was supposed to be
written and not really think

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.610
about anything else.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.990
But other than that, I'm trying
to think of what I've really

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.150
liked recently.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.850
Well, everyone should go to
"The Favorite" right now.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.990
That's an amazing movie.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.100
It's like super
queer in all ways.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.385
And then, I really liked "Pose"
last year, that was good too.

00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:22.760
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Well, I wanted

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.290
to give you an
opportunity to read

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.575
a little bit from your book.

00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:26.450
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.190
So this is when I'm
trying to understand

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:34.540
the connection between the man
who was the director of Love

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.680
and Action, who was
performing this torture on us,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.060
I wanted to understand where
his thoughts and his sort

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.710
of ideology came from.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.930
And I compared it to
my father in this.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.530
So I'm like at the
end of my time there.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.380
"I often thought of the life my
parents had shared before me,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.620
how inevitable it all seemed,
my father the quarterback,

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.960
my mother the cheerleader,
everyone in town

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.610
cheering for their success.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.256
Champagne glasses
held up each year

00:34:02.256 --> 00:34:04.630
on New Year's Eve, the only
night they allowed themselves

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.100
to drink alcohol.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.469
A toast to the next year,
and the next, and the next,

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.600
until finally, it must
have been my mother

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.389
without a glass in hand,
standing before their friends

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.300
on the top floor of
Adam's Mark Hotel,

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.040
toasting to a new
birth that would never

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.949
arrive that first time.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.820
And then there was
me, the boy in whom

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.412
they placed their dreams.

00:34:23.412 --> 00:34:25.370
It was hard to imagine
the degree of their love

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.340
for me, the easy
faith they must have

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.714
placed in God at the moment
of my uncomplicated birth.

00:34:30.714 --> 00:34:33.130
It was hard to imagine how
disappointing it must have been

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.671
for them to figure
out I wasn't quite

00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:37.420
all that they'd hoped for,
a stain on their otherwise

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.100
perfect union.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.914
Just that morning I had
read John Smith's testimony

00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:43.080
at the back of the handbook.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.739
This is the guy
who ran the camp.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.770
One that had suggested we could
all one day follow the path

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.380
many of our parents had
followed and journey out

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.090
of homosexuality.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.090
Smith wrote that he had met
his second wife, Vilene,

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.770
while doing yard work.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.750
How romantic, he wrote.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:02.020
I imagined her in a floppy
sun hat, long sun dress,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.460
catching on her knees, thong
sandals on her pedicured feet.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.530
She must have caught
sight of Smith's dimples

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.930
as he approached his
next weed or stray branch

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.490
with the simple smile of
a child, the smile that

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.500
had wooed so many men
to the ex-gay lifestyle.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.140
A hiss and spray of automatic
sprinklers pivoting rainbows,

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.050
quote, 'She's aware that
my attractions have changed

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.870
in general toward men, but
that I love her deeply,

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.200
and make choices daily to
remain faithful to our marriage,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.850
and have not regretted
that decision.'

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.590
End quote.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.820
Like my father, Smith was
excellent at conversion

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.860
at justifying whatever
sudden mood overtook him.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.070
He had skipped over most of his
former life in his testimony,

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.040
never explicitly mentioning
it in our sessions.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.440
It was hard to
imagine that he'd ever

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.720
been married, the way he
talked about how many men

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.100
he'd been with.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.950
Until I read his testimony,
I had no idea just how vast

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.400
his journey had been.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.540
Quote, 'I had developed an
addictive habit of masturbation

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.450
that carried into my
marriage,' Smith wrote.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.790
In the same way that my father
had condemned everything

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.270
before his calling as rubble,
as fodder for God's greater

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.910
purpose in his life,
Smith had consigned

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.740
every failed act in
his first marriage

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.690
to the sin of addiction.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.370
Rising out of this
sin, Smith now

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.080
believed the higher
power had elected

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.480
him to lead other gays
out of their addiction

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.492
into successful marriages.

00:36:21.492 --> 00:36:23.950
He believed he could do this
because he knew a thing or two

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.850
about the familial
circumstances that

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.780
had contributed to the formation
of homosexual addiction.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.620
My father's story carried
an obvious parallel.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.650
Working with criminals,
thugs, as he called them,

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.750
had compelled him to
begin the jail ministry

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.720
in our small Arkansan town.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.980
Why did good man
turn out to be thugs?

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.740
Because they came from
circumstances like his,

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.230
families in which the alcoholic
father had done something

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.730
brutal.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.000
But what had held their lives
together before the conversion?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.150
Before the A to Z logic of
sin reduced human complexity

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.800
to a syllogism?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.640
What form had their faith
taken, however limited,

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.170
in their long lives
as pre-converts?

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:06.070
Christianity is, among other
things, replete with converts.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.430
Peter renounces his atheism
to become a fisher of men.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.280
Saul becomes Paul on the
road to Damascus, wiped clean

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.310
of a past in which the execution
of good Christian believers

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.110
was his life's work.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.740
But the Bible never shows us the
beating heart of a pre-convert.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.420
Crumple the first
half of the story

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.130
and tossed it in the trash,
all else is distraction."

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.928
Thank you.

00:37:26.928 --> 00:37:27.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.330
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
I also, just to end

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.101
on a more inspirational note--

00:37:37.101 --> 00:37:39.100
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah,
there is another paragraph

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.070
there is like hopeful.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.357
But I was like, I've run
out of my reading time, so--

00:37:42.357 --> 00:37:43.940
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
I just want to read

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.510
one paragraph of something
that really, really resonated

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.980
with me and meant a lot.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.990
And so this is midway
through the book,

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.300
where you're
talking about trying

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.820
to imagine what it's like
to be a straight person

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.514
and to have all
of your desires--

00:38:01.514 --> 00:38:02.930
GARRARD CONLEY:
That's [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:04.564 --> 00:38:06.230
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
You say, "What did it

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.750
feel like to not have to
think about your every move?

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.820
To not be scrutinized
for everything you did?

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.150
To not have to lie every day?

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.930
In my most stubborn
moments, the moments

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.850
that must have accumulated
to such a degree

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.830
that the blond haired
boy distrusted me,

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.330
I told myself that
it must have felt

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.400
really dull to be straight.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.110
When I was my most
stubborn self,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.600
I thought this affliction
is what makes me smarter.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.270
This disadvantage is what
gives me my ambition.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.220
This is what first
inspired me to write."

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.330
And I thought that was a really
beautiful sentiment about where

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.420
we find strength as members
of the LGBT community.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.110
So--

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.740
GARRARD CONLEY: Thank you.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.050
SANDERS KLEINFELD: And
with that, I wanted to-- we

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.640
have about 10 minutes
or so for questions,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.681
if anybody has questions.

00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:47.030
Pass the mic around.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.270
AUDIENCE: I haven't read
your book or seen the movie.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.600
In this talk, you haven't
really talked much at all

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.380
about your peer relationships.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.790
And I'm curious about
that, two aspects of that.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:03.810
One is, did you have any friends
at all who were gay, or--

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.540
I'm talking about
high school mainly--

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.430
who were gay or
at least straight,

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.410
but may be more open,
and warm, and whatever?

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.980
And the other side of that is,
did you take a lot of abuse

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.070
from other peers who may be--

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.240
that not necessarily
knew you were gay,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.040
but may be suspected there was
something different about you?

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.650
And therefore shunned you or
abused you, even, verbally,

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.930
or whatever?

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.550
GARRARD CONLEY: So I had no--

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.520
there was one out person
in my high school.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.290
And he was abused horribly.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.090
But he was very tough.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.000
And I remember seeing that
as an example of, like, wow,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.050
I don't think I really
want to do that.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.150
But even though I didn't
agree with him at the time,

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.550
I was very amazed
that he managed

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.490
to stand up and still wear
what he wore in school

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.940
and act the way he did with
people yelling at him all

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.242
the time.

00:39:57.242 --> 00:39:58.700
But the only friend
that I did have

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.500
in high school that could
be considered to be gay

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.520
was an abuser.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.920
So that was not good.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:14.570
In terms of whether I was made
fun of, before I met Chloe,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:19.730
my girlfriend in the
book, I was basically--

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.300
like no one knew that I was gay.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.830
But I was overweight
and I also just-- there

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.384
were mannerisms that were
a bit obvious at times.

00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:30.800
And I remember, like, for some
reason, I decided to take--

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.450
I think it was
because it was easy,

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.650
I took a shop class for like
two semesters, where you learn

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.345
how to use a bandsaw and weld.

00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:41.720
And I really liked
it, because it

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.678
was like you could do a
lot of work by yourself

00:40:43.678 --> 00:40:44.960
and no one would bother you.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.096
But the guys in there
were pretty terrible.

00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:48.470
And they would
always just like--

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.080
if I didn't have any
stories about someone

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.230
that I was having sex with, even
though they obviously weren't

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.650
having that much sex
probably, they're

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:02.345
in band class for two semesters,
they would just make fun of me

00:41:02.345 --> 00:41:02.970
the whole time.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.970
So it was terrible.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:05.980
But that was the only--

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.800
like, I managed, I
passed really well.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.050
And it's kind of funny,
like people, I'll

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.930
go to like a gay
club, and people

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.300
will sort of stare at
me, like why are you

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.430
not acting like everyone else?

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.890
And I'm like, because
I was trained, sorry.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.940
I'm trying to untrain it.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.760
But I was very good at passing.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.970
And that's why my
family was very shocked

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.650
when I was outed to them.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.330
And I think because
of that shock,

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.270
it made it easier,
sort of, for them

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.640
to go to the church members
and listen to whatever

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.900
they had to say to fix this.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.350
Because they thought I was--

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.016
they thought I was
totally in the clear,

00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:47.600
like two girlfriends,
he still seems

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.040
to be dating another girl.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.910
Everything's going great.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.370
He looks normal.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.780
He's smart.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.772
And then like suddenly
this hits them.

00:41:55.772 --> 00:41:57.230
And it's the worst
thing that could

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.771
have hit them,
because the church was

00:41:58.771 --> 00:42:00.620
so obsessed with the topic.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.822
I mean, it was like,
it was the thing.

00:42:02.822 --> 00:42:04.280
I wrote about in
the book, but when

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.300
I came back from conversion
therapy on a weekend,

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.250
between the two
weeks, my dad-- was

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.600
being ordained as a preacher.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.150
And we had to stand
up on a stage.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.450
And my dad's final question
during his ordination

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.480
was what are you going to do
about the sin of homosexuality

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.730
in the church?

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:24.770
And my dad was like,
I don't believe in it.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.670
And I'm just standing
there, like, OK.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.490
And no one knows I'm
in conversion therapy

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.810
except my family.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:35.067
So, you know, lighter note.

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:36.775
To be fair, that was
an intense question.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.350
AUDIENCE: You mentioned this
question of authenticity.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.060
And then sometimes
there's a narrative

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.170
that runs both ways,
that if you identify

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.420
as part of the LGBT
community, both the secular

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.420
and the religious world
say you can't have both.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.670
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:57.080
AUDIENCE: And so, what have
been your experiences with that,

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.440
in terms of living the way that
you feel, or whoever may feel,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.330
is appropriate to themselves?

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.200
GARRARD CONLEY: Yeah, I mean
there's some really great

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.880
gay Christian writers.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.400
Chris Vines is one person
that I really like.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.440
He wrote "God and
the Gay Christian."

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.510
And that helped my
mom a lot, whenever

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.820
that-- because she was like,
I need to understand it

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.010
from a biblical perspective.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.470
And that really helped.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.870
There's also a lot of churches
that are affirming now.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.440
I mean, not a lot, but
more than there ever were.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.980
So it is possible.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.960
It's not just a myth.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.760
But unfortunately,
in my life, religion

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.950
was used as a weapon against me.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.430
And it's taken me a very
long time to feel comfortable

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.740
being in a church
again, without feeling

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:48.040
some of those flashbacks,
or just really scrutinized.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.790
Even though I know no
one's looking at me,

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.936
it feels like that.

00:43:51.936 --> 00:43:53.810
So that's been a really
hard struggle for me.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.560
And it's something
that I really advocated

00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.320
for in our own community,
is to be sensitive to that.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.530
Because a lot of gay
Christians or LGBTQ Christians,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.000
they think that life is
not possible for them.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.600
And that can result in even more
suicidal ideation, and a loss

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.660
of self, and identity.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.160
So it's important
to show that there

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:20.330
is a multiplicity of lives that
you can lead once you come out.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:25.100
But often, that gets lost
in a very tough battle

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.510
that we're fighting.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.890
Like it's tough when we're
in the age of Mike Pence.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.770
And he's been very anti
LGBTQ for a very long time.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.980
And it's very tough
to say to someone,

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.020
like, let's be
reasonable, there are

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.919
good Christians, who
like us, and our side,

00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:42.710
and are helping us.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.960
And it's hard for some
people to hear that,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.570
because they feel like they're
fighting for their lives.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.250
But one of my messages--

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.940
and often, you know, I
do take hits for this,

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.390
but I always want to reaffirm
the fact that there's

00:44:56.390 --> 00:45:00.020
nothing in Christianity
that is inherently

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.410
anti-LGBTQ, especially if
you look at the passages.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:07.580
And saying something as
simple, on like a big platform,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:13.220
as God does not hate
you, you are not a sin,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.520
even though that seems so weird
that we're saying in 2019,

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.770
it's still very shocking to
a lot of people to hear that.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.700
And so I've tried
to use my platform

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.140
as much as I can to just
be like, you can have both.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.790
Even if I don't have both yet.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.220
You know, my mom's calling,
and she's not pushing anymore,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.620
but she'll call and be like, so
have you gone to a church yet,

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.420
I don't really care which one.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.910
No, Mom, I haven't.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.082
Yeah.

00:45:43.082 --> 00:45:44.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks for sharing.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.140
I was just curious.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.872
GARRARD CONLEY: No, have
you found it difficult to--

00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:50.330
like have you found
a lot of people

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.820
who don't see that the
two are compatible?

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.600
AUDIENCE: Well, it's more
that, I don't [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.519
but I work a lot with
communities of faith.

00:45:59.519 --> 00:46:01.560
And I do interact with a
lot of younger folks who

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.650
are struggling with that.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:06.110
They're saying, I'm being
told that if I choose

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.462
to be out and authentic, I
have to reject this part,

00:46:09.462 --> 00:46:11.920
even though there are aspects
of it that I do want to keep.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.461
And so I was just
always just curious

00:46:13.461 --> 00:46:16.422
to see how people who choose
to continue practicing faith

00:46:16.422 --> 00:46:18.870
can balance it.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:20.330
GARRARD CONLEY: I
think the project

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:26.880
of any sort of liberation is
to create more modes of being,

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.600
like as many as possible.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.510
And we learn that, when you
go from second wave feminism

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.140
to where we are now.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.500
And it's like you can
be any type of woman

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.870
that you want to be.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:42.560
And so I think depending on what
stage of liberation you're in,

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.700
sometimes you have
to sort of protect,

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.940
so you're more intense,
and you're like,

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.320
screw straight people.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.130
And then now, you're like,
OK, you can sit at the table

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.070
again if you be nice.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.700
But there's like a-- so
I try not to judge people

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.650
who are in the different spot.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.950
Because some people
have been really hurt

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:06.110
by what's been used
against them in religion

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.503
and what's been justified.

00:47:07.503 --> 00:47:08.190
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Thank
you so much, everybody.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.160
GARRARD CONLEY:
Thanks you so much.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.110
[APPLAUSE]
