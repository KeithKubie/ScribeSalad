00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.433
And so there's a recent
book called "Predisposed:

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.967
Liberals, Conservatives,
and the Biology

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:07.433
of Political Differences."

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:09.900
It was like, yeah,
let's get some science!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.700
It's like, roll some science
into this conversation!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.800
And it suggests that political
views may be hardwired

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.200
into our DNA, oh my gosh!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.533
And we have the
author of that book,

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.967
political scientist John
Hibbing, standing by live right

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.066
now on video call.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.834
John, are you there?

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:27.867
I am here.
Hello, Neil.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:28.567
Hey!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.033
So John, you operate a
political physiology lab.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.300
That's right.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.967
And you're at the University
of Nebraska at Lincoln?

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:40.967
- That's correct.
- Excellent.

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:44.200
So what is a political
physiology lab?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.667
Well political
physiology is an attempt

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:51.200
to measure how people react
to stimuli without asking.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.533
You just get them
thinking about stuff

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.400
and you get to see
how the brains differ?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.734
That's right, exactly.

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.133
And the simple
thing to do would

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.400
be to show them pictures of
Barack Obama or Donald Trump.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.066
But we actually go the
next step and show them

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.567
nonpolitical images and see
if there are differences

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:05.934
across the political
spectrum and how

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:07.367
they respond to those images.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.734
Ooh.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.200
So what have you found?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.934
Well, our kind
of go-to measure

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.433
is electoral dermal activity.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.900
We know that when the body
is aroused, even mildly,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.700
the sweat glands
open up a little bit.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.266
So this is easier to measure.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.133
And we can see if people
are tending to respond more

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.200
strongly to negative
images, like a picture

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.367
of a bear, or positive images,
like a picture of a loved one.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.867
And we know overall
that people respond

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.533
more to negative images.

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.033
We want to look at the
individual differences

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.400
and see if those
differences correlate

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.734
with political beliefs.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.667
So not everyone has that
same reaction to something that

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:45.867
could harm them, basically.

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.266
Exactly.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.066
Some people respond a lot more
to things that could harm them

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.667
than to things that they love.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.533
Other people respond
about the same.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.133
So it seems to me, if you
were to make a political career,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.367
you could get everyone who
has that sensitivity to vote

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.033
for you by feeding that fear.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.400
There's some truth to that.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.533
And I think where
you're going with that

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.000
is that you might see
some of that happening

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.066
in the political arena today.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.200
No, I wasn't.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.700
No, I- I, no.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.767
[laughs]

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:18.533
So who was more sensitive
to this threat of violence?

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.633
The conservatives are, yeah.

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:21.433
Across the board.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.066
We do a lot of things.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:24.600
For example, we do
things with memory.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.967
We show them a whole
bunch of pictures,

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:28.800
some positive, some negative.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.567
Then we'll do a distracter task.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.200
Then we'll show them a
whole bunch more pictures,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400
some that they've seen before
and some that they haven't.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
And we see who can
remember things.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.200
Liberals and
conservatives remember

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.266
about the same overall.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:44.100
But conservatives remember the
negative images much better.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.734
The liberals remember the
positive images much better.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:47.633
Whoa.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.633
Wow.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:53.767
OK, so did the
brains look different?

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:54.767
Did different parts lit up?

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:55.767
Yeah.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:57.200
We have done some
neuroimaging work.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.100
And it really is pretty easy to
predict who is a liberal, who's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.333
a conservative, simply on the
basis of looking at the brain

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.767
activation patterns.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.100
So it would have been fun to
have this conversation with you

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.734
with an image of your brain
like right next to you

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:12.333
just so we can see what's
lit up or not as you spoke.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.834
I think that's none
of your business.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:14.834
[laughs]
