What's one interview question you ask every prospective employee?

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:08.317
I did employ quite a lot of people in my life

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:10.444
in various positions.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.974
And at the moment,

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:13.284
at this point in time

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.813
that I have my own business

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:19.962
and I'm looking for people to collaborate,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.174
what I really try to sense

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:25.428
is what are their deepest motivations

00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:27.297
because if their deepest motivations

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.766
align with my deepest motivations,

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.098
everything will work.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.392
But no matter how inspiring,

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:37.986
you know, impressive they are,

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:40.177
all the toolbox in the world

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:43.179
cannot replace the right motivation,

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.718
and this is actually what I'm looking for.
