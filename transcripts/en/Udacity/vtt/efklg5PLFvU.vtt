Well, it cost me $20 just to rent the truck, that's just to get the keys. Then I

00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:11.067
paid $2 per mile, so I'm traveling 20 miles and I have to pay $2 for each of

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:16.397
those. So I have my initial fee of 20, $2 for my cost per mile, and then 20

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:21.427
miles, so I get $20 plus $40, which is $60. If you got $60, nice work.
