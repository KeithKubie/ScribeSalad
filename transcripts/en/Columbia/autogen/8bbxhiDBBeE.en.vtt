something to help the Caribbean become
 

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.170
something to help the Caribbean become
more self-sufficient in energy because

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.180
more self-sufficient in energy because
 

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.450
more self-sufficient in energy because
our neighbors there have the highest

our neighbors there have the highest
 

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.120
our neighbors there have the highest
electric rates in the world because they

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:39.130
electric rates in the world because they
 

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:42.380
electric rates in the world because they
have to import all their energy

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:42.390
have to import all their energy
 

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.880

virtually every island in the Caribbean
 

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.980
virtually every island in the Caribbean
could be completely self-sufficient with
