00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.774
- [Tutor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:04.426
is see if we can solve
the differential equation,

00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:07.287
the derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:09.370
is equal to x times y,

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:11.824
pause this video

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.484
and see if you can find
a general solution here.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.580
So the first thing that
my brain likes to do,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.749
when I see a differential
equation is to say,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.780
hey, is this separable
and when I say separable,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.420
can I get all the ys and dys on one side

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.889
and all the xs and dxs on the other side?

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.153
And you can indeed do that,

00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:33.381
if we treat our differentials like,

00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:35.982
if we could treat 'em
like algebraic variables,

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:37.666
which is fair game, when you're dealing

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.502
with differential equations like this,

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:42.419
we could multiple both sides by dx,

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.529
so multiple both sides by dx

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:47.838
and we could divide both sides by y,

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:50.750
let me move this over a little
bit, so we have some space,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.764
so we could also multiple
both sides by one over y,

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:58.151
one over y and so what that does is

00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:02.548
these dxs cancel out and this
y and one over y cancels out

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:04.995
and we are left with, let
me write all the things

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.892
in terms of y on the
left-hand side in blue,

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:08.809
so we have one over you

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.729
dy is equal to,

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:15.234
and then I'll do all this stuff in orange,

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:16.922
we have is equal to, we're just left

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.247
with an x and a dx, x dx

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.309
and then we'll wanna take

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:25.670
the indefinite integral of both sides,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.553
now what's the
anti-derivative of one over y?

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:32.076
Well, if we want it in
the most general form,

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:36.660
this would be the natural log
of the absolute value of y

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.117
and then this is going to be equal to

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:41.117
the anti-derivative of x

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.879
is x squared over two

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:46.947
and then we wanna put a
constant on either side,

00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:50.343
I'll just put it on the
right-hand side, plus C,

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.224
this ensures that we're dealing
with the general solution,

00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:55.671
now if we wanna solve explicitly for y,

00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.009
we could raise e to both sides' power,

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.062
another way to think about it is,

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:02.838
if this is equal to that,

00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:05.040
then e to this power

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.972
is going to be the same
thing as e to that power,

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:10.578
now, what does that do for us?

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.294
Well, what is e to the natural log

00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:14.652
of the absolute value of y?

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:16.283
Well, I'm raising e to the power

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:18.498
that I would have to raise e too

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:20.511
to to get to the absolute value of y,

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.504
so the left-hand side here,

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:25.940
it simplifies to the absolute value of y

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.509
and we get that as being equal to,

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.754
now, we could use our exponent properties,

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.671
this over here is the same thing as

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:37.753
e to the x squared over two

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.926
times e to the C times e to the C,

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.672
I am just using our
exponent properties here,

00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:48.566
well, e to the C, we could just view that

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:52.639
as some other type of constant,
this is just sum constant C,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.049
so we could rewrite this whole thing as

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.966
C e to the x squared

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.515
x squared over two, hopefully
you see what I'm doing there,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.507
I just use my exponent properties

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:07.978
e dah dah dah, sum of two things

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:10.722
is equal to e to the first thing
times e to the second thing

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:14.510
and I just said, well, e to
the power of sum constant C,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.577
we could just relabel that
as, let's call that our blue C

00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:21.094
and so this simplifies to blue C times e

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:24.054
to the x squared over two,

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:26.842
now we saw this absolute value sign here,

00:03:26.842 --> 00:03:29.509
so this essentially means that y

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:34.445
could be equal to, we
could write it this way,

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:37.445
y could be equal to plus or minus C,

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:43.426
C e to the x squared over two,

00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:48.107
x squared over two,

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:50.719
but once again, we don't
know what this constant is,

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.164
I didn't say that it was
positive or negative,

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.609
so when you see a plus or
minus of a constant here,

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.734
you could really just subsume all of this,

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:59.362
I'll just call this red C,

00:03:59.362 --> 00:04:02.115
so we could say that y is equal to,

00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:05.452
I'll just rewrite it over again for fun,

00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:07.119
y is equal to red C,

00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:12.954
not the Red Sea, but a red C (laughs)

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:16.037
times e to the x squared over two,

00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.329
this right over here,
it's the general solution

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.412
to the original, separable
differential equation.
