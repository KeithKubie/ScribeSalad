00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's go take a look at the big reveal,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for how it actually started.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Up here is our string; we start at characters zero, on line 1, with ' This '.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--now we're on line 1, character 5, with the ' is '.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--we're on line 2, character 11,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we're starting the Left Angle, then the ' b ',

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then the Right Angle, then the ' webpage '.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And to reverse engineer this, you might note--for example--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that you know the Left Angle is 1 character.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If it starts on character 11, and the ' b ' comes right after it on character 12,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
there must be no spaces between them.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Similarly, since the ' b ' is 1 character and it starts on character 12,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the RANGLE, there must be no spaces between the ' b ' and the RANGLE.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So the real trick here is figuring out what happens

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
after the "is" and before the ' b ',

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and knowing that you need these 3 extra spaces

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
ao all the action's happening here.
