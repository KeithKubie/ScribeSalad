00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:02.875
- As we've seen in other
videos, this is a map

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:05.943
of the European possessions,
especially the Western European

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:09.112
possessions in much of
the world as we enter

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:12.529
into the 20th century before World War I.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.312
You see significant
possessions by the French

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.098
not just in Africa but also in Indochina.

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:23.158
You see the British also
have significant possessions

00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:25.491
in Africa, but also in Asia.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:30.922
Germany, Belgium, Italy also
have imperial possessions.

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.319
Now as we go through World War I,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.166
that changes the map of
Europe fairly dramatically

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.480
and we talk about that in other videos

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.854
but some of the major outcomes,
at least when we're talking

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.890
about imperialism is that
the Austro-Hungarian Empire

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.877
gets broken up, changing
the map of Eastern Europe,

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:53.226
the Ottoman Empire gets broken up,

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.452
with much of the Middle
East now under control

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.944
by the British or French
and of course Russian exits

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:03.111
World War I having had the
Bolshevik Revolution in 1917

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:06.699
and is now the Soviet Union.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.859
As we get into the period after
World War I, we start to see

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.815
momentum gather in terms
of independence movements,

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:19.131
in terms of this imperial
structure breaking down.

00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:23.298
In 1922, Egypt becomes
independent of the United Kingdom.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.215
Iraq, which was part of the
Ottoman Empire for centuries

00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:32.750
was put under British
control after World War I

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.081
and in 1932, it gets its independence.

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.575
Then we enter into World War
II, which is an incredibly

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:44.202
traumatic time, not just for
Europe but for the world.

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:46.526
And as we exit out of World War II,

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:50.715
we see further momentum
being gained for the various

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.798
anti-colonial independence movements.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.759
Indonesia, which was
originally a Dutch colony

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.679
but during World War II, gets
under the control of Japan

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.913
as part of its imperial possessions,

00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:08.588
but as we get into August of
1945, the Japanese are bombed

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:12.799
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
effectively ending World War II

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.920
and the Indonesians are able
to claim their independence

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.971
nominally now from the Dutch.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:22.554
Then from 1944 to 1946,
further possessions

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:25.620
that were originally part
of the Ottoman Empire

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.243
but after World War I
became under the control

00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:30.867
of the French and
British, Syria and Jordan,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.199
gain their independence.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.368
Syria from France and
Jordan from United Kingdom.

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:39.951
And then in 1947, you
have the independence

00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:44.102
of the Indian subcontinent.

00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:47.541
This is a particularly noteworthy struggle

00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:50.090
under the leadership of Mohandas Gandhi,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.257
often known as Mahatma Gandhi,
mahatma meaning great soul.

00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:56.442
And it's a peaceful resistance

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.066
that's able to get independence.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.219
Now the subcontinent is partitioned

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.054
into what will become Pakistan and India.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:08.387
For the most part, areas
that were majority Muslim

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.186
became Pakistan and you can
see this region in the west,

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.335
and this region in the
east which would later

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:17.102
get its independence in
1971 and become Bangladesh,

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:18.204
and then for the most part,

00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:22.621
regions that had Hindu
majorities became India.

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:25.322
This wasn't a clean partition
because there were some

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:28.784
territories, princely states,
areas where the majority

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.515
was not clear that
became under contention.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:35.512
Kashmir, even to this day,
is a point of contention

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:37.838
between India and Pakistan.

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:40.304
Much of the Indian
subcontinent was very mixed

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:44.327
with some areas being 60% Hindu
or 40% Muslim or vice versa

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:46.993
so that catalyzed one of
the largest migrations

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:50.663
in human history, the number
of people changing borders,

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:54.516
sometimes becoming quite
sectarian and quite bloody.

00:03:54.516 --> 00:03:56.726
But even after that, India is still

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:59.001
one of the largest Muslim countries.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.750
The founder of Pakistan is
Muhammad Ali Jinnah and India's

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.414
first prime minister and
both of them were active

00:04:05.414 --> 00:04:09.099
in the independence movement,
is Jawaharlal Nehru,

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.834
who will become famous for
the non-aligned movement,

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.168
for newly liberated
countries to not want to side

00:04:15.168 --> 00:04:18.055
on either side of the Cold
War and he actually coins

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:20.318
the term third world
which is now associated

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:22.841
with developing countries,
but when it was coined,

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.679
it meant, we don't wanna be first world

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:27.042
aligned with the western
capitalist countries,

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:28.678
we don't wanna be second world,

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:30.573
aligned with the communist block,

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:34.275
we wanna be independent
or the third world.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:36.981
As we get into the late
'40s and early '50s,

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:41.148
we also see an independence
movement in French Indochina.

00:04:41.984 --> 00:04:45.020
These countries will eventually
become North Vietnam,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.725
South Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia, and a significant figure

00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:53.529
here is Ho Chi Minh who will
become a very prominent figure

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.139
as the French Indochina
War eventually evolves

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.904
into the Vietnam War, bringing
the United States into it

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:04.327
as part of its Cold War
containment strategy.

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:07.798
The 1950s also see significant
independence movements

00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:09.298
throughout Africa.

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:13.685
In 1951, Libya gains independence.

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:17.852
From 1956 to 1958, Tunisia,
Morocco, Ghana, Guinea,

00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:22.822
all gain independence.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.725
Of particular note is Ghana,
originally called Gold Coast.

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:31.556
The first president and prime
minister is Kwame Nkrumah

00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:33.245
and he's known as one of the founders

00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:35.796
of the Organization of African Unity

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.613
and he wanted to see where a
world where as these African

00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:41.898
countries became
independent, they unified,

00:05:41.898 --> 00:05:44.043
seeing that Africa would
have much more power

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:47.875
as a unified entity than
as a fragmented one.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.233
And so he was a major promoter

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.733
of the idea of pan-Africanism.

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:55.159
Now the independence
movements only accelerated

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.810
as we go into the 1960s.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.345
1960 in particular was a year
of many independence movements

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:06.667
but you can see here, most
of Africa was independent

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.417
as we exit the 1960s.

00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.354
In blue here, listed the
French colonies that gained

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:15.259
independence in this time period.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.783
In this salmon color,
the British colonies,

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:21.422
and in yellow, the Belgian colonies.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.350
There would continue to be
change over the next few decades

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.476
but the world starts to look very similar

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.865
to the world as we recognize it today.

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:32.252
Now I'll leave you with a
speech that Jawaharlal Nehru

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:35.437
made in Washington DC in 1956,

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:39.187
which highlights his
desire for nonalignment.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.677
"The preservation of peace
forms the central aim

00:06:43.677 --> 00:06:45.145
"of India's policy.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:47.705
"It is in the pursuit of this
policy that we have chosen

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:50.537
"the path of nonalignment in any military

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:52.938
"or like pact of alliance.

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:56.953
"Nonalignment does not mean
passivity of mind or action,

00:06:56.953 --> 00:07:00.297
"lack of faith or conviction,
it does not mean submission

00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:02.587
"to what we consider evil.

00:07:02.587 --> 00:07:05.055
"It is a positive and dynamic approach

00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:07.116
"to such problems that confront us.

00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:10.630
"We believe that each country
has not only the right

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.682
"to freedom but also to decide

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.190
"its own policy and way of life."

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.659
And this is a big deal because remember,

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.503
he's giving this speech in
Washington DC which would love

00:07:19.503 --> 00:07:23.691
him to clearly align
with the western block,

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.332
with the capitalist countries
led by the United States

00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:28.867
but after working so hard
for their independence,

00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:33.417
many of these nations, like
India, were not eager to lose

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:37.919
their autonomy and realign
with more powerful countries.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.913
To close out this video, I'll
leave you with an interesting

00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:44.046
question or a series of
interesting questions.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:47.696
Why do we see a good chunk of
the world become independent

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:50.499
in the second half of the 20th century?

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:54.879
Was it that the imperial
countries no longer had the energy

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:58.848
or the power or the will
to control these colonies?

00:07:58.848 --> 00:08:01.211
Was it something happened
in the psychology

00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:04.047
of their peoples, they just
went through a traumatic war,

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:05.890
and they realized that
they weren't interested

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.279
in controlling the
destiny of other people?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.451
Was it due to the efficacy
of some of these independence

00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:15.168
struggles, like the nonviolence
movement led by Gandhi?

00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:17.873
Or maybe some of the more
violent independence struggles

00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:21.489
like what we saw in
Algeria against the French.

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:24.639
But needless to say, the
world fundamentally changed

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.207
in this time period.

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:28.478
When we were entering
into the 20th century,

00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:31.607
we had an imperial world,
especially controlled

00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:34.221
by the Western European powers.

00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:38.895
After two traumatic wars,
imperialism comes to an end

00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:42.306
and we see the world as we know it today.
