00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:11.429
On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II,

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.140
scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.099
and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.250
They did this by creating 
for the first time

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.402
a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel:

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:31.460
the nuclear reactor.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.000
Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.449
has led some to bill nuclear power

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.918
as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:48.550
A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.801
to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.720
But rather than dominate the global
electricity market,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.620
nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.540
to 11% today.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.121
And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades.

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.581
What happened to the great promise
of this technology?

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:15.632
It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles,

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:17.621
including high construction costs

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:19.790
and public opposition.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.343
And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges.

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:28.671
Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.123
and a controlled chain reaction

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:35.131
that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei.

00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:39.172
The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.563
bound by a powerful nuclear force.

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:47.832
Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons,

00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:52.253
but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons,

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.311
and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.613
Compared to its more abundant cousin,

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:03.183
a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:07.463
into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products,

00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:09.282
in addition to two to three neutrons,

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.473
gamma rays,

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:12.513
and a few neutrinos.

00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:16.532
During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:20.805
A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons,

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:23.223
and if some of them strike uranium nuclei,

00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:27.713
fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:31.643
If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei,

00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:37.023
more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.644
But inside a nuclear reactor,

00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:43.775
this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:49.084
made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check.

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:50.834
With a controlled chain reaction,

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:55.804
a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years.

00:02:55.804 --> 00:03:00.373
The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power,

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:02.115
but there's a catch that can result

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.267
in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:09.987
It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy

00:03:09.987 --> 00:03:12.856
to be captured by uranium nuclei.

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:17.117
The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out.

00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:21.987
The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:24.884
to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:29.924
to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission.

00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:34.118
Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator,

00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:38.254
but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast.

00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:40.586
To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction,

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:44.087
the concentration of U-235 is enriched

00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:47.766
to four to seven times 
its natural abundance.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:52.078
Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:53.767
through centrifuges

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:59.017
to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238.

00:03:59.017 --> 00:04:03.157
But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235

00:04:03.157 --> 00:04:06.647
up to 130 times its natural abundance

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:11.667
and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:15.448
Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated

00:04:15.448 --> 00:04:19.586
to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:22.287
Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:24.708
goes into speeding up neutrons.

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:29.777
Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products.

00:04:29.777 --> 00:04:34.179
Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant,

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.574
usually purified water.

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:41.808
This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam

00:04:41.808 --> 00:04:43.798
just outside the reactor.

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:46.680
Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.780
but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.468
the meltdown.

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:55.919
If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks,

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.960
or the pumps that push it fail,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.497
the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts.

00:05:01.497 --> 00:05:03.059
During a nuclear meltdown,

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:05.929
radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor,

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:07.948
and if the reactor fails to hold them,

00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:13.218
a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense.

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:16.109
But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high,

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:19.780
containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.899
spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows.

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.289
The radioactive fission products
in these vapors

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.952
eventually decay into stable elements.

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:31.960
While some decay in a few seconds,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.350
others take hundreds 
of thousands of years.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.418
The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:39.829
is to safely contain these products

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:43.870
and keep them from harming humans
or the environment.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.620
Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.031
In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem.

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:52.351
Every one to two years,

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:55.830
some spent fuel is removed from reactors

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.121
and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste

00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.399
and block its radioactive emissions.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.010
The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.670
fission products,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.850
and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.523
This mix must be isolated from
the environment

00:06:15.523 --> 00:06:18.041
until it has all safely decayed.

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:23.682
Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground,

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:25.212
but none have been built,

00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:29.092
and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security.

00:06:29.092 --> 00:06:32.200
How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.112
plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.772
of 24,000 years?

00:06:38.772 --> 00:06:42.584
Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead,

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:46.023
storing them indefinitely on site.

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:50.601
Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel.

00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.023
Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction

00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:57.035
and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs.

00:06:57.035 --> 00:07:00.932
Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment,

00:07:00.932 --> 00:07:15.076
but also a security risk for nations.

00:07:15.076 --> 00:07:18.488
Who should be the watchmen to guard it?

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:21.883
Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:26.044
pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:27.903
inside an atom -

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.113
as an explosive bomb

00:07:30.113 --> 00:07:34.272
and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential.

00:07:34.272 --> 00:07:37.053
But their successors have learned
humbling insights

00:07:37.053 --> 00:07:41.834
about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits.

00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:48.237
Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.
