00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.100
SUZI ESZTERHAS: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.250
So as Peter already
told you, I'm

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.110
a wildlife photographer,
which pretty much means

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.850
I have the best job on
earth, in many ways.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.120
In some ways, maybe not so
great, as Peter mentioned

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.060
the financial side.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.270
But in terms of
adventure and joy,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.890
I've got a pretty good
gig with what I do.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.710
I travel the world
taking photos of animals.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.590
I do this for magazine
publications and book projects.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.730
And my favorite projects
are for in-depth stories

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.050
where I spend time with
one animal, or one species,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.590
anywhere from a few days, to
a few weeks, to few months.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.940
And in the case of
cheetahs, 18 months.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.370
So a lot of my time goes
to spending long hours

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.750
with my subjects, and really
creating in-depth work

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.100
that maybe we haven't seen
before, very rare imagery.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.960
And it's having
these special times

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.140
with animals and long
time with animals that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.624
really makes this possible.

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:19.540
I make my living from a
few different sources.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.309
As I mentioned, I do magazines,
I do books, I also lead tours.

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:24.850
As a wild life
photographer, you have

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.130
to have a lot of
balls in the air.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.920
And whatever comes
down is great,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.670
and you're lucky some things
work, some things don't.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.680
But there's no wildlife
photography career

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.492
where you can just
do one thing anymore,

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:39.450
where you're photographing
for one publication.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350
You've got to have a lot of
different projects going on.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.220
But the one commonality is
that I focus on baby animals.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.060
So I specialize in documenting
family life of wild animals,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.740
and that is something that
I was born passionate about,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.210
according to my mom.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.360
She always says that this job--

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.220
you didn't pick this
job, it chose you.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.690
Ever since I can remember,
this is all I wanted to do.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.949
I don't know what it's
like to live life and not

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.110
want to photograph animals.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.150
I was definitely a strange kid.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.160
I didn't quite fit in school.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.460
I wasn't exactly
popular with the boys,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.260
or stylish, as you can see.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.660
But I was passionate.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.530
I was madly passionate
about animals, about nature.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.540
This looks somewhere
really exotic,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.820
but it's actually a zoo.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.060
But I am dressed for
Safari, just in case.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.600
And I've spent my life dreaming
about places like the African

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.760
Savannah.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.460
And I told my parents
that I was going

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.020
to go live in a tent
in Africa, and I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.390
think they thought I
would grow out of it.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.460
But I never did.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.370
And so, I grew up
in the Bay Area.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.470
I grew up in San Rafael.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.750
And then I went to Boulder
for a couple of years,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.150
and then finished my
school in Santa Cruz.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.060
And Santa Cruz was
a great place for me

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.830
to start off as a young
nature photographer.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.030
I did a lot of local work.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.150
Obviously, I didn't really
have when I graduated college--

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.444
you can't just graduate
college and say

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:17.110
I'm going to be a
wildlife photographer.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.485
It's a bit like
saying, I'm going

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:19.810
to be an actor, or a musician.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.620
You need a day job.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.940
So I worked at the
Santa Cruz SPCA

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.155
as the PR director,
which basically

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.530
meant I got to hang out with
puppies and kittens all day,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.590
which was better than my
previous job of waiting tables.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.820
So I was pretty
happy about this.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.000
And I held this
job for six years.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.470
And in that six
year time, I managed

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.580
to get my schedule to
be four days a week,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.670
and then I would go out and
shoot for three days a week.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.600
And I really, really worked
on my portfolio, mostly local,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.980
at the time.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.730
As I started to work
with local subjects,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.840
I started to realize how
important that connection was

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.570
with the animals,
in terms of focusing

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.670
on one animal in depth,
sometimes one individual,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.680
but certainly one species,
and saw the value in that.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.310
And I started producing
material, again, mostly focused

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.510
around baby animals.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.540
And I started to hear
for the first time

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.591
that you can't make a career
in focusing on baby animals.

00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:25.090
I mean, first of all, you can't
be a wild life photographer.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.820
That's just a pie
in the sky dream.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.580
But particularly, when I
threw in the baby animals,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.110
people sort of pooh poohed it.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.620
Baby animals are not
something that people

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.760
held in wide respect.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.190
It was like, oh, that's for
kids, and you'll never make it.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.930
And so I heard that
from the very beginning.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.340
And honestly, I was so
driven and so passionate

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.726
about my subjects, that
I just didn't care.

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:52.100
I just completely
disregarded it.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.820
I almost like
didn't even hear it.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.220
And that drive-- you
have to have that

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.900
to make it in this industry.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.219
You have to be
completely 100% driven.

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.385
You need that tunnel vision.

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:10.390
You need that ability to not
pay attention to rejection,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.300
and not pay attention to
what people are saying,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.550
and that extreme dedication.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.830
Photographing wildlife
is not always easy.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.370
It takes a lot of
patience, which I'll

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.180
talk about more in depth later.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.080
But it also takes
a lot of skill,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.050
and there's a lot of things
that you wouldn't necessarily

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.250
realize in it.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.010
There's different ways of
approaching different subjects.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.110
Some of the animals,
you have to hide from,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.770
so I started using blinds
a lot, also called hides.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.430
Dressing from camo from head
to toe for certain subjects.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.890
And being in a blind
is really interesting.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.980
You sit in there all day.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.929
Sometimes, you're in a
crunched up a little position,

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:59.720
and you're waiting for
something to happen.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.600
And sometimes, it's hot
and sweaty in there.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.410
It's muddy.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.920
And it's generally
not a fun experience.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.910
So everybody has all these
ideas of wildlife photography

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.490
being super sexy.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.060
You get to go to
all these places

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.060
and gallivant around the world
and you're with wild animals

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.770
all the time.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.478
And the truth of the
matter is, is you're

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.890
doing stuff like this,
sitting in a blind--

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.960
hours and hours of boredom--

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.900
I wouldn't be honest if I
didn't admit that I get bored--

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.020
and waiting for something that
may or may not happen after you

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.120
spent a 13 hour a day.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.330
And then, if you actually think
about what happens in those 13

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.880
hours, you can't always--
sometimes you can read a book,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.380
but sometimes, in
this case, it's

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.510
too dark inside to read a book.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.420
So you sit in there and just
try to get into this zen space.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.730
And working with
baby animals, there

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.000
are particular-- if you're
at a den site, for example,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.985
you can't cause a
lot of disturbance.

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:56.379
So often, you just sort of go in
really very quietly and slowly

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.920
in the morning, and
then you pull out

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.600
when the sun goes down.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.860
And you don't go in and out.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.520
There's no like going in
and out to pee privilege.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.480
So you do things, like carry
around a big, huge, red water

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.010
bottle that is your
pee bottle, that

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.070
is a nice color that you could
never mistake as your water.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.130
This is your life.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.200
This is what you're doing.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.850
You make that mistake once.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.980
You accidentally
drink out of it once.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.090
You never do it again.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.730
You cover things with
stickers-- do not drink.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.330
Various things that you just
don't think about as life

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.820
as a wildlife photographer.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.690
And some of these places that
you go are sort of like these

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.000
legendary-- when I
first went up to Alaska,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.030
and had the ability
to travel, you start--

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.730
you read about working with
these dangerous animals

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.420
on foot.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.210
And grizzly bears can
kill you, and they charge.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.970
And then, you start
sort of realizing

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.430
that yeah, animals like this can
be dangerous, but a lot of that

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.810
is sort of this almost urban
legend, mythical folklore.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.790
Working with grizzly
bears has actually

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.610
been some of the most
peaceful experiences I've

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.980
had working with any subject.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.660
And I learned this
really early on.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.180
Grizzly bears were my
first large carnivore

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.860
working around getting to
know how to work with them.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.210
And I was with a bear
guide who taught me a lot.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.660
He was a bear hunter.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.850
We carried bear
spray, at the time.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.660
And what I realized is, is
that knowing animal behavior

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.929
is 90% of this job.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.140
And this was good for
me, because it was always

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.030
90% of my interest.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.789
The photography
kind of came second.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.750
It was the animals
that came first.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.900
But knowing that actually
part of the skill,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.850
or the majority of
the skill, is knowing

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.820
what these animals might do,
in terms of keeping you safe,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.350
but also in terms
of what they might

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.860
do in getting the
photo the next time,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.530
anticipating what
they're going to do next.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.800
So historically, you'd think,
OK, working with mom and cubs,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.820
with grizzly bears is something
that is quite dangerous,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.427
but really if you
know their behavior,

00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:12.135
you keep your distance,
you're respectful

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.550
and you know signs
to watch for--

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.460
I use a lot of long lenses--

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.310
it can be incredibly
peaceful experience,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.201
where you're not in danger
and they're not stressed.

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:25.200
And that's one of the
most important things when

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.920
I work, particularly since
I work with baby animals,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.060
is not stressing
my subjects out.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.390
Because obviously, this is
a really tender sensitive

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.140
situation when you're working
with animals and they're young.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.440
And some of these
young mammals that

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.670
grow up around people-- this
is a sub-adult grizzly bear

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.560
that grew up around people.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.320
And we have various strategies
when working with grizzly

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.164
bears if they get too curious.

00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:52.830
So you have bear spray
around your belt,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.496
but you don't want
to use the bear spray

00:09:54.496 --> 00:09:56.410
unless you absolutely have to.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.090
So the Bears will come up
and get curious about you.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.480
And they'll kind of try
to sniff your backpack

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.670
or whatever they want to do.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.709
And you, obviously, will
slowly back away and try,

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.250
if you're with other people,
you try to sort of stay together

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.120
as a group.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.082
And then, sometimes,
the bears that

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:17.040
have grown up around
people, they're not really

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.706
easily phased, so you
might do something

00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:21.990
like shake a rain jacket at
them, which makes a loud noise,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.060
and then they usually run away.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.840
Or in this bear's case, he had
heard a lot of rain jackets.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.630
He was not fazed by
rain jackets at all,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.480
so he just kept coming
and coming and coming.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.952
And then finally, I just took
my baseball cap off my head

00:10:35.952 --> 00:10:37.410
and bonked him on
the nose with it,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.880
and that was the end of that.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.260
So a baseball hat
is what it takes

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.240
for this large and dangerous
carnivore to go running away.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.920
So some of the job has
really been dispelling

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.300
a lot of those myths.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.000
And I'm not saying that these
aren't dangerous animals,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.300
but there are very peaceful
ways of working with them

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.160
and coexisting.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.950
One of the other exotic places
I got to go was the Arctic.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.610
This is my first experience
with really extreme conditions.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.970
I went up to document
a climate change study.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.790
And part of that was
actually the scientists

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.230
were darting mothers and cubs
as they came out of their den.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.780
And so the scientist
had a cub that

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.130
was getting a little too cold.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.290
It was tranquilized and its
body temperature was dropping.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.590
And he's like, are you
OK with warming him up?

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.850
I'm like, sure.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.300
I'm not going to say no to that.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.850
I had a job on a
ship in Antarctica.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.010
I worked on a staff
for two expeditions.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.410
And that was a little bit
of a-- it was a fun job.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.490
It didn't pay well, but I
got to photograph penguins

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.660
on my off time, and then was
assisting with zodiac loading

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.540
and unloading on my work time.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.080
But for me, as a young wildlife
photographer starting out,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.780
it was a job that was
a dream job because I

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.460
had a paid trip to
Antarctica and I

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.190
got to photograph animals.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.410
I was already selling
pictures, at this point,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.940
and I had already established
a relationship with an agent.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.690
And when I got home from that,
my agent sold one of my photos

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.705
to the cover of "Time."

00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:24.830
and it was a really
interesting point in my career.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.663
Two things happened.

00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:31.340
One, I knew that the job
didn't pay that well.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.330
At that time, I was $50,000
in credit card debt,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.480
and that was from just
trying to get started.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.767
There was there was no--
you can't get a business

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:42.350
loan as a wildlife photographer
and there was no family money,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.590
so credit cards, to
me, were worth gold.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.190
And so, I put everything on a
credit card to buy all the gear

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.370
and do some of the
first travel that I did.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.070
So I knew that this was
not a high-paying job,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.060
but I hadn't really realized
how bad it actually was.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.450
And so, when I got this
message from my agent

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.660
that this had sold, I
thought, I'm going to be rich.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.070
This is amazing.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.240
Cover of "Time,"
worldwide rights--

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.850
I'm going to be a rich girl.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.760
And I had all these numbers
in my head, and in the end,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.870
it was $1,500 split
between the two of us.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.776
And that was a major
eye opener for me.

00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:24.150
And then, the other eye opener
that came with the "Time,"

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.370
cover as well was--

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.240
you know, you get the cover of
"Time," and so a lot of people

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.020
start talking about, OK, well,
the photographer has arrived.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.150
They've had the cover of "Time."

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.540
And for me, it was the
first time I really realized

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.740
I'd-- obviously, being a woman
in a male dominated field,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.700
I had been a minority.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.830
And I had experienced some of
the challenges faced with that.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.260
But this is when
I really started

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.290
to hear discussions about
me, said in front of me,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.940
of she'll be barefoot and
pregnant in five years.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940
She's not going to last.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.610
She'll have kids.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.210
She's a woman.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.860
She's not going to
go to tough places.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.760
And it really--
the conversations

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.060
after this "Time" cover came
out, were quite eye opening

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.559
for me, in terms of exactly
what an old boys club

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:16.350
I was dealing with.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.560
My big break came at a really
interesting point in my life.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.170
I had been saving money, instead
of paying off my credit card

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.750
debt, which I should have been.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.760
I was saving money to do
a dream project, which

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.620
was to go to Africa and
photograph a cheetah cub

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.520
family.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.310
I wanted to follow cubs
that were out of the nest,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.530
like six weeks old or so.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.170
And I'd put money
aside for that and I'd

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.620
made some relationships
with people in Africa

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.530
about certain places
where cheetahs were found.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.960
And I had convinced
these lodge owners

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.440
to let me know when there was
a litter of cheetah cubs out.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.710
And it had been a couple
years since I had, had

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.960
any correspondence with them.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.825
And at the time, I was
still working my SPCA job.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.640
I was part time, but I
was still working it.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.250
And I was feeling a
little demoralized

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.860
about my career,
and whether or not

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.780
it was going to
actually work for me.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.460
And there were other
challenges in my life, as well.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.905
I was-- I think, every woman, at
some point, has a bad boyfriend

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.780
and this was my time to
have a bad boyfriend.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.060
I had this guy for seven years
that I shouldn't have been with

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.070
and life just was not
really going well.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.280
And bing, comes into my
inbox an e-mail saying

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.610
there's cheetah cubs,
come to the Serengeti now.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.300
And I decided overnight to
radically change my life.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.290
So I dumped the boyfriend.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.580
I drained the savings account.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.810
I put everything in
storage, and I picked up,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.264
and I went to Africa.

00:15:53.264 --> 00:15:55.680
And I thought I'd stay two
years, and I wound up staying--

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.263
sorry-- I thought
I'd stay two months,

00:15:57.263 --> 00:15:58.740
and I wound up
staying three years.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.050
And it radically
changed my life.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.850
I wound up spending 18
months working with Cheetahs,

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.140
five different families.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.500
This is a family I
worked with when--

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.490
I actually found the mom
when she was pregnant

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.320
and worked with these guys.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.710
They are about four days old.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.930
And I started getting imagery
that was really unique.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.430
And what I would
do in order to get

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.487
this imagery is I would go out
and I would find my cheetah

00:16:30.487 --> 00:16:32.070
family in the morning
and I would stay

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.070
with them all day
long until sunset,

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.730
and then, I had one of those
old-fashioned GPS point

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.970
devices, not like the Garmin
where it tells you like,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.890
turn right to go
to the cheetahs.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.290
There wasn't anything
like that, but I

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.850
would plot in points
at the end of the day.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.310
And so, the next day, I would
go back and try to find them.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.310
And I did this over and
over again every day.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.650
And I got to know quite a few
different females very well.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.710
And as a result, their
cubs grew up around me

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.800
and started you doing things
like playing on my car,

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.180
on the tire, and then
I had a cheetah jump

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.790
on the hood of my car.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.812
This is a cub that
grew up around me.

00:17:17.812 --> 00:17:19.770
And then, he eventually
progressed to the point

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.752
where he would stick his head
in my window that was open.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:24.960
And cheetahs are very docile.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.000
They're not like
lions or leopards

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.890
where they're going
to full on attack you,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.250
so you don't have to be
terrified when this happens.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.840
But, he stuck his
head in the window

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.370
and pawed my shoulder to try
to get me to engage in play.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:43.020
And of course, as a wildlife
photographer, we don't touch.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.710
It's not something that we do.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.720
It's a real ethical no,
no, so I didn't play back,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.200
as much as I wanted to.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.080
I didn't play back.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.830
Or I would just be
sitting there in my car

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.530
and he'd be on the roof and
his tail would drop down

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.300
and graze my neck, and it was
quite a heavenly experience.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.320
And then, followed the moms
when they went out hunting.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.210
This is a shot that was
incredibly difficult

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:06.840
for me to get.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.310
I think I tried for
about 12 days or so.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.050
And she finally had a
hunt that was in the open,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.880
and in a right situation
for photography.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.120
And just being able to
capture these animals

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.940
at such high speeds
is something that's

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.800
challenging, but also
really exhilarating

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.130
watching a cheetah move.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.690
And you can see here
in her movement,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.630
her tail is like
a rudder and she's

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.870
using it to turn as
this gazelle zigzags

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.290
and tries to escape from her.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.350
So just really
incredibly special times

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.840
with my cheetah families.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.670
And then I found myself at
the end of those 18 months,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.940
I found myself thinking, well,
I'm in the Masai Mara, which

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:57.480
is one of the wildlife meccas,
and so I thought well, turn

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.540
my attention to the 1.8 million
wildebeests that were pouring

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.390
in, and do the great migration.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.230
Worked with Leopard.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.720
And then spent a few months
working with a lion pride.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.770
This is one of my
top selling images.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.800
This is a male meeting his
cub for the first time.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.450
And again, this went back
to knowing wildlife behavior

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.180
and knowing what
might happen next.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.424
So I had done a lot of research.

00:19:23.424 --> 00:19:25.340
I had talked to a lot
of different biologists.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.029
And I knew that when
I found the cubs

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:29.570
they were about two weeks old,
and I knew that at some point,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.530
mom would take them out, or more
like mom couldn't keep them in,

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.564
and they'd be so
rowdy they'd come out.

00:19:35.564 --> 00:19:36.980
She couldn't do
anything about it.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.960
And they would meet
the rest of the pride.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.580
And that would be
when they met dad.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.770
So I anticipated this
moment and just hoped

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.490
that it would happen, and in a
good situation for photography.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.960
And on a day when I could find
them, because lots of times

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.610
I would go out looking
for my subjects

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.526
and not be able to find
them, and look all day

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.380
and have no success.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.610
So luck plays a huge part in it.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.920
Anticipation plays a huge
part, but luck as well.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.710
And then that patience game of--

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.420
a lot of the big
cats that I work with

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.480
aren't very shy because they're
used to people on safari

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.130
following them around.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.630
But when you start
working with some

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.540
of the nondescript animals,
like these jackals--

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.812
you start following them
and they're like, whoa,

00:20:20.812 --> 00:20:22.020
you're supposed to ignore me.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.399
What's going on?

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:24.690
And they don't like it one bit.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.990
So for this family, it took
17 days to habituate them.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.350
And what that means is
basically to get them

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.520
so that they're not shy anymore.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.850
And so, 17 days until
I got my first photo.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.100
And that's just moving
my jeep a little bit

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.690
closer to them every day.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.350
A lot of people ask what my life
was like living in the Mara,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.870
and this is the
car that I drove.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.290
It was a little Suzuki.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.420
When I first got there,
I had a Land Cruiser.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.620
And the Land Cruiser
is a lot to handle.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.710
It's a lot on my
own with my physique

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.590
to even just change the tire.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.840
You grow up in Marin
and you called AAA.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.620
There's AAA out
there, so you've got

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.210
to do everything on your own.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.350
So this was a car
that I could handle

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.102
doing some small repairs
on, and also a great car

00:21:17.102 --> 00:21:19.560
for driving around, following
wildlife, because I could get

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.362
into little places, as well.

00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:23.320
People teased me because
it was like a toy car,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.660
but it served me very well.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.210
And then my camp.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.930
This is my very
fancy bush shower.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.290
At first, I just had
the rubber bucket

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.820
and tied it up in the trees.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.510
And then I had my
camp guy make me this.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.290
I did hire a security
guard for camp,

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.115
and he became sort
of my camp guy

00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:49.300
and helped me with stuff around.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:55.190
And then I had this
tent for three years.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.710
So it's bigger than the kind of
tent you'd go to Yosemite in,

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.870
but still pretty basic.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.180
There was a cot inside.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.470
And then I had a basin
to wash with, as well.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.810
No toilet-- living without
a toilet for three years

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.570
is quite an experience.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.060
And then, I had no power for
the first year and a half.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.310
I ran everything off
my car batteries.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.110
And then, after a
year and a half,

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.174
I got solar panels put in.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.340
So I don't know if you
noticed in the previous shot,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.070
but there's a little
friend up in front.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.590
But while I was working
in the Masai Mara,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.980
the rangers got to know me.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.900
And they asked me if I would
take care of an orphan servile

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.090
kitten, named Moto.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.130
I named the Moto,
which means fire.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.910
And I was pretty isolated
and kind of lonely

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.240
in camp, so I loved
the idea of having

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.840
a little something, a little
being to love and take care of.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.300
So I said yes.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.140
And the intent was always
to return him to the wild,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.390
but he was two weeks old,
so he needed a lot of time

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.240
with a mom, of sorts.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.190
So when I first got him,
he was not doing well.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.550
He was emaciated and he
was not feeding very well,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.280
and a rehabber had told
me that I just needed

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.454
to hang out with him in bed.

00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:14.620
And I couldn't, at the time.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.397
I was working on my hyena
den and I was too busy.

00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:19.480
I couldn't just hang out
in bed for days with him,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.560
so I sewed a little
kangaroo pouches into shirts

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.422
and tucked him inside
and buttoned him up.

00:23:26.422 --> 00:23:28.130
And I would take him
in my Jeep everyday.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.338
We'd go out to the hyena den.

00:23:29.338 --> 00:23:31.420
And he loved it in the pouch.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.600
He was super happy in there.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.580
He would just snooze
away in the pouch.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.120
He peed on me a lot in there.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.670
But other than that, it
worked out really well.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.320
And then bonded with me from
being so close to me for days

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.960
and hearing my heart
beat and feeling my skin.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.790
Then he started
feeding very well.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.060
He also loved being brushed
with an old toothbrush

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.470
that I had around.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.370
And if you think about
it, it was perfect.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.800
It was the exact shape
and size and texture

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.310
as mom's tongue would have been.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.560
He absolutely could
not get enough of this.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.080
So I did this every day.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.210
And then, the really
tough part came

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.270
where I had to teach
him how to kill rats.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.430
And that one was rough.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.890
So I started--

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.460
I took him from milk formula
to chicken smoothies.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.180
So I actually got a blender
and started blending up

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.229
chicken breast with the milk.

00:24:29.229 --> 00:24:31.020
But then, I had to get
him on to something.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.890
It's not like he'd find
raw chicken breast around

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.360
in the Mara, so I had to get
him on to something natural.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.100
So I said to the rangers--

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.290
I put up a bounty
on rats, and said

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.930
if you can bring me a dead
rat-- the only rule was

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.460
no poison was
allowed-- then I'll

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.690
give you a certain
amount of money.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.080
So the day I put the
bounty up, the next day

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.900
I had seven dead rats
with people's names

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.450
all written out of
who I owed money to.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:03.360
And then the stakes got
higher, because he immediately

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.150
got the hang of what a rat--

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.820
like, what the taste is,
and he got the taste for it.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.550
But he didn't know quite
what to do with them,

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.690
in terms of killing them.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.910
And what mom would
do is she would

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.480
take something maimed or
crippled back to the nest

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.210
for them, or take them out to
something maimed or crippled.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.150
And so, I knew I had to give him
something maimed or crippled.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.250
So it sounds really
horrible, but I

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.980
had to say, well, I'll give
you double the amount of money

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.780
if you give me a crippled rat.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.310
So I got these brown bags
with crippled rats inside.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.800
And the first crippled
rat I gave him,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.800
it took him 45
minutes to kill it.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.200
And he killed it by
just beating it to death

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.990
on the floor of my tent.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.200
It was like a crime scene.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.010
There was blood everywhere.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:48.730
It was terrible.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.850
But he eventually
got the hang of it

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.540
and became the most
amazing rat hunter.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.520
And he thrived.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.020
And he did very well.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.010
To the day that he left, he
actually loved being in my car.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.350
I think it's from all
the time in the pouch.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.110
There were no fences in
my camp, so he was seeing

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.330
all those wild animals around.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.130
But he loved, for some reason,
he loved looking at the animals

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.390
through the window.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.064
So he'd always try
to hop in my car

00:26:20.064 --> 00:26:22.230
whenever he could to go out
on a game drive with me.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.390
So sometimes I would let him.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.760
He did go back to the wild.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.750
He just disappeared one night.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.590
He used to-- by the time he
left, he was pretty feisty

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.130
and had reached sexual maturity
and was very aggressive,

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.400
but he still was
coming in every night.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.440
And he would cuddle
up to me, and purr,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.190
and lick me for a few
minutes every night,

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.960
and then he'd go
off hunting again.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.390
I left the zip open in the
tent, so it was like a cat door.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.737
It actually worked as a snake
door, too, unfortunately.

00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:50.820
And he was supposed to be
good at catching snakes,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.280
but he wound up being a
miserable snake hunter.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.140
So that didn't work out so well.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.182
But he would just leave,
come back as he pleased.

00:26:58.182 --> 00:26:59.640
And then one night,
he didn't come.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.181
And I just kind of
thought the worst,

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:04.147
but I saw him a week later,
and he was absolutely fine.

00:27:04.147 --> 00:27:05.730
So he just returned
to the wild, which

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.170
is exactly what I
wanted him to do.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.919
I don't know what I
thought-- like, maybe,

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:10.890
there'd be some
dramatic goodbye.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.390
I'd never done anything
like this before.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.450
I grew up with puppies
and kittens, you know?

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.190
And when they leave,
you usually say goodbye.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.990
You put them to sleep,
and you say goodbye.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.864
I thought there'd be
like goodbye, good luck,

00:27:22.864 --> 00:27:25.320
but none of that.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.750
But I was very happy
that he went to the wild.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.080
That was the point
the whole time.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.680
So I'm not going to get
too doom and gloom, but one

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.980
of the things that
this experience also

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.650
gave me was my first
experience with conservation

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.970
and conservation photography.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.760
So one of the things that I
realized is that there was

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.390
poaching going on absolutely
everywhere where I had been,

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.520
but I had never seen
any signs of it,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.640
because as a sort of
tourist, you don't.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.070
But then I would come back
and talk to the rangers

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.017
and they'd talk about
catching eight poachers

00:27:59.017 --> 00:27:59.850
on [INAUDIBLE] hill.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.266
And I'm like, well,
wait a minute.

00:28:01.266 --> 00:28:03.190
I was on [INAUDIBLE]
hill yesterday.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.860
And so I started
to sort of marvel

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.680
at how invisible poaching was.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.780
And I started to ask could
I come with you on some

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.280
of the anti-poaching jobs?

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.694
And, of course, first,
the answer was no.

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:18.360
Again, that went back
to being a woman--

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.890
that it wasn't
safe to be a woman.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.832
And the nice thing about
Africans and their sexism

00:28:23.832 --> 00:28:25.290
is that they're
pretty point blank.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.373
They don't try to hide it.

00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:27.110
They're like no.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.370
It's because you're a woman,
and there's no place for you.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.870
Whereas in our culture, we try
to hide it a little bit more.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:32.490
But they don't.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.864
They just come
right out with it.

00:28:33.864 --> 00:28:35.040
And they're like no.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.910
But after two years, I convinced
them to allow me to come,

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.500
and they did.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.020
So I spent three weeks
shadowing these guys.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.440
And we would go out on these--

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.290
some of them are just patrols,
patrolling for snares.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.615
And then others were a little
more exciting than that,

00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:52.920
and they were actual ambushes.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.430
So we would go and we
would find the meat hanging

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.340
in a camp where the guys were
sort of packing it in and out,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.900
coming back and forth.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.940
They had to walk two
days with the meat.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.610
So we'd see where meat was
hanging and drying in the trees

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.443
and you'd know they
were going to come back,

00:29:07.443 --> 00:29:09.317
so we'd lay in the grass
and wait all night.

00:29:09.317 --> 00:29:11.400
And there were sometimes
when I'd go out with them

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.380
and nothing exciting
would happen-- just lay

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.100
there all night,
and a hyena would

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.808
chew on your shoe, or
something, and that

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:19.600
was like the only
excitement-- guys never came.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.870
And then there were other
nights where stuff would happen.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:30.400
So with these raids, most of
what these guys were doing

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.650
is commercial meat poaching.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.350
And it was going at
a really rapid rate.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.160
So you they estimated that
year, 180,000 wildebeests

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.010
had been poached in the
Serengeti Mara ecosystem.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.410
And that year, the total
population was 1.8 million.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.730
So in terms of the
sustainability of the trade,

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.780
and the volume that
we were dealing with,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.925
it was pretty out of control.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.830
A lot of it was
going on at night.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.114
And so, the night ambushes
that would happen,

00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:04.780
it was really difficult.
The guys didn't

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.370
have night-vision equipment.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.100
They had-- a lot of them-- there
were some AK 47s in the mix,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.820
but a lot of them just had old
rifles that they hadn't shot

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.060
in 10 years--

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.020
very underfunded.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.560
They had a couple handcuffs.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.820
The rest of them used some twine
that they put guys together

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.320
with.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.060
On this raid, there were
52 poachers that night.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.050
And we had 40 guys on
foot, and six vehicles,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.530
and the poachers came in.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.504
We watched them coming
down from the escarpment

00:30:33.504 --> 00:30:34.420
for a couple of hours.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.420
And then, they came in
and all hell broke loose.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.070
People were running
everywhere-- chaos.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.050
And in the end,
12 were captured.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.630
So it's a very
challenging thing.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.490
And it's also a very
demoralizing thing

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.870
for the rangers
themselves to hear.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.070
They were out 52
poachers and they got 12.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.880
It's not exactly a success
rate that they can be proud.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.490
There were days when we would
go around collecting snares,

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.850
and there would be, at the end
of the day, over 300 snares.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.940
So huge, huge volume.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.650
After my time in the Mara, I
started doing a lot of work

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.660
in jungles with apes.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.910
And apes are really fun.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.350
They're pretty
exciting to work with.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.892
I always describe
chimpanzees as schizophrenic.

00:31:22.892 --> 00:31:25.350
One second, they're calm, and
then the next second, they're

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.510
just completely psycho.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:32.340
And the alpha males are the
worst at it, unfortunately.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.480
And I was warned--

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.570
so this guy, his
name is Cacama, and I

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.370
was warned when I started
working in this area,

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:44.470
that Cacama might give me a
little grief when he met me.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.370
And I didn't really know
exactly what that looked like.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.970
But the Ugandan research
assistants had said,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.870
if he charges you, you
need to kick at him,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.790
and then he'll stop.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.840
And so, trying to
describe what it's

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.820
like to be charged by a
chimpanzee is really difficult.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.850
When they start charging, they
get into this-- first of all,

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.600
they get bipedal.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.220
And second of all, their
hair stands up on end

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.940
and it's piloerect.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.610
It looks like they've
been electrocuted,

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.870
and it's from all the
aggressive hormone that's

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.790
just pumping through them.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.119
And then they take branches
with them, usually,

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.910
as they're running.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.010
They're like carrying
the force with them.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.050
They throw rocks often.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.115
And they beat the ground.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.890
And I tell you, when
a chimp like this

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:39.320
comes straight at you, you would
have to be like super human

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.550
to be able to kick at it.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.940
I could not kick at
him when he did this.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.880
And so as a result
of me not kicking,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.390
which everybody found
hilarious except me,

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.940
is Cacama gave me a bit
of a slap as he went by.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.090
He just went, whap, and
slapped me on the hip,

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.030
and then kept going,
which was quite alarming.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.990
It didn't really hurt, but
it was pretty terrifying.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.900
And then, all the guys
thought it was hilarious.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.000
The head researcher wasn't
so excited about it.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.850
The guy from Harvard,
because obviously,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.270
you don't want to have
any physical contact.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.030
Aggression tends to build
in chimpanzee societies,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.640
so it wasn't the greatest
thing that happened,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.330
but it was terrifying,
to say the least.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.680
So Cacama, who was like this
big, huge, brutal alpha male

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.150
is the polar
opposite of this guy.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.620
This is Alonjo.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.080
And when I first
entered this field,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.050
I'd heard people talk
about animal crushes.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.260
And I had thought these
people are so bushed out,

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.020
they have spent way too
much time with animals,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.310
until I developed my
first animal crush, which

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.170
is what with Alonjo.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.370
And Alonjo stole my
heart immediately.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.700
I mean, you have to admit, he's
a pretty sexy looking chimp.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.970
And he's very charming.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.450
He's grown up around
people, so he has

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.320
absolutely no fear of people.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.510
And he likes to look at
you with these gazing eyes.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.409
And then he does this thing
where he puts his arm out,

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.600
and he puts out
his palm, and it's

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.159
like grooming solicitation.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:20.570
It's what chimpanzees, when they
say to each other, groom me.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.489
So he would come up
to me and do this.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:23.989
And of course, we don't touch.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.610
We can't do this,
but I desperately

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.710
wanted to groom Alonjo.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.020
And there was another
American research student

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.170
there at the time,
my friend, Jess.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:38.210
And so, one day, I confessed
my crush for Alonjo.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.400
And she's like,
oh, my god, me too.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.469
He's such a good-looking chimp.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.350
And so, then after that, we
kept like, I saw Alonjo today.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.270
You did not.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.230
So we had the thing
going about Alonjo.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.170
Animals do get under
your skin sometimes.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.230
Alonjo's one of them that did.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.700
So then I moved on to
photographing orangutans,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.150
and this is something that
is very close to my heart.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.150
Orangutans, as many
of you probably know,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.400
are in peril from
palm oil, which

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.340
is in a lot of Western
products that we use,

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.510
food products and toiletries.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.880
And so I set off on a quest to
photograph an orangutan rescue.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.430
And the orangutans that we
found that needed to be rescued

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:30.890
were in a patch of land that was
fragmented and was surrounded

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.130
by clear cut, and so there was
no way these orangutans could

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.700
live on it.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.020
And I went out with these guys.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.020
This was the rescue team
that I went out with,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.820
and we drove into the village.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.400
They dropped me off at
a little guest house

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.630
where they thought I'd be
more comfortable staying.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.380
They went into the village
to stay at somebody's house.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.910
And at 10:00 at
night, one of them

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:55.070
came back, looking
absolutely terrified saying

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.530
they were fleeing, because
they had gotten death threats,

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.020
and that I had to hide
there, because it wasn't safe

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.630
for me to leave with them, and
that they didn't think anyone

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.960
knew I was associated with them,
but I shouldn't leave my room.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.350
And they would send an unmarked
car for me the next morning.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.590
So it was quite an
eye-opening experience,

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.190
in terms of what these
guys are dealing with.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:21.055
And I'm sitting there having
to text my fiance saying,

00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:23.180
the number for the State
Department and my passport

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.055
copies are on the desk,
and blah, blah, blah.

00:36:25.055 --> 00:36:26.730
I didn't know it
was going to happen.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.500
Nothing happened.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.400
Everything was fine.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.110
They sent an unmarked car.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.290
I got out of the village
without any problems.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.690
But the palm oil
industry is something

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.900
that is absolutely--
it's like big tobacco

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.430
or big oil in this country.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.960
It's quite corrupt.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.730
And it's quite
scary for the locals

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.770
that have to deal with it.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.900
So we moved to another village,
stayed in an Islamic community.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.830
And for me, I was
with those 12 guys,

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.100
and what was great is the
Islamic faith is obviously

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.530
very modest, so
because I was a woman,

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.570
they gave me the
bedroom, which is great,

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.620
except there's no bed.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.510
But it was super
comfortable, nonetheless.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.500
And I stayed in this house.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.800
The bathing was not ideal.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.290
The bathroom, for showering
and whatnot, wasn't great.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.110
But this is often the
conditions that we're

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.760
in as wildlife photographers.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.270
We're either in the
bush, or were often

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.340
in villages that are
incredibly impoverished

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.870
and we don't complain and
we're just really grateful

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.670
about everything that we're
given, particularly these guys,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.610
because these guys are
risking their lives.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.710
A lot of them are informants
and they're actually

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.010
snitching out people
in their community

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.530
about these
orangutans being sold.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.780
So one of the things that
happens with orangutans that

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.537
are on palm oil plantations
is that the babies are

00:37:52.537 --> 00:37:54.370
sold on the black market
as pets and there's

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.720
a lot of money involved in this.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.270
So the informants are
usually snitching them out

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.730
when they know a baby's
in somebody's house that's

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.350
going to be sold.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:08.830
So we did rescue an orangutan
on this parceled piece of forest

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.240
and took her to a
national park where

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.730
she could live safely
and have enough food.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.010
The big thing about being
on a palm oil plantation

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.020
is that they can't survive.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.950
Orangutans can't live off
palm, and so they slowly

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.860
starve to death, if they're not
shot by the palm oil plantation

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.030
workers.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.370
So she was released.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.065
So that was a happy story.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.770
And then I have worked a lot
with some much lighter-hearted,

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.150
goofy animals.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.830
Sloths are one of my favorites.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:47.330
I've spent close to eight
years working on sloths,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.910
and recently did a sloth book.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.720
And one of the things that we--

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.020
the sloth researcher and I
really wanted to document

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.410
are these swimming
slots that live

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.940
on an island off of Panama,
about three hours off shore.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.310
And it was quite an adventure
going to photograph them.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.030
And I had never done any
underwater photography before,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.220
so I was pretty intimidated
by this whole thing.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.650
I'd never used an
underwater housing.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.920
And so, photographers,
like any other field,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.560
when you don't know how to
do something, you practice.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.210
So this is the pool
in my backyard.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.370
And this teddy bear has
been various animals for me.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.640
He's posed as penguins in trees.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.860
He's posed as
koala joeys getting

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.339
a surgery in a hospital, just
trying to figure out techniques

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:35.630
of how I would shoot something.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.637
So I stuck some floaties
on this teddy bear,

00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:40.220
in order to figure
out how I was going

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.503
to shoot the cover of our book.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.960
And then there is India.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.960
And India was a project
that for me took 2 and 1/2

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.810
years of negotiating
with Indian National

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.840
Parks and the
government, and that

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.870
was to try to photograph
a wild Tiger den.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:12.080
And I had one huge disadvantage,
and that was being a woman.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.350
And India is one
of the worst places

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.110
that I've worked in, in
terms of being a woman.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.630
I'm very careful when I
travel to other cultures.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.050
I always dress according to
the way I should be dressed.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.524
And I act the way
I should be acting.

00:40:30.524 --> 00:40:31.940
If you're a woman
traveling alone,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.784
I think that there's
no other way to do it.

00:40:34.784 --> 00:40:36.200
But it was quite
difficult for me,

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.110
because I just was not
getting any headway.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:43.130
And then, one of my closest
Indian friends said to me,

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.729
you just need to hire
a male project manager,

00:40:45.729 --> 00:40:47.270
and stop trying to
go to the meetings

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.490
yourself, and just have
him do everything for you.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.820
And that solved
absolutely everything.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.330
It's one of the few
places where I've actually

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.520
gone into government
meetings and I've

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.710
been told that I can't
go into the meeting

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.770
because I'm a woman, and it
was a government official

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.200
that told me that.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.860
So it's a challenging
environment, for that respect.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.610
I absolutely love
the Indian culture.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.400
I love the Indian people.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.940
And I loved working with
my Indian tiger den.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.780
So this was in a place called
Bandhavgarh National Park,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.280
and this was a very
special project for me,

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.370
not just in terms of how
rare it is to get permission

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.400
to work with a wild tiger den,
but the fact that this female

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.520
was super relaxed, and
eventually her cubs

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.140
also accepted me as well.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.080
This is the natal den
where she gave birth.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.390
So you can see in
the next image that's

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.610
her going back up into it.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:46.010
She stayed in her natal den
for about the first month,

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.910
and then moved her cubs
to an even better place

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.200
for photography.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.840
And this shot was
really interesting,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.860
because she had moved them to
a place that was quite high,

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.390
actually.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.070
It was like a cave, and
she liked to lay out

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.230
on the front of the cave area.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.622
And in order to get
the shot, I had to--

00:42:05.622 --> 00:42:06.830
I was working on an elephant.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.650
When you work with tigers,
you're on elephant back,

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.670
usually, in India.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.660
And there's a long history
of good relationship

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.690
between elephant and tigers
in the national parks

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.130
and the tiger reserves.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.140
And so, I am on
this elephant back,

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.730
and I had to stand up in
order to get the shot.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.745
And my elephant [INAUDIBLE]
is holding onto my legs.

00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:32.120
And he's like,
please don't fall.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.869
Please don't fall.

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:34.460
Please don't fall.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.650
And I stood there
and was able to get

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.800
these photos that kind of
gave you that feeling of being

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.360
in the den.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.400
And that was just because mom
liked to cool off up front.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.430
So again, luck playing a
huge part of it as well.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:53.621
And then I did a lot of work
on the cubs as they grew up.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:01.650
So one of the things that I
would just like to end on.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.480
I know I've talked a
couple times about being

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.610
a woman in this
field, but it's being

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.770
a minority in the field
has been something

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.450
that's incredibly challenging.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.220
And it's slowly changing.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.560
There are more and
more young women

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.560
getting into nature photography
than there used to be.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.780
When I entered it was very
much an old boy's club.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.220
It still very much is.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.260
There's still a lot of
sexism in the field.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.520
There's a lot of sexual
harassment as well.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.370
But things are changing.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:33.770
And I decided two years ago
to start my own nonprofit.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.740
So I started
something called Girls

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.670
Who Click and it's dedicated
to trying to encourage

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.870
young women to enter the
field of nature photography,

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.810
either as a profession
or as a hobby

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.550
or as a part of another job.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.620
But just trying to
get girls into this

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.630
and get them outside
with a camera.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.370
And that's been
incredibly rewarding

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.090
working with the girls.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.360
We provide free
workshops for teen girls.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.680
And then we a lot of the top
names in nature photography

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.480
that are women are
working as instructors.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.120
So it's something that is
incredibly close to my heart

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.580
that I'm very proud of, and
that's called Girls Who Click.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.690
And that is it.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:16.020
That's all I've got for you.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.012
Thank you.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.682
SPEAKER 1: Any questions?

00:44:23.682 --> 00:44:26.140
AUDIENCE: I'm from India, and
it's incredibly disappointing

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.534
to hear that experience.

00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:28.450
SUZI ESZTERHAS: Sorry.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.470
AUDIENCE: On behalf of
my countrymen and women.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.420
If it makes you
feel any better, I

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:39.190
have tried getting permission to
use a Rover to take photographs

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.650
and I've never gotten permission
so far, even being a man.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.660
The question I had was, from
a conservation perspective,

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.480
increasingly many more people
are visiting national parks

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.370
and they're taking
pictures of wild animals.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.640
So there's a lot
more information

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.790
in social media, a lot
more images and pictures.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:04.450
So people kind of tend
to lose perspective

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.912
that there is extreme
threat and danger for some

00:45:07.912 --> 00:45:08.620
of these animals.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.950
Like tigers, for
example, today, you

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:14.050
go to [INAUDIBLE] or
Bandhavgarh and you

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.480
spend two or three
safaris, or you

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.274
go to [INAUDIBLE]
into the forest,

00:45:18.274 --> 00:45:20.440
it's a guarantee that you'll
definitely see a tiger.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.550
And many of them
carry good equipment

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.920
and they shoot pictures.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.536
But the truth is, there
only about 2,700 tigers

00:45:26.536 --> 00:45:27.160
in the country.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.570
And it's the largest tiger
population in the world.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.250
There's so much
images of that, people

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:38.470
don't have that perception that
this natural history is pretty

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.850
much under severe threat.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.410
We need to do
something about it.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.190
What is your
perspective on that?

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:47.170
SUZI ESZTERHAS: I
think, that's definitely

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.660
one way to look at it.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.540
The other way--

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.010
So first of all, I think there's
a lot of validity in that.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.100
And what I would
say is a lot of this

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.330
is how you use the pictures.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.820
And one of the things
with Girls Who Click

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.810
and also the way I
operate is not just

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.540
collecting pretty pictures,
and using these pictures

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.560
for conservation.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.050
So I do a tremendous
amount of work

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:15.040
with conservation organizations
and raising money and also

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.150
awareness.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:20.890
And so, trying to use your
pictures to elevate awareness,

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.060
rather than just--

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.830
let's just say you're posting
these photos on social media.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.850
Rather than just posting
a pretty photo of a tiger,

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:32.020
trying to also post, maybe
not every time, but at least

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.740
sometimes, every
once in while, post

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.420
some really critical information
about how many tigers are left.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.070
And also, what I
try to do is when

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.290
I do post about
conservation, I try

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.110
to tell people what they can
do, because otherwise people

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.700
wind up feeling a
little bit helpless.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.530
It's very easy right
now in this climate

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.600
to feel helpless about a
lot of different things

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.780
that are going on.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.300
So giving people
something to do,

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.340
some direct action
they can take,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.550
and your photos can
actually utilize-- they

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.130
can bring that home even
more, than if you posted that.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.770
Let's think of posting that
without an image, right?

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.650
Not that many people would see
it, because it's just text.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.140
But if you post that with a
pretty photo, it gets shared

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.790
and it gets shared again.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.910
So I think a lot of it is
how you use the photos.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.042
But that's one of the
things that I really

00:47:15.042 --> 00:47:16.750
am trying to teach
the girls in Girls Who

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.300
Click is that this is
not about just collecting

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.170
pretty pictures.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.210
This is about doing
something good

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.560
with your photos that's
going to benefit the world

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.270
and the animals that are in it.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.480
So that is a fair point.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.110
We see also a lot-- you're
absolutely right about tigers,

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.960
but we also see that with lions.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.500
They didn't realize
until 10 years ago,

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.630
it kind of came as a
huge shock to the world

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.316
that lion numbers have
dramatically plummeted.

00:47:44.316 --> 00:47:45.940
Because people, when
they go on safari,

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.539
they see lions everywhere.

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:49.330
But what they don't
realize is that outside

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.990
of the national parks, lions
are almost non-existent,

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:54.970
and it's only in
those little pockets.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.340
So you get this false
impression that Africa

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.740
is teeming with lions when
you go over there on safari.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.410
And you would get that
impression with the tigers

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:02.960
as well.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.670
So again, I think it goes back
to how you use the images.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.350
Thank you.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here today.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.160
So not even to reframe
that, but kind of

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.595
build on that last
question there--

00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:16.970
in addition to
just the awareness

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:20.420
perspective, and desensitizing
it from other people,

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:25.070
or them feeling it's not as
though it's as big of an issue,

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.230
you just mentioned the
tourism and the parks

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:28.200
in Africa and whatnot.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.140
Do you feel that because
of this awareness

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.514
and now more of a movement to
go and visit those in person,

00:48:34.514 --> 00:48:35.930
that you're seeing
an encroachment

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:37.479
on the actual
habitats themselves?

00:48:37.479 --> 00:48:39.770
I actually went on safari a
few years ago and noticed--

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.320
just the sheer number of
cars and the difficulties

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.925
it causes for the
lions themselves.

00:48:43.925 --> 00:48:45.800
And if they're all
concentrated in that area,

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.496
do you see that this
awareness actually

00:48:47.496 --> 00:48:49.745
might backfire in the sense
that all the tourism there

00:48:49.745 --> 00:48:53.050
is going to continue to
destabilize their environment?

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:56.160
SUZI ESZTERHAS: Yeah,
that's a real catch-22.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.980
I definitely witnessed
that firsthand

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.760
and continue to witness
that all over the world.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.760
You see tourists,
irresponsible tourism,

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.620
not just tourists
behaving badly,

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.390
but the infrastructure
that's set up for

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.150
tourism not being ideal,
or being too crowded,

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:12.570
or not being green.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.870
And that is a problem.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.490
The flip side of it is that if
we cut off areas to tourism,

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.670
or if there aren't enough people
seeing them, we as human beings

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.880
tend to not care about something
unless we can enjoy it.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.920
That's why wilderness
areas in this country

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.930
haven't really ever worked.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.180
Wilderness areas are a
great idea in concept.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.850
There's no roads
going through them.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.740
The problem is people
can't enjoy them.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.560
People tend to forget they exist
and they don't care about them.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.680
Whereas, a threat it
happens in Yellowstone,

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.470
the whole world cares because
so many people have been there

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.430
and they care about it.

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.800
So it is I think
a real catch-22.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.180
The answer is, obviously,
it's a no-brainer,

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.020
is controlling the tourism,
and controlling the numbers.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.680
And that's a huge problem.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.730
It's one of the biggest things
right now with jaguar tourism

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.920
in Brazil, a place where
I used to take people.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.960
When I first started
going, we'd have

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.230
three or four boats around
a jaguar sighting maximum.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.260
And last time I
went, there were 30.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.130
And so that kind of
uncontrolled growth

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.630
is going to kill
it for everybody.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.690
It's not good for the tigers and
it's terrible for the tourism.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:24.320
So I think a lot of it
is about controlling it.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.880
The problem comes
is that you have

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:30.650
these economies and these local
areas that are so impoverished,

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.950
that everybody wants to get
in on it, rightfully so.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:37.460
But it's very difficult
to control that growth.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.119
It has to come from
a government level,

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.910
and a lot of these
governments are just not

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.740
willing to do that.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.800
Botswana is kind of
an interesting example

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.200
of controlled tourism,
however that's

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.160
only available for the
elite and for the wealthy.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.240
So there's kind of a
catch-22s in all of it.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.490
But I think that's
a really fair point,

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.140
that we have to control it.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.420
AUDIENCE: Whether it's
photography or art or writing,

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.020
some sort of creative
endeavor, or developing

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.060
your creative talent,
there is that developing

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.727
your personal style.

00:51:13.727 --> 00:51:16.310
And I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about maybe

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.280
how other photographers
have either influenced you,

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.980
or changed your own
style, or you perhaps

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:29.060
saw what they were doing
and tried to build on that,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.720
or however that might be,
that helped you develop

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.760
your own creative style.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.100
SUZI ESZTERHAS: So
when I was little,

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.920
I grew up watching
nature documentaries

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.200
and also reading magazines.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.630
But I really loved
nature documentaries.

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:50.030
And when I was in college, I
did a semester abroad program,

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.940
and I had the ability
to work with a film crew

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.310
from the BBC for about two
weeks as a sort of apprentice

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:58.940
of sorts.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.180
And they allowed me to go
back and work with them

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.840
on two occasions.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.020
And I learned a tremendous
amount from them, particularly

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.770
about wildlife behavior and
about respecting animals,

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.830
and about working with
individuals and developing

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.010
relationships of trust between
yourself and the animal,

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:22.400
but also habituating
animals that are shy.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.930
And I took from that--

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.920
a huge amount of
my work is based

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.300
on the way a cameraman operates
versus a stills photographer.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.280
In fact, a lot of people
have told me, god, you

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.580
work a lot more like a film
crew would than a stills

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.190
photographer, just in terms
of the sheer amount of time

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:45.170
that I take with my subjects,
and also how in depth

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:51.230
and how much care I take in not
offending my animal subjects

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.570
or not threatening their trust.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.890
So cameramen have been
hugely influential.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:02.270
I wish all stills photographers
had spent some time

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.120
with cameramen, because
cameraman, for the most part,

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.260
are really--

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.580
they're in the trenches more
than still photographers,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.680
in terms of how
much time they have

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.310
to spend waiting for a
shot and how much they have

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:17.800
to get into the animal's head.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.590
But that's also something
that I'm most interested in.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:26.040
So most of my early people that
I admired, with the exception--

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.650
there's a female
nature photographer

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.950
that I admired growing
up named Tui De Roy, who

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.220
is a huge mentor of
mine to this day,

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.620
and is someone that I am
privileged to call a friend.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:44.080
She entered the industry when
there were almost no women.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.210
And she stepped foot
very bravely into a world

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:52.870
where women were really
not welcome at all.

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:54.520
And I really admire her for it.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.500
So I grew up admiring
her stuff as well.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.040
AUDIENCE: Going back a little
bit to conservation issues,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.490
you've had a lot of
contact with local people

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.130
who seem to really care
about these issues,

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.580
whether it be rangers or people
who are out there to protect

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.100
the orangutans near the
palm oil plantations,

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.570
and could you talk more
about what drives them?

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:23.220
Is it government initiatives
that pay those people as a way

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:29.160
to basically help protect
the preserves, or is it

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.380
just their interactions
with the animals

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:37.550
that they feel compelled
to protect them,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.990
just to get a
sense of what works

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.300
and what doesn't
at the local level?

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.780
SUZI ESZTERHAS: I
think it depends.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.220
I mean, it depends on the
conservation initiative.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.780
I can think of ones
that I've worked

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.900
on where it has not been
driven by money at all

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.190
and the guys are just totally
in love with the wildlife

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.350
and care passionately
about what they're doing.

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:01.900
And then I can think
of others where

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.210
it's like they're just
going through it blind

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.310
and they just want the money.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.120
And they're maybe
doing a good job,

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.000
but the passion is not there.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.240
So it's all across the board.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:20.560
I think that any program, not
any, but many programs that do

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.310
bring in together money and
conservation, they work,

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:26.980
because local communities
need the money

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.330
in many of these countries.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.270
The biggest problems,
like the poachers

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:33.040
that I showed you
photos of, those

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.730
are Wakuria people in the
Serengeti National Park.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.620
And one of the
reasons why they're

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.480
poaching in the
Serengeti National Park

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.630
is because they used to live
in the Serengeti National Park.

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.090
They were hunters and gatherers
and they got kicked out

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:48.850
by the government when it
was made a national park

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:51.220
and they're not employed
by the National Park.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.620
The National Park employs
people from the cities,

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.410
instead of employing
local Wakuria people.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:58.780
So they have absolutely
no economic benefit

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.190
from the park at all.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.170
So they go into the
park to get what's

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:05.320
sort of rightfully
theirs and there's

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.630
no qualms about that,
because they're not

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.340
getting any benefit.

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.400
So why not?

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.750
So the conservation programs
that employ people and give

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.290
them a livelihood, I think, for
the most part, really do work.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.020
I know there's some
situations where money doesn't

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.210
work in conservation,
but I think

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.920
they're few and far between.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.910
AUDIENCE: I didn't quite catch
if you like writing articles

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.961
to go with your photographs,
or do you sometimes--

00:56:30.961 --> 00:56:33.460
how you display the photographs,
or are you sometimes trying

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.342
to find a reporter to go
work on it with you, or just

00:56:37.342 --> 00:56:38.800
what do you prefer,
or do you think

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.950
you'll be more doing more
writing with the photographs?

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.750
SUZI ESZTERHAS: I
don't like writing.

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:46.120
I grew up with two parents
that were journalists.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:46.880
They were writers.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.330
And I don't know, maybe that
gave me a distaste for it.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:52.930
But just not in a
terrible way, but they

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.970
were writing a lot,
particularly my father.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:58.330
But writing is something
I've never enjoyed,

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.980
and it's never
come easily to me.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.800
It's something that usually
I dread it and put it

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.350
on the back burner.

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:06.880
I'd write for children's books.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.170
That's very different.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.540
It has been
challenging, for sure.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.530
Writing for a
three-year-old is not easy,

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.710
especially when you've
never had a three-year-old.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:18.160
But in terms of
writing for adults,

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.840
it's just not something
that interests me.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.290
The other thing is too,
I know a few writers,

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.300
and also a lot of
the magazines I

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.400
work with, use
writers of their own,

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.030
whether they're
freelance or staff.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:32.050
So what I generally do when I
pitch a feature to somebody,

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:35.320
is I pitch story
ideas with it to just

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.850
make it a prettier
package for them,

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:38.350
so that the editors
don't have to do

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.820
as much research on their end.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.784
And very often they go with
one of the points that I pitch,

00:57:42.784 --> 00:57:44.200
and they'll assign
a writer to it.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.820
And then the writer
almost always gets

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.370
in touch with me, which is very
common, because photographers,

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.000
we have all these direct
experiences with the situation

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.750
or with wildlife.

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:55.900
So they'll interview me, either
as a direct interview, or just

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.370
to get more information
to write their story.

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.630
AUDIENCE: So you give them
the photos plus ideas.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:02.630
SUZI ESZTERHAS: Exactly.

00:58:04.442 --> 00:58:06.150
AUDIENCE: So many of
the animals that you

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.520
photographed are endangered.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.650
And I think there's a
pretty good awareness of how

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:14.130
climate change is endangering
those animals, especially

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.870
polar bears, et cetera.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:19.710
But habitat loss
and invasive species

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:24.660
and other encroachments
because of the huge monoculture

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.480
seems like it's
equally threatening.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:32.715
And I wonder if that's an angle
that you're trying to approach?

00:58:32.715 --> 00:58:33.840
SUZI ESZTERHAS: Definitely.

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.900
Habitat loss, for so many of
the animals that I showed--

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:40.080
you know, orangutans are like
the extreme example for it--

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.500
but habitat loss
is something that

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.510
is affecting I think
every endangered

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:47.710
species that you saw photos of.

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.130
It's something that's
very challenging

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:53.550
to capture in an image.

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:58.440
We do see images of it, but it's
difficult to visually capture

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.520
that.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.390
The biggest thing
in Africa is areas

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.980
that have been just grazed and
they're deserts, essentially

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:13.740
because of so many years
of improper grazing.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.920
And then prey loss is
as bad as habitat loss,

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.160
if not worse, particularly,
obviously, for the predators.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.450
But the prey loss is
huge when you are working

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.580
in impoverished countries.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.200
Basically outside
the national park,

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.630
you don't see many things alive.

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:35.730
So again, I think
there's so many--

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:39.990
a lot of people, when the
death penalty was recently

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:42.380
announced by Kenya
for poachers-- people

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.820
are going to get the death
penalty for poaching,

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.430
and I had so many friends on
Facebook celebrating this.

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:54.240
And to me, it is a terribly
tragic, sad, sad situation,

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:58.110
because most of these poachers
that are doing the poaching,

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:01.060
they're low on the scale.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.704
You've got the
person above them,

01:00:02.704 --> 01:00:04.620
and then a middleman,
and then usually someone

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.739
in the government that's
getting all the money.

01:00:06.739 --> 01:00:09.030
Those aren't the people that
are going to get executed.

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:12.420
It's the guy at the bottom.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.420
And so, it's not
necessarily like the photos

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.960
you saw today aren't like guy
going to get meat and give it

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.230
to his children, it's much
more commercial than that.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.400
It's like a drug trade.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.510
It's big.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.840
But he's a very,
very poor man who

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.680
does not have many
opportunities, if any,

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.970
besides poaching
for making money.

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:36.810
So it's very easy for all of
us to see it as black and white

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.220
in this country.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.620
AUDIENCE: What should
Google be doing

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.154
beyond what they are doing
in the realm of conservation.

01:00:43.154 --> 01:00:45.070
SUZI ESZTERHAS: That's
a really good question.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.190
Maybe you should tell me that.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.190
AUDIENCE: It's a secret.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.920
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.010
I was going to say in the
realms of conservation

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:57.450
and of arts education
for kids and women?

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.580
SUZI ESZTERHAS: You know,
I think anything that

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:04.020
corporation-- first of all,
one of the things that I--

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.500
I do so much with kids, between
my children's magazines,

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.900
the children's books,
the Girls Who Click,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.430
and to me, the biggest
problem in our society

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.940
is disconnection with nature.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.950
It is so shockingly present
and such a serious issue,

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:22.710
because it touches on
local issues and global.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:24.690
If a kid is not
connected to nature here,

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:27.810
they're not going to care
about lions in Africa.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.600
So I think that
just establishing

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.370
a strong connection to nature
from the youngest age possible

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.160
is so critical.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.210
I have a print shop.

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:42.390
I sell photos to children's
hospitals and to moms.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.900
I purposely have an
economical line of prints

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.560
so that moms on low budgets
can afford to buy my work,

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.070
because I believe it's
important for those photos

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:56.310
to be on the nursery wall for
kids to see them on the wall.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:59.124
Because honestly, I'm not
sure those kids are going

01:01:59.124 --> 01:02:00.540
to be taken anywhere
where they're

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.640
going to see birds
and squirrels,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.020
let alone larger
animals than that.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.190
So I think that anything
that corporations

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:12.720
can do to get kids outside and
to get them connected to nature

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.940
is really, really important
on the most basic level.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.830
Because I think with
our conservation,

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:21.720
yes, and fund-raising
is really important,

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.510
and working with adults
is really important,

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:27.330
but so much of it is we're
preaching to the choir,

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:30.040
because we're reaching
people who already care.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.200
The biggest thing, and
it boggles my mind,

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.200
because so many huge
conservation organizations do

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.990
nothing with children
anywhere in the world,

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.380
and that we're just
totally missing the boat.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.380
All I have to do is look at
young kids on their iPads

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.530
and how much time
they spend a day

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.420
outside with their feet
touching the ground

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.137
and for many children it's zero.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:56.720
I don't know the
actual numbers, but I

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.950
think for the majority of
children, it might be zero.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:03.220
So I think that is the biggest
threat in this country right

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.340
now is that
connection being gone.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.500
I can't imagine my
childhood without nature.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.620
It was such a part of it.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.290
And I just lived in the
hills in San Rafael.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.540
I didn't live anywhere exotic.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.640
In terms of what
else Google can do,

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.430
I think I'll leave that
to you to figure out.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:26.060
Thank you.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.140
Thank you for having me.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:27.640
Thank you.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.790
