00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.950
Even though it looks like a random, bumpy
mess, your brain is incredibly organized.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.630
Your brain has its own version of google maps
for navigating the world around it -- but

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.380
just how flexible are these maps to changes?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.090
Every sound you can hear or touch you can
feel is because neurons in a specific part

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.080
of your brain are firing.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.150
Our brains are organized “topographically”so
that we can keep track of where things are

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.859
happening, … that means we can tell the
difference between a touch on the arm or a

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.910
touch on the face.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.880
By observing people’s brains in different
imaging machines, neuroscientists have largely

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.129
mapped out touch, and other, sensations in
the brain.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.289
They found touch signals from different parts
of the body get sent to different areas of

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.639
the brain -- and from that we’ve made somatotopic
maps.

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:47.219
The cool thing about these maps is that they
maintain spatial relationships, meaning the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.420
receptors in my skin that sense touches to
this part of my hand, and this one, send connections

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.850
to similarly neighbouring parts of the brain.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.239
You have these maps for each of your senses.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.171
In the case of touch, they’ve drawn out
what’s called a homunculus in the brain

00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:04.980
--- basically there’s a tiny man living
inside your head.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.970
Okay there’s not… but the homunculus is
an easy way to see which parts of the primary

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.540
sensory cortex, right here, sense different
parts of the body.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.720
What you’ll notice is size is not totally
proportional..

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.650
Bigger parts of the body don’t necessarily
get more sensory space in the brain… instead,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.220
regions with more sensitivity get more real
estate in the sensory cortex.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.420
And this could be why our lips and fingertips
are a lot more sensitive than our arms?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.050
They’re represented as larger in the homunculus,
meaning there are more neurons paying close

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.880
attention to sensations coming from those
regions.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.830
Diagrams like these make it seem like the
map is inflexible … but that might not always

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.830
be true.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.110
Let’s say you lose a hand -- those sensory
neurons don’t just go dark…

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.730
Researchers hypothesize that when a limb is
lost, new connections may sprout into underused

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.680
brain areas, or perhaps weaker connections
that were already there can now take over.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.750
When looking at nonhuman primates with amputated
limbs, researchers have seen touches to the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.510
lips light up regions of the brain corresponding
to where the limb was… which makes sense

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.739
if they’re using their mouths to do tasks
they would’ve done with their hands before.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.140
There are similar observations in adult humans
too, though some argue it might depend on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.660
what the patient uses to compensate for the
lost limbs.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.319
But a case study added some surprising new
elements to this story.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.110
A young boy with both his hands amputated
received a double hand transplant.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.370
Shortly after his transplant, he didn’t
have any touch sensation in his new fingertips.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.693
But, when they put him in an MEG machine,
they saw that touches to his lips lit up the

00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:33.693
parts of his brain that used to be for his
hands.

00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:37.290
Then tests seven and a half months after the
transplant, touches to the lip activated only

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.540
the lip area of the sensory cortex, and touches
to the fingertips produced unusually strong

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.359
responses in the finger area of the cortex.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.189
Does this mean we can regrow and rewire massive
parts of our brains within less than a year?

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.050
While it’s tempting to interpret things
this way, there’s a big debate in the field

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.790
right now… and there’s no solid answer
yet.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.139
Patients with amputated limbs often report
feeling their lost or “phantom” limbs,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.670
sometimes painfully.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.379
This probably means the sensory neurons for
the lost limbs aren’t completely gone.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.349
So perhaps in the case of this boy who received
the transplant, he didn’t fully regrow new

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.140
connections, but other connections were briefly
allowed to take over.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.990
While it’ll be helpful and interesting(!)
to know what’s really going on here, the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.540
good news is that regardless, follow-ups a
year and a half after the transplant, showed

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.489
the boy can write, dress, and feed himself
more independently than before.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.249
There are more neurons in your brain than
there are websites on the internet, so what

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:34.250

Thanks for watching, talking body swaps, what
about head transplants?

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.700
Crystal tackles that heady topic -- here.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.510
One last thing: Have you done the two-point
test before?

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.439
Test out your sensory homunculus by having
a friend poke you with one or two sharp pencils

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.790
on the palm of your hand and on your upper
arm, and see how accurately you can guess

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.900
if they used one or two points on either surface,
depending how close and far apart they are.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.480
Thanks for watching!
