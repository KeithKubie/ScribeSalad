00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:01.693
- [Voiceover] What I want
to do in this video is

00:00:01.693 --> 00:00:03.931
make a little bit of what I
talked about in the last video,

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:05.777
a little bit more concrete.

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:08.844
So, let's say that the year is,

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:12.246
for the sake of simplicity,
let's say it's 1996

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:16.618
1996, and the current interest rates,

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:18.395
and I'm just going to
use round numbers here,

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.138
they don't have to be exact,

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.158
as long as you get the general idea.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.451
Let's say the current interest
rates in the United States

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.114
are 8%,

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.245
8% interest rates in the United States,

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.387
and let's say that in Thailand,

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:32.599
in Thailand, let's say,

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:38.774
Thailand, let's say that
the interest rates are

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:41.438
12%.

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:42.893
So, the last video we talked about

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.621
that you have this
interest rate discrepancy,

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:47.797
their exchange rate is being pegged

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.503
by the Thai Central Bank,

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:51.564
it's being managed,

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:54.606
this could be a tempting way to make money

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:57.091
for a Thai financial institution.

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:58.206
So, let's say it's 1996,

00:00:58.206 --> 00:00:59.961
you're a Thai financial institution,

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.083
you borrow a million dollars,

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:05.729
so you borrow, you
borrow 1 million dollars,

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.908
and this is the part where
we're going to make it

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:08.330
a little bit more concrete,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.854
and in 1996 the exchange rate,

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:14.203
let's say it's 25 Baht per dollar.

00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:15.777
So, then you convert that,

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:17.374
you convert that into,

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:18.797
and you're borrowing one million dollars,

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:20.832
let's say you're borrowing it at 8%,

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:24.524
and then you convert
that to 25 million baht.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:29.035
So, this gets turned into 25 million

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:31.079
25 million baht,

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.157
that you then lend at 12%,

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:36.710
That you just then lend at 12%.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.569
Now, let's just say for
the sake of simplicity,

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.828
this is an interest only loan,

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.540
and that the principal
is due in two years.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.786
So, we're going to call
this a two year loan.

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:48.192
So, this is a two year loan.

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.336
So, let's think about what happens,

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:51.257
how you can make money
as long as the currency

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:52.186
stay stable,

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:55.053
and how this loan will really burn you

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:57.161
if something happens with the currency.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.669
Especially if the Baht were to devalue

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:01.853
relative to the US Dollar.

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:03.929
So, while the two currencies are stable,

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.885
every year you're going to make 12%

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:09.206
on the 25 million baht that you lent,

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:10.309
and that is what?

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.036
12% of 25 million,
that's going to be what?

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.505
Four million a year?

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.356
And I'll get the calculator out
just to verify that for you.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:21.686
So, if I have 25 times

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.306
so this gonna be in millions,

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:27.217
so, 25 times 12%, it gets us,

00:02:27.217 --> 00:02:28.402
oh sorry, three million,

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:30.117
I was doing my mental map incorrectly.

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.286
So, that gives you three
million baht a year,

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:34.494
you're going to make in interest.

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:37.112
So, this is going to be three million,

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:38.595
so, you're going to
get three million baht,

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.584
it's going to come from
whoever borrowed that money,

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:44.802
three million baht,

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.548
and then to pay the interest that you owe

00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:48.624
on that dollar loan,

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:50.428
you can then convert that into,

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:52.036
you're going to get 25,

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:54.603
you're going to have 25 baht per dollar,

00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:56.774
so let's convert that into dollars,

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:58.591
so three million baht,

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.003
if you divide it by 25,

00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:02.443
is going to be,

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:04.105
so this is in millions,

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.222
so this is $120,000.

00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:11.076
So you convert this into $120,000,

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:14.764
so it becomes $120,000,

00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:16.633
and how much interest do you have to pay?

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.206
Well, you have to pay 8% on the million,

00:03:19.206 --> 00:03:21.430
which is $80,000.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.221
So, you subtract out
the 80,000 in interest,

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.706
minus 80k interest,

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:30.705
and you're left with $40,000 per year.

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.590
$40,000 per year profit.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.751
40 per year,

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:36.332
and this is just off of a million dollars,

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:37.823
you can imagine if you did
this with a billion dollars,

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:38.666
or any amount of money,

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.618
you're just getting this

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:43.321
what seems like an
almost risk free profit.

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:45.237
The reason why I say it's
almost is that this is all

00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:49.750
contingent upon this
exchange rate staying stable.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.065
Now let's see how you get
burned when you have this

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.203
devaluation of the baht.

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:57.432
And the first place it'll
just become much harder

00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:59.057
for you to do this interest.

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:01.601
So, now all of a sudden the currency's,

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.103
the baht devalues and you go to,

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:05.501
let's say you go to,

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.843
I'll just pick an arbitrary
point right over here,

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:12.273
you get to a situation where
you're at 45 baht per dollar.

00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:13.115
So, let me write this,

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:14.693
so you have devaluation,

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:17.165
devaluation,

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:19.470
and now you have 45,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.805
45 baht per US dollar.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:27.805
Up here it was 25 baht per US dollar.

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:29.234
So, let's say this is happening,

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.591
this is 1997 that we're talking about.

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.675
Now, how'd the dynamics play out?

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:35.939
Well, now your three
million baht in interest,

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.996
'cause remember you lent this in baht,

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.429
your three million baht,

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:41.607
let me write this down,

00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:43.476
are going to be how many dollars?

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:44.684
Let's get our calculator out,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.792
so now you're going to have three million,

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:49.422
and you're going to
have 45 baht per dollar,

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.623
so divided by 45, you get

00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:55.994
this is going to be about $67,000.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:58.217
So, this right over here is going to be

00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:00.273
equivalent to at this new exchange rate

00:05:00.273 --> 00:05:03.605
$67,000.

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.277
But your interest that
you owe on the dollar loan

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.523
is $80,000.

00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:11.112
$80,000 in interest,

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:15.161
and so you actually have
this $13,000 deficit

00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:16.273
that you're going to have to pay

00:05:16.273 --> 00:05:17.210
out of your pocket.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.321
So, now your little attempted arbitrage

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.656
is working against you.

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:23.328
But that's not the horrible part,

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:24.710
you might be able to still

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.973
dig up some money to pay this off.

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:29.105
But the horrible part is
what happens when you have to

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:30.335
pay off the principal,

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:31.566
this was a two year loan.

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:33.754
So, in 1998 you're going
to have to pay back

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:35.183
the million dollars.

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:36.735
Well, if everything worked out,

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.876
if the exchange rate had stayed stable,

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:40.505
the people you lent the money to

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:42.432
would give you 25 million baht,

00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:44.417
you would be able to convert
that into a million dollars

00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:45.400
and pay off the loan.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.145
But now that there's
been this devaluation,

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.339
in 1998,

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.124
in 1998, so 1998,

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:55.709
the people you lent the money to,

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:57.488
assuming you lent it responsibly,

00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:58.329
and even that's in question,

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.780
because the whole country was entering in

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.499
something of a bubble,

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.580
but you're going to get 25 million,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.237
you're going to get 25 million Thai Baht,

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:07.308
but you're not going to
be able to convert it

00:06:07.308 --> 00:06:08.573
into a million dollars anymore.

00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:11.969
We're going to have to
divide this number by 45.

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.059
So you divide 25,

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.056
divided by 45,

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:18.117
you're going to be able
to convert it to about

00:06:18.117 --> 00:06:20.932
$556,000.

00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:25.796
So, $556,000, which is too bad

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:27.846
because you owe a million dollars.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.702
You're going to be nearly $450,000 short,

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:33.448
you're going to take a
huge hit on this trade

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:35.817
that you were doing just
to make $40,000 here,

00:06:35.817 --> 00:06:37.947
because the baht devalued.

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:38.964
And you can imagine,

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.119
as people saw this coming,

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.016
so for whatever reason
people started to get afraid,

00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:45.025
they started to convert out of the baht,

00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:47.609
stop investing in Thailand as much,

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:49.420
they started to realize that
some of those investments

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.007
made in those earlier years
might have been going into

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:52.672
kind of a speculative bubble.

00:06:52.672 --> 00:06:54.535
But then when this becomes apparent

00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:57.079
that there might actually be
a banking crisis going on,

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.594
because all of these
banks were doing this,

00:06:58.594 --> 00:07:00.242
all of these actually formal banks

00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:02.564
or even informal financial institutions

00:07:02.564 --> 00:07:03.772
were doing this trade,

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:06.164
and it could bring down the
entire Thai financial system,

00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:09.826
it became even a more
self-fulfilling prophesy.

00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:12.289
Because now investors
were even more afraid

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.194
to invest in Thailand,

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:14.645
even more people were to pull out,

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.873
and that would deplete the
Thai Central Bank's reserves

00:07:17.873 --> 00:07:18.637
even more,

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:19.280
and then on top of that,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.423
even Thai citizens would become

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:21.955
afraid of the banking sector,

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.217
they would go to their banks,

00:07:23.217 --> 00:07:25.911
they want their demand deposits back,

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.587
and we all know how a
fractional reserve system works,

00:07:28.587 --> 00:07:30.474
that by itself is a bank run,

00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:32.276
and so the banks wouldn't even
have the reserves to pay it.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:36.064
So, even before the
banks take the hit here,

00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:37.214
when people see it coming,

00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:39.617
it could bring down the entire system.
