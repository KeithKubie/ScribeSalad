00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Hello, calculator fanciers

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.600
We have a real treat today!

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:13.400
A viewer, a home amateur calculator reviewer, sent me in a calculator I have never seen before

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.300
This is the Gaxio!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.940
And they emailed and said: "Have you ever seen a Gaxio"

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.620
I said I had not, and they got this shipped to me direct from the Gaxio warehouse

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.820
Wherever that may be

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.080
And so on the front you can see, it's a Gaxio FG-82MS, very nice

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.400
This is a scientific calculator

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.460
On the back, you have all the options labeled

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.040
It comes... it comes with a slide-on hard case™

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.120
Loving that and...

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh, down at the bottom there - Made in China

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.220
Some of you may think the Gaxio is a little bit familiar, looks vaguely like something you have seen before

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.580
Well, I have here our previous review we did of a Casio - a member of the FX series

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.420
and you can see - a surprising similiarities, look at that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.760
They're pretty much the same calculator, just in different packaging

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.440
one's in a slightly cheaper packet than the other

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040
Other fact - you're now watching an unboxing video in an unboxing video

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.880
Now, blatantly the calculators cannot
accidentally be this similar

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.020
when I saw this it just sent ripples through the calculator fancier community, everyone's outraged

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.480
I mean, surely if you're designing a calculator
at least design your own calculator

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.820
Don't just rip off someone else's making a cheap version of the calculator

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.020
I mean, we are outraged. I will not let this go down

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.340
I... I am I could not believe that Casio
just ripped off Gaxio's fantastic design

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.760
So let's get in there and see
what the original has to offer

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.300
Now, I am a little hesitant to break the
package,  I don't want to have to cut into it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.040
If only it came with a little tab so I could open it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.980
Aah! Here we go, look at that, so I can pop that open there

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.560
Look at it just slid out! What an action!
There's, aah,  the inst--

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.680
Oo! The instructions are bound.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.280
So often, I open a calculator, the instructions fly one way, calculator the other, I never match them back up again

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.720
This, it's all contained, very nice. Put that over there

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.620
OK, let's pop the packet open and we have...

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.060
(Drum roll please)

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.720
OK, so there's the calculator and that slide
on hard case

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300
OK, so you can see already,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.140
this covers a variety of models, so if
you own any of these

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.820
And obviously, you're going to have more than one Gaxio around the place,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.440
you can just look them up in there,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.960
very unfortunately it's  for the various FX models

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.620
and what we have here is actually the Gaxio FG-82MS, not covered by this set of instructions

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.900
Now, you might think this is very suspicious that the Gaxio FG series calculator

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.680
comes with instructions something labeled the
FX series and it's Casio as we know who

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.590
made the FX series of calculators

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.260
OK so that case did indeed slide off
hard... and, oh,  here there's the inset in there

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.900
and you can see they've not
glued it in properly, so if you decide

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.700
you want to remove it and stick it to the
outside... like so, that is entirely...

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.840
Oh, I didn't quite... OK, you get the idea anyways

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200
Look at this, this is the FG series classic, that's good

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.560
High quality manufacturing as only Gaxio can do

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.680
OK, I don't know who quality control
person 28 are but whoever he or she is,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.170
they know a perfect calculator when they
see one

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.280
Right, let's take this thing out for a spin

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.380
2 square root... oh it's around the wrong way oh my goodness

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.540
OK, O... OK hang on, so... so, 2 square root equals... nice

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.020
Times 2... oh OK. so they know if you're typing 2 a second time

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.400
you know what you've typed, why waste
an entire part of the display

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.800
when they can show you a fraction of it, that.. they've simplified it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.120
Even down here, they've taken chunks off this number here, so you don't need all those extra digits

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.260
and you can see, everyone knows the
square root of 2 is 1.411... whatever that is... 13

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.580
OK, here we go! 2, equals 31.11... something...ok

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.760
*dies of laughter*

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.600
OK, OK, hang on, hang on

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.720
OK, I'm gonna be honest with you here
31.11... whatever that is... is not quite... 2

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.300
But it's not 1.999, so... you know... it's... it's gone different...

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.200
In all new and creative ways

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.110
let's try something

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.340
a bit more down the line, let's put in
π, so we've got π down here,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.520
OK, shift, π, excellent!

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.010
And let's just try multiplying it
by one to see if it can do that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.580
Equals 3.141... something... 9
OK OK OK that's OK, that's not so bad

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.620
Let's try dividing by 0 and see what
happens here

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.360
1 divide 0 equals...

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.040
That's... it has a Meth ERROR

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.080
so you... this calculator's had too much meth

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.740
So when I was testing the inferior knockoff Casio FX

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.890
I tried the square root of 17

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.350
Square root of 17

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.760
you simply type square root of 17 you
hit equals and it tells you that it's the square root of 17

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.500
So let's see how this one
does with that square root of 17 equals... a number

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.240
OK, let's multiply that by the square
root of 17 and that equals...

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.000
Hey, hey! Hey I did it!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.400
OK, I'm doubting myself, I'm gonna to redo root 2 times root 2

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.080
equals... two!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.320
What did I do before?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.200
Obviously, the first calculation out of the box is just a warmup calculation,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.160
where it gives you a random kind of test... calibration number

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.100
Now it's it's... it's... it's actually I can feel it is genuinely it's heating up

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.020
It's now warmed up and ready to go

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.740
So as a whole it's quite...

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.080
it's got quite a nice hand feel, I mean it's got these these kind of wings, which... which is sweet

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.680
And... I mean the Casio calculators,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.160
They're reasonably heavy, they've got
what feels like a lot of plastic

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.440
Whereas these

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.710
I mean the Gaxio, it's environmentally
friendly

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.880
it doesn't use any more plastic than absolutely necessary

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.420
It's got a real light kind of... you know...

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.960
"could go at any moment" feel

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.040
And I... I appreciate that dedication to efficiency in manufacturing

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.560
Final scores for the imported Gaxio FX... oh, sorry

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.140
FG, none of that knockoff Casio rubbish

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.760
FG 82-MS

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.020
For display it's got a good display, bits of it seem to come and go all the time though,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.660
so I'm going to give it an 8... or rather most of an 8

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.900
For functionality, it's got everything I need that would be an 8

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.680
For acuracy, ooh, I wanted to give it a higher score, but it's not quite there every now and then

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.240
so I'll... I'll drop the 10 down to an 8

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.120
Ergonomics: works well in both hands, I
reckon around an 8

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.420
For cred, I mean it's got the Gaxio name, what more do you need? That's an 8

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.000
And for durability

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.960
*sound of calculator on calculator violence*

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.100
Obviously, an 8

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.800
That gives us a total score of 888

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.850
OK, that's it. Look we're going to very
quickly check that in the instructions

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:39.490
so you can see here... uhm... it's not the English bit... Chinese... Chinese... Chinese...

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.320
No English

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.880
No other languages

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.330
OK,  so normally they have every possible
language,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:53.300
here, unless you're fluent in Chinese symbols... No luck. That's... that's the Gaxio attention to detail.
