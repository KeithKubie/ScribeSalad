00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.260
JEAN-BAPTISTE HIRONDE: When I
started my company with my two

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.360
friends, I decided to create
edjing, the first free DJ

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.600
app for the large public.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
The idea came from a passion.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
I used to practice DJing
during student parties,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.725
and at this time, I didn't
find a very easy to use

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.630
and affordable
solutions for mixing.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.540
Today, we have more than
60 million downloads.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.650
edjing is the most
downloaded DJ app.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.080
We are present in 182 countries,
so I'm very proud of my team.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.890
When we launched
our app on Android,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.140
it became the largest
contributor for our growth.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.090
We earn 50% of our revenues
on the Android platform

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.380
and more than 70% of our new
downloads come from Android.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.600
SEVERINE PAYET: Our mission
is to provide great music

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660
tools for music lovers.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.260
We think that what made our
success possible in Android

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960
is the fact that we
really put effort

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.880
in designing great and
quality apps for our users.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.130
And this was also possible
thanks to the tools

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.710
that Google Play is
providing to publishers.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
Material Design was
a great improvement

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.660
for our design team.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.600
It was a more unified
and smooth experience.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.620
It made them really discover
and love the Android world.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.120
Audio latency is really
important for us.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.040
We are designing
music applications,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.850
so it has to be very
responsive and very reliable.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.384
For DJ apps, you need the
latency to be very, very low.

00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:44.050
DAMIEN DELEPINE: The
[INAUDIBLE] latency

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.990
is the audio gap between the
time we generate the sound

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.500
and when the sound actually
comes out of the speaker.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.300
On the new Android
Marshmallow devices,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.280
like Nexus 9, Nexus
5X, and Nexus 6P,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.200
we are down 20
milliseconds of latency.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.400
Thus we were able to
provide an application more

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.240
stable and more reactive so it's
usable for DJ professionals.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.200
SEVERINE PAYET: We developed
Mixfader this year.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.120
It lets you mix and
scratch directly

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.305
from your smartphone or
tablet via Bluetooth.

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:18.430
DAMIEN DELEPINE: And Android
Marshmallow developers

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.280
are able to be part of these big
negotiations between an Android

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430
device and Mixfader.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.070
Other platforms add a
minimum of 20 milliseconds

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.580
for their Bluetooth connections.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.520
We were able to reach 7.5
milliseconds of latency.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.280
We have the best experience
on the Android platform.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.680
SEVERINE PAYET: We initially
had a premium business model,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
but we started testing the
advertising model working

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.500
with AdMob.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.380
We multiplied our
revenues by two to three,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.920
depending on the app.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.840
We love Google Play, because
we can interact with our users.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.360
When they come in to leave
a review on the store,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.870
we can answer to them directly.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.550
And we can upload
and update very fast.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.682
That's something that's
a real asset for us.

00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:08.140
JEAN-BAPTISTE HIRONDE: Today
DJiT is the 10th largest music

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.880
app publisher, and
our ambition is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.790
to be the number one
within the next two years.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.560
Thanks to the audio latency
improvement on Android,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.110
we're able to develop
new music apps for users,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.830
and we can't wait for this.
