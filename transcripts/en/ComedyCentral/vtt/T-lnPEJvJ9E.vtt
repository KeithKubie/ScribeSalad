00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.240
- Like flashings,
like a flirty, like...

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.908
[giggles]

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.911
This was just,
[grunts]

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.914
<i> [dark electronic music]</i>

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:22.856
â™ª 

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.418
<i> [cheering and applause]</i>

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.653
- Hello, everybody.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.087
Welcome
to "This is Not Happening."

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.590
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,
and tonight

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.926
it's all stories
about romance.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.661
[cheering]

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.496
<i> I fucking love him.
 You'll love him too.</i>

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.632
<i> Give it up for
 Mr. Kyle Kinane, everybody.</i>

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:10.736
- This story takes place
a little over a decade ago.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.472
It was right before I moved
to Los Angeles.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.573
I was kind of making my rounds
with friends,

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.309
so-- [clears throat]
talking to a buddy,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.010
and he's like,
"Yeah," I'm like

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.013
"Hey, man, I'm leaving soon,
so if you got any time

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.081
to get together," he said,
"I'm having a birthday party

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.783
"with some co-workers.
Uh, come on out, just--

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.486
You know, hang out with
the co-workers, have a drink."

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.254
Say bye before you split town."
So I did that.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.123 align:start position:0%
[clearing throat] I met him
at a bar called Durty Nelly's,

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
'cause God knows there's not
enough Irish bars

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.262 align:start position:0%
called Durty Nelly's
in the world.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.997
So I go and I meet up
with my buddy.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.765
I get there,
my buddy's day job--

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.667
I-I know him from when
we played in bands,

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.002
so it's like weird,
it's like seeing like,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.971
like old punk rock buddy,
but his day job,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.807
he taught severely
developmentally disabled kids,

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.710
and that was--
that was his day job.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.680
And that's a--that's a hard job.
Like it only my--

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.714
I couldn't even put myself
in the shoes of people

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:58.284
that do that job,
like to deal with, you know,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.020
severely developmentally
disable--and you're there,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.322
and I-I got to the bar
and it was all teachers

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:05.024
from the school,
and they all--

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.528
They were drinking because
they needed to drink,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.163
and they--and they had the looks
on their faces,

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:15.001
like--like Vietnam veterans
have softer looks

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.504
on their faces, then
the people that teach, like,

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.139
the special ed that they taught.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.710
Like, I mean, like GG Allin
can walk around

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.078
with shit smeared on him,

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.313
but he knows
where that shit came from.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.148
It came from his own ass.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.750
Fuck GG Allin, all right?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.886
Talk to a teacher of
developmentally disabled kids,

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.322
like, "Yeah, I got shit on me.
I don't know where it came from.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.492
My back's turned,
and I don't have another shirt.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.727
Get some more shots."
That's who--

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:44.430 align:start position:0%
That's who was drinking
at the bar that day.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.235
And--and God bless them
for doing that.

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:52.772
You know? For little to no pay
that they're doing that job,

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.240
and they're all
just fucking drink--

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.708
It wasn't even beers,
it was just shots.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.011
You can cla--
Yeah, applaud for it, yeah.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:02.582
They bust their ass
and somebody's doing that.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.750
Thank God
that they're doing that,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.852
but they drank
like they did that job.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.420
They were like I said.
There was no--

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.757
There was no buffer rounds,
there just be a plate of shots.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:13.359 size:88% position:44%
And then, like, "Wait, we're
gonna wait for the beers?"

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.362
"We're not drinking beers,
pussy, just drink your shots.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
Plural.
We each get three."

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.766
"Okay."

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.702
So we're just--
We're just drinking.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.304
Just blah, like I got there,
but they--

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.140
It was--It's still daylight.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.208
[laughter]
They're school teachers.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.543
They were done at 4:00.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:35.048
It's 4:30, and they're just...
[growls]

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.652
And, uh, you know, as the shots
are going in,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.086
'cause you know--

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.890
cavorting and carousing,
you know, that's it.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.826
You know, you deal
with that trauma every day,

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.327
and you release it
however you can.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:51.497
So all the teachers are
mingling, getting together,

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.733
who's talking to who,
and now I'm left

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.836
in the side room
with a--with a gal.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.837 align:start position:0%
And there wasn't even--
really any flirting

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:00.807 align:start position:0%
there was just some talking,
and then she was--

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.743 align:start position:0%
Well, she--she was flirting
with me--she started flirting.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.079
Her way of flirting was to--
She just flashed me...

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.581
with a--

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:13.019
where there is a--with a totally
ineffected face.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:13.819
[laughter]

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.321
That's so off-putting.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.689
[laughter]

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.925
- Like flashings,
like a flirty, like...

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.359
[giggling]

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.161
This was just,
[grunts]

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:26.965
[laughter]

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:29.602
And then she just left
her shirt up.

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:32.971
Maybe she wasn't even flashing.

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:34.941 align:start position:0%
Maybe she was just
airing out her boobs.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.210 align:start position:0%
I don't know,
but just like shirt was up,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.446
and she'd look at me,
and then she'd like

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.947
start doing
something else, like,

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:43.449
"I feel like having
a cigarette."

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.052
She digged through her purse,
like, "Put your boobs--

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.987
Put your boobs away.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.857
"This is a bar and grill,
ma'am.

00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:55.795
And it is almost dinner time."

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:00.299
So that was the--
That was the flirting.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.135 align:start position:0%
That was it.
That was me and--

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.837 align:start position:0%
My guess, me and you.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:11.043
Unless I'm reading--
This messages are getting mixed.

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:13.679
Unless the airwaves
are getting scrambled.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.314
I think we're flirting

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.184
'cause your shirt's been up
for 20 minutes

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:20.153
and I have just been
looking at it.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:28.560
So then she goes,
"Let's go to my car."

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.330
That was it.
There was...

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.000
no kissing, no necking,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.002
as the young folks
like to call it.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.039
No old-fashioned necking.

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.011
"Let's go to my car."
"Okay."

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.347
'Cause I've been having
all the shots too.

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:51.583
I've been drinking
like a teacher of...

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.119
developmentally disabled people.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:56.022
I'm not built for that.
So I was pretty shithouse.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.127
So we walk out,
and her car's right there,

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.561 align:start position:0%
in front of the door.

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.429 align:start position:0%
She was the first one
at the bar.

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.866 align:start position:0%
[laughter]

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:10.136
So we just--
We get in her car.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.704
And,
"Okay, what are we gonna do?

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.573
Chit-chat?
Get to know each other?"

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:16.709
"No. Fellatio."

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.377
Just like that.
Just like,

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:19.945
"Oh, I guess I'll get
in your--What is this?

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:23.249
Like a '89, '88?
What--Oh, oh, Lord."

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.556
Just--Just right,
just there

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.991
and I don't--

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.662
Because it's--Like I said,
it's still daylight.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:40.967 align:start position:0%
There--there people going
to get meals.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.672 align:start position:0%
And I'm also drunk,
so I'm like--

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:49.274 align:start position:0%
Part of me is like,
"Fuck, whoo!"

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
And--and another part is like,
"Stop! Stop it!

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:57.516 size:84% position:42%
"There's a children section
of the menu for this place.

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:59.285 align:start position:0%
Knock it off!"

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.591
And so I'm like,

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.493
"We should--We should go around
the corner or something."

00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:09.828
She's like, "Ugh."

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:14.099
She was disgusted
by the idea of privacy.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.368
"Ugh!"

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:22.141
So, uh, fires up the car,
and we pull out.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.710
I don't know
how much shit we ran into,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.781
but just, turn the wheel
and just bumper bowled.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.687
We find a parking spot
or a yard or something.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:36.555
And, uh--

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:37.889
And there's just--

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.459
So there's some,
like, messing around,

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.862
but nothing,
and I'm like, "I don't--

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:44.830
This shouldn't happen,
but it's--

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.398
It's a mixed emotion
to be like,

00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:48.300
"Am I taking advantage of you,"
or I'll also be like,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.035
"Stop, stop touching.
Stop, stop.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:51.637
"No, s--get--no.
Get out.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.140
You get out of there."
And--

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.143
But then I feel like,
"No, I really shouldn't.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.011
And, um...

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.513
then she's like, "Well, I'm just
gonna drive home."

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.182
And that can't happen.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.718
At this moment,
she's a threat.

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:08.254
She's a threat
to the community...

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.058
And that's when I realized

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:17.897
that just, out of pure
civic responsibility...

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.268
I have to have sex
with this woman.

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:26.205
[laughter and applause]

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.378
To keep the streets
safe for the kids!

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:38.517 align:start position:0%
And, all right, if--

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.686 align:start position:0%
If keeping
you off the roadways

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.621 align:start position:0%
for a few more minutes

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.024 align:start position:0%
saves a life,
here we go.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:47.392
And then we were both
just dipping in and out

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:50.029
of consciousness
through the whole thing.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.031
There's nothing--
I mean, I don't care

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.200
how many, you know,
Bruce Springsteen,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.868
Bob Seger tunes
you hear, like,

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.070
â™ª Well,
we had sex in the car â™ª

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.572
â™ª It was fumbly, but it was
hot and sweet and innocent â™ª

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:02.742
It sucks.
No, it sucks.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:05.143
It's just shitty,
and you're trying to have sex

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:06.545
and there's just a gear shift

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.581
that's almost poking you
in the ass,

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.982
and part of you is like,
"Maybe,"

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.417
and you're like,
"Yeah, don't."

00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:15.221
Only at the fact
that one of you get excited,

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.490
bump it into neutral,
now you're in the traffic.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.327
So and then you got one knee
in the fucking change cup

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.895
and the other one
in the ashtray,

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.463
and nothing's hot about it.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.400
It's just clumsy and shitty,
and maybe you come,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.502
and maybe you fall asleep
and who knows what happens.

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:31.904
[laughter]

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.573
Either way, we both
wake up from a nap,

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:36.475
and, uh...

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.345
Both pantsless.

00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:41.981 align:start position:0%
Just waking up from a nap
pants--

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:45.851 align:start position:0%
Both just Daffy Ducking,
right in the front seat there.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.622
You know, that
that we were all--

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.257
Whatever--whatever
we built up to, it's happened.

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:56.428 align:start position:0%
So how do we...?
What do you--What do you do?

00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:58.263 align:start position:0%
Small talk, I guess.

00:09:58.263 --> 00:10:02.201
Just like, "[laughs],
so...moving to California."

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.370
[laughter]

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.940
She just goes, "My kids live
in California."

00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:13.144
And--and she took out a picture
of her kids.

00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:17.216
Her kids were as old as I was.

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:20.352
Like I'm thinking,
"Kids," like, "We're having sex,

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:22.120
so your kids, like,
"No, your kids are--

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.227
Oh, my God, how many?
Jeez, you got hot kids, lady.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:31.464
Oh, I just banged the mom
of some hot kids."

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.301
That was the end
of that effort.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.302
"Moving to California?
Look at my hot kids!"

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:40.139
All right.
Dead end.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.474
Still sitting there.
It's rude to leave, you know?

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:45.644 align:start position:0%
Plus, we were still drunk.
I don't know.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:48.714 align:start position:0%
And suddenly I see a cassette
tape laying there,

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:51.350 size:84% position:42%
I'm like, "Oh, all right.
Look at that, oh, Journey."

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.820 align:start position:0%
Thank God.
Everybody likes Journey

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.590
and how metaphoric, because
what has this evening been?

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.026
[laughter]

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.995
She takes it off my hand,
now she gets mean.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.329
She takes it off my hand,
she's like,

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:08.167
"That Journey I taped over it!"
"Oh, no!"

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.038
"With what?
A slightly better band?"

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:15.040
"No."
Puts it in the cassette deck.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.677
Christian rock music.
"Oh, mm, mm."

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:22.848
Which she promptly starts
singing along to,

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.384
because she realized
she sinned.

00:11:29.587 --> 00:11:31.222
So I thought I was gonna just--

00:11:31.222 --> 00:11:34.460
I thought I was gonna
not stop believing.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.395
Now I don't
believe in anything.

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.530
[laughter]

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.300
I still don't wanna leave.
It still seems rude to leave.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.937
Like, maybe she just likes
the chord progressions.

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:50.609
She was like, "Oh, it's not--
It's not Journey for sure.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:53.245
It's Christian.
You're a Christian?"

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:57.550
And somehow we just let logic

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.386 align:start position:0%
to where...she just--

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.822 align:start position:0%
Forgetting that she believed
in Jesus, decided to get

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:08.460
real upset and say,
"It's all your fault,

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.232
because the white man stole
my people's land."

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.605
At no point did we discuss

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:22.074
ethnicity at all

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:24.743
in the evening

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:27.813
and, um...

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.415
"I'm gonna go."

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.250
[laughter]

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.187
That is kind of a good argument
against the white guy.

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.923
It's just, "You stole
my people's land."

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.124
"You got--
You got me."

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:41.927
[laughter]

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:45.964
"I don't know what else to do.
Did we wear a condom?

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:49.101
Never mind.
I'm gonna go."

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.769
And, um...

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.339 size:78% position:39%
I just, uh--Yeah, I left.

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:56.008
I got out of the car
at that point,

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.676
'cause I realized there was
nothing I was gonna do

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:00.779
that was gonna remedy
the situation,

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:03.182 align:start position:0%
and, uh...

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.951 align:start position:0%
I hope she's well.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.189 align:start position:0%
There's no...cool moral

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:15.460 align:start position:0%
or a sweet little bow
on the story.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.463
Just a--Just a yarn about
how I stuck my dick

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:19.998
where it shouldn't have gone.

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:21.233
[laughter]

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:23.201 align:start position:0%
That's it,
so thanks, everybody.
