00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
Oh, yeah look at that. That's beautiful.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.080
Hey, what's up guys welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.320
I'm hanging out again with my buddy Nate, and we are getting ready to play with some colored pyrotechnics

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.820
We scrolled down into the comments and found this request from Benjamin Yonkers that says "make colored smoke bombs plz plz plz"

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.549
Making colored smoke. This is something that I've been trying to do for about six years with common ordinary chemicals.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.740
I've tried using colored crayons, I've tried potassium nitrate,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
I've tried all the recipes I found online in all different variations with absolutely no success.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570
I've also reached out to my friend NurdRage, and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.250
contacted pyrotechnic companies and the feedback

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.849
I'm getting from all these sources is those recipes online may not actually work. If you've tried any of them yourself you'd probably understand my

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.309
frustration.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.360
So in this video we're going to show you step by step how to make colored smoke bombs that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.480
actually work. Now unfortunately, we do have to crush your expectations; to get this to actually work,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.140
we had to reach out to a pyrotechnics company and order specialized chemicals, but now that we've got them,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.709
we're gonna tell you what they are and what recipes we're using to achieve these results

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.660
I think we can all be proud of.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.070
The chemicals we're using for this recipe, our potassium chlorate, lactose, magnesium carbonate, industrial dyes and good old-fashioned baking soda.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.070
Now I got my potassium chlorate and lactose from a pyrotechnic supply company; You can synthesize potassium chloride, however

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.330
it's not very easy or practical to do at home. Now Lactose on the other hand, you've heard of people being lactose

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.100
intolerant and that's because lactose is extracted from cow's milk. That's where this stuff came from. How does this stuff taste?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900
(THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME)

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.820
It's a little bit sweet, but I wouldn't recommend eating it by itself

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.500
I wonder if you can mix it with water and make milk.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
Magnesium carbonate is an inorganic salt

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.000
that's obtained by mining a mineral called magnesite, so this stuff feels kind of like powdered sugar, but it's even lighter and less dense.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.520
The industrial dyes you see here came from a company called Walrus Enterprises,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.080
now they deal on massive scale they're used to dealing in 50 pounds or more

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.060
So for me to get 1-pound samples was very difficult and very expensive, but here they are, and of course household baking soda,

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.700
which you can pick up at the grocery store.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.049
So before we color our smoke the plan is to make a double batch of all the white ingredients

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.680
So we'll separate those into six different piles

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.219
then we'll measure out the dyes and add those to the six different piles giving us our different colors in theory. So that'll give us

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.400
six different samples to play with, so we can test whether or not they're even gonna work. Let's get busy!

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.360
*makes evil concoction*

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.380
So here we are guys, We have a hundred and twenty-eight grams of our smoke composition and base. the recipe that we used was 27%

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.650
potassium chlorate, 18% lactose, 16% magnesium carbonate, and 3% baking soda. So what we're gonna

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.789
do now is divide this white powder into six different piles, just over 21 grams each,

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:43.300
then we're gonna measure out 12 grams of each of the colored dyes, mix those in, and theoretically we should get some colored smoke.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:58.640
*makes colorful concoction*

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.890
Now we've just made our first composition here.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.640
This is the yellow smoke. We put it in a penny wrapper with a fuse sticking out the top here,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640
We're just gonna test this off to make sure they're even gonna work at all.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610
Oh, back up!

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.670
Oh yeah, look at that. That's beautiful.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.050
Oh, that's beautiful, and a very rich yellow.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.000
It looks like we got the ratio right. If this were too little,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.039
it wouldn't be burning off at all, if it was too much, the dye would actually be turning black. So we found a very good

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.500
Ratio here--Ooh, and it's getting hot yikes! *inaudible*

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.780
Dang!

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.100
So our first test was very successful getting them to go off in the penny wrappers. My question now is, what happens if we

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.500
just let this burn in the open air? So let's set the powder down in a brick, and use a lit fuse

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.900
to see if we can get it to ignite.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.620
*Lights fuse* Ready?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.420
Ha-ha-haha, it just kind of blows it away. Whoa!

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.100
Oh, Look, a little bit of it's burning. Oh, and it's spreading. Yeah, a little bit of it's burning it did catch, and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.529
I definitely see yellow smoke coming off that.That is thick yellow smoke. I got to back away.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.240
Whoa?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.969
That's--uh, some of yesterday's flash powder. Now it looks like we are pollinating the neighborhood.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.640
All right guys. I'm calling that a success. Yellow smoke bomb is in the bag. Let's go load up six more.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:33.480
*makes more colorful concoctions

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.440
Alright guys update now that we know that our test smoke bomb worked

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.370
We divided all the powder up into tubes

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.090
And we got 21 different smoke bombs that was enough for 3 from every color

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.560
And we had a little bit extra so we have three that are all of the colors mixed together so now that we know these

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.919
things work

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.329
there's only one thing left to do that's to take them outside line them all up and let them off at the same time so

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.830
we can see how all the colors work together through outside. We're gonna set off a test of blue smoke grenade

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.639
just so we can see which way the wind is blowing then we've got a whole line up we're gonna set up all at once.

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.159
You're on the GoPro

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.260
That was kind of interesting we had all kinds of different colors there we had like violets blues live with gray smoke

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.040
But I'm calling that a success because it was colored, so let's go ahead and get the whole lineup and light them off at once

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.660
There we go

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.040
(RAINBOWS)

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.800
We're all kind of going the wrong way, let's look at that there

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.280
(MORE RAINBOWS)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And still went for the white car

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.859
That's pretty cool. All right so that first test didn't really work out so well

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.490
We actually lined everything up so the smoke was blowing right in line with each other so this time

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.949
We've offset it a little bit. We should get a little bit better flow

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.680
I got him. That's why we have a backup.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.500
Oh, that's pretty

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.400
Red has such beautiful orange in it

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.579
So that one worked a lot better

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.609
We actually put it so that the wind was blowing it this way and we could see all the colors

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.819
You could see we actually had red orange yellow blue

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.019
We had two violet we had the black all didn't seem to work really really well in this mixed color

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.920
Wasn't just black smoke was it Nate. Yeah, it was just kind of a black mix with maroon a really dark purple maybe.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.700
Kinda like an Ursula purple, that's like that dark evil purple, which is really really fun

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.980
We got a few left over, so we're just doing it one more time

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.400
So from our experiences so far, guys, it looks like these are working every single time. We're getting very consistent colors

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.130
we've got thick smoke, everything looks really good so for one final experiment,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.960
why don't we make a legitimate smoke grenade out of PVC pipe light it off and throw it off and see how that goes

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.560
*makes evil components*

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:55.240
*makes evil, colorful grenades*

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.340
So update guys, we just made some really cool

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.199
looking smoke grenades each of them are a different color, and there's quite a bit of composition, so they should burn a little longer

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:06.429
I'm thinking these will actually be safe to hold on to the bottom of it before it heats up too much

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.410
So I'm gonna try that I'm gonna hold this in my hand light it off and watch the smoke waft off and observe the results

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.540
Light it up

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.100
Cool

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.420
Moment of truth; is it going to work? Is the red smoke grenade gonna work?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.400
Booya, I think that's yes

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.210
Oh, that's gorgeous; look at that. Look at the way it's wafting up into clouds there. That's gorgeous

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:41.540
(I HAVE THE POWER)

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.680
You know what awesome thing is you could probably throw this thing like smoke grenade style

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:51.439
And just like have it roll into a building if you're playing airsoft or paintball would that be an epic smoke grenade

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.870
I'm gonna go get that before it stains this

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.329
It's still going that was awesome we got three more. Let's light another one

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.450
Yes

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.600
(Grant) Yes. Wow mine spitting off little... yellow- spitting fountains
(Nate) There's the green, that's got some good burn[?]

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.700
(Grant) That is actually pretty cool. Look at that.
(Nate) Oh, so is the blue.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.060
Did it get hot? No.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.680
Whoa, that's beautiful. Let's interchange them; let's mix them like this

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.460
That's getting dusty[?]. Yep. Yep it is

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.250
That was amazing. That's a lot of smoke

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.039
The PVC actually is a better thermal insulator in this case than steel; that steel got really really hot

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.020
The PVC worked out really nicely though

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.150
I can hold this and it's actually really cool to the touch the steel on the other hand you got to like play hot potato with it.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.910
That is quite warm, quite warm to the touch

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.810
What would have been cool is if we would have juggled these while they were blowing smoke

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.619
That would have been epic. In any case, I think we've got a pretty good show we learned something here

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.520
we got colored smoke to work. I'm calling that a success. So you have it guys,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.840
that's how you use potassium, chlorate, lactos, a little bit of baking soda and some colored dye to make yourself some colored smoke, the right way -

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.000
the way that actually works. And a huge shout out to our friend Benjamin Yonkers for putting this suggestion down in the comments below,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.280
you can go check your YouTube inbox Benjamin, we're sending you 25 bucks

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.000
We've got a lot of materials left over so if there's anything you want to see us do with it

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.270
tell us about it in the comments. That's right and thanks for joining us for this experiment today guys,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.270
we'll be looking for you. The next one to talk to you then.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.800
Oh, look at that you can actually see like all the ash leftover on the inside. Wonder if that means these could be reusable

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.520
Whoop. Ha-ha-haha

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.020
Colorful[?] smoke. Here we gotta... get a different direction
