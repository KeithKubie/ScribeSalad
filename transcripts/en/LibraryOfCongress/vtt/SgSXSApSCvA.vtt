&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
Good morning everyone.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.330
Thanks for coming to the
National Book Festival today.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.290
I'm Guy Lamolinara and I work
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
All day here, at the Library of
Congress National Book Festival;

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.240
we are recognizing and
celebrating the importance

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.920
of reading, and authors
and books.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.200
The library makes it seem
easy to do every year,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.250
but the truth is the National
Book Festival is a huge

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.870
undertaking, a huge financial
undertaking, but yet is free

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.420
for everyone because
of the generous support

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.860
from our sponsors
and supporters.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.730
So, please spread the joy of
reading with your gift online

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.940
if you can at loc.gov/donate
and you can do

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.890
that from the festival app or
when you purchase books today.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.190
Now onto the event that
you all are here for.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.160
Before I begin, I want to

where she faithfully writes two
pages a day five days a week.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.390
I've personally been lucky to
know Kate for several years

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.240
and I can tell you as you
would suspect that she is one

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.180
of the nicest people
you could ever meet.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.990
I can also tell you Kate
has the world's best laugh.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.350
So what you want to
do is make Kate laugh

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.630
and you will not
be disappointed.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.360
The work of Harry Bliss is
very familiar to anybody

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.540
who reads the New
Yorker magazine.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.190

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.510
Please welcome Kate
DiCamillo and Harry Bliss.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.100
[ Applause ]

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.640
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: So,
how are you all doing?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.270
We don't have very long together
and Harry and I were trying

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.790
to figure out how to do this to
maximize it and we both agreed

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.570
that what we would like to do
is to talk with you all as much

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.760
as possible and Harry also
volunteered that he could have,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.730
do I get this right, a
volunteer come up and do a.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.030
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Scribble.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.330
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: A scribble

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.720
and then he would
turn it into a.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.020
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Masterpiece.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.890
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah, a
masterpiece, a masterpiece.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.510
So, this; so, the first
question is does that sound good

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.130
to have Harry do that?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.430
[Applause] Yes.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.800
And then the second question
is, do you all have questions

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.160
and we can just kind
of interact?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.830
We'll show you, well
let's just do a,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.250
we'll show you a
little bit about what

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.230
"Good Rosie" is about, and
typically when an author

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.920
and illustrator do books
together you don't do

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.470
them together.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.860
Usually the publisher
decides who's going

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.900
to illustrate a book, but Harry

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.340
and I had done a book together
before and we had also,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.660
Harry had illustrated a
poem that I had written

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.940
that had a dog in
it and we had wanted

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.980
for a longtime to do a dog book.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.950
So, we collab; we decided that
we were going to do this book

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.280
and it is; how many
of you all have dogs?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.580
That's excellent.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.380
How many have cats?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.820
Okay. So, Harry and
I are dog people.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.720
So, this is just the story of
a dog who meets some other dogs

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.300
at a dog park and not a lot
happens, but a lot happens.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.720
So, Harry do you want to take
it from there for a minute?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.020
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah,
with the book?

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.320
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Yeah with the book.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.620
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.920
I love dogs.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.160
I love all animals, but in
particular, I'm fifty-four

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.460
and something happened.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.840
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
I'm fifty-four too.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.140
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.440
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.740
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: You Pisces?

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.040
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
I'm an Aries.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.340
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Oh, okay.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.640
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.050
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: So, yeah
this is serendipitous

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.350
that this book came about.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.310
So, this is George and
Rosie lives with George.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.610
Rosie is a good dog.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.910
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.210
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: You're
supposed to read this, right?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.510
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Oh, should I read it?

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.810
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah, well
let's go to the next one.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.110
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Oh.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.690
Oh, Harry isn't that
beautiful art I have to say?

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.010
I mean, it's just like don't
you want to pick her up?"

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.310
[ Applause ]

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.610
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Thank you.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.290
Well, I chose, I chose to do
this in comic sequential panels

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.310
because I'm a cartoonist and I
love panels and I love the fact

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.630
that you can, the time, the
space between the panels it's

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.570
like a little beat in music
like a rest if you will, so.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.330
So, there's Rosie and
she lives with George

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.950
and Rosie's a lonely dog.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.250
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Right.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.550
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.850
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
She's lonely.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.150
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.450
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: She
feels a certain melancholy

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.840
which is a word that shows up
in a lot of my stuff actually.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.270
But let's not think about that.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.570
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Let's
not talk about that.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.870
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Yeah, okay alright.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.170
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: But
it's a good work though.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.470
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.770
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: It is.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.070
Rosie and George walk together

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.510
and sometimes Rosie
chases squirrels.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.370
She runs very fast,
as fast as she can,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.350
but she never catches anything.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.720
You want to do George?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.600
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Rosie
always returns to George.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.560
I've been a good
dog Rosie, good dog.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.670
But I can't see that part
over there where George.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.970
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.270
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Talks
about the clouds, yeah.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.570
What does it say?

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.870
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Well, he's "Look

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.660
at the clouds Rosie
aren't they magnificent?"

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.540
"That one looks like
Abraham Lincoln."

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.370
George thinks that the clouds,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.240
that most clouds
look like presidents.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.060
Rosie thinks that most
clouds look like squirrels.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.850
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: One day
George sees something different

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.180
in the clouds.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.480
Say it.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.780
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: "Look Rosie!

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.260
That one looks like a dog!"

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.060
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: "The
cloud does look like a dog."

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.700
Rosie wags her tail,
"Hello, hello!"

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.000
she shouts.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.300
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: "Woof-woof."

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.850
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: The dog
cloud does not answer her.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.950
Rosie feels lonely in an
empty bowel sort of way.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.960
George looks down at Rosie.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.630
He looks up at the cloud.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.930
"Hmm."

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.230
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Hmm.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.120
"I've got an idea Rosie.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.930
Let's try something new."

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.750
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: And
something new is going

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.890
to be the dog park which is
where all the action begins.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.810
Can you flip forward so we
can see some of who she meets?

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.300
This is Maurice.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.290
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah,
she meets Maurice.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.590
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: [Brief
laughter] It doesn't go well

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:54.150
at first and then can you
flip until we see Fifi?"

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.450
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Fifi
comes along.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.750
There's Fifi.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.050
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.350
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: "Yip-yip."

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.650
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Yeah, there's Fifi, yeah.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.640
And with both of these dogs
it doesn't go well at first,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.830
but they [brief laughter], they
figure out how to be friends.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.160
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: After
some real drama.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.460
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Yeah, after some drama.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.760
So.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.060
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: You know.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.360
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: That's one

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.300
of my favorite panels,
"Drop it!"

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.600
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.900
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: "Drop it!"

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.200
Yeah.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.500
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Dogs being dogs.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.930
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: And that's
Fifi's tail hanging out there.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.770
Yeah. But we won't, we won't
tell you all what happens,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.830
but there is a little bit drama
and everything turns out okay.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:37.370
But let's, let's see if you
guys want to ask questions

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.330
and then let's have
Harry do the art.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.630
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.930
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Do you think?

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.230
Because we can't.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.530
Yes.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.830
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.630
My favorite book that
I ever wrote myself?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.780
Are you here with
a parental unit?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.440
Where is that parental unit?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.220
Oh, somewhere over there, okay.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.000
And do you have brothers
and sisters?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.680
So, where is the
mother of this child?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.550
Because I've got a
question for you which is,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.570
which of the children
do you love the best?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.340
And I know, I know what
your mom would say.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.470
"I love them equally,
but differently"

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.330
and that's the same way I feel

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.080
about any books that
I've written.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.340
I see them as like deeply
flawed but loveable anyway

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.770
which is I'm not saying you're
deeply flawed, you seem lovely,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.190
but do you know what I mean?

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.700
There are just, I feel intense
love for them that's equal

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.180
but I see them as individuals.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.370
Yes.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.730
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.030
What inspired me to write

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.000
"Because Winn-Dixie" is
a good question for now

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.390
because I had moved from
Florida to Minneapolis

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.910
and it was the first time in my
life I had been without a dog

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.500
and we know how many of you all
have dogs and also that some

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.800
of you have cats, but I just
could not, I could not get

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.360
over the fact that
I didn't have a dog.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.890
I couldn't have one in the
apartment where I lived,

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.210
and also it was a brutal
winter in Minnesota

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.480
and I was homesick for Florida.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.230
So, Winn-Dixie takes
place in Florida

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.990
and Winn-Dixie is
centered around a dog.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.850
I could not have a dog, but
this is the beauty of writing

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.740
and of creating things.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.330
I could make-up the best
dog that I could imagine

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.180
which was Winn-Dixie
the biggest, smelliest,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.990
smilingest dog in the
world, so that's--

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.770
that's where that came from.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.910
Yes, yes I see you.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.050
&gt;&gt; Hi Kate, it's
lovely to see you.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.360
Winn-Dixie was far and
away our daughters,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.090
three daughters favorite
book of all-time,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.740
so we do have a favorite.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.740
I'm asking you, did you
have a Jack Russell in mind

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.710
when you wrote the story?

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.760
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Did I
have a Jack Russell in mind

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.080
when I wrote this story?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.380
Did I Harry?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.820
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: No, I
don't think you did.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.120
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: No.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.420
I didn't. This is, but
this is the wonderful thing

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.260
about working with somebody
else's; what happened was Harry

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.900
and I saw each other at a
conference in North Dakota

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.420
and we're like when are we
going to do that dog book?

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.480
And it was a really
instructive moment for me,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.410
because Harry said on the plane
back, he started doing sketches.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.220
We didn't know what
we were going to do,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.260
but he just started
making sketches of dogs

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.490
and he sent them to me and I
just kind of got a feel and none

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:36.190
of those were Jack Russells,
but that's where we started

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.110
and I started with just the feel
of those dogs and then tried

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.490
to feel my way into the story.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.610
So, why did you select
a Jack Russell?

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.910
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Jack Russell,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.080
it's just they are
feisty little dogs

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.710
and they're beautiful,
all the color.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.850
A buddy of mine had a Jack
Russell when I was growing up.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.460
I just, they're just
adorable dogs.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.490
I just, there's something
about a Jack Russell that.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.790
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
There's some.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.010
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: I think to the
fact that Rosie is a female.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.310
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Right.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.610
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: I
don't know why,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.910
but Jack Russell's always look

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.210
like females even
though they can be male.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.510
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Wow.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.810
Alright, let's hope
the Jack Russells

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.120
of the world aren't listening,
you really hurt, okay.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.420
So, yes.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.290
&gt;&gt; My daughter would like
to know if you're going

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.880
to write a book about a cat

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.020
or if you would consider
writing a book about a cat?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.320
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: So,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.670
am I going to write
a book about a cat?

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.260
Well, I did have a cat show
up in "Raymie Nightingale."

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.560
What about you Harry?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.860
You got a cat book in you?

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.340
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: I don't know.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.160
I'm going to retire soon, so.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.330
I do love cats though
I have to say.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.890
&gt;&gt; Did you read comic
books when you were a kid,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.800
because of "Flora
and Ulysses" you,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.520
there's a lot of comic books.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.820
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah,

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.120
so did I read comic
books when I was a kid?

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.720
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yes.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.050
And what I lived for, and Harry
and I have talked about this,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.190
and I know that you've read
way more comics than I did,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.930
but for me it was Peanuts.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.230
I would go to the library

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.800
and there were these
huge Peanuts' treasuries

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.010
that while we, my brother and
I like wore those to shreds

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.760
and we were the only
people in the library

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.610
that checked them out, but we
just read those and read those

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.400
and read those and it really
informed not only "Flora

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.760
and Ulysses", but my love of
Peanuts shows up in this book

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.970
and Harry's love of Peanuts
shows up in this book, so.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.270
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah, it's true.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.260
There was a certain kind,
well melancholy is Peanuts

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.870
that I love and I still
love it to this day and I,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.420
those same treasuries.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.720
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.510
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: I had to
buy them again, you know,

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.910
because I beat them up
so much, but yeah Peanuts

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.620
and I love the fact that those
kids all populated that space

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.920
by themselves without
any adults.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.220
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Right.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.520
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: They
also suffered.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.820
You know, they dealt
with, you know,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.680
some Charlie Brown was a
little depressed and a.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.980
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Right.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.280
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: You know.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.580
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: And, and.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.880
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: They had issues.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.180
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: And
they asked big questions.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.480
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: They
asked big questions.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.780
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yeah.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.080
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yes.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.380
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: And
I love big questions.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.680
Yeah.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.980
&gt;&gt; What is your first
book that you ever wrote?

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.280
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: What's my
first book that I ever wrote?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.090
I have to know what your shirt
says, "Mermaids have more fun."

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.420
Oh, I would have said "Mermaids
have a great tale" you know,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.610
t-a-l-e, but I'm not in charge

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.820
of your T-shirt but
I like it anyway.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.220
Okay, so my first book was
"Because of Winn-Dixie"

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.740
and Harry what was your first?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.250
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: A, my first
book was actually "Little Lit."

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.180
It was a compilation
of other parts

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.270
from telling old folk tales,
so I was in that book.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.570
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
What year was that?

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.220
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Wow,
1999 I think.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.520
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Okay.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.820
Alright.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.120
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Yeah.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.420
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo:
Um, yes sorry.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.720
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask a little

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.160
about your beginning
years; were they structured?

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.090
Did you have a lot
of empty time?

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.390
Were you a dreamer?

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.410
Did you go to preschool?

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.360
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: You
really do want to know

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.660
about the early years, yeah.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.060
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us of what
might have encouraged this great

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.740
imaginative ability of yours?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.970
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: You
kind of make me teary.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.510
So, who was I as like a kid?

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.490
Alright, I was a kid that
grew up in a small town

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.610
in central Florida and,
and on a dead end street

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.310
with a neighborhood that was
all young kids on one side

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.450
and then three widow
ladies on the other side.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.560
And so, the kids had
the run of the street

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.900
and also those three widow
ladies were all gardeners

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.660
and also were really glad
that all the kids were there

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.750
and we were welcome to
come into their houses

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.640
and onto their porches
and talk with them and all

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.480
of that shaped me considerably.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.780
Did I go to preschool?

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.080
I did go to preschool.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.380
I loved it.

Any real artist never likes
school I guess, but I loved it.

It was just like I loved it.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.830
I loved reading and I was
lucky enough to have a mother

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.020
who facilitated my love
of reading and made sure

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.520
that I always had books,
bought them for me,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.700
took me to the library
and read to me.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.000
Can, and speaking of reading,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.590
can I ask how many
teachers are out there?

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.000
How many of you teachers read
out loud to your classes?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.070
Can we have a round
of applause for that?

I didn't really fit
in in school.

library saved my life honestly.

I will just say,
that's totally true.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.370
So, I want to always make
the point of saying how much,

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.310

of trouble had it not
been for libraries.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.040
My mom took me as a
little boy to, you know,

about losing my mom.

in schools all over the place is

to turn these scribbles
into something.

and I kind of see

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.550
if I can turn it into something.

what this could be?

so someone said no.

But don't join the
crowd, you know.

So, when that's happening

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.090
in your brain there are actually
various lobes of your brain

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.440

up right now,

on this on fMRI's.

looking at this?

I'm going to, great; I'm going
to paraphrase what she said.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.460
So, she read Winn-Dixie in class

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.840
and when she first started
reading she didn't know what the

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.870
word "melancholy" meant,
and then she learned it

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.280
from the book and you learned it

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.260
because of Littmus
Lonzenges right?

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.700
Because they produce a
feeling of melancholy in you,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.790
and then also a friend
of hers went to Florida

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.050
and saw a Winn-Dixie store

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.790
and I remember the first
time I did a signing

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.280
where somebody came through the
line and showed me a picture

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.410
of a Winn-Dixie grocery
store and they're like "Look!

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.710

say about words,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:39.000
and that how much you absorb
words through a story, and so,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.330
people are always worried
about reading level

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.590
and you can learn
any word, right?

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.920
You're learning a ton of words
you might as well learn the word

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.200
"melancholy" and you
learned it right?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.720
So, well-done.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.170
Okay, one more question
and we're going to,

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.350
it's going be an
adult back there;

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.430
an adult child a
combination, okay yes.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.030
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yes.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.660
&gt;&gt; So, I was interested in the
inspiration for Edward Tulane

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.960
which is my favorite
book of yours

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.590
and my son has a
related question.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.000
&gt;&gt; Why did you make
Edward Tulane a rabbit?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.180
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Okay,
I can answer that question.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.420
So, how many of you all
have read Edward Tulane?

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.510
Okay, so where did
the story come from?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.430
It came from receiving
a rabbit doll as a gift

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.820
and when the friend handed
me this rabbit doll I said,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.120
"What's his name?"

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.420
And she said, "Edward."

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.470
And I said, "Thank you very
much" and I took him home

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.510
and I put on the couch in
my living room and he's big.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.280
He's like he comes up to here.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.480
He's dressed in this
very elegant outfit

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.390
and every time I walked
into the living room,

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.100
I screamed because he's a
really creepy looking rabbit

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.390
and he's just sitting
there like this.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.840
So, like the third night that he
was in the house I had a dream

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.210
about him where he
was under water face

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.900
down on the ocean floor
with no clothing on.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.020
It's your basic naked
rabbit dream.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.500
And I think that most writers
have naked rabbit dreams

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.800
and probably artists.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.100
&gt;&gt; Harry Bliss: Many.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.400
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamilllo: Yes, right.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.700
Yeah. And I just am the fool

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.000
who will standup here
and talk about it.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.670
So, I thought that seems like
the beginning of a story,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.100
so that's where Edward
came from.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.750
And can I, let's do
one thing in closing,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.360
for all of you books
matter so much.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.240
Seeing other people in
stories and seeing yourself

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.510
in stories matters
so much right now.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.240
So, thank you for being
here for books and thank you

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.010
for believing in the
power of stories.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.700
[ Applause ]

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.750
We're going to sign
somewhere, so thank you,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.180
thank you for being here.
