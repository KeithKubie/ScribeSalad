00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.490
Let's do some more examples finding do
mains of functions.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.590
So let's say we have a function g of x. So this is our
function definition here tells us, look,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.690
if we have an input x, the output g of x is going to
be equal to 1

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.400
over the square root of 6

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.699
minus -- we write this little bit neater, 1

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.080
over the square root

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.650
of 6 minus the absolute value of x

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.960
So like always, pause this video and see if
you can figure out what

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.000
what is the domain of this function.
Based on this function definition what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.219
is the domain of g?

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.780
What is the set of all inputs for which
this function is defined?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.730
Alright. So, to think about all of the
inputs that would allow this function to

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.090
be defined, it may be easier to state when
is this function

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.510
not get defined. Well if we divide by 0

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.910
then we're not going to be defined. Or if
we have a negative

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.940
under the radical. So if you think about
it -- if if what we have under the radical

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.049
is 0 or negative -- if it is 0 or
negative. If it's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.070
0, you can take the, you can take the
principal root of 0. It's going to be 0.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.130
But then you are going to divide by 0.
That's going to be undefined.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.810
And if what you have another radical is
negative, the principal root isn't

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.170
defined for native number, at least the
classic principal root is a defined for

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.100
a negative number. So if 6 minus the absolute
value of x is zero or negative,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.770
this thing is not going to be defined.
Or another way to think about it is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.740
it's going to be defined -- so g is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.799
is defined -- is defined

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.240
if -- g is defined

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.280
if 6 minus, maybe I can write if and only if.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.770
Sometimes people write if and only if
with two f's right there, iff.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.570
g is defined if and only if --

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.810
this is kind of mathy way of saying if and
only if -- 6 minus the absolute value

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.250
of x is greater than 0

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.979
it has to be, it has to be positive.
If it's zero,

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.020
we're going take the square root of 0 is 0. 
Then you divide by 0. That's undefined. And if it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.319
less than zero, then you're taking, you're
trying to find the principal root of a negative

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.709
number, that's not defined.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.569
So let's see, it's g is defined if and only
if this is true.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.230
And let's see. We could add the absolute
value

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.800
of x to both sides. We could add the
absolute value of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.040
x to both sides, then that would give us 6

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.140
is greater than the absolute value of x,
or that the absolute value of x

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650
is less than 6. Or we could say that,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.720
you know, let me write that way. 
The absolute value of x is less than 6.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.950
Another way of saying that is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.860
x would have to be less than 6 and
greater than negative 6.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.920
or x is between negative 6 and 6.
These two things --

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.799
these two things are equivalent. If the
magnitude of x is less than 6

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.860
then x is greater than negative 6 and
less than positive 6.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.100
So if we wanted to write the domain in
kinda fancy domain-set notation,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.430
we could write the domain of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.709
g is going to be x, all the x's that are
a member of

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.250
real numbers such that negative 6

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.430
is less than x, which is less than

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.900
6, and we're done. Let's do another one.
And this was gonna get even a little bit

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.540
a little bit hairier, just for, just for
kicks. Alright.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.050
So let's say that I have --

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.910
let's say that I have -- h of x

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.590
is equal to --  and I have a kind of
composite definition here.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.940
So let's say it's x plus 10

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.040
over x plus

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.470
10 times x minus 9

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.470
times x minus 5

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.520
times x minus 5 and it's this if it --

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.760
h of x is this if x does not equal

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.900
5 and it's equal to -- it's equal to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.270
pi if x is equal

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.490
if x is equal to 5. So once again, pause
this video.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.970
Think about what is the domain of h, or
another way to think about is what made h

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.989
not defined? So let's think about it.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.000
So what would make h not defined?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.700
So if some -- if x is anything other than 5,
we go this clause. If it's 5, we go this clause.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.290
So in this clause up here, what would make
this thing undefined?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.910
Well the most obvious thing is if we
divide by 0.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.700
So what's going to cause us to divide by
0? So

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.169
if -- if x is equal to

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.169
if -- let me write it here -- so we're going
to divide by 0 --

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.600
divide by 0.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.120
That would happen if x is equal to 9.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.520
That would happen if x is equal to negative 10.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.669
x is equal to negative 10. Now we have to be
careful, would that happen

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.890
if this was the only definition here, it
would happen when x equals to 5.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.100
But remember when x is equal 5, we don't
look at this part

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.030
of the compound definition. We look at this
part. So it's true that up here you would

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.030
be dividing by 0 if x is equaling 5
but x equaling 5, you wouldn't even look at --

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.650
look there. For input is 5,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.690
you use this part of the definition. So you'd

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.110
divide by 0. Maybe I should write it this way,
divide by 0

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.540
on, I guess you could say the top -- the top

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.870
clause or the top part a definition. Part

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.180
of the definition.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.980
If x equals 9, X equals negative 10
or -- and that's it

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.750
because x equal 5 doesn't apply to this
top part. If this clause wasn't here

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.060
then yes, you would write x equals 5.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.490
Now we're almost done, but some of you 
might say, wait, wait, wait, but look,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.160
can't I simplify this? I have x plus 10 in
the numerator and x plus 10 in the denominator.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.450
Can I just simplify this and that will
disappear?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.630
And you could except, if you did that, you
are now creating a different

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.920
function definition. Because if you just
simplify this, you just said 1 over x minus 9 --

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.910
1 over x minus 9 times x minus 5.
This is now a different function.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.250
That one actually would be defined at x
equals negative 10. But the one that we

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.840
have started with, this one is not. This
is -- you're gonna end up with 0 over 0.  You

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.470
gonna end up with that

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.010
indeterminate form. So for this function,
exactly the way it's written,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.200
it's not going to be defined with
x is equal to 9 or x is equal to

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.940
negative 10. So once again if you want a fan --
write in our fancy

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.420
domain set notation. The domain

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.970
is going to be x

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.420
all the x's that are a member of the
real such that

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.800
x does not equal 9 and x

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.780
does not equal negative 10.
Any other real number x --

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.430
it's going to work including 5.
If x equals 5, h of --

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.470
h of 5 is going to be equal to pi,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.580
because you default to this one over here.
h of 5 so OK x is equal 5,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.580
we do that one right over there. Now if
you gave x equals 9

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.670
you gonna divide by 0. If x equals negative 10,
you gonna divide

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.190
by 0, but that's gonna work for anything else.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.300
So that right over there is the domain.
