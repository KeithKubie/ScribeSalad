00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:09.760
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Honored to be joined

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.360
by Sebastian Junger who's
made amazing documentaries

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.855
such as "Restrepo."

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.430
His newest one is called
"Hell on Earth" about Syria.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.010
And he's also the author
of the book called "Tribe."

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.950
So let's give Sebastian
a warm Google welcome.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.450
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.055
Thank you.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:28.930
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So
we're going to start off

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.540
talking about "Hell on Earth."

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.515
Maybe we can go
into why you decided

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:39.490
to jump into that topic, what
inspired you to get involved?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.290
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: So I became a
war reporter in the early '90s.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.240
I went to Sarajevo, to Bosnia.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.920
This is of course before the US
was involved as a peacekeeping

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.520
force.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.310
And I continued covering civil
wars throughout the '90s.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.850
I first went to
Afghanistan in 1996.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.600
I watched as the
Taliban prepared

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.820
to overrun Kabul and Jalalabad,
and then again in 2000.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.160
Then I was in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.780
Most of my experience
as a war reporter

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.600
has been with the local
population and in wars

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.560
that the US wasn't involved
in and wasn't thinking about.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.950
And then my colleague
and I, Tim Hetherington,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.710
spent time with US forces
in Eastern Afghanistan

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.130
in Kunar Province and made a
documentary called "Restrepo."

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.600
We went to the Oscars.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.920
We were nominated for an Oscar.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.844
We didn't win.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:35.260
A few weeks later
we were supposed

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.090
to go on assignment to Libya
to cover the Libyan civil war.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.781
It was part of the sort
of Arab Spring uprisings

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.280
that were so interesting and
complicated, really complicated

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.615
moment for the Arab world.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.120
At the last minute
I couldn't go.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.180
Tim went on his own and he got
killed in the city of Misrata.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.490
He was hit by
fragments from a mortar

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.340
fired by Gaddafi's forces.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.200
And he bled out in the back
of a pickup truck from a wound

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.870
that I think didn't
necessarily have to be mortal.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.410
No one around him
knew what to do.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.807
Not the rebels and not
the other journalists

00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:12.140
had any medical training at all.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.010
He just bled out a few
minutes from a hospital.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.110
And after that, I decided
to stop war reporting.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.550
But Syria turned into sort
of the worst case scenario.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.259
I mean all the Arab
Spring countries went

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.550
through what they went through.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.650
Tunisia ended pretty well.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.350
Libya is still pretty rocky
but it's quieted down.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.750
Syria was just full-on
bloodbath, 400,000 people dead

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.650
at this point,
millions of refugees,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.460
a lot of international interests
converging on the problem

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.720
and making it worse.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.010
And so my colleague
and I, Nick Quested,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.220
decided we really had to
examine the case of Syria.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.060
How did it start?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.910
What went wrong?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.580
Why is there a civil war there?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.360
And particularly, how did
ISIS come out of this?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.810
Syria is the only country that
produced something like ISIS.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.900
ISIS really is just sort of
remarkable in its depravity

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
and its violence and its
pretension to religious purity.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.200
And so we just felt it was an
important thing to explain.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.570
And of course you
want to make something

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.430
that helps people come to a
good decision about what to do.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.757
And that's always in the
back of any journalist's mind

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:25.590
or filmmaker's mind.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.989
So that's how we wound
up focusing in Syria.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.030
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.480
And so you used
Syrians on the ground

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.121
to record your
footage and whatnot?

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:35.620
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, I mean
for the first time in my life

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.634
I made a film and wasn't
on the ground shooting.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.550
In fact I didn't even
leave the United States.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.425
I was writing a book.

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:44.740
I was writing my book
"Tribe" and promoting it.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.300
Nick went overseas.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.021
It was a suicide mission
to go into Syria itself.

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.520
They were kidnapping journalists
and cutting their heads off

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.480
on camera.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.500
I mean, danger on the
battlefield is one thing.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.370
The risk of being kidnapped
and executed is an entirely

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.770
different kind of risk that
really almost no one has

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.840
the stomach for, and
I certainly don't.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.930
So what we were able to do,
what Nick was able to do

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.450
was along the
Turkish-Syrian border,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.370
he found people,
fixers, and people

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.550
who had family in
Syria, friends in Syria,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.050
he found people that
knew people in Syria who

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.100
were documenting their own
civil war with cameras.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.350
And we started working with
and we would get cameras

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.430
to people in there.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.320
We started working
with people who

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.010
were stuck in the Civil War,
either just the civilians

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.690
or they were Syrian
cameramen who

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.144
wanted to document what was
happening to their country.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.060
We started working with
them sort of remotely.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.796
We would get thumb
drives into them.

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:41.920
We'd get cameras into them.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.380
We'd give them
shooting instructions.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.300
And then we'd get this
material back out.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.800
And it was a very, in
some ways, awkward way

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.440
to make a film compared to just
being on the ground shooting.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.230
But it also had enormous
advantages in addition

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.790
to the fact it was
just safer for us.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.589
But it had other sort of
creative advantages as well.

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.630
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Can you
talk about the backdrop

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.330
to Syria, like the
different political entities

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.039
that are involved
right now in civil war?

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.496
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Yeah, I mean it's

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:11.880
super complicated of course.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.240
And Nick really was the
expert about that stuff.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.250
I mean he did 30-some
trips over there

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.800
and he really got into the
weeds with Syrian politics.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.237
He didn't successfully
completely

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:23.570
drag me into the weeds with him.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.350
But from what I
understand, of course

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.030
you've got the Assad regime.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.790
It's backed by Iran,
heavily aided by Hezbollah,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.120
and backed by the
Russians, by Putin.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.300
So no, you're not going
to topple the regime that

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.380
has friends like that.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.560
Assad's not going anywhere.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.000
In the beginning of the war, the
Free Syrian Army was largely--

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.180
it was the product of a popular
uprising, an uprising that

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.550
was protesting not only
the deep, deep corruption

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.200
of the Assad regime but also
the just unspeakable brutality

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.000
of the security forces
that kept them in power,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.720
security forces
that were completely

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.410
OK with detaining teenage
boys who had sprayed graffiti

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.670
on a wall--

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.680
down with Assad, just
something like that--

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.770
completely OK with
detaining 15-year-old boys

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.720
and torturing them to death.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.220
That was how the
revolution started,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.750
with parents whose
boys had been detained

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.157
and were in a police
station, parents

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:31.740
massing in front of
the police station

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.940
demanding the release
of their children,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.750
and finally storming the
police station to save them,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.156
and then the security forces
opening fire on the parents.

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.530
That's how the
civil war started.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.760
And sometimes in this country
what I hear from people is.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.372
it's crazy.

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:46.080
It's a civil war.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.607
If those people want
to kill each other,

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:49.690
you can't tell them apart.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.820
Just let them kill each other.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.278
You have to
understand, people have

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.540
to understand how
these things start.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.300
They start with obscenities
like that situation in Daraa.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.190
It's the town of Daraa.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.280
So the FSA came out of that.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.680
And of course the
longer a war goes on,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.360
the more chance you have of
a popular and more or less

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.730
democratic movement
metastasizing,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.190
having some parts
of it metastasize

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.790
into radicalization,
into really sort

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.550
of like vicious
anti-Western thought.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.490
It becomes just as inhuman
and cruel as the regime

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.540
they're protesting.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.180
So one of the arguments, one
of the moral and practical

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.230
arguments for intervening
early on in civil wars

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.370
is that keeps that kind of
radical cancer from starting.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.370
And once it's started,
it's really hard to stop.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.560
I mean just like with
cancer in the human body,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.149
it's really, really
hard to stop.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:50.190
And that's what happened.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.860
The FSA splintered.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.740
Some groups got
really radicalized.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.230
Al-Qaeda came in.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.820
And eventually ISIS was
sort of incubated and born

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.680
in the vacuum in Iraq
after the US withdrawal

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.070
and migrated into Syria
and really took a foothold,

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.250
got a foothold in Syria.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.750
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
In the documentary

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.780
you follow a particular family.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.094
Can you talk about how you guys
got connected to them and maybe

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:22.760
an update on what the
family's doing now

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.890
if you're still in contact?

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.020
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, so it's
two family of brothers, Marwan

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.970
and Radwan.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.700
One was a garage mechanic,
another at a little cell phone

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.574
shop in Aleppo.

00:08:36.574 --> 00:08:37.990
And they were
pushed out of Aleppo

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.760
by the fighting to a
town called Manbij.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.590
ISIS took over Manbij.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.179
They were living
under ISIS control

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.540
with their children, their
wives and their children.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.950
And the Russian Air Force
and Assad's air force

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.970
was bombing Manbij
pretty regularly.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:02.170
And so what Nick managed to
do was he knew the brother.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.440
He knew a third brother
that was actually in Turkey.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.140
And he said, "Listen,
would you think

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.720
those families would
like to document life

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.310
under ISIS for us?

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.040
We'll pay them and
they'd shoot for us."

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.700
So they agreed to.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.480
And so we got them
a camera, like

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.040
a very nondescript, low
profile Samsung 7 cell phone

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.500
camera basically, the
kind that everybody

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.900
has so they're not calling
attention to themselves.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.940
And they self-documented.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.137
They documented their lives
under ISIS, the conversations

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:36.970
they had about if they
should try to escape,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.370
what are the risks of escaping?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.190
And they documented
the escape itself.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.870
They were basically
under a tarpaulin

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.420
in the back of a truck driving
through ISIS checkpoints

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.390
through no man's land into
FSA territory, eventually

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.580
into Turkey.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.750
And keep in mind, just
imagine, those of you

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.250
who have children, doing
a journey like that,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.340
knowing that if you get
stopped at a checkpoint

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.905
and they pull the tarpaulin
back and they discover you,

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:05.560
you and your family will be
lined up and machine gunned.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.060
That's what the stakes were.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.680
And they documented all this.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.270
And thank God they
got out safely.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.280
They got to Turkey.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.540
Nick met them in Turkey
and got to meet them

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.430
and then started
shooting them himself.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.950
And then they continued
on with their camera

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.840
onto a Zodiac, a rubber Zodiac
trying to get to Greece,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.676
and the last moment
were turned back

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:26.800
by the Turkish Coast Guard.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.820
So some of the most
extraordinary parts of the film

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.360
are parts that just
this family shot.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.760
And really, it's a whole new way
of thinking about filmmaking.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.310
Even if we'd been
able to go in there,

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.050
it would have been
like a Westerner

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.110
with a video camera in
the middle of this very

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.370
intimate family situation.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.800
It would have altered it.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.480
It would not be the reality
that you're seeing here.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.980
And so really there is something
to be said for asking people

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.980
to self-document as long as
you can trust that they're not

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.000
manipulating you.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.579
And that's the only
downside to it.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:06.120
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
And there's a scene

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.980
when one of the families, the
husband and wife are talking

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.320
and he was making a decision
if they should flee or not.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120
And they were arguing
right in front

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.150
of like six of their children.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.090
And it just really
hit home about

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.799
how terrible the crisis is.

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.090
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, I
mean they're stuck in Turkey,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.430
so they're safe, but
they're miserable.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.550
And they're arguing about
whether to risk the boat

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.426
passage.

00:11:29.426 --> 00:11:30.800
And you all know,
there are a lot

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.510
of people drowned, a
lot of loss of life

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.630
on these Zodiacs
of people trying

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:41.030
to get from North Africa to
Europe from Turkey to Greece.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.040
And the wife is like--

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.010
the mother is saying,
one big wave and I

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.950
lose all my children.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.370
And he is saying, OK, but
at least we'll die together.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.040
And right now we're
stuck in Turkey.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.350
Our children have
no future at all.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.120
I say it's better that we
gamble on giving them a future

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.930
or we die together
and that's God's will.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.230
And the husband eventually
won the argument.

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:13.420
JORDAN THIBODEAU: There's
an argument in the West

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.220
that during all this chaos
that the people who are leading

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.500
should stay there and they
should fight or something.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.630
But I think after
watching this documentary

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.940
you realize how much
of a terrible situation

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.680
they're in right now.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.594
For the people that are
caught in the diaspora,

00:12:31.594 --> 00:12:33.010
did you talk to
any of them to see

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.665
if they're willing to go back
to Syria or are they thinking--

00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:37.540
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean
most of the refugees

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.302
that Nick had contact
with want to go back

00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:40.510
to Syria as soon as they can.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.240
I mean, the people that
were displaced by the fire

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.451
up in Sonoma, wherever
they're living right now,

00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:48.700
they don't want to stay there.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.634
They want to go back to
their homes, rebuild.

00:12:50.634 --> 00:12:53.050
You know, that's just the
normal human thing, and likewise

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.710
with refugees.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.580
Not everybody-- the West is
pretty appealing frankly.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.820
And I mean some
percentage of people

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.080
are going to want to stay here
to enjoy the life that we're

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.580
here for.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.350
I mean, they're the same
as us, so some people

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.100
will want to stay.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.830
And frankly, the immigrant
population of this country

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.580
has contributed
enormously to our society.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.621
My father's an immigrant.

00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.850
In fact, he's a war refugee.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.330
He was a two-time war refugee
from the Spanish Civil War

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.850
and then the Nazis in France.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:26.440
My first wife was an
immigrant from Bulgaria.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.580
This country's
better off for having

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.880
those people, those good
people in our borders.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.390
And so I think to the
extent that some people will

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.070
want to stay, I think
there's probably

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.980
a net gain for us and
obviously for them.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.400
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Can you talk
about the organization of ISIS?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.230
Because when I watched
the documentary,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.563
I just thought it was maybe
just a couple-- like a group

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.010
of people who are just rebels.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.218
But it seemed like they're
setting up their own state

00:13:53.218 --> 00:13:54.170
inside of Syria.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.450
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean the
interesting thing about ISIS

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.200
as opposed to al-Qaeda
is that they really

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.510
controlled territory.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.590
They had oil refineries.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.080
They were setting up
a taxation system.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.790
They were running schools and
every aspect of a functioning

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.430
modern society.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.100
They're repaving roads.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.516
They were doing
all the things you

00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:16.360
would expect the state to
do in exchange for giving

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.560
the state taxes.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.800
They were providing
those goods and services.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.720
And that made them
really different

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.060
from any other terrorist group.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.130
And they are a terrorist
group obviously.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.190
And they really controlled
quite a bit of territory

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.130
in Iraq and Syria, in
Northern Iraq and Syria.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:41.650
And so they had a [INAUDIBLE]
civil administration,

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.740
a military hierarchy,
their leader.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.894
The sort of supreme leader
was named al-Baghdadi.

00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:49.810
No one's sure if he's
alive or dead right now.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.518
I think people think
he's probably alive,

00:14:51.518 --> 00:14:54.410
but obviously he's had
better days than right now.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.540
And they're really being rolled
up pretty quickly in Syria.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.760
Which doesn't mean that
their threat is over with,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.770
but what they proclaim
to be the caliphate--

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.240
they declared the
caliphate in the area

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.610
that they controlled,
harking back

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.140
to the sort of glory days of the
Arab world of the Muslim faith.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:23.164
And that dream, or
nightmare, has died.

00:15:23.164 --> 00:15:25.080
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now
in the current situation

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.030
you have Kurds and you
have FSA involved, whatnot.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.701
If ISIS is pushed
out, does the FSA

00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.950
have enough strength the
actually control the country?

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.510
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Right, I forgot.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.680
I lost track of my list of
players in this situation.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.490
So the Kurds are an
autonomous tribal group.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.170
And their population spills into
Turkey, into Iraq, into Iran,

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.000
into Syria.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.610
They dream of having
an independent Kurdish

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.670
state, which of course is
extremely threatening to all

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.770
of the states that they're part
of, because those states don't

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.940
want Kurdish-controlled
territory carved out

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.160
of their national
borders, particularly

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.130
if Kurdish-controlled territory
happens to have a lot of oil

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.610
in it, which some of it does.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.990
So it's all extremely delicate.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.680
The Kurds have been very, very
useful allies, helpful allies

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.240
in fighting ISIS.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.330
But recently they
turned around and voted

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.640
for independence, which
completely freaked out Iraq.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.690
And now they're fighting with
their former allies in Iraq.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.200
I mean, there's
potentially a regional war

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.140
involving the Kurds and all
of the different nations

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.900
around Kurdish
territory that don't

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.280
want them to have independence.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.010
And so let's see,
who else is involved?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:55.390
It's also a major confrontation
between Sunni and Shia Islam.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:02.800
So when we invaded
Iraq, the Sunni minority

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.260
had political and military
control of the country

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:11.050
under Saddam Hussein and
oppressed the Shia majority.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.730
When we came in, we got
rid of Saddam Hussein.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.960
We started a
de-Ba'athification program,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.090
The Ba'ath Party was the sort of
nationalist party under Saddam

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.589
Hussein.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.760
So he purged the military,
the schools, the universities,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.660
right down to very
low-level jobs.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.060
He purge them of all Ba'athists.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.460
Of course a lot of those
people were perfectly decent

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.100
people who were stuck in a
system where you had to be--

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.680
like under communism
in Eastern Europe,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.460
you had to be part of
the Communist Party

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.150
in order to even get a
job sweeping the streets.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.250
Being in the party
doesn't mean anything.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.800
But we purged all those
people and basically created

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.560
an unemployed and
very bitter population

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.100
who were then oppressed--

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.930
I mean oppressed, murdered,
rounded up, tortured,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.210
killed, murdered by
the Shia government

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.120
that we put into
power in Baghdad.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.760
Oddly, the Shia government had
of course very strong relations

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.160
with the Shia government
in Iran who's our enemy.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.560
So no matter what we
did we were creating

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.640
a contradiction in
our policies, almost

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.570
sort of brilliantly
contradictory policy.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.070
It would be hard
to actually set out

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.060
to be as contradictory
as we were.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.200
So a lot of these
disenfranchised Ba'ath Party

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.610
leaders and generals and
officers and party leaders

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.220
and all that eventually
started the Sunni insurgency,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.731
partly to protect the Sunni
population from the Shia who

00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:39.730
were beating up on them.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:45.730
And eventually
when President Bush

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.310
started negotiating a
US withdrawal from Iraq

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.280
and then handed that
off to Barack Obama, who

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:57.010
sort of finished the job, in
the vacuum of our withdrawal,

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.700
the Shia government--
the Shia forces sort of

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.600
had free reign to really
abuse the Sunni population.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.650
And at that moment, ISIS was
formed as a civil defense force

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.600
to protect the Sunni population.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.650
And what they offered
was a pathologically

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.400
extreme and virulent
vision of Islam

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.950
in exchange for protection.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.260
And so it was born
in Northern Iraq.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.820
It was born in Iraq.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.520
And when the Syrian Civil
War really got going,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.020
they saw an opportunity.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:35.560
They migrated into Syria, took
territory, came back into Iraq

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.930
and overran, I think,
five Iraqi Army divisions,

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.850
then took all their weapons.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.140
And they just started sort
of bouncing back and forth

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.590
between Syria and Iraq, grabbing
more and more territory,

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.500
taking over oil fields,
creating oil revenue, tens,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.250
hundreds of millions
of dollars of revenue

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.120
now being generated
by this machine,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.170
which could then pay for
more arms and more jihadis.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.000
The whole thing
sort of snowballed.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.820
And it wasn't until
recently that ground forces

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.770
were able to start
to roll that back.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.580
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Now you mentioned

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.720
in the documentary
Assad kind of jump

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.790
started some of the
radicalism inside of Syria

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.720
when he released certain people.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.500
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, so Assad
knows that Western forces have

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.747
a sort of soft spot for
democratic movements,

00:20:21.747 --> 00:20:22.830
because we're democracies.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.790
And when people rise up
in Tunisia or in Egypt

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:31.120
or wherever, or in
Ukraine or wherever--

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.820
it's happened in many places--

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.500
the Western powers
are like, oh great,

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.210
a democratic movement
will overthrow

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.680
this despotic regime,
another spot of light,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.870
sunlight in the world.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.020
We're for that.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.490
Of course Assad knows that.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.570
So the FSA, they
really were quite

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.230
democratic and idealistic
when they started.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.390
And Assad knew that
that would be absolutely

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.960
irresistible to
Western powers who

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.000
want to arm them and
give them the capability

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.870
to topple his regime,
much like we armed

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.390
the Afghan fighters
in the 1980s so they

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.340
could fight the Russians
who had invaded them.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.860
It's sort of the same idea.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.950
So what he did--

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.709
but he also knew that the West
was scared of Islamic radicals.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:17.250
And he had a lot of
Islamic radicals,

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.140
I mean straight up
terrorists, in his jails.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.820
So what did he do?

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.790
He released them.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.760
He released the most violent and
radical Islamists in his jails

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.240
and seeded the SSA
with Islamic radicals,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.810
and then was able to
say, look, if you topple

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.890
them-- said to the
world, if you topple me,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.720
this is what you get.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.240
You basically get
al-Qaeda in Damascus.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.070
So careful who you
arm over there.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.060
So he sort of ruined
the party basically

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.070
by letting these
radicals out of jail.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:56.080
And he'd much rather fight
al-Qaeda in his own country

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.309
than fight a democratic movement
that's armed by the West

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:00.100
in his own country.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.230
I mean, that is not a
fight he's going to win.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.330
And so as soon as he did that,
then the Russians could say,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.000
we're all fighting
terrorists together.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.030
And then they had their
rationale for bombing

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.790
and on it went.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.470
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So for
people who are on the ground,

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.450
they talk about what they
see as a possible end

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.100
game for this conflict.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.005
I mean, there's so
many different pieces.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.960
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean,
the war in Afghanistan

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:37.680
started when the
Soviets invaded in 1980.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.260
We're coming up on 40 years now.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.630
And it's still at war.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.060
And if we pulled
out, if we completely

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.370
pulled out of Afghanistan,
the war will get worse.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.532
I mean that's the sort of
weird delusion of the left

00:22:51.532 --> 00:22:53.490
is that if you pull US
forces out of a country,

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.040
things will get better.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.830
And actually what happens
is the civilian death

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.990
toll will get dramatically
worse if we pull out.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.030
It may be that the
Syrian conflict

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.510
does not, within the next
couple of generations,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.280
have a solution.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.990
It's entirely possible.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.840
If there is a kind of
tentative stability

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.980
that allows for a drop in
the suffering of civilians,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.760
it will be, I think, a
de facto partitioning

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.570
of the country where the
front lines kind of stabilize

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.160
and the country is
divided through sort

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.890
of ethnic and tribal
divisions that

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.150
figure out how to have a kind
of stability, like in Bosnia.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.700
I mean in Bosnia that was helped
by the Dayton Peace Accords.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.980
But basically it solidified
front-line positions that

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.540
had evolved during the war.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.960
And it sort of solidified
them as a permanent solution.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.160
And something like that
may happen, I don't know.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.650
Or it could easily
keep going on.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.200
The problem is you
have Shia versus Sunni.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.940
You have this sort of weird
axis of Putin, Assad, and Iran

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.100
and Hezbollah versus the West.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.070
You The Kurds are in there.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.730
The Turks, I mean,
the Turks are making

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.379
some incredibly
troubling decisions

00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:17.670
about their own country and
about their foreign policy.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.190
So you have these unbelievably
problematic and self-interested

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.330
parties.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.020
And there's a huge
amount of oil, right?

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.853
There's a huge amount
of oil in these areas.

00:24:26.853 --> 00:24:28.940
Like what else could you
throw into a situation

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.620
to keep it going
for a long time?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.554
I mean Afghanistan
doesn't have oil.

00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.470
I mean, no one really
cares about Afghanistan.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.530
It's not like the
international community

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.210
is dying to get its hands on--

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.120
whatever.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.200
I mean, Syria is a nightmare
compared to Afghanistan,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.270
and Afghanistan is still
going on after 40 years.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:49.680
So I think one of the
things that could happen

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.875
is a regional war that
kills a million people.

00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:55.250
I mean, that's
entirely possible.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.430
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Very cheery.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.275
So when you're working
this whole entire project,

00:25:04.275 --> 00:25:06.030
what were you main takeaways?

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.300
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: The
first thing I wanted to do

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.740
is disabuse people of the
idea that when a country slips

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.840
into civil war it's somehow
a sort of broad moral failure

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.720
by the population that they
somehow like violence and can't

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.670
keep themselves from
killing each other.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.184
That's just not how
civil wars work.

00:25:27.184 --> 00:25:28.850
That's not how it
worked in our country.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.790
Everyone forgets, we
had a civil war too.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.940
That's not how it worked in
our country in the 1860s.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.400
It's not how it works.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.190
The vast majority of people
are good, decent people

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.560
who don't want to be
killing their neighbors.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.250
It doesn't take very
many psychopaths

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.390
and nationalists and
power-hungry politicians

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.302
to tip a country into civil war.

00:25:51.302 --> 00:25:52.510
It really doesn't take a lot.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.890
Likewise in street
demonstrations,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.310
it doesn't take a lot
of sort of Molotov

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.050
cocktail-throwing
anarchists to turn

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.120
a completely reasonable street
demonstration into a riot.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.810
It really doesn't take a lot.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.190
And so I wanted
people to understand

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.946
that the people of Syria or
Bosnia or wherever it is,

00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:16.070
they're just decent people.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.970
They're people exactly like us.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.970
And when they flee
with their children,

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.560
they're not trying
to take advantage

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.350
of the bounty of
the West and take

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.240
advantage of our generosity.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.050
Fleeing their country is
incredibly scary and dangerous.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.010
It's the last thing any
reasonable person would

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.330
want to do with their children.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.413
And yet they're doing it
because they know if they

00:26:34.413 --> 00:26:36.100
don't, they're going to die.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.740
That's what an immigrant
refugee population is.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.117
And the other
thing I wanted to--

00:26:42.117 --> 00:26:44.075
there are two other things
I wanted to explain.

00:26:46.925 --> 00:26:51.160
First of all, some
of this came out of--

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.450
some of it we can't control.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.320
The countries have internal
dynamics of civil wars.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.534
We can't play god.

00:26:57.534 --> 00:26:59.200
Not everything that
happens in the world

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.330
is because we did or
didn't do something.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:10.860
But I have to say, our
invasion of Iraq in 2003

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.800
introduced in a huge amount
of instability and violence

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.260
and death into that
part of the world.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.900
I'm not defending the
Saddam Hussein regime.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.910
Of course he was
unspeakably evil.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.310
But just for the
purposes of history,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.790
we killed something
like 100,000 civilians.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.910
We introduced
violence as a norm,

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.200
a new norm in Iraqi society, and
made some incredible blunders,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.150
like de-Ba'athification.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.929
And when you traumatize
a society like that,

00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:45.220
it's like traumatizing a child.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.080
It will act badly.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.000
I mean trauma produces a
result, not a good one.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.970
And then the
withdrawal-- then if you

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.553
invade a country and
kind of break it,

00:28:00.553 --> 00:28:02.090
then you kind of
should stay there.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.130
And we didn't do that either.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.332
I mean in Afghanistan in the
'80s, we armed the Afghans

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:09.290
to the teeth so they
could fight the Russians--

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.870
which is arguably the
right thing to do--

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.950
spent a huge amount of
money giving them weapons.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.046
And when the Russians
pulled out, what did we do?

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:17.420
We didn't care
about the Afghans.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.650
We pulled out.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.590
We didn't stay to build schools
and build bridges and help.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.655
No, all we were doing,
all we were interested in

00:28:23.655 --> 00:28:24.530
was killing Russians.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.140
We actually didn't care
about the Afghans, at least

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.890
not judging by the money
allocated by this nation

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.510
afterwards.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.450
So I wanted to make
the point that we

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.840
can be judgmental and whatever
about those crazy people

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.700
over there that have
their crazy civil war.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.350
We are part of it.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.230
And America has done enormously
good things in the world too,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.710
including stopping fascism
during World War II.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.860
My father grew up in Europe.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.590
He's alive because-- I mean
his homeland survived--

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.560
France survived because of us.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.920
I mean, he made that very
clear to me when I was young.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.030
So we're an enormous power
for good in the world as well.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.740
But we need to own our mistakes.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.960
And I would like to propose Iraq
was a mistake, in that sense.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.390
And finally, the public
use of violence by ISIS--

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.580
I mean taking people
into the town square,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.520
pouring gasoline over them,
and burning them alive,

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:27.160
putting them in steel cages,
groups of men in steel cages,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.470
and then dangling them over
a swimming pool by a crane

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.570
and then slowly dropping
them into the water

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.810
and watching them drown, with
underwater cameras to record

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.280
it, that is pure evil, right?

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.390
It's an evil of the sort that
is absolutely unacceptable

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.189
and I'm glad they're being
eradicated from the planet,

00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:49.480
but it's the kind of evil
that every society, including

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.460
our own, has indulged in.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.440
I mean people commit
public violence in order

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.300
to intimidate other people.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.760
And you don't have to go very
far back in American history

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.140
to find public violence.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.170
I mean the lynchings of
black men in the South,

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.410
I mean those men
could have been easily

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.690
killed quietly in the
dead of night and buried.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.850
That's how people
commit murder, right?

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.492
They do it quietly and secretly.

00:30:11.492 --> 00:30:13.450
That's not what happened
in the American South.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.950
The murders were done in
an intentionally cruel way

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.450
in the middle of town.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.658
I mean, there were ministers
who would let church out

00:30:21.658 --> 00:30:25.540
early so that the congregation
wouldn't miss the lynching.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.640
That's an attempt to
intimidate the population

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.780
just like ISIS was doing.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.670
So one of the points
I wanted to make

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.610
is that ISIS must be
condemned, but in the context

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.720
of acknowledging that
every society has

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.860
used that kind of violence.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.820
And we need to
acknowledge that dark--

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.580
in condemning the
dark side of ISIS,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.830
in the same moment
we have to actually,

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.530
to be intellectually honest,
acknowledge the dark side

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.830
that we're capable of, and
thank God have transcended.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.790
But we can't forget that.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.434
We can't be too sanctimonious
that they're somehow inherently

00:30:58.434 --> 00:30:59.350
different than we are.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.141
You go back two
generations in this country

00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:02.439
and they're really not.

00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:03.980
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Now the documentary

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.480
showed how a person got
radicalized and joined ISIS.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.540
I guess there is a
theory that people

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.970
join these groups because of
lack of economic opportunity.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.928
And some other people
think, no, it's not that.

00:31:15.928 --> 00:31:17.597
It's for other causes.

00:31:17.597 --> 00:31:18.680
Where do you land on that?

00:31:20.655 --> 00:31:22.280
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
There's a whole range

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.780
of reasons to join ISIS.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.140
If you're Syrian and ISIS rolls
into your hometown in pickup

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.720
trucks, a really compelling
reason to join ISIS is that

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.030
they'll kill you if you don't.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:35.480
So there's that to some
sort of economic opportunity

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.970
in those areas for
disenfranchised people

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.480
that feel like they need to join
the winning team to survive.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.180
And then if you move to
the European population,

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.140
why would--

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.540
I mean, it was mostly
middle-class kids

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.620
that joined ISIS.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.590
Why would a middle class kid
in Europe of Arab descent--

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.080
but not an immigrant,
not a refugee,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.460
someone who was born in France
or in England of Arab descent,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.300
middle-class kid who's in school
and university, whatever--

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.620
why would they join ISIS?

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.007
They are not economically
desperate people actually.

00:32:12.007 --> 00:32:14.090
That's not the kind of
people who would join ISIS.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.447
They're too busy working.

00:32:15.447 --> 00:32:17.780
They're too busy trying to
work and with their families.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.760
It's really middle-class kids.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.370
And teenagers are particularly
vulnerable to sort

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.470
of utopian visions.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.970
And ISIS wasn't trying to
lure them in to their movement

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.610
by showing beheading
videos, because then you

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.990
only get the psychopaths.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.214
And psychopaths can be
useful, but you can't have

00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:36.380
a whole army of psychopaths.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.754
There just aren't
enough of them.

00:32:37.754 --> 00:32:41.960
So what they did to lure
people is to give them

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.250
a vision of a utopia.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.320
And so they had these videos
of incredibly high production

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.490
values showing a family
in ISIS territory

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.220
having a picnic by a
lake, things like that,

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.610
just this sort of
utopian, idealized vision

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:03.740
of life inside the caliphate.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.470
And also just the whole
idea of the caliphate

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.360
is finally standing
up to the West

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.190
and reclaiming this very
real, sort of historical,

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.810
sort of lost golden
age of Islam,

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.910
and this sort of
very real dignity

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.240
that the Arab world had
in regard to the West.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.830
That had been lost.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.040
And they're very conscious
that it's been lost.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.140
And totally reasonable,
they want to reclaim it.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.610
We would too.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.290
And so what they
do is these videos

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.120
that they put out
there were showing

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.930
in a very glowing sort
of light this utopia

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.187
that you can come join.

00:33:40.187 --> 00:33:42.770
And also, young people want to
be something bigger themselves,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.954
greater than themselves.

00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:47.870
There's a great band,
Queens of the Stone Age,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.670
and they have lyrics
to one of their--

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.320
I can't remember the
name of the song.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.990
The lyric is, "She
wanted something

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.210
to die for to make it
beautiful to live."

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.870
That's ISIS.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.244
I mean that's the
appeal of ISIS.

00:33:58.244 --> 00:34:00.200
That's the appeal
of, in the 1930s,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.760
going over and fighting
the Spanish Civil War.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.989
And that's exactly what's going
on with those kids in Europe.

00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:09.530
And then they get
over there and they

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.460
realize it's a
complete lie and it's

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.690
a horribly abusive and
depraved organization.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.699
But then it's too late.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.559
Then they're basically stuck.

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.100
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now the US is
increasingly our involvement.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.730
I heard recently we have some
troops now on the ground.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.389
And I guess we're
working with the Kurds

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.360
to a degree or something.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.989
Do you see US
involvement increasing?

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.072
We're going to have more
soldiers as time goes on?

00:34:36.072 --> 00:34:39.000
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, there's
a Marine expeditionary unit

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.760
there.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.280
There's a bunch of 155s over
there, artillery over there.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.670
They've got aircraft flying
out of Northern Iraq I guess.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.800
I don't really know
the tactical details,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.929
but yeah, there are
US forces over there.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:53.555
They're focused
on defeating ISIS.

00:34:53.555 --> 00:34:54.929
I don't know
exactly what they're

00:34:54.929 --> 00:35:00.060
going to do when ISIS is
gone and different militia

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.520
groups that they were allied
with, including the Kurds,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.770
start fighting with each
other to control the areas

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:09.300
that ISIS used to occupy,
particularly the oilfields.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.750
So are US forces then going
to become peacekeeping forces?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.710
I'm not sure exactly
what's going to happen.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.251
I'm not sure the
administration knows

00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.870
exactly what's going
to happen if Turkey

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:29.670
decides that parts of those
areas really should be Turkey.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:32.120
They feel that Mosul
is a Turkish city.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.170
Mosul's in Northern Iraq.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.800
How's that going to go?

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:43.680
There's an expeditionary unit
in between Turkey and Mosul.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.530
It's going to have to stay
there to keep Turkey from trying

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.480
to claim a piece of--

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.750
I mean, it's a huge mess.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.560
And the administration right
now, the Trump administration

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.330
is juggling an awful lot of
very complicated situations.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.520
I hope they have the
bandwidth to figure out

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.700
a wise course of action, a
wise strategy in that area.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.690
I hope they do.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.450
I wouldn't say it's
likely that they do,

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.210
but I hope they do,
I mean for our sake

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.050
and for the sake of
the people over there.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.819
There's a lot of innocent people
still stuck in that country.

00:36:16.819 --> 00:36:18.360
They really don't
need Western powers

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.740
making more mistakes
with that area.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.490
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now
in your documentary,

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.230
you're limited because you have
to air it on cable and whatnot.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.605
Were there things
that you wanted

00:36:27.605 --> 00:36:29.430
to include in the documentary
but didn't have enough time

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.160
to do?

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.890
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Oh, anytime
you make a 90 minute film,

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.560
you really feel like you should
have made a hundred minute

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.112
film.

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:39.570
This is actually
a hundred minutes.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.830
Every time you make a
hundred minute film,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.230
you think it should have
been 120 minute film.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.615
The truth is, a hundred minutes
is about as much time as people

00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:48.990
can kind of really
concentrate on

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.930
something difficult. And
this is definitely difficult.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.020
So yeah, there's always
stuff that drops out.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.440
The beauty of the
internet is that you

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.170
can put that content that
didn't go into the film,

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.630
you can put it on a
website and say, oh,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.040
if you want a more expansive
story about this refugee

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.170
family, here it is.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.420
And so we made these
sort of mini films

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.580
that broadened some
of these topics

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.700
that we had to sort of
confine and cut short.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.680
So all that stuff
sort of lives online.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.200
And that's actually a
kind of pretty cool use

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.938
for that material.

00:37:23.938 --> 00:37:26.104
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Do we
have any audience questions?

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.400
We'll get you a
mic in the second.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.150
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for
taking the time here.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.700
I'd never heard that thing about
the hundred minute attention

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.080
span and was wondering
where you got that from?

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.830
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I
mean, that's not data.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.740
That's not research.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.079
It's just that's my sense
from watching a lot of films

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:46.370
and from making a lot of films.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.650
A hundred minutes seems to
be just about the limit.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.358
I mean you can go to
two hours, whatever.

00:37:50.358 --> 00:37:52.520
But if you go to
two hours, trust me,

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.830
the audience will know
you've gone to two hours.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.320
And you really don't want
your audience thinking

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.910
about how long the film is.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.535
As soon as that--

00:38:00.535 --> 00:38:01.410
you know what I mean?

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.493
It's like on a first date
you don't want your date

00:38:03.493 --> 00:38:06.320
thinking, wow, we've been
having dinner for two hours.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.450
That's not a good sign.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:09.837
Same with filmmaking.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.240
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to
understand your viewpoint

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.740
on ISIS vis-a-vis the Taliban.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.330
They seemed to have
had similar structures

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.160
in terms of carving
out territory,

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.580
providing basic services,
promises and the rest.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.200
But ISIS is a bit more
brutal of course it seems.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.724
So what's your take?

00:38:34.724 --> 00:38:36.140
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Oh yeah, I mean,

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.070
the Taliban were conducting
public executions.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:46.190
They were stoning adulterers in
the sports arena, for example.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.560
But the Taliban weren't
a terrorist organization.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.410
I mean, they were terroristic
towards their own population.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.290
I think they're
extremely abusive.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.340
And so are a lot of
right-wing regimes as well.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.150
Brutality is brutality.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.820
But they weren't
attacking the West.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.710
And from the West's
perspective--

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.060
and we are Westerners, right?

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.160
From our perspective, you become
a terrorist when you attack us.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.926
AUDIENCE: Weren't they
housing Osama bin Laden--

00:39:11.926 --> 00:39:13.050
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well yes.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:16.950
AUDIENCE: --and thus--
it seemed like they

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.690
were housing Osama bin Laden.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.405
And so it was this default
attack on the West.

00:39:22.405 --> 00:39:24.030
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Absolutely they were,

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.170
and that was problematic.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.090
But they themselves,
they started

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.990
in the madrassas of Pakistan.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:35.190
Their entire focus was bringing
their vision of sort of pure

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:40.530
and, we would argue, radical
Islam to Afghanistan.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.160
That was the their entire focus.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.920
They weren't trying
to use Afghanistan

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.480
as a base to attack the West.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.660
Now they did host bin
Laden and al-Qaeda

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.930
is a terrorist organization.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.360
And they finally really
got our attention.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.790
I mean it took a while to
get our attention, right?

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.860
I mean al-Qaeda
attacked us a few times,

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.000
and we kept sort of like,
oh, OK, that didn't hurt.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.130
That didn't hurt too much.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:04.860
I mean, it took a few tries
before we actually really

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.310
focused on them.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.970
And of course that was 9/11.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.880
And after 9/11 happened,
the United States was like--

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.530
I mean George Bush said
to the Taliban leadership,

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.850
turn over al-Qaeda.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.007
Turn over the
al-Qaeda leadership,

00:40:22.007 --> 00:40:23.340
we will not invade your country.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.673
We'll actually come and help
you, because you need help.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.470
If you don't turn them over,
we will come after them.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.240
And you will become
our enemy as well.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.490
I didn't vote for George Bush.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.630
I disagreed with a
lot of his policies,

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:41.130
but I thought that was an
incredibly sort of sage

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.730
and reasonable reaction.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.390
In the heat of the moment after
9/11 that he did that I thought

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.340
was really admirable.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.460
Very stupidly the Taliban said,
no, no, no, they're our guests.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.230
And we went in and got them.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.280
It took a while and we made
a huge number of mistakes,

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.440
but that was a war
that made sense to me.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.690
I mean I was over there
in 2000 with Massoud

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.950
fighting the Taliban.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.900
I was there in 2001
with his commanders

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.840
when they took Kabul, with
the US Air Force overhead.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.112
The Afghans were overjoyed
at what was happening.

00:41:12.112 --> 00:41:14.070
We could have done a huge
amount of good there.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.600
We really could have.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.630
We left 15,000 troops
in Afghanistan.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.150
15,000, that's it.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.290
There's 40,000 cops
in New York City.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.970
We left 15,000 American
soldiers in the country

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.360
that produced the worst
attack on American soil

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.430
since Pearl Harbor.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.350
And we went on to
Iraq, a country

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.190
that had nothing to do with it.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.930
And we lost the war in
Afghanistan in Baghdad

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.400
basically, in my opinion.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.310
And so the Taliban and
ISIS, what do they share?

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.900
In terms of their vision of
Islam and how to run a society,

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.160
they're very similar.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.010
ISIS is more extreme, a
little more spectacular

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.660
in their brutality, definitely
more media savvy for sure.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.660
But it's the same
radical vision of Islam

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.770
that my friend Sarah
Chayes points out.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:14.510
And Sarah, she's a childhood
friend, former NPR reporter.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.150
When 9/11 happened, she went to
Pakistan, bought a motorcycle,

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:21.440
and drove into Kandahar and
rented a house in Kandahar

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.335
while the Taliban were still
in control of Kandahar.

00:42:24.335 --> 00:42:26.710
She's also a Harvard graduate,
an incredibly smart woman.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.280
And she really knows
the Arab world.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.930
She learned Pashtun,
really knows

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.600
the Arab world, amazing woman.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.610
She wrote a book called
"Thieves of State."

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.860
And she examined the
role of corruption.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.200
And what she found was
that the common denominator

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.180
in all these radical
Islamic movements that

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.460
are so brutal and violent--

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:49.390
the Shabaab in Somalia, Boko
Haram, the Taliban, ISIS--

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.330
the common denominator
in all those movements

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:58.150
is that they got traction
in the population

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.840
not because the population loved
the idea of radical Islam--

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.490
who would really, right?

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.150
That's not a fun way to live.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.650
They got traction
because they would

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:13.690
promise to stop the
incredible corruption

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.220
of an oppressive regime.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.560
Every one of those
countries was just

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.750
crippled with
government corruption.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.180
The governments were basically
criminal cartels that

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.010
existed to enrich themselves.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.760
And these radical
movements would say, OK,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.030
if you adopt our
vision of Islam,

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.450
we will protect you from the
tyranny of this government

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.800
and its corruption.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.770
And people reluctantly would be
like, OK, that's a good deal.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:42.210
And I remember when I was
in Kabul, Afghanistan,

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.970
in the summer of
1996, I got shot

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.040
at by a Taliban
machine gun position

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.910
on the outskirts of town.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.440
And me and the translator guy
that I-- and he was Afghan.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.180
He was Pashtun-- that
I was working with,

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.060
we got behind cover.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.100
We got out of there.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.960
And he said, "We
hate those people.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.070
We hate them.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.870
But we're going to
let them in because we

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.120
can no longer live with the
corruption of this government.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.870
And they promised to
clean up corruption."

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.040
So if we want to
fight terrorism,

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.260
we can fight terrorism
really effectively

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.290
by fighting corruption,
particularly corruption

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.150
with governments that
we're allied with

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.510
and do business with,
particularly those governments.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.540
We won't have to fight terrorism
because it won't gain root.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.540
We're completely
screwing ourselves

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.966
and wasting a lot of lives, lot
of lives of very good people.

00:44:34.966 --> 00:44:36.340
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
That reminds me

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.814
of what happen in Iran
with the fall of the shah.

00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:40.480
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.650
AUDIENCE: We have
one more question.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.270
AUDIENCE: Follow
up question-- do

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:49.320
you see ISIS changing once
they don't hold territory?

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.900
I guess I understand it,
the original ideology

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.660
is they are the caliphate.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.830
They're following the Quran.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.810
If they don't hold territory,
they no longer have a mandate.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.285
Is that completely made up or
do you see anything changing?

00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:03.660
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
I mean, I don't

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.310
know a regime that doesn't
change the rules of the game

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.400
when they lose the game, right?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.524
Including our own
administration.

00:45:15.524 --> 00:45:17.190
You lose a vote in
Congress and you just

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.022
change what the vote
was about, no problem.

00:45:21.022 --> 00:45:22.980
I mean not to pick on
you know who, but I mean,

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.390
that's totally human
behavior, right?

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.723
So ISIS is going to do that too.

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:26.590
I'd do it.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.910
I mean of course, right?

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.730
So yeah, they lose
their mandate,

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.770
they'll change the
basis for their mandate

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.390
and they'll continue
saying what they

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:38.800
want to say to expand their
power base, of course.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.710
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
kind of this rise of corruption

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:45.220
and people wanting to combat it.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.590
But then you also talked
about this tipping point

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:51.430
where there's this point
where it takes not too

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.140
much to nudge
people into violence

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.690
and then the cascade
to civil war.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.440
How, as you've observed
these, would you define as far

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.470
as indicators or warnings
that that tipping

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.930
point is beginning to happen?

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.680
Because I think anytime
you see corruption

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.686
there's people that are
fighting against it.

00:46:07.686 --> 00:46:09.310
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I
mean listen, people

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.560
might be willing to die but
they're not willing to let

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.400
their children die.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.350
And when a population
gets to the point

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:16.870
where there's a reasonable
chance their children will die,

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.430
they will do anything.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.400
They will walk across
several international borders

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.050
to safety.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.570
They will sell a kidney
on the black market.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.090
They will do absolutely
anything, including

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.480
breaking into a
military storehouse

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.790
and grabbing a bunch of AKs
and a couple of magazines

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.040
and fighting as best they can.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.120
They'll do that.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.680
So where is that tipping point?

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.890
The tipping point is
when the security forces

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:44.710
are detaining and torturing and
killing people, particularly

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:48.940
children, when they're
firing heavy machine gun

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.510
fire into crowds of protesting
people who are peaceful--

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.390
mothers, children, whatever.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:59.010
When that starts to happen and
if it goes on for too long,

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.177
that's the tipping point.

00:47:00.177 --> 00:47:02.260
And it would be the tipping
point in this country.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.240
I mean if that happened
in this country,

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.220
we'd all be grabbing
weapons, right?

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.126
I mean to defend our
families, of course.

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.750
I mean, we're the
product of evolution.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.060
We're the products of
individuals that made

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.410
certain choices to survive.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.670
We're the product of that.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.874
So of course we would
protect ourselves.

00:47:17.874 --> 00:47:19.540
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We
came close to that,

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.630
I think, after the
Revolutionary War

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.934
during the Whiskey Rebellion
and the debtors crisis,

00:47:23.934 --> 00:47:25.350
the Continental
soldiers going out

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.210
fighting for the
country and the debtors

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.230
coming and taking
their livelihoods,

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.340
and then during the Depression,
during the Bonus Army

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.500
fight when the military
came after the veterans who

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.060
were trying to get their
benefits from World War I.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.154
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah
right, absolutely.

00:47:40.154 --> 00:47:41.820
Human behavior doesn't
change very much.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.030
AUDIENCE: Hi, how are you doing?

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.609
So I have a question.

00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:50.900
What are your current thoughts
about the situation that

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.040
is happening in Iraq right now
with, they retook the city.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.840
And there's just this huge power
vacuum between the Iraqi Kurds

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.199
and with the other people
involved in the government.

00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:03.490
What are your thoughts on that?

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.160
What's the future for Iraq
looking like right now?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.930
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I
mean, I don't know.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.370
I'm not an expert and I never--

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.770
I didn't cover Iraq
because I didn't

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:13.910
think I could be objective.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.676
I mean back in '03 I
was so against the war.

00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:18.800
And I wasn't at all against
the war in Afghanistan.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.316
I thought we could do some good.

00:48:20.316 --> 00:48:21.690
I was so against
the war in Iraq,

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.465
I refused to cover
it because I didn't

00:48:23.465 --> 00:48:24.590
think I could be objective.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:26.290
So I'm not an expert in Iraq.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:26.840
I'm guessing.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.760
Things tend to slide towards
violence in countries that

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.890
are destabilized like that.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.848
And those are obviously
destabilized countries.

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:40.600
And they're also, at this
point, deeply traumatized.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.100
Everyone in those countries has
been exposed to really quite

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.060
a lot of violence.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.060
And so I'm guessing.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.860
I'm just going to guess
that that vacuum will

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:56.750
create turf wars
that will trigger

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.390
another phase of a regional war.

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.990
I hope not, but I
wouldn't be surprised.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.490
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Think about
the psychology of the children

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.800
since we've been in
Afghanistan since 2001.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.170
Now there's kids who have
been alive for 16 years

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:10.475
and all they've known is war.

00:49:10.475 --> 00:49:13.030
Or then with Iraq, all they've
known is war for 14 years.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.040
I mean that must have a--

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.300
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah, I
mean, we're almost at the point

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.980
where young American soldiers
fighting in Afghanistan

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.994
were born after 9/11, that
were not alive on 9/11.

00:49:27.994 --> 00:49:28.910
That's pretty amazing.

00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.040
As far as the
Afghans go, there's

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.590
children whose parents
have known nothing but war.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.680
I mean, it's incredible.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.080
And it's not their
fault. They didn't ask

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.240
to be invaded by the Soviets.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.730
They didn't ask to have
America load their country full

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.380
of weapons and then pull out.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.240
They didn't ask for any of that.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.730
They didn't ask to
have Pakistan arm

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.630
and organize and train a
radical Islamic militia

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.210
and send it across the borders
as the Taliban to take over.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.543
They didn't ask for any of that.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.160
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
being here Sebastian.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.710
It's been very
interesting to hear

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.346
you speak about this so far.

00:50:09.346 --> 00:50:11.220
I just have a question
about the documentary.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.030
And you mentioned the method
was self-documentation.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.460
So I'm assuming
that you and Nick,

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.010
seeing the footage
after the fact

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.985
and on the cutting
room floor and kind

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:24.360
of going through all of this,
what was that process like?

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.610
I imagine it must have
been intense at points

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:33.444
to see certain parts that were
recorded days or weeks after.

00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:34.860
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Yeah, of course.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.110
Yeah, some of the
footage was upsetting.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:40.680
But mostly your
job as director is

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.070
to create a narrative that's
compelling and provides

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:48.241
a vehicle to communicate
important information.

00:50:48.241 --> 00:50:49.740
I don't want it to
just be a history

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.700
lesson because people won't
watch the full hundred minutes.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.440
If it's just a series
of personal stories,

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.800
you may allow for a human
connection with the viewers,

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.594
and that's lovely,
and it's important.

00:51:01.594 --> 00:51:03.385
But you also need a
bit of a history lesson

00:51:03.385 --> 00:51:06.700
to understand why those humans
are having that experience.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.300
So all the different kinds of
footage we had, from the family

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.490
and from the other shooters
we had in the field--

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:15.940
we had access to a kind
of trove of ISIS footage

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.014
that ISIS had shot through
some kind of digital backdoor

00:51:19.014 --> 00:51:21.430
that I don't understand that
someone sort of found for us.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.900
And so we had access to a sort
of ISIS database of footage

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.400
that they shot.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.680
So we had all kinds of stuff.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.480
Some of it's super upsetting.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:40.670
Some of it was incredibly
motivating and encouraging.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.840
One of the strange things--

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.170
my book "Tribe" is about this--

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.990
the closer to a front line
you are, the more of a crisis

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.870
there is, the better people act.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.529
People within their communities
act incredibly well.

00:51:52.529 --> 00:51:55.070
And they act better and better
as things get worse and worse.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.630
And so one of the things
you see in a war zone

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.640
is people acting with
unbelievable nobility

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.550
and generosity and courage,
I mean just extraordinary,

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.800
in a way that they don't
have to in an affluent suburb

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.133
like the kind that I grew up in.

00:52:05.133 --> 00:52:06.509
I never saw noble
human behavior.

00:52:06.509 --> 00:52:08.300
I didn't see any bad
human behavior either,

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.880
but I certainly didn't see
any courage or anything.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.874
There wasn't any need
for courage, which

00:52:12.874 --> 00:52:14.040
is actually kind of a shame.

00:52:16.054 --> 00:52:17.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We'll
do two more questions.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.178
I just want to do a question.

00:52:19.178 --> 00:52:21.095
Can you talk about the
White Helmets In Syria?

00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.927
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yeah,
so the White Helmets

00:52:22.927 --> 00:52:24.580
were a civil
defense organization

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.410
that was organized
sort of organically,

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:32.260
spontaneously to rush into areas
that had been bombed by Assad's

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.510
air force, or later
the Russian Air Force,

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.080
and dig survivors
out of the rubble

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.899
and dig the corpses out of the
rubble to give to the families.

00:52:39.899 --> 00:52:41.440
And often those guys
would get killed

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.050
because there'd be a second
bombing attack on the same spot

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.730
to kill the first responders--

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.734
incredibly brave, unbelievably
brave young people doing that.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.140
AUDIENCE: OK, quick
question, I hope.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.570
The first is, is
the war on terror

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:03.680
moving to Africa, as
maybe evident by some

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.420
of the recent accounts?

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:10.550
And then secondly, you
mentioned Iraq being a mistake.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.000
Are we on a course
for the same type

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.010
of mistake with North Korea?

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:21.110
And perhaps would your team and
company do the same in terms

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.440
of gathering information
inside North Korea

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.170
like you did with Syria?

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:28.684
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: That
was a short question?

00:53:28.684 --> 00:53:30.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:30.699 --> 00:53:32.990
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We'll give
you 30 minutes to respond.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.410
Go for it.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.000
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I don't know
anything about North Korea

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.470
other than what I read
in the paper, which

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.220
is the same as what
you read in the paper.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.770
I've got similar
worries I'm sure,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.510
and also maybe an unrealistic
sense that people don't

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:48.400
do, just for the hell of it,
the worst thing imaginable,

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.390
like I just have to assume that.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.370
So is the war on terror
moving to North Africa?

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:56.830
I mean, it's been there
for 20 years, right?

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:57.670
I mean the Shabaab--

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:03.710
I mean in 1993, "Blackhawk
Down," Somalia was already--

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.100
is that terrorism?

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.810
It's an incredibly
troubled place.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:10.510
The Shabaab is absolutely
a terror organization,

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.760
as is Boko Haram.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:21.140
And Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups
have existed in the Sahara,

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.220
in this Sahel for
years and years.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.630
This isn't new.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:31.790
And of course we don't want
to fight those wars ourselves.

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.320
We can't fight everywhere.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.250
But those groups are
legitimate threats.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.830
An al-Qaeda-affiliated group
took over northern Mali

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.670
and overran Timbuktu
and destroyed

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:48.890
all these beautiful monuments,
Islamic mosques and things,

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:53.090
like destroyed them, and
killed a lot of the population

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.510
and were driven out by French
military action, thank God.

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.530
But I mean, that's
an important issue

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.290
not just for the
security of the West

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:02.870
but for the dignity and
the safety of the people

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:05.490
who live in those areas.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:09.284
And so we can't
fight all those wars.

00:55:09.284 --> 00:55:10.700
We shouldn't fight
all those wars.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.400
But one thing we can do is have
military trainers and advisors

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.730
there to help these
military forces

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:20.755
in those countries that are
often very ill equipped and ill

00:55:20.755 --> 00:55:21.260
trained.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.790
You just sort of get
them up to speed so they

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.230
can fight their own fights.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.400
That, to me, is a
completely legitimate use

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:34.610
of American power and knowledge.

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:37.250
So no, this isn't new.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:42.500
And someone asked me about
US forces in those areas

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.622
and why are we there, and
someone else said, "Oh,

00:55:44.622 --> 00:55:45.455
it's oil interests."

00:55:45.455 --> 00:55:47.270
I'm like, come on.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:49.170
I mean first of all,
you drive a damn car,

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.681
so you're not allowed to be
upset about us protecting

00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:54.680
oil interests around the
world as long as you're

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.210
using that shit, right?

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.420
Sorry, that's just
too hypocritical.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.300
But also, that's
ignoring the fact

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.460
that these
al-Qaeda-affiliated groups

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.520
are incredibly abusive
to the local population.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.550
Just remember that.

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:09.466
They're horrible.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.650
AUDIENCE: So going
back to "Restrepo"

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.620
and "Tribe," have
you given any thought

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.400
to revisiting the platoon
5, 10, 15 years from now

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.590
in the context of "Tribe"?

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:28.180
And possibly a second
question, expanding "Tribe"

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.740
into a feature documentary
is super interesting stuff.

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.850
SEBASTIAN JUNGER:
Yeah, thank you.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:37.250
The platoon is not a
platoon anymore, obviously.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:38.030
It's dispersed.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:41.450
And most of those guys are
now out of their military

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:44.840
and they're leading their lives.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.960
I don't think I'll
track them down.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.730
I don't know quite how I would--

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.679
I don't quite see
the narrative for how

00:56:51.679 --> 00:56:52.970
I would make a film about that.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:55.440
AUDIENCE: Because you
talk a lot about PTSD

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.898
and the brotherhood that
comes out of tragic events.

00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:05.800
The guys from my platoon
when I was in Iraq,

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.980
I feel like the deepest
brotherhood with them

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.540
just because we went through
the stuff we went through.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.320
But like my high
school football team,

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.080
before I went to Iraq they
were like my brothers, but then

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:25.380
now I won't even go to
a high school reunion--

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.575
so in that kind of context.

00:57:29.249 --> 00:57:31.540
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I'm not in
touch with all those guys.

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.060
I'm close to one guy in
particular that we're

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.200
really good friends.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.855
I'm in some kind of contact
with some of the others.

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:41.230
I'm not sure they're in that
much contact with each other

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.040
either.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.610
I'm not sure there's
a real story there.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:46.730
I hear what you're saying.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.200
But I think most
of those guys have

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.780
constructed their own
lives and sort of moved on.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.589
A few stayed in the
military, but not many.

00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:57.880
If I thought there was story
there, I'd think about it.

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:03.850
But also, I am moving on
from the topic of war,

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.400
very deliberately.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.040
"Tribe," obviously a little
part of it is about PTSD,

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.916
but mostly it's about our
society and community.

00:58:12.916 --> 00:58:16.600
And I'm definitely going to
keep going in that direction.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.490
I can't imagine having
not covered war.

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:20.560
It's part of who I am.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.490
I like to think I've
contributed in a good way

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:26.539
to our country's
conversation about war,

00:58:26.539 --> 00:58:27.580
our understanding of war.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.580
I mean, I'd like to think
I've done some good.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.550
The experience has been
sometimes painful but also

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:37.090
extremely positive for me,
having been a war reporter.

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:40.240
But I actually want
to move out of that.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:46.230
There is a kind of psychological
consequence to engaging

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.380
in war, in the topic of war.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.687
It doesn't cost nothing,
psychologically and morally.

00:58:52.687 --> 00:58:53.895
And I'm sort of done with it.

00:58:57.607 --> 00:58:59.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Well
thank you for joining

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.032
us to talk about the "Hell
on Earth" documentary.

00:59:03.032 --> 00:59:04.990
This concludes our first
part of the interview.

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:07.240
But let's give Sebastian a
round of applause for his time.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:07.350
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:08.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:10.400
Thank you.
