notice what do we do we take a concrete
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.760
notice what do we do we take a concrete
concept and we use it to describe more

concept and we use it to describe more
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460

of understanding a concepts in our
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.570
of understanding a concepts in our
cognitions and I can start with the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
cognitions and I can start with the
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.150
cognitions and I can start with the
temperature to show to show this effect

what expert the participants didn't know
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.910
what expert the participants didn't know
is that the experiment actually started

is that the experiment actually started
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.670
is that the experiment actually started
in the elevator because the experimenter

the other half she handed a warm cup of
 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.550
the other half she handed a warm cup of
coffee that's all then she took her cup

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560
coffee that's all then she took her cup
 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.710
coffee that's all then she took her cup
of coffee back then they came to the lab

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720
of coffee back then they came to the lab
 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.569
of coffee back then they came to the lab
immediately after that and they were

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579
immediately after that and they were
 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.220
immediately after that and they were
asked to judge a person they never knew

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230
asked to judge a person they never knew
 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.500

amazing result was that those who held a
