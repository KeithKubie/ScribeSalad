00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening, I'm Anne McLean,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.830
from the library's music
division and it is my pleasure

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.400
to welcome composer Gabriela
Lena Frank to the Library

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.930
of Congress tonight and
also Harry Christophers,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.760
who is the artistic
director of the Haydn and --

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700
Handel and Haydn Society.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.220
Very, very excited to
have you both with us.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.520
Thank you for coming.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.310 position:56%
This a very special concert
tonight, featuring the famous Handel

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.920
and Haydn Society and also a new
work co-commissioned by the Society

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.470
and the Library of Congress.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.070
We've been looking forward
to this for quite a while.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.730
The work was co-commissioned
by these two institutions

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.930 position:56%
to mark our milestone anniversaries,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.050
it's our 90th as a concert
presenter since 1925.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.110
And H&amp;H, the nations oldest
continuously performing arts

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.400
organization, is celebrating
its bicentennial.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.870
This is the Washington
premier and it was heard

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.840
for the very first time
last June in Boston

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.140
by a very chorus centric audience
at the Chorus America conference.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960
What was that evening like for you?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.260
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
It was brilliant.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.930
I mean, H&amp;H, we hosted Chorus
American in Boston and performed

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
in Symphony Hall, a program, a
very mixed program of some Handel,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.050
I think we did part- we
did some Messiah, I believe

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.380
and Gabriela has a wonderful piece
and we also did [inaudible 1:41].

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.780
It was a mixture particularly
devised for Chorus America

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.090
and all the delegates and choral
conductors and singers there.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.960
&gt;&gt; You know, we were looking,
I was showing them just now,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.990
we have a book, we have a
complete run of all the books

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.900
of pieces collected by the society,
and it began in 1815, right?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.370
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Yes, the
society gave its first concert

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.720
on Christmas Day 1815 in
Kings Chapel in Boston,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.020
in which there were pieces by
Handel and Haydn, of course.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.840
And why it was called that was

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.790
because Handel was the
old and Haydn was the new.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.510
Haydn died a few years.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.910
So it was very simple.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.670
But what's interesting
about these pieces and --

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.970
do we talk about this volume?

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.350
That what people don't know is
that H&amp;H was a publishing company.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.400
And in 1825, 1827, 1830, they
published various things,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.570
and one of these is called
the Old Colony Collection.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.300
And I was fascinated
by it because I had

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.110
with my group I founded
nearly 16 years ago,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.960 position:56%
we recorded the complete Eaton Choir
Book, which dates from, of course,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.340
1490, a few years before.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.310
But this, you know,
for a young country,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.810
this is quite a publication.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.770 position:56%
And it contains choruses from, a
lot of Handel choruses from Messiah,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.460
Israel and Egypt, Judas
[inaudible], Joshua.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.710
But then, a whole lot of what
I can term sort of late sort

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.060
of Chapel Royal verse anthems

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.600
by very well known composers
called Kent and Chapel.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.150
Does anybody know them?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.660
No. Well, not does
anybody in England either.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.130
But what was amazing is that these
people were clearly they were the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.230
best, the Howells of the
choral world in 1780,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.530
between about 1780 and 1800.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.670
And there's a piece by Kent
we're performing this evening,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.790
Hear my Prayer, that was actually
very, very popular at that time.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.690
Nobody possesses it
today in England.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.320
There's no cathedral choir
that has it in their library.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.110
But it was last published in a
collection for Durham Cathedral

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.410
in about 1843, but not performed.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.750
But here they are preserved in
the Old Colony Collection here.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.000
So you'll witness one
or two of those pieces.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.100
And also, you'll recognize,
there's a piece

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.060 position:56%
by a person called Mozart two sacred
words, and no prizes, I'm afraid,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.640
for guessing where the tune comes
from, but you'll hear it tonight.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.790
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know, you'll
have to go backstage in a moment,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.840
so we will start with you and
ask you a couple of questions.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.800
With your own ensemble,
the 16, which Harry founded

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.160
and has an extraordinary
reputation around the world,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.860
you achieved such an
expressive simplicity.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.030
And I saw a statement from
you somewhere where you said,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.920
"We shape the phrases according
to the architecture of the time,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.920
allowing the music to have
the freedom that it did then."

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.370
Supplied so beautifully that
this program, all the programs,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.170
you're doing new work, old work.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.750
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Well, I
mean, so much of the work I do

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.590
in England is [inaudible] music,
and of course, that's sacred music

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.540
that the composers of the day
wrote the music with the buildings

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.330
in mind just the same as
the building, builders,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.420
of those wonderful cathedrals
all throughout Europe built the

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.990
cathedrals with the music in mind,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.430
there were definite
ratios that were going on.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.420
And so, you know, to
fit that is lovely.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.540 position:56%
And when we talk about architecture,
I mean, architecture music,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.420
the whole idea of the arch phrase,
goes right through from [inaudible]

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.740
through Baroque right
through to early classical,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.090
and really I suppose
and with Beethoven,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.010
etcetera, things began to change.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.060
But really we can use that
idea of architecture and shape

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.610
of phrases right through certainly
into early Mozart and Haydn.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.910
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It's wonderful

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.850
to have Gabriela's
piece on this program.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.410 position:56%
We are pleased to have been working
with [inaudible] and with the Handel

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.380
and Haydn Society for two years

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.200
in the past years to
make this possible.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.810
And have had a number, of
course, discussions about it.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.590
It's string quintet and
full chorus of 26, right?

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.490
And tell us about the text.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.790
We were talking about this earlier.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.880
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.350
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Well,
it was interesting, wasn't it?

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.750
Because having a commission
bicentennial,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.710
we really pondered a lot about
what to do with the text.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.300 position:56%
And I said, it's got to be something
that was really relative to Boston.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.600
And somebody said, well,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.510
there's this amazing thing
called the Boston Hymn.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.440
I'd never heard it, but it's
incredibly long, isn't it?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.740
I mean, it's by Emerson.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.200
What, it's about three pages long.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.500
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank:
Something like that.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.650
And I remember in our
initial discussion,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.820
that I led a very good team on
board, very first [inaudible].

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.700 position:56%
I was pulling it up on the
Internet in that conversation we had

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.310
over the phone, there were
several of us sharing that.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.780
And I remember looking and going,
oh my god, and they only want this

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.170
to be 15, 18 minutes,
and I said this is --

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.520
plus you know, possible
instrumental interlude.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.000
We were already tossing out
our wish list of attributes

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.550
that could to go into the music.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.730
So I remember thinking, okay, you
know, I'm an editor's daughter,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.890
so I should be able to get
into this text and be able

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.220
to pull out salient elements.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.390
But doing just a simple
surgical exerting wasn't going

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.020
to really do well because the text,
if you know it, is very linear.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.930
So if you have to just
remove a verse,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.760
it suddenly doesn't make sense.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.800
So what you need to do is go
to each one and distill it

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800
down a little bit more, and
then it actually makes sense.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.610
If you get rid of some of
the details that trip you up

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.100
and just get it down
to the bare-bones.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.430
And then it's also
a bit of a sermon.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.540
Now, sermons don't
necessarily lend themselves well

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.270
to song, but lyrics do.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.640 position:56%
So was there a type of lyricized
sermon that I can make so I preserve

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.140 position:56%
that sense of foretelling the future
when you get away from tyranny.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.420
I mean, it was very, very important
to keep that sense of grandeur

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.830
and that sense of awareness
of the past that Emerson had,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.440
but also the optimism that
he had for the future.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.150
So we worked out something where I
was able to distill the text down.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.450
And then to give a
very prominent role,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.070 position:56%
you'll see, to the instrumentalists.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.390
They tell the story I
think equal to the singers.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.690
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Yes,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.410
and actually what Gabriela's
done is achieved a wonderfully --

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.530
to say it's an archaic sound
with the singers isn't quite --

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.510 position:56%
it sounds very colonial, it really
does capture, I just feel, you know,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.640
as soon as the singers come in,
it captures something about 18,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.240
the early 1800s and it's amazing.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.350
[inaudible] there are no kings and
that sort of stuff, which is good.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: About the text
itself, it's very compelling.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.470
It doesn't refer, it
refers to slavery and that

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.870
of course is a very important issue
of the day of his, Emerson's day.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.730
What, what were the
phrases, I want to ask you

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.770
about the recitative-like quality.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.820
Somebody had noticed that there
were certain moments that have

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.920
that quality and the
diction is incredible.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.730
I heard the recording
of the premiere.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.640
Well, that's what you're known for,
that's what, among other things,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.840
that's what the Society
is known for,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.130 position:56%
is carrying the word so beautifully.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.290
Are you thinking of recording
it, perhaps, at some point?

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.590
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: I don't
know, we'll, we'll have to see.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.820
We'll have to see if
it's in the future.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.130
I think it's -- something you
mentioned, just about the words,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.760
I mean, the fact that this text,
of course, is so, is so powerful

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.960
and so powerful to America.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.270
And, one of the things
of this concert is just

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.490
after Gabriela's piece we
have pieces by William Byrd,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.480
which of course, are
incredibly powerful to, you know,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.420
it's from the, you know, era of the
of, of post-Reformation in England

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.640
when Catholics lived
in fear of their life.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.670
And you'll see that actually
what I, there's a modest elegy

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.120
to Thomas Tallis by William Byrd.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.420
But then I've also, for the
[inaudible] you'll notice I,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.160
I've just had, I will have
four singers, just at the side

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.540
of the stage, singing this in a
very intimate way because they --

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.670
and Byrd wrote those
masses for private use.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.270
They weren't for singing, well,
they weren't allowed to be sung

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.390
in the bigger theaters because
they were in Latin, of course.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.880
But they would have been sung
in, in a private house, Rectors

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.940
and Catholics, getting
together, worshiping in private

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.210
and if Thomas Cromwell
had knocked at the door,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.610 position:56%
their heads would have been cut off.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.090
I mean it's, it's, it's, you
know, this was powerful stuff.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.880
So just in the same
way that your piece

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.680
in the Boston Hymn is very
powerful, we know we can reflect

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.630
that way back 400 years
to, to England.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.930
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: I remember,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.050
what I wanted to convey
too was a real fine line.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.150 position:56%
I wanted to celebrate and to be
glorious when we get to that moment.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.820
But to also count, to hint that the
tyranny that he is referring to.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.280
So there is some rather dark
writing and dark harmonies,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.910
and you have to go there as
a player, you can't eschew

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.240
that in the drama as
much higher as a result.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.400
It may not be that obvious
when you look at the sermon.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.330
And it was when I distilled
it that I saw the jewels

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.220
and these lines that
were coming out.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.450
And I was like, this is really
high, it's almost operatic.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.870
It's just high drama.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.820
But he had that kind of feeling.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.800
So that raised the
bar when I saw that,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.840
that there's a lot
of levels to this.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.150
So can I come up with music that
likewise has those kinds of levels.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.070
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was thinking, you
mentioned earlier that the writing

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:09.700
for the voices at some point I saw
something referenced to low voices

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.760
and high voices, would you
expand on that a little bit.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.920
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: Well,
for me a choir is an orchestra.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.320
It's not just voices and
it's not just [inaudible].

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.630
There's the color blend.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.010
We talk about sopranos
and we talk about altos,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.740
and yes there's a slight
[inaudible],

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.980
different color, that's
very important.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.860
And of course, a woman
can sing a note

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.330
that a man sings the exact
same note at the same octave

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.180
and it's a completely
different color,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.820
one that's instantly
recognizable by anyone.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.340
So the interplay of low and high
is an easy way to separate verses.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.970
You can just assign now girls,
now boys, now boys, now girls.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.500
But then you can also blend.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.390
So there's an innate kind of
drama of teaming up and separating

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.260
that can be very effective.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.960 position:56%
And Emerson has that too, there's
certain lines that are higher drama,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.520
other lines that are almost like a
Greek chorus, that are commenting,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.040
some lines advance the plot,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.320
others make the metaphorical
elusion to something in nature.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.630
It's expensive when you
make an elution to nature

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.100
to make the lyrics pretty,
but if they can also double up

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.560
and advance the plot at the
same time, for me that's almost

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.020
like combining high and low voices.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.060
So you can see how he's
orchestrating with colors

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.190
and intentions at the same time.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.950
So I like, you know, symphonically
when I write for the choir,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.710
and some people say I write
vocally for the symphony,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.390
so I think you find
that common ground.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.690
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
It's interesting

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.820
because actually also
you're cast writing,

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.100
the string writing is very,
very different, is it?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.160
And it's very -- I mean, there's
kind of the sort of folk elements

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.430
that come into it, which
where did they come from?

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.730
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: Yes.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.330
And if you've read anything in
my bio, you'll know that I'm not

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.760
from Boston, and I have a
Jewish Lithuanian forebears,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.370
Chinese forebears, and
Peruvian forebears.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.620
And then I was born in Berkeley
in 1972, and hit Berkeley,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.920
you know, hippie hay day.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:15.980
So I am very I represent a lot
of Americans in my generation.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:22.040
And in my life as I have studied
musica Indian, Indian music,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.770
of Bolivia, Equador, Peru, and
looking at the colonial music too

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.310
that has come over, I've also made
a study casually, very casually,

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.630
of folk music of the
world, of other cultures.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.080
And there's certain
gestures that just seem to be

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.450
of the people that come up.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.160
There's a kind of lift, there's
a kind of grace note phrasing

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.290
that seem to lend themselves
well to flutes.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.060
And we have flutes everywhere.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.880
And I mean, this is a
very general observation,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.320
and even people listening to
music of mine that is not Indian,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.930
this is not an Indian work,
they still see the things that I

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.710
like to do in my ostensibly
Indian influence works.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.540
So one of the things I
noticed the folkloric groups,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.270
there a lot of solos.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.570 position:56%
There's something about the intimacy

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.110
of the three other players backing
off and one player coming forward.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.430
And have that in this
kind of writing.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.520
There's something vocal
about the line.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.610
And you have a lot of that
in the string writing,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.260
where one player just
starts going off

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.390
and just got this very
expressive feeling.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.090
For me that is of the people,
it's something very much

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.800
of the populace mindset,
expressing yourself that way.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.460
The harmonies, sort of,
sort of, open harmonies.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.490
Dismisses are usually
inflected folkloric music.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.500
A lot of people think the
harmonies are very simple,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.740
if you only look the primary
notes of the melodies.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.110
But if you look at
all the little notes,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.500 position:56%
they do getting into the main notes.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.070
Instead of going [note sounds],
they might go [note sounds].

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.680
All the little notes
that are characteristic

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.690
of one region over another.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.240
They're often not that consonant,
and that's what enriches the music.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.540
Actually, for me, it's a bit
like seeing a very nice sweater

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.600
and it comes with that tag,
and saying that, you know,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.690
the variations in the
fabric are not blemishes,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.030
it's what makes it interesting.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.710
Yet it's still a sweater.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.860
But the so-called blemishes I think
are the most interesting aspects

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.160
of folkloric music.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.460
And there's plenty of that.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.680
I write it out, I don't leave it
for the player at their discretion

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.080
to inflect as you would
with folkloric music.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.990
I mean, I'm a bit of
a control freak,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.950
so I just make sure
everything is in there.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.010
But you also want to
bulletproof the music.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.200
If you don't have such skilled
players as the H&amp;H musicians,

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.810
you really need musicians
that need everything spelled

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.410
out so then they can emote
and feel comfortable.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.180 position:56%
That's another reason why, if you're
making folkloric allusions, you try

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.610
and use the notational
vocabulary of classical music.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.520
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Was this
your first work for chorus?

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.820
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank This one?

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.010
Oh, no, oh, no.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.600
This one I only earned because
I wrote about a dozen or so.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.020
I mean, you work your way up.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.220
And in fact, your former
director heard me speak on a panel

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.980
at a previous Chorus America
conference and then followed-up,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.280
she sounds very interesting.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.240
Follow-up and listen
to choral music.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.510
This was a very careful
considered search

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.550
on their part for something
like this.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.350
And I have more choral
music in my future.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.950
I have a requiem that
I will be writing for,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.810
the Houston Symphony
and their large choir.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.580
And I only have one requiem
in me, so I really have

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.980
to do well with this one.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.620
I have an opera coming up, and
the opera will also have a chorus.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.330
So it's interesting, the
choir is very portable.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.100
You can taken it into many
different kinds of environment.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.200
It can be a capella, the Kings
Singers, so that's one kind.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.930
[inaudible] children's
choirs, very, very different

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.610
than if they are steeped in
tradition, as you guys are,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.260
but still looking to the future,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.660
completely different
animal from the opera.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.810
Or a symphony's own choir is not
the same as an opera's own choir.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.110
I went to school with singers,

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.280
so I understand these very strange
creatures that we call singers.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.940
I understand their
culture, and I love it.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.120
I really I love art song too.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.460
And sometimes I try to write choral
music that sounds like art song

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.940
in the tradition of Schubert or
Shuman, when you have one singer

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.710
and one piano and that's
it for the evening.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.790
There's something very beautiful
about that, and I try to bring

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.950
that into choral writing as well.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.060
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I remember that one

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.580
of your interviews said your piano
teacher used to play art songs

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.880
for you when you were a child,
which is sort of unusual

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.440 position:56%
to be introduced to them that early.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.590
But that inculcates a
lot of your writing.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.640
And I was thinking too about
your comments about the opera.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.960
I was curious about, well, I
was thinking about this work,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.090
this Emerson text and the
work that you've just written,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.080
which is almost like a sacred work.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.820 position:56%
And thinking about the fact that H&amp;H
was formed to perform sacred music.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.680
But it has this strong
element in it.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.100
And I was just thinking about
the society too, and your plans.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.090
Do you ever have mixed evenings as
you used to do in the early part

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.730
of the history, when you would have
a Beethoven symphony alongside a

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.260
piano concerto, and you know?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.560
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
Oh, yes, we do.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.000
I mean, the thing is, now
it's a period orchestra.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.250
So when Chris [inaudible]
was made assistant director

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.680
in the early '80s, and Chris
turned a brave move, I mean,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.220
a very brave move that time to
sort of complete transition.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.650
Change the orchestra
into paired orchestra,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.390
and which has grown
and grown and grown.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.940
And it's a very interesting
subject because, of course,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.200
it's changed the so-called
mission statement

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.930
of bringing of being old and new.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.860
But in my book, actually, by
having paired instruments,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.820
what we're doing is quite
simply making the music

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.560
of the past sound new.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.650
I mean, it's fascinating hearing
a pair of orchestras play Bach,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.990
play Haydn, play Beethoven.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.680
You hear things you've
never ever heard before,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.400
especially baroque music, you
hear tone colors of instruments

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.830
that just don't exist
today, and that I think is

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.400
so wonderfully beautiful.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.760 position:56%
And I'm afraid today and I can't
hear a modern orchestra play baroque

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.210
music, I really can't.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.220
It's just so it's just not
-- we've learned so much.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.020
I mean, the thing is, when the
paired music movement started,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.960
Chris [inaudible] formed
his own group in England,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.600
Academy of Ancient Music, all those
years ago in the very early '70s.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.920 position:56%
I remember because actually I sang
at Westminster, after I left Oxford,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.610
I sang at Westminster Abbey for
six years, I sang professionally

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.140
for six years before I gave
up, I didn't sing anymore.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.660
But I sang in Chris
Hawkwood's very first creation.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.830
And I remember, oh my goodness,

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.220
the orchestra playing was
well, it was not brilliant.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.440 position:56%
Because these people were, you know,
these players were sort of learning

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.470
on the job, they were learning all
about these wonderful instruments.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.520
They were trying to get sounds
out of an oboe, an early clarinet,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.980
and you know, the horns
were -- it was [inaudible].

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.550
But bit by bit, these
players now understand it,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.750
at the Juilliard Movement,
the Juilliard program

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.280
in New York, it's staggering.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.060
We're getting fantastic players
coming through that are really good

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.000
in their own right, and it's very
exciting, it's very exciting times.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.290
And I think the result is

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.340
that paired music it's
really coming alive.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.700
And if ever you get the chance to
come to Boston and hear H&amp;H live

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.910
in the symphony hall,
it's an experience.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.030
The vitality and physicality that's
being produced by the music-making.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.950
And not only that,
it's the communication.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.930
These players and singers,
they love what they do.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.660
They know so much about
their instruments

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.670
and what they're singing
about and the text.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.870
And I'm very text-ive
and I'm not interested

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.700
in a choir making a beautiful
sound and doing the breaths

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.890
and singing perfectly in tune and
the words are sort of a compliment,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.950
sort of syllables are an
appendage to the notes on the page.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.800 position:56%
It's not about that, it's about, you
know, anybody writes for the voice,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.420
you're writing text, text, text
all the time, the text has to live.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.960
And in my book, I mean, they get
very bored by me saying, look,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.750
you just go back to [inaudible],
he said, sing as you speak,

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.630
and that's the dictum that
you can use for everything.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.100
And the musical will come
alive and it won't be false.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.310
That's what I think, anyway.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Such a rich history.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.720
And it's so exciting to see how
you do this very old music you're

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.250
speaking about with
new composers too,

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.910
and that's pretty amazing
for us to contemplate.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.450
I was reading about you the society
tried to commission Beethoven,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.710
and that was kind of fascinating.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.280
And I looked up a bit
here and there about it,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.170
but he wasn't able to accept it.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.520
But just the fact that you
went after him, as they say.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.820
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.330
I mean, in society, you
look back over the history,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.840
that H&amp;H premiered not only
Messiah, Haydn's creation,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.140 position:56%
Bach's Matthew Passion, [inaudible].

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.040
Don't worry, I'm not going
to do that, don't worry,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.400
I'm not going to play that here.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.260
But anyway, it's an immense legacy

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.410
to this country, and
it's fascinating.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.360
And what was the lovely
thing in the bicentennial is

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.810
that we were revisiting pieces
that we hadn't done for years.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.880
I did a performance
of Handel's Jephtha,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:35.120
which H&amp;H last performed I
think in 1858 or something.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.920
It was amazing.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Now that you've come

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.580
through this extraordinary
celebration period,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.360
do you have a new trajectory
for the next few years?

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.620
Because you've really guided
this whole bicentennial.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.920
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Yes.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.650
I mean, in many ways
it's more of the same.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.440
My great love is Handel, so
every season we will close

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.190
with a Handel oratorio.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.530
This year we're closing
with Handel's Saul,

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.990
his first oratorio,
which is immense.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.240
It's a phenomenal piece.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.370
Next year we'll do [inaudible],
the two secular, the two oratorios

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.750
that were a disaster in his
lifetime because god forbid,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.780
you couldn't have, you know, the
word oratorio had to be sacred.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.760 position:56%
And the profanity of something like
a story of sex and lust as a simile,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.920
you know, it's not for the
audiences of those days,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.420
but it's a brilliant piece.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.630 position:56%
And we'll carry on to do I'm
planning to do Theodora and Susanna.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.600
Wonderful music.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.040
Handel, he just has this
incredible insight into characters,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.990
and all those amazing
Old Testament stories

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.290
which he just brings to life.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.400
And we see we now see so
many of them being done

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.410
on the operatic stage,
which I think is brilliant.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.360 position:56%
We need to look back to Theodora and
Peter Sellars as amazing production

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.730
that sort of set Handel
alight really.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.850
So yes, I mean, it's sort
of continuing the same.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.730
We have big acts on
Haydn's symphonies.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:03.900
Haydn for me is just a
phenomenal symphonic writer.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.280
I can't remember which, I think it
was [inaudible] or somebody said,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.860 position:56%
somebody asked him why do you never,
why do you never perform Haydn?

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.090
He said it's too difficult
for the modern orchestras.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.640
It is difficult, and you
know, and he has this sort of,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.910
you look him up in a textbook
and he has this adage,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.370
the grandfather of the symphony.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.300
And it sort of makes people think,
oh, he must be a bit boring.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.020
But he's not.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.970
He's full of wit, emotion,
drama, charm and I just say

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.090
to the players every time, you
know, Haydn every day he could,

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.090
he went for a walk and he took
a notebook with him and he wrote

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.780
down in that notebook things
about the colors of the leaves,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.420
what animals he saw, what he
was feeling like, what the color

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.570
of the sky was, and had all
his symphonies, his creation,

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.410
everything, everything he
wrote, it's all pictorial.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.630
And you just have to
have imagery behind you

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.880
and think up ideas the whole time.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I didn't know about
these notebooks, that's fascinating.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.290
It's like [inaudible]
album leaves, you know?

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.700
And, yeah, so say a
bit more about those.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.000
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
Well, I mean it's, I mean,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.030
it's amanchor [phonetic], of
course, did a lot of research

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.330
and amanchor's, of course,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.620
recordings of Haydn are
just second to none.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.210
They are wonderful, what he
gets out of the composer.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.990
I think what it, what it
just gives us an insight

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.270
into what Haydn was
thinking the whole time.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.830
And, you know, we don't --
there's a tendency, well,

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.530
there's been a tendency
with period music

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.430
and the whole historic [inaudible]
performance to get bogged

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.460
down in academia and that to sort

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.230
of rather overload
our performance of it.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:42.760
And, so that, that's why when I'm
rehearsing Haydn I invent ideas

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.320
and just imagery.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.630
It may not be what Haydn was
thinking but it might have been.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.740
But I'm sure Haydn would be pleased
that actually we're doing that

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.210
and we're thinking about, you know,

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.700
how to interpret this particular
phrase and everything's important,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.250
just some things are more
important than others.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.550
And, we go into a lot of detail

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.440
and hopefully then it will
come to life on stage.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.810
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It's
fascinating what you say

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.560
about the natural world being
such an influence on him.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.120
Does this also play
a role in your work?

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.120
And also, I wanted to ask you
too about, I read somewhere

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.680
that you have a practice of waking
up and warming up as a composer.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.690
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: Yeah,
actually, I'm also a pianist,

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.770
although I didn't get any
degrees as a pianist in school.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.290
I was lucky enough to
attract the attention of very,

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.380
very good teachers and
I played a lot and one

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.920
of my old schoolmates here,
Wendy Olson's, in the audience,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.360
is somebody I accompanied
her in playing all the works

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.820
of Bartok [inaudible], from
violin and piano for her recital.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.370
So, I was very active in
that way and, in doing so,

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.620
I picked up some really
good habits as a pianist

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.600
that also work for composing.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.750
So, performers do exercises.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.270
They do scales, they do arpeggios,

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.600
but they don't perform those
scales and arpeggios for you.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.850
You wouldn't pay money
[inaudible] to listen

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.940
to them go up and down on those.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.880
But, the scales and arpeggios,
the ideas that they're embedded

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.570
in everything they do and even to
practice, it's not just technical

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.450 position:56%
and musicalizing your scales, making
them very musical, your arpeggios,

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.240
is a very good one for performers.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.190
In most compositional
training programs,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.960
we don't come up with
the analogy of this.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.200
And I started doing this really on
my own, coming up with exercises

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.500
that I can do as a composer.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.210
So for instance, something
that's embedded

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.520
in every piece are transitions.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.040
And transitions are
notoriously difficult

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.480 position:56%
for especially younger inexperienced
composers to master, how do you get

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.410
from something that's really
high drama and then clunk,

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.350
you're in the soft
section and clunk,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.800 position:56%
it's just high drama all over again.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.940
And some composers are difficult

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.690
because they don't give you much
transition time, maybe two measures

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:48.990
to try smooth everything out.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.880
You can see the performers
putting the brakes on.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.820
It's a bit like a plane
trying to take off

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.500
with only a little bit
of land to run from.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.690
And if the composer is very
distinguished, they just accept it.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.060
So you can practice transitions.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.680
And something I do often
is I will take something

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.920
like perhaps eight bars
of the Handel Messiah,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:15.320 position:56%
and then I will take eight bars of
Muller Six, and I have to join them.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.400
And it is great fun
because you're working

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.410
with fabulous material,
first of all.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.660
And you're getting in there, and
you really understand something

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.370
about Handel when you see
he could have done this,

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.960
but he went here instead.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.160
You're inside the forest rather
than just looking from the outside,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.540
and you're touching the trees
and you're getting in there.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.150
Or you could do something
like Shostakovich,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.570
and take a string quartet and
go to Bartok, another quartet.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.400
So now the instrumentation
is the same, you have to get

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.730
into it in a different way.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.120
It's not just bleeding in
the instruments smoothly,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.360
it's actually understanding
what makes this Russian,

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.380
what makes this Hungarian, what
makes this two different gentlemen.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.290
So because that situation, the
Handel to Muller, the Shostakovich

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.320
to Bartok, it's going to come up
in my own music, the parallel.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.620
And when it does, I'm ready.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.960
In fact, I'm filled with ideas.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.450
So often I'm asked, how long did
it take you to write something?

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:19.050
And that's a hard question for me
to answer because when I sit down

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.290 position:56%
and I assemble all the transitions
I played around with over the years,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.150
because I keep everything
in my binders, in my studio.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.360
And I have maybe 40, 50
binders of just material

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.290
that has surfaced over the years.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.340
Are inflammable, and
creativity went into that.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.390
So it doesn't take me long to
take something and get started.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.280
And they took time.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.840
So assembling everything together,
writing new music, hiding my tracks

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.980
so you wouldn't be able to connect
it to the notes, and really coming

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.870
out with something that
doesn't sound like Frankenstein,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.120
may only take a month to
six weeks, but doesn't take

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.050
into account all the time I put
into each and every little bit

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.770
that winds up in the binder.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.590
So the exercises are a really
good way to keep you in shape.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.100 position:56%
I can't imagine a performer not
staying in shape and trying to learn

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.750
from ground zero each
and every work.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.950
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Like your
long tones and your scales.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.250
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: Yeah.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.550
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And all the things.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.590
You said that composers are
storytellers, and this, of course,

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.180
applies to all the composers
that you were performing with,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.840 position:56%
the society and all composers today.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.250
And you talked about -- I
love this phrase, you said,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.900
composers are storytellers
uniting a lot of different things,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.170
coating it in music in order to
give our impressions of the world.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:41.240
I'm just thinking, there's so much
to be said, I want the audience

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.330
to have a chance to ask
you both some questions.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.090
We talked -- I want to mention
one or two other things.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.070
One was that the society
commissioned Amy Beach.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.100 position:56%
And we own 300 of her works here, so
that's an interesting thing for us.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.400
And that she was only 22
when she wrote the mass

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.730
that the society premiered.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.310
And it was very seldom
done after that.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.600
But she also had a
symphony performed

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.110
by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:13.530 position:56%
So I wanted to just ask you to touch
on the issue, this reminded me,

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.750
to touch on the issue of
diversity and inclusion

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.960
of composers broadening
the canon of composers.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.530
And by this gesture,
this is a wonderful thing

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.470
to have this commission
out in the world

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.480
for a major choral
society like this.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.570
What is your thinking today on
how to mentor this and how also

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:36.340
for you how to open this up,
how do you open this dialogue?

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.950
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: We could
talk about this in a seminar

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.850
over a week, how to adjust and the
issue of diversity in the arts.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.870
I have thought of myself
primarily as a one-woman show.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.060
As a freelancer, I don't have
a nonprofit organization.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.030
I haven't worked in the public
schools where we are bereft

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.400
of our arts programs in a
way that we weren't before.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.390
In many ways I'm kind of a plug-in,
like going and I do what I can.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.590
And when I get invited like to work
with you, that is one statement.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.840
If I'm invited to work with the
Sphinx Organization, the founder,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.800
Aaron Dworkin, won the
MacArthur Genius Grant.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.490
He was actually a schoolmate
of mine at the University

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.940
of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.550
He was a young multiracial
African-American violinists,

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.880
already going after repertoire
by African-American composers.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.180
I remember myself looking

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.450 position:56%
at the repertoire thinking there
wasn't enough that reflected my kind

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.020
of history, and I had to
do something about it.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.320
So I set the bar high.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.050
I started to see myself in a way
that really put me, you know,

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.670
as needed by the world but
needed in a high-quality way.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.970
I really have to pay my dues.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.600
I have to be great at what I did,
I couldn't just be a messenger.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:56.520 position:56%
So now I have found a lot of, as I'm
getting older, I turn 44 this year,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.840
I am old enough when
I go into the colleges

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.520
that I could be their parent,
and they look me as a role model.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.390
And I can see their eyes get big.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.600
I just left DePaul University, a
week there, and the women composers

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.800
and actually the men composers too,
they can welcome diversity as well.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.500
This is something that's
an issue for all of us.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.920
So it just means I can't walk
away, I have to keep going.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.910
There aren't very many women
composers yet, it's much better.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.820
This is a similar issue for
women conductors as well.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.850
I actually think they are a little
bit behind the composing maybe

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.920
because it's more public.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.440
You know, most composers were away,
and then for events like this,

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.630
we come out of the closet and we
actually have there's a face to us.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.390
But it comes about through
the efforts singular as well

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.360
as an aggregate of what
we can do collectively.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.050
I mean, you guys heard me
on a panel, and I was kind

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.280
of an out-of-the-box selection

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.190
for this great honor,
this great commission.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.490
But it takes -- an endorsement

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.930
like this is very powerful,
is very powerful.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.970
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers: Yes, I think
it's very interesting because I --

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.370
one of the reasons Gabriela
came out of that box

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.130
because actually we found
your music challenging,

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.970
which I certainly felt
the vocal music.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:20.070
You know, I find -- I've got
a bit bold statement here,

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.980
but I find a lot of choral music
that's written today is just not

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.280
challenging enough.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.700
People are falling into this
sort of mold of what is something

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:36.040 position:56%
that is beautiful sustained is
going to be they can meditate to or,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.990
you know, it's going to be a fail.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:42.820
To me it's wallpaper music, and I
want something that's challenging.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.900
I'm not going to name
any of those composers.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:51.800
But you know, for me, I mean, in
England there's a Scottish composer

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.890
who I have immense respect
for, James MacMillan.

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:59.390
He wrote a big Luke Passion that
was co-premiered, co-commissioned

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.690
between the Boston
Symphony Orchestra

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.360
and the London Symphony Orchestra.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.870
You know, his music's
challenging and it's rewarding.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.560
We need to only look
back to Britain,

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.890
Tippett [inaudible],
people like that.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.910
You know, you know, the music
was challenging but it, you know,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.730
there's something rewarding
about it.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.710
And one can slip into a very
[inaudible] in particular can slip

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.250
into something that is
just easy or, you know,

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.700
just makes a pleasant sound.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.560
And it's sort of, in a sense,
it's the way that I think many,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.480
many choirs operate, you know,
they're intent on being beautifully

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.960
in tune, beautifully together, the
breaths have no part of the music

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.820
and it's just, it's what
I call pastel shades.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.200
You see, I want, I want
a vibrant oil painting.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.170
I don't want any pastel shades.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.470
And, that's what you, you know,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.770
[inaudible] because that's
what you've given us,

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.260
you've given us something that's
vibrant, that we have to work at.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.660
And the reward is great in the end.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.240
I mean, it's interesting about
a composer, I mean, we have a,

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.110
in England we have a lot of, a
lot of very fine female composers,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.630
who are writing in all
repertoires, I mean, like you know,

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.720
think of Judith Weir, Sally Beamer,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.790
straight off who are writing
for all sorts of genres.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:15.790
And it's brilliant
and, yeah, more of it.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.090
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: More of it.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.390
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Have you
both here at the same time,

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.810
I wasn't sure we'd have
the pleasure of having you.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.360
But this is great.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.300 position:56%
And I want to ask if there's anybody

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:31.870
who has questions before
Harry has to go backstage.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.360
Questions, anybody?

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.220
No. I have a question.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.630
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering, I'd like
to know more about the opera

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.390
that you're writing and when it's
going to be premiered and where?

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.840
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank:
Well, the last couple --

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.860
now I can start talking
more publicly about it.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.330
You know, opera is a
very hard come-about,

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.970 position:56%
this has been in the works for about
nine years, when I really think

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.860
about the first, you know,
murmurs of something happening.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.060
There's a consortium of several
opera companies so that a lot

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.550
of planets have to be in alignment.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.800
They work out who gets to premiere,
what singers, their own singers,

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.610
are they going to share
the production design.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.590
For the composer [inaudible] team,

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.560
we are the smallest
part of the equation.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.260
Maybe, you know, for posterity,
our name is on the score.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.120
But wow. So my writer is Nilo Cruz.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.370
He has the distinction of being
the first Latino to win a Pulitzer

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.370
for his play in 2002,
Anna in the Tropics.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.090
And I believe that was the
first off-Broadway play

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.410
to be awarded this.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.310
And he's a wonderful, fantastic
writer, great imagination.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.440
And like me, he has a penchant

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.120
for imagining a what-if
for his characters.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.020
He may take actual events
and they may be the backdrop,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.580
but then he paints
a different story.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.980
So even though he talks a lot
about political topics in Cuba,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.060
he's Cuban-American, that's not
what the story is really about.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.820
And I sometimes feel
like I do the same thing

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.520
where there is the influence
of my mother's culture,

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.000
but it's not per se I'm not trying
to make a string quartet sound

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.670
like a band of some
poignant panpipes.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.120
I'm trying to infuse the essence
and take it into my own way.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:15.220
So our story is we will be
revisiting Flee that Diego Rivera.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.940
But there is an existing opera that
tells the arc of her story already.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.930
And it's a difficult dramatic
arc to make work theatrically.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.220
She dies inconveniently
and things aren't resolved.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.690
So we decided we want to be able
to do more and there are sounds

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.740
that we wanted to go
after, fantastical sounds,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.210
and we need to make
this story fantastical.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.860
So we're welding it with the
El Dia de los Muertos festival,

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.260
the day of the dead.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.350
So we know that Freda died
three years after Diego.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.660
What a lot of people don't know is

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.890
that Diego accepted Catholicism
right at the end of his life.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.950
And he was a communist, but
he accepted it fearful that,

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.430
you know, his time was up.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.820
And he was calling for Freda.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.810
There's a little letter
where he says this.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.950
And we said, that's it, so
Frida's a spirit in the underworld

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.730
and she comes back to reminisce.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.590 position:56%
So this way we can have spirits, we
can have the villagers that come in,

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.780
but we have a third pivotal
character and that is Catrina.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.130
She's the Centinela, or
the keeper of the spirits.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.460
She is a trickster and a prankster.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.940
She gets to decide which of
the spirits go back every year.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.000
So maybe Antonio, this year, you
know, the diabetic, you can go back

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.760
and here's some candy for you.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.400
Or this Salatino, the
old man, you know,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.290
who broke his neck,
here's your cane.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:36.240
And so and there's
between Frida and Catrina.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.060
Two strong women, you know, the
past, that is hinted at Catrina,

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.670
how did she get to
be in this position,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.680
you know, what is going on here.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.370
So she watches as Freda
and Diego reminisce,

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.440
and it is absolutely
wonderful, really glorious.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.670
So we are looking at
the 18, 19 season.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.090
And I've been on my phone a lot,
yes, no, yes, no, with contracts

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:03.190
and working out the
details of instrumentation.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.330
We believe that Catrina
will be a high soprano.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.770
We think that Frida will
possibly be a mezzo.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:14.160
And we want to high baritone for
Diego because he is avuncular,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.140
so he's got to have some of the
lows and that sort of gravitas.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.210
But he also is heroic, but
can't just make him a tenor.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:28.620
So we need a high baritone.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.010
That's what the opera is about.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:37.900
&gt;&gt; Is it going to be in English
or Spanish or Spanglish or both?

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.970
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank: It will
be Spanish with the possibility

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.200
of an English version later.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.400
But, you know, English is my first
language and Spanish is my second.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.670 position:56%
And I believe that there was a place
of imagination I can go to when I go

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.820
into the Spanish, because
it's different.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.490
I have to have to leap for it.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.240
And I cut my teeth on
very lyrical Spanish too.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.040
Even when I start speaking Spanish,
I started getting very musical

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.440
in the way I speak it as well.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.210
And so we always knew we
wanted to go into Spanish.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.920
The challenge for us is trying to
get to a Mexican Spanish that's

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.190
from their time, as opposed to
Mexican Spanish that we hear today.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.490
I went to school in Houston,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.710
so I know [inaudible] Spanish
very well, is different.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.740
And Nilo is Cuban and I'm Peruvian
and my mom has still street slang

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.020
that she uses that people
look at me when I bring up,

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.570
and they have no idea
what I'm saying.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.260
So we are interested.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.760
It's a challenge, you're right.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.090
The element of challenge is
very important for artists.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:38.560
And so this kind of challenge,

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.310
especially even the
subtle challenge,

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:45.370
rather than a really obvious one,
are the most difficult to get.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.160
Like the high money
note, okay, you know,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.910
I'll just practice and I'll get it.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.360
But something like,
what's the difference

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:55.200
between Mexican period Spanish
from their time as opposed

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:06.000
to what I hear today, as
opposed to what I know.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.120
So we'll be in Spanish.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:15.270
&gt;&gt; I wonder how much
of a role you have

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.930
in defining the dramatic
content of this,

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.570
and how do you divide the labor

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:23.990
of the storytelling
with your [inaudible]?

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.970
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank:
That's a very good question.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.180
So it's different for every
composer [inaudible] team

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.900
and it holds true not
just for operas

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.560
but anytime you have a new text.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.530
So Nilo's contributing some
of my text for the requiem

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.910 position:56%
that I mentioned, but not all of it.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.170
I love Britain, so for
that particular piece,

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.680
I'm modeling of the war requiem

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.040
where he has Owen Phillips plus
traditional liturgical text.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.970
Owen Phillips being a
contemporary poet commenting

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.790
on World War I, I believe
it is, yeah.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.220
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
[inaudible] That's right.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.520
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Lena Frank:
Yeah, sorry, that's right.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.140
Thank you, thank you.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.390
So I'm doing something
similar with the requiem,

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:03.150
and Nilo was okay with that.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.260
Sometimes writers want to do all
the words, so then you honor that.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.490
So that's another level of their
ownership of the storytelling.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.280
If you have a good relationship,
I can go to Nilo and say, well,

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.780
you know what, I would really love
some sort of text that allows me

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.820
to do something very
musical and nerdy,

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.130
something a writer wants
to do with a choir.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.950
I want to do something
where I peel away one voice,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.250
I replace it with the clarinet,

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.710
and I'm left with just
the highest soprano

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.380
that drops down to [inaudible].

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.830
I said, so what could
that be, so, okay, well,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.870
that will be when the spirits are
becoming the villagers, you know,

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:40.720
and Frida passes the note
to Diego who feels her pain.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.480
So then I'm part of it, but
I understand where, you know,

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.720
the landscape that he painted.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.140
Other times, he's been
very generous.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.910
He says, Gabby, what do you think?

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.940
Would she be angry here?

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.450
What is your reaction?

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.130
Would she, you know, be submissive?

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:02.230
Or I'm thinking about
making Catrina even sharper,

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.070
and so then I get to participate.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:07.450
So we began to work out the
first act in such a way.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.680
And we actually had a
residency at a small school

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.190
in Southern California,
Whittier College.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.940
And they just paid for us to come
there to work with their students

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.540
and speak in some classes.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.150
And we had two weeks which we did
nothing but breathe and sleep.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:25.330
I have a wonderful video of the
two of us talking, on my iPhone.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:29.620
And Nilo's on my floor in my
little kitchenette in my room,

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.440
and he has down glasses
and he turned upside

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.740
down water glasses,
just normal glasses.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.210
He put a napkin on each one,
and those were the villagers

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.220
with the white outfits,
the campesinos.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.550
And [inaudible] nothing
to side with the spirits,

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.660
because you can see
right through them.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.050 position:56%
And an upside down teacup was Diego.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:55.610
And then for Frida, he had a
little soy sauce bottle [inaudible]

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:59.920
with the red hat and is curvy,
like this, and that was Frida.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.360
And we were talking through
the characters, you know,

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.770
and he was moving them
around and brainstorming.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.760
Then he went away and
he came back and came

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.410
up with something marvelous.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.970
So I'm in there but it's
Nilo, Nilo's genius.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.710
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh,
maybe just one more

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.110
and then we have to let them go.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.220
&gt;&gt; The question is
for Mr. Christophers.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.430
Knowing that you are a
specialist in many, many things,

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.440
but baroque music, early
music, [inaudible].

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.910
I cannot find the right question.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:39.460
I'm very interested in the music
from Latino American composers

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.260
like [inaudible], even
the first composer

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:48.920
who composed the first opera
in America, [inaudible].

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.450
Have you been interested in
that repertory, first of all,

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.960
that's my first question.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.810
And the second one, do you think --

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.140
I'm a conductor also and a choral
conductor, orchestra conductor.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.030
Do you think the performance
should focus

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.190
on the repertory of our country?

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:17.150
For instance, [inaudible] recorded
an amazing amount of Spanish music.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:22.910
And [inaudible] focus on
Handel, those composers,

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.350
and we should focus
on our repertoire.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.650
&gt;&gt; Harry Christophers:
Because you're close to it.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.290
I think that's -- I mean, I
hear folks obviously a lot

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.620
on the English Renaissance
because we have access

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.400
to all those part books
and everything.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.320
But I did years ago, actually I did
a discourse of music by Padilla,

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.830
who was early Spanish
went to Mexico.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.970
But I also remember some years
ago, during a tour of Brazil,

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:52.260
of basically first-generation
Brazilian composers [inaudible].

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.960
This was a requiem, which
was amazing, actually.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.860
It was a little bit
poor man's Mozart,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.210
but actually it was
still worthy of doing.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.570
But actually having since doing,
and this was about 15 years ago,

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.940
I did that, but since then,
there's been so much more research.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:15.390
And actually I've been approached
by somebody in Brazil to look

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.240
at some what looks
really good music.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.540
So I'd love to.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.950
But, you know, the thing is,
there's so much music about

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:28.190
and we forget how much music is in
the libraries of Southern America.

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:32.140
The stacks there just waiting
to be researched and looked at.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.970
And above all, the problem so
often with it is that a lot

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.330
of people start doing research
where the auditions are bad

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.260
and you have to sort of go back.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.130
I remember years ago, in Portugal,

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:45.900
the wonderful [inaudible]
foundation.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.560 position:56%
They used to produce these fantastic
volumes of Portuguese music

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.670
by [inaudible] all sorts of people.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.300
And I performed a lot of
it, but we actually have

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.310
to have it all re-edited.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.780
The volumes looked beautiful,
but there were so many errors,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.180
the pictures were wrong, etcetera.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.540
And now, I was over in Portugal
recently, and I go back and said,

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.750
we're now getting all these
wonderful old additions

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.870
by people coming but we've got
no money to publish them now.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.960
So I've watched it
all the way around.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:21.120 position:56%
But yes. But I think since you're on
the spot, you know, you were here,

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.280
you know, to get research and
get an identity, is fantastic.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.530
So yeah, let's hear
it on CD as well.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Thank
you for your question.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.740
Thank you so much, Harry
Christophers, Gabriela Lena Frank.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.190
We're looking forward
to the premier.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.360
[ Applause ]

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.010
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
