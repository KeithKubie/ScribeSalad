00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I know this is a general question. Your pseudonym is Mujeok Pink (which literally translates into Invincible Pink) 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Any particular reason or background to adopt your pseudonym? 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I didn't plan to use a pseudonym, although it is a quite common practice in the field 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I thought Mujeok Pink will give an easy hint to guess which generation I am from 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This was a nickname for my blog and I was 7th grade when I first started it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Since I was a big fan of Power Ranger and the Flash, I initiated my nickname with Mujeok (invincible)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Usually it is followed by a color and girls typically go for either yellow or pink

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But pink was my to-go color and that is how it ended up with Mujeok Pink

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When we were young, we all used to think we are at the center of the world. Like I used to think I need to protect this world and those foolish people

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I named my blog as Secret Haven and have been writing with pseudonym Mujeok Pink

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It is only that I never knew I would continue to write until the age of 30. It is shameful

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Although my real name is Jimin Byun, but I have lived and being introduced as Mujeok Pink

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Not a while ago, I visited the National History Compilation Committee

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You see..my hair is bleached now, but it was pink when I made a visit

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We are talking about the audience consisting of historians dedicated to study Korean history over several decades and I introduced myself as Hello, my name is Mujeok Pink.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Please be cautious to come up with your ID

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Mujeok Pink is my identity but I am satisfied with where I am now

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You currently publish several series of fun and unique webtoons. Could you briefly introduce your works?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes. I publish three series of webtoons at the moment. Two episodes per week

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
All of them happened to be historic webtoons. Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk (True Stories of the Joseon Dynasty) is available at Naver

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Basically I transform historical events in Joseon in messenger format

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
For example, the king would send messenger gifts to the prime minister not to step down

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The World History Talk is a spin-off series and is available at Wisdom House. They publish lots of educational books

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It is themed on world history in a messenger format where Napoleon and Cleopatra are in the same group chat

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Qin Shi Huang would bury someone and take proof shoot

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The last one is The Three Kingdom, which is also developed in a messenger format

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I update 6 episodes per week. Put it in this way. You are submitting six final papers every week. I am happy thou

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:21.000
As your subscriber, I am glad you said you are happy. I wonder how you manage your time

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
First of all, I need time to do my time management, but I don't. So it is either I work or not 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
In these days, it is more like I work and more works are lining up as if someone is waiting to knock on my door 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So I work every day. I work, eat and sleep. My schedule was not this tight when I used to post one webtoon series

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I was able to take at least one day off and I would hang out, read or watch movies

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:08.000
As I literally work seven days per week, I even started to lose the sense of weather transitions. The last movie I watched was The Avengers: Age of Ultron 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I was not sure if this is a lifestyle that a human being deserves, but you guys work at Google 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I am pretty sure you understand what I am talking about life without life in which you are imprisoned at the company. I think they use this term Crunch Mode at gaming companies

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I do not think I ever worked to the extent where I feel imprisoned. But we are always exposed to working environments regardless of time and location

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Oh you rephrased. Basically you are like a freelancer who does not commute, but you just have this

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I can sense a variety of contemporary components in your webtoons

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Although your themes are based on events occurred 300 ~ 500 years ago, I thought the way you illustrated was very modern

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Do you have any routine to keep your modern senses or any triggering event?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Well..yes. my webtoons are staged 300 ~ 500 years and actually 1800 years in case of The Three Kingdom

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I think they are customized towards modern readers to certain extent

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It may sound cynical, but I think the essence of human life remains the same. I also have that quote at my work place

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It is so true that I do not need to modify the essence

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Whether it is King Sejong, Cao Cao or Liu Bei, they are human being after all who share the same sense of emotion with us

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They feel various feelings, be jealous on same things, and share the same ambition trigger

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The way they confront conflicts is no different either

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.000
They reconcile, fight or do tricks to set them apart. I actually learned from the essence of their life

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I thought people lived several centuries ago were fundamentally different, but they are actually not. All I need to worry was how to put them together

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Then how to convince the readers? I just removed old languages

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I removed old languages and built wifi and cell phone in historical settings. I replaced historical words with emoji

00:08:42.000 --> 00:09:12.000
With this, my subscribers can sympathize first of all, and realized that human life is same after all, because we all tend to think that there might be something special about great men in history

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Earlier you asked how I do my research

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:42.000
My virtual readers..I will call them Netizen. They are very fast paced

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I just closed episode 350 for Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk and the tone has been changed just over 100 episodes. It just took one year

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Even cell phone models have been changed. In my first episode, the cell phone was small enough to reveal King Sejongs holding fingers

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Now that smartphones have become bigger, I only reveal his thumb. I need to purely observe changes in cell phone or display

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And language tone is the most important most of all

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I am 30 years old and I do not understand the language that 20 year old speaks. Sometime I do not even get what 25 year old speaks

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I have to keep utilize big data and do research. I was able to spot all of them at Monopoly online cafe

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I think I joined three cafe where young generation get together. I key in the word or phrase in those cafes to see whether they are still in use or not

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
If there is no record during the past two months, it means they are no longer in use

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Then my concern would be finding the new contemporary word that replaced

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I start to search for synonyms and there are lots of interesting words. I mainly use Youtube. Do you know Bapung and Ins?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:56.000
BAPUNG (meaning Wind Balloon) refers to slime that does not stick to hands. When slime is smashed on the desk, it creates bubble

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Whoever makes big bubble wins. I learned it from elementary school students

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:28.000
One day, youtubers were invited to an elementary student to talk about job exploration and I was about to brag about the new word BAPUNG that I learned and it was used as if it is a common word

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
INS refers to printed sticker. You hand over your favorite picture to a printing company to print them into sticker

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They will not care about copyright. Anyway I learn these new contemporary words

00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You might think I would scold people for not using proper language since I like history, but I actively learn new words than anyone because words carry soul

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Sometimes I am told that my language is childish. It is a complement

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I think it is a complement indeed. Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk is where I learn new slangs from

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Thank you

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Thanks for being a teacher to all of us

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We just talked about webtoon from its content perspective. What are your thoughts on webtoon as a platform that distribute digital contents?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It is an interesting area to discuss and I actually give lot of thoughts on it

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It has been a decade since I published my first webtoon

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What is the normal rank at a company with 10 years of experiences? Manager? Senior manager? 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Anyway, there are people working for you at that point. I thought that it is a time to be more responsible

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Previously, I didn't negotiate on fees and accepted whatever works that were requested

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Someone with the most experiences in my field advised me that I look like the most junior among the first generation of webtoonists based on my work behavior

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I am the first generation no matter what and have the responsibility to pave the way for the next generations

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Let me ask you this. If we say webtoon is a building, then Google is engaged in a real estate business in a virtual world. 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Actually not..it is a real world because you are paid

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Anyway you are in a real estate business. What is the biggest issue?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Who wants to give a great answer?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Current issue. You are a landlord. What are your thoughts? I will give out my answer based on how you word your answer

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Anyone from Youtube team?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You..who just had an eye contact with me. We talked earlier at pantry. Could you please share current issue of Google?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Current issue?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah. Something that wakes you up when you think about it

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:57.000
The increase of creators in Youtube translates into the increase in tenant in real estate analogy and I guess our concern is how to drive these creators to produce contents of great quality

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Tenants share the same concern. How to create better contents?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
There is only one solution MONEY. You need to make a living out of doing what you like

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
For example, I am a webtoonist and it is great if I make money out of drawing webtoons

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I can get a part time job and still make income, but that does not do any good to the ecosystem of my industry

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Even if I win a million dollar lottery, the same million dollar earned by drawing webtoon make positive impacts to the industry at a totally different level

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
In this perspective, full-time webtoonists should make living out of it and I guess that is my major concern

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Webtoonist might slightly deviates from Youtubers in this perspective

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Reputation used to bring bucks to both Webtoonists and Youtubers because each click brings extra cents

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
However in these days, reputation does not necessarily guarantee high income because the conversion rate to cash is lowered

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I have more than two million subscribers. It is a huge number. What is the population of Gwangju?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000
What about a district in Seoul? I am LG Twins fan and 45,000 people can fit into Jamsil Stadium

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Pretty much 50 stadiums subscribe my contents. But 2 million subscribers do not make me rich

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:01.000
There are probably only a handful of webtoonists who own house in Seoul. Contents that we create does not bear fruits

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What is that mean? It does not sustain. There are several reasons

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Illegal sharing is the primary reason, which is known to steal 80% of the profitability

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Although an illegal sharing platform called Bamtokki was recently suspended, but it did not help too much

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I ponder how to cope with where we are situated

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Contents that are viewed by multiple people implies that it is well made, which also translates into that the author delivers contemporary messages

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Nonetheless, they cannot make a living out of it. My mom has a cancer and I cannot afford to send her to hospital

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Do you realize that webtoonists cannot get married unless they have a major hit?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
If you are married, you have a series that went viral

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
If you have kids?? Then you made really big hits

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Let us say I have a husband・let me put that back because I will have to give birth then

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Let us say my family had a baby and there are choice you have to make along the way

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:21.000
You need pain killer, $100 or $500 nutritional supplements and even if I have 2 million subscribers, I still feel pressured to buy $500 supplements

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Why contents does not convert into cash? Why people no longer pay to view contents?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Why does our main source of income come from advertisement?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Advertisement profit is not primary source of income for us

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:49.000
It is merely based on the trust that someone will make purchases after being exposed to this small banner

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I dig into historical evidences up to 10,000 years ago to create my contents

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I only charge 10 cents per episode so it only cost 80 cents per month. I want to charge them more like up to 2 dollars

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Just give me 2 dollars..would you? If you do not have cash, you can pay with credit card

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I am confident that I can continue to do this work if every viewer pays two dollars per month

00:20:37.000 --> 00:21:00.000
At least I am in a much better position than other peers. I have fans, agency and manager YLAB who takes good care of me

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I can afford to consult with lawyers to file lawsuits

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:17.000
However, the majority of creator who practically blow breath to this industry, including both webtoon and youtube, are powerless and speechless

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:29.000
They sacrifice future, time, passion and health for what? I feel they are looking at the middle of darkness

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
We are not sustainable. What shall we do?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
There are lands that need to be explored, but explorers are starving to death

00:21:42.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I think this is a serious problem. I bet you clicked a video because the title sounded sensational, but it ended up wasting your time to watch it

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Guess what? This will continue as long as compensation issue remains unsolved. People work what they are paid for

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:38.000
You always seem to be bright and vibrant, but I am seeing the other side of you tonight as you shared serious thoughts and reflections on webtoon industry

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Speaking of work, I am an employee at Google and I raise the same question to every guest speaker at Talks at Google

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Have you ever imagined that someday your job can possibly be replaced by AI? If you agree, which form do you think it will take place?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
I thought that simple and repetitive parts of my work could be replaced

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000
For example, re-organizing historical events for easy understanding, whether in forms of messenger or social media, is one

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:39.000
It is simply cleaning historical data and organize them into given formats

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Of course, AI has better searching skills and I thought that AI could replace me as long as it is tuned to contemporary words with historical backgrounds

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I played a game recently..actually Google made it

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
I drew picture of the words that AI suggested and it guess what it is

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:18.000
For example, I draw TV and if AI made correct guess, I win. It was quite interesting indeed

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I thought AI would learn from human, but it turns out that I was learning the ecosystem of AI

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
It felt strange because I drew TV and it obviously looked like TV, but AI was telling me it is a box

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Then I realized that AI only recognized outlines

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Then I started to think from AI perspective to which extent I should simplify my drawing so that AI will recognize what I meant

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
To describe my works in beverages, it is like adding espresso shots in green tea

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It is grotesque. Who would ever thought that, but people do

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Whether that was a mistake or not, people think in opposite ways

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
That is type of the works that I do. Narrating Joseon history in form of a social messenger

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:43.000
and I also created a textbook of virtual reality as a senior project when I was in college

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I combine two extremes or something that are not cohesive in any aspect at all. But AI is smart, productive and intelligent.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I think AI will be a good assistant to my projects because I do not think it will make any mistake

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I mean..AI beat Lee Sedol (A legendary go player). AI will be fine for next 5 years at least

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I am still concerned regardless how quickly AI develops because as I said earlier, it does not make money

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:44.000
AI functions based on repetitive learning. But the trends change from time to time. It used to be martial arts, followed by sexual and gangsters

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Once the area of learning is narrowed down, AI can only concentrate on certain things and dig into them

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I hear d AI also writes good novel these days

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Both our work scope and preference will continue to narrow down, giving AI more limited areas of concentration, then AI will easily catch up

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:37.000
AI already better paint than I do. AI should pay tax. I never imagine AI would beat Lee Sedol at this stage

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I thought the event will take place when I am around 70 years old

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
However the reality is AI already won Lee Sedol, does coloring, write novels and songs and who know what will happen a year later?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Whether it is GiGa Genie or Google Assistant, I want to have them to change channel

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Building a bright future with AI sounds pleasant. How do you imagine yourself after one or 10 years?

00:29:30,000 --&gt; 00:27:28,000
I will be drawing webtoons probably. I do not have personal memory since 2016, which means this will continue until 2019

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I will be drawing. I hope I will survive

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Yes. I wish to keep subscribe your webtoons

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Please make sure to buy me virtual coins

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Now I will toss it to the audience for Q&amp;A session. Please raise your hand if you would like to ask anything to her

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Please feel free to ask personal questions such as what game do you play? Oh I play Candy Crush by the way

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Hi I am an engineer at Google

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You shared challenges in webtoon industry and, as a matter of fact, software industry went through the same

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Copying software program became a normal practice and people were fooled for using software out of their pocket

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Anyway, I think there are ways to make improvements along the way

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:12.000
What kind of changes do you think it will make positive impacts in your industry?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000
The portal where I post World History Talk was established by a publishing company

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I was convinced when I heard of Wisdom House launched webtoon business because they have a long history of exchanging scripts with authors

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:59.000
In other words, we went through a dark age where authors were arrested due to censorship, and there were editor who visited imprisoned authors in person with snacks to check on their status

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:18.000
They show courtesy to the authors. So you know you are respected as you talk to them, even though they are rookie

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:31.000
They might experience trial and error in the beginning, but I was convinced that they will be directed towards the right path

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:40.000
As a matter of fact, authors are often offended because they are in close communication with the readers

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Wisdom House take actions to protect the authors or send presents during Korean Thanksgiving

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Most of all, they giveaway free books since they are publisher

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:11.000
They feed the authors both physically and intellectually and show respect to authors that they deserve

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
In return, I did my best on my end as well. I didn't feel like being a printer

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
I am explicitly promoting Justoon

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Please subscribe and also monitor them as well because I have witness many publishers that launched a new business with healthy motive, but soon became materialized

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:44.000
They forgot the core business value, which resulted in losing both trust and readers

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Webtoon market has a short history with 15 years. However, the rise and fall has been very dynamic and there a lot to learn from it

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:10.000
What I learned is to show professional respect to those I work with that they deserve

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:23.000
This is very fundamental thing to do, yet it is difficult to be consistent. I think even a word era is outdated given the pace of changes we face

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
A challenge is replaced by another and we will face new challenges overnight

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:37.000
New challenges come with new roles, however, what does not change tasks managed by human

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Human is the most important. I recall only three people in my industry who stick to that principle

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I have two questions. One is the web ecosystem

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:30.000
It seems that the industry keeps growing, although wealth distribution is another matter

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:46.000
There are new players in the market that plans and creates contents as a middle person like YLAB.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Could you please explain how you cooperate with YLAB?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Also, you seem to do research on tones and languages, but I find that tones from your characters differ from one another

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Especially Cao Cao and Yuan Shao from The Three Kingdom have unique tone. Do you have any research object for benchmark?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
It is an interesting question

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:46.000
My relationship with YLAB? I am good with them

00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Our relationship is combination of fandom, loyalty, family and they also help me with money and legal issues

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:18.000
When I say something and it is contractual issue, they would review even though it is against their profit

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:29.000
If copyright or malicious comment issues occur during the review, they would hire a lawyer for me

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Because you will see tons of weirdoes from historical webtoons. The genuine history maniacs would be on my side, but those who pretend to be offend me

00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:04.000
In addition, there are authors at YLAB and they are my colleague, subscriber, and fan and working with them definitely synergize

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:35.000
It is a desirable business model, but investors will get involved to expand their business later on. I hope they move towards a right direction

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Moving on to the next question, I think tone represents your identity

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
You will notice that people use different tone at group chats

00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Elders tend to finish the sentence with multiple dots and shorten their sentence as if they can never write more than three lines and etc

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I did not pay much attention to it in the beginning, but it turns out that their life is immersed into their tones

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Non-verbal expression is critical as well and each one has its model, including a number of King from Joseon and characters from The Three Kingdom

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:55.000
In The Three Kingdom, Yuan Shao is full of non-verbal expressions. He does not initiate any conversation

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Most of people believe that the Three Kingdom is represented by Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and the Son family, but I would say 70% of the story deals with different characters

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Yuan Shao is from a noble family and he does not initiate conversation

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
If he has to, he would only start a chat with Cao Cao by just calling his name

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:07.000
In reality, people with high profile would call my name first and remain silent until I answer back

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000
They will call my name multiple time until I finally answer back

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:24.000
For example, if my script needs to be edited, editors usually just ask me to do so

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
However, high rank officers first summon me before digging into main agenda

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Yuan Shao would always call Cao Cao name first before initiating the main conversation

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Aman is Cao Cao nick name and he would call Aman repeatedly until he answers

00:41:37.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Cao Cao spent the most of his early years with loyalty. He killed those violated the boundary of law, and did not commit habitual killing

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:13.000
He got sick of the law system at his time and sought for power

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
He was very busy as to lose his humanity, which is immersed in the way he communicate

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Cao Cao does not go more than a sentence when he talks to his family and complete his sentence with noun followed by period

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:42.000
My friends studying law are obsessed with putting period to finish sentences

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Last question?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I will take two more. The one in red and blue

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:30.000
You mentioned that you upload six episodes per week for three series

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:40.000
You are so busy that you cannot even really remember the last movie you watched. You are committed to you works without personal life

00:43:40.000 --> 00:44:00.000
How long does it take for you to draw one episode and which aspect of your work is the most time consuming? Do you have assistants? If so, what is their role?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000
The majority of my time goes to The Three Kingdoms Talk

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I usually spend five days on it and split the other two days on The World History and Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:31.000
I am pretty used to Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk at this stage and it does not take more than a day

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I have more know-hows to come up with new episode themes. For example, what is the day today by the way?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Battle of Myeongnyang took place today. Today is Oct 28th right?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
25th

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Look at me..For example, I used to have the dates of historical events on my cell phone calendar, including the birthday of kings of Joseon, anniversary or the date of death and etc

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk is updated on every Wednesday and Sunday so it is easier for me choose theme and put them into day-based frame

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Also, I have been doing a special episode on Hangul Day for five consecutive years along with Korean New Year and Thanksgiving Day to talk about Korean traditional rites

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I also try to address social issues at the time of writing such as college tuition and housing prices etc., which apparently had to be dealt with centuries ago

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:50.000
For example, public officers in Joseon had to let go 90% of their salary for housing to work in Seoul

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I do not much struggle to come up with new episode ideas for Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Once I know what to write about, then rest of the process does not take that long

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:12.000
The Three Kingdom Talk takes much longer because it is not easy for me to decide which scenes that the subscribers are interested to read

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
The Three Kingdom is very interesting by itself

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:30.000
The real historical events took place almost 2,000 years ago then the story was novelized nearly 600 years ago and it has been passed down since then

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
However, The Three Kingdom seem to be very old-fashioned at its first glance as if only those in 50s would read

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:59.000
So I think of ways to make it more accessible to young readers who can sympathize

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:09.000
I changed Chinese ranks into terms that Koreans are more familiar with

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:21.000
For 1 on 1 battle, I replaced it with screen capture or youtube format

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:31.000
For the scene where you make order to the adviser, I used the setting where the adviser is invited to a group chat to receive the order

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000
This is my first level of transformation

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
The second level of transformation is change in emphasis

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:53.000
To sympathize with the new generation, it should no longer be Liu Fei and Cao Cao that we all know

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Martial arts was the key to success 20 years ago. Million copies were guaranteed

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:28.000
However, the same paradigm will not sustain a month in these days because our generation grew up watching the monitor

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
They do not get used to wide screen or even detailed pictures

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
As the key viewing channel is shifting from PC to mobile, authors started to spend less time in drawing cuts because even well-made pictures are distorted to certain extent in mobile format

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
People no longer reads so the length of lines shortened

00:48:49.000 --> 00:49:04.000
The Three Kingdom is a soap opera with scale so my main struggle was changing the point of view to the first person perspective

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:30.000
For example, the webtoon begins with Liu Fei who is 23 year-old employed where he ask google whether 23 year-old jobless living in mom's house should kill himself or not

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Cao Cao who was a public officer would say something like this damn country should fail as an attempt to change the world

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Or I turned Yuan Shao who likes getting attention into a social media celebrity

00:49:49.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Describing their desire and ambition in 21st century language is challenging because I do not meet many people to have desires

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:24.000
I just want to sleep. This is my concern. I know I am committed to my work, but I feel isolated from the society

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I wonder whether my work brings value. Does 24 hour that I spend help hungry kids in Kenya?

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I feel this disparity when I travel

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:47.000
I think building a house for Habitat brings much more value than drawing webtoons, but I have not traveled in recent 5 years

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Being honest with my desire is good..not forgetting that I am a human being

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Then I think I will be able to find various themes. I have to be humane first to understand how others think

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
The one in blue

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Hi. I am an engineer at Google

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Your story was interesting and the way your put them together was fun as well

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:42.000
I thought you could give me advice. How can I become a fun story teller? 

00:51:42.000 --> 00:52:00.000
You also talked about AI. In AI era, you mentioned that people will seek entertainment over productivity. What categorize entertainment in AI era?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:12.000
I do not think fun stories are out of creativity. It comes from observation. It is a long process

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I have a good educational background just like everyone in this room

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:26.000
It means that you theoretically understand fun. In other words, you cannot do something that makes you look undermined

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:39.000
I made a big hit with Joseon Wangjo Sil Talk as a webtoonist. But I thought myself as a noble, studious and cynical person

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:49.000
I would pursue the truth to become light to this world and looked deep inside, thinking that I would every possible desire in me

00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I was seen as an author with many subscribers, but our interest is making money to be honest

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Money is good

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.000
There are things that I want to enjoy by paying money and that is good for me

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Maybe I like too much coins but anyways I want to make money and be successful

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
That is how I get paid for my salary・to protect the server

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:33.000
I need to observe others in more detail to be paid even more. Contemporary people are very unique

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Consumer, reader, Netizen are all same group of people, but the way they communicate is very unique

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You have to witness with your own eyes. There are several differences that I feel as an author

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:00.000
First, the way of thinking has been changed. They do not get metaphor anymore

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:12.000
In the past, people knew what it meant to be delightful with tears in their eye or being cold to someone when you actually love them inside

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:22.000
This does not work anymore. When someone is angry, they will only believe it when I emphasize that they are angry

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:32.000
They will have to accept it. People do not want me to use rhetoric for explanation

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:45.000
This is very interesting. But we are busy, especially inside of the building

00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:06.000
I am captivated inside of well decorated building for my word, but you need to use time to meet people for observation

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
At the same time meeting people is tiring

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:21.000
I get uncomfortable when I encounter someone having different thoughts, especially when they are younger

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I have that resistance in me. Maybe it is because I am stubborn or level of my education

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:42.000
However, I have to invest my time and be patient with them and observe until I understand

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
When I do not understand their pattern, I need to memorize them at least. This is painful

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:59.000
I used to enjoy using elegant words, but my subscribers are 4th graders

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I have to put everything in the view of 4th graders. I actually learned this from one producer

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:23.000
One day, I talked to a producer with milestone programs. Their world is very intense and competitive. You never know when to get fired

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Then I asked him for know-how and he said that if you can make a program that 8th grader understands, then the rest of humanity would understand

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:41.000
That happened four years ago and that was very helpful advice. 

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:54.000
I only imagined subscribers ranging from 20 to 30 year old. I targeted 8th graders as my potential reader and he said that it has been pushed down to 4th grader. Humanity evolves

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:04.000
You should remember this 4th grader rule. This is not something to laugh about

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Everyone in this room should be 4th grader. Do you know how hard it is? Because it comes with a sense of shame

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Why did I go to college and paid tuition if I have to put myself into 4th grader's position?

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:34.000
My colleagues say that they wish they are 11th graders. Then they can write milestone episodes

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Does it answer your question?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:04.000
There is an impressive quote from your other interview. You said that you draw historical cartoons, but its essence is ordinary life and human story

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:15.000
I hope you would continue to keep this sharp sense of observation to provide us with great contents

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:30.000
I wish we could present a great gift to you, but only guest speakers at Talk at Google can have this doll
