00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.540
For a long time the measurement of a healthy
baby was having 10 fingers and 10 toes.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:13.389
Wait, why did nobody care about the eyes,
nose, mouth and ears?

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.550
Hey digitals, Lissette here for Dnews.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.460
I am the proud owner of 10 fingers and 10
toes, i can prove half of this right now.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.949
You’ll have to trust me on the 10 toes thing.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.769
But, have you ever wondered why that is?

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.289
Why don’t we have 12 fingers and 14 toes?

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.890
Or 6 fingers and 1 toe?

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.520
Well, this may not come as a shocker to you
DNews fans out there, but no one really knows.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.250
It might all come down to math.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.340
Mark Changizi, a theoretical neurobiologist,
developed a hypothesis called the Limb Law,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.220
first published in the Journal of Theoretical
Biology in 2001.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.370
It’s a mathematical equation that tries
to figure out the correct number of limbs

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.420
an animal needs in order to connect to the
world around it based on the length of its

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.380
limbs relative to it’s body size.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.380
WHEW.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.390
The equation looks like this.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.720
Confusing, I know.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.579
But he used this equation with 190 different
animal species from seven different animal

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.339
Phyla, and the math seems to check out.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.630
Mark thinks this same equation could be used
to figure out why humans have five fingers

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.630
on each hand.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.490
The calculation treats our palms as the animal
and our fingers as limbs.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.880
Also it takes into account that the whole
reason behind having fingers is that they’re

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.759
able to fold over our entire palm, in order
to grasp things.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.130
So, first, fingers have to be at least as
long as our palms, aka length need to connect

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.659
to the outside world.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.180
When you crunch the numbers, you'll get 9.42
digits per hand.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.069
But, he argues, since our hand is not a free
roaming creature, but is attached to our arm,

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.340
it doesn't need limbs protruding from all
sides.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.299
Hands only need half the total number of limbs.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.590
That gets us to 4.71 fingers per hand.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.740
Just based on math.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.780
Pretty amazing.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.570
But other explanations are simpler than that.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.430
Evolutionary biologists say that we have 10
fingers and 10 toes because that’s the best

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.820
combination for us.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.429
If 8 fingers and 8 toes would have given us
an evolutionary advantage, humans would have

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.759
4 fingers on each hand.

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.619
Cliff Tabin, a Harvard Medical school geneticist
focusing on limb development in vertebrates,

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.460
pointed out that our motor skills come down
to our thumb and index finger, and that another

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.770
small, 6th finger wouldn’t really change
anything.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.020
And if we ever did grow a 6th finger, Tabin
argues, it would probably grow out of our

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.030
wrists, like panda’s have.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.050
It gives them extra support when gripping
bamboo, which gives THEM an evolutionarily

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.050
advantage.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.070
So, basically, we'd have six if people with
six fingers got an advantage.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.650
Then, there is this more complicated science
answer to why we have the number of digits

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.650
we have.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.620
James Sharpe from the Centre for Genomic Regulation
in Barcelona discovered it all comes down

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.900
to three molecules in our body.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.170
Bmp, Wnt and Sox9.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.750
They’re responsible for marking out in an
embryo where fingers will go and how far apart

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.780
they’ll grow.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.390
And for the most part it marks out space for
five fingers on each hand and five toes on

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.390
each foot.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.390
But of course sometimes things can go wrong,
resulting in the gaps between fingers being

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.320
bigger and only having room for four fingers.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980
Or, sometimes it screws up and you have room
for an extra finger.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.200
Oh and fun fact, the basis for this discovery
was a theory first proposed by Alan Turing

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.730
back in 1952 about how animals get spots and
stripes.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.730
Love you, Alan.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.030
So why 10 fingers and 10 toes?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.860
Again, we’re still not entirely sure.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.890
But it all seems to come down to because that’s
exactly the number of fingers and toes we

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.890
need.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.720
Sometimes it’s best to just trust evolution
and be thankful we don’t have hoofs.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
Amirite?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720
Sponsor?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
But you might have noticed, most of these
are about hands, because humans are footist!

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.200
Seriously though, feet are super cool, but
when did they evolve and why do they look

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.360
different than hands?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:52.910
Julia walked a mile in those shoes, here.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.090
Why do you think we have 10 fingers and toes?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.080
Would you rather have more or less?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.760
Let me know.
