00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough, now of course if instead of reels,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.880
we had complex result, okay, then we wouldn't have the same precondition, but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.960
deciding what the form of the. Output is whether it's real or

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.250
complex is an important part of the specification process. For

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.670
this particular exercise, we're going to go with, go with the real numbers and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.010
the precondition says that X which is our input argument is greater than or

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.220
equal to zero. Notice that were not saying what happens if.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.710
X is less than zero. We're specifying the behavior of the function

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.530
in terms of what does this function mean when it gets expected arguments? Now,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.050
if you wanted to have a variant. Which worked on any argument.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.130
But race and exception or produced a return code if x was less than 0.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.980
We could specify that as well. But we're going to keep it simple for

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.810
now and really say we're defining square root over the non-negative reels.
