00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.859
So graphene is a kind of graphite? How, what's the... graphite, graphite looks like that

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.749
That's a big slab of graphite. I can by using the scotch tape method peel pieces off

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.980
The way I think of it

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289
Is that a single atomic layer of graphite is graphene. I knocked it around a bit this be?

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.379
Single molar mono layer by layer graphene where you've got two layers held together by these Van der Waals forces

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.969
That's got slightly different electrical properties and then you've got tri layer and when you get up to 50 layers the graphene starts looking black

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.110
It's you seem to note that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030
one model layer of graphene over a wide part of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.880
Absorbs about 2% of the light intensity

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.200
incident on it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.689
So it's very transparent and that makes it an interesting material as well because you got a transparent conductor

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.859
Amazingly the absorbance of graphene is given by the fine-structure constant

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.669
Times pi. Now, if any of you up to sixty symbols, you know, I'm fascinated with the fine-structure constant

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.369
You could see a sixty symbols video on that Andrei Guymon costume Novoselov isolated

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.459
graphene from a lump of graphite and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.970
For some electrical contacts on and so that had some very interesting

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.329
Electrical properties they made a little transistor out of it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.669
What we're waiting for now is to make lots of transistors

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.290
Out to reverse a much more difficult job that it's very difficult to switch off the channel

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.199
because of a bit of quantum mechanics that the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.789
Electrons in graphene of this curious band structure graphene does not have a bandgap

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.539
like silicon or germanium or gallium

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.929
Arsenide a band gap is a gap in energy

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.240
If you want to get the electrons flowing, you've got to put the Fermi energy which tells you the energy of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.029
the energy of the highest energy electron

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.369
you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.269
Don't want that in in the middle of in the middle of the gap because then you don't get any free electrons or free holes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.880
So you guys are gonna push the chemical potential down into the valence band or up into the conduction band

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.409
they stand bandgap is crucial for being able to turn off your silicon or gallium arsenide field effect transistor because in the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.529
band gap between the conduction band and the valence band

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.829
Any electronic state so you could get in there and you can't put them in there by putting in some impurities. Those states are

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.189
Evanescent they decay very rapidly in space. So the electrons can't propagate through it when you're in the conduction band

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.750
About above the bandgap of the valence band below the bandgap the electrons or the missing electrons call the hole called the holes

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.160
Can move very very freely and had pretty good velocities, especially in something like indium phosphide or gallium arsenite that's faster than silicon

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.259
But silica has got this fantastic property

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.760
You can oxidize its surface and make silicon oxide now in addition to that, of course in the latest bunch of transits

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
He's not using silicon oxide

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.159
As the barrier you want a higher dielectric material

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:53.119
So you got like a hafnium salts and oxides that can that can push up that and you get more more electrons in your channel

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.949
For a given gate voltage. What's so exciting about graphene from my kind of looking forwards point of view. Well whereas silicon

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.790
or germanium

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.590
Or indium phosphide or gallium arsenide has a structure like this

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.190
It's a very rigid structure

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.949
Basically, the diamond structure for silicon silicon is just like diamond except the silica is replacing the carbon atoms. It's a very rigid structure

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.199
And the electrons can move freely in all three direct dimensions

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.000
The surface for MOSFETs the interface between the silicon and the oxide or the hafnium oxide

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.700
At that surface

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.869
you've got to be very careful because once you break these bonds and you're changing the chemistry at the atomic level and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.289
You can have charge on those on those surface States that charge can be very adverse in principle. You can scatter electrons

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.440
scattering electrons randomize your momentum

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.269
so if you're trying to get them to move down a channel with a high current as quickly as possible to make if you wanna

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.219
switch a device class off if they zigzagging and knocking off impurities and so on till

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.359
They take longer to go down the device their mobility as it says is reduced

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.739
So you want it's nice to have a clean surface now the point about graphene. Is that graphene?

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.108
This is a lump of graphite

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.690
It looks very black. Of course

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.109
But you could take graphite and thin it down by exfoliation

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.929
Using the scotch tape method and I I just did exfoliate a little bit of graphene

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.410
Earlier this surface underneath the sellotape. It's not beginning to look a bit dirty. And those are layers of

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.889
Multi-layer graphite it's not necessarily single layer graphite. They may be five six ten 20 layers, but amongst all that

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.889
There will be a single model layer of

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.229
Graphene, so having it thin that's really important

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.598
Well having it thin is is interesting from a physical point of view because now we've got the electrons moving in

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.259
a single mono layer and they move

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.970
first of all at a very high speed

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.679
About five times faster than they would in gallium arsenide or indium

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.720
Phosphide three of three to five times faster anyway at a 10 to the 6 meters per second

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.179
Which is actually one 300 through the speed of light curiously enough, which is pretty fast. The problem is

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.649
That things like silicon germanium gallium arsenide and so on

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.489
These have a energy gap between the conduction band and the valence band

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.269
Any electron in that gap which are many because there not many states in the gap those electrons tell you get stuck now with graphene

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.750
There's no energy gap. It's a problem for switching off a transistor. You can't you can't switch it off with a conventional potential so

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.649
What the Manchester group decided to do?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.339
They decided to go vertical so by combining what you need to do is two switches current off

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.149
so this you make a vertical tunnel transistor and a key element of the vertical tunnel transistor is

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.098
By getting a sister material to graphi and colleagues agonal boron nitride

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.438
It's got exactly the same crystal structure as graphene except that alternate atoms

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.409
if all of these are carbon atoms in Boran light or this one it would be

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.468
Boron, this will be nitrogen. This will be boron

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:10.979
this will be the nitrogen and so on going around here and that creates a very very strong barrier very effective and

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.549
powerful barrier a barrier in fact at six electoral votes

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.479
so six times the value of the electron gap in the energy gap in in gallium arsenide and so

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.180
in this device the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.620
Graphene layer has put on top of it boron nitride and then on top of that we have another

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:36.719
graphene layer and we mount that on silicon silicon oxide and use the silicon as a gate electrode and you use that to

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.259
Control the tunnel current through the layer and using that device we were able to make a transistor in which you could switch off

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:44.940
So we were very excited about that

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.279
That work was published in in science and we were even more surprised and pleased that six weeks off

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.659
I think six weeks after our paper came out the Samsung group came up with a very similar concept

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.109
And they managed to put about a hundred of these transistors on a chip

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.229
so I think at that point everybody thought wow, these vertical devices are gonna take off but

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:11.039
Things do seem to have that doesn't seem to have happened. I think the technology is very

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.889
Difficult we to remember that it took

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.190
You know many beers decades for silicon to go from just an interesting lab based material

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.239
Into a field effect transistor and then into these incredible integrated circuits with all these transistors on a single chip

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.160
It takes a lot of time and it takes understanding the physics and understanding the material science

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.579
but in parallel with with all this work on graphene, I want to emphasize the graphene is one of a large family of

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.870
similar

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.980
two-dimensional materials in which you clinics which can be

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.399
Exfoliated and there are about I believe it around the thousand of these

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:55.540
Materials and one material that we are working on here in Nottingham and Manchester interesting as well is indium selenide

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.839
Molybdenum disulphide is none materials

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.419
Remember your Mali slip used to probably put on the gears of your bicycle on the gear wheels

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:11.049
That's a similar material because the molybdenum disulphide sheets can slide over each other with almost no friction

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.929
So this isn't that very hot material as well

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.400
Now those materials have got an energy gap and an energy gap that depends on

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.390
the number of atoms you make the crystal out of the great thing about

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.919
These layered compounds. Is that when you break them apart you

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.770
Break the band of ours bonds

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.410
these these bonds

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.760
don't get charged don't trap and don't become defects it looks as if

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.020
You know

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:44.469
the electron just doesn't get scattered off that so that's that's an interesting aspect of these devices that people are playing around with and

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.890
indium selenide

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:50.180
This is again a

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.820
Manchester knot in collaboration

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.939
we produced a feel effect transistor that has some really very good very very nice properties and that

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:04.239
Was published a few years ago and people that that indium selenide 'sister coppers are making quite a big impact at the moment

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.990
people are working away on it because it's like gap semiconductor and

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:16.390
you can combine it you can switch it off with using a field effect and you can also put make or a nitride barriers and

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.659
Not only that but then take one band of ours crystal

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:27.099
And then it take another exfoliation one on top of it and make a multiple sandwich structure with lots of layers and bread and butter

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.940
and so on and

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.349
They're all sleeping between properties that these materials could have good ab, so could be the EM facility, but not no no, no

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.570
No silicon has got years to go heist

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:43.510
I quite like when I my PhD I was spent ages trying to put good electrical contacts on silicon

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:51.549
And eventually the French colleague put very good contacts on and we were a very nice paper on the electronic properties in bulk silicon

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.960
But that's forgotten in the history of silicon, but back in

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.740
1971-72

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:04.900
We looked at bonito photon resonance. Oh, I love silicon. I've got very got me interested in the field really and and curiously enough

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.709
I yes. I've almost forgotten this GC and Plessy were making very primitive

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:16.720
Feel effect transistors they were blimburn and reliable and we got our hands on some of these and we did some quite interesting

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.530
quantum experiments on the very first UK feel about transistors we couldn't get them from Germany or America, but

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:31.420
DC and Plessy were making material that materials. So no silicon is a great material. I'm not going to do it done

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.820
now I've got the token so I can lay the value in add the bay leaf emerged or into it and

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.550
Store it back and hand the target and now I've got the token again

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:45.760
I can load something into it into my register add something onto it back and pass the token on and I've got it

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.669
So I can load the value in add the value from a register story back
