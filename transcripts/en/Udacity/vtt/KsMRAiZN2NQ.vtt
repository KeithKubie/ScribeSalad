00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.230
The third kind of UML relationship that we have to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.330
deal with during design is how are you going to implement dependencies.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.940
Dependencies are at once both the most common and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.050
the most varied kind of relationship.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.180
Having a dependency between two classes merely means that

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.450
one class somehow uses the other.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.680
This relationship can be implemented in a variety of ways.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.720
Most simply you can have an attribute or

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.900
a global object having the type of the target class.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.300
You could receive arguments of the target class in one of your methods.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.100
You could make a method or construct your call to the target.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.370
Or you could import the target as either directly or

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.720
as part of a, a, a package into your class.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.580
All of those are examples of how you're using the target in your

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.780
particular implementation.
