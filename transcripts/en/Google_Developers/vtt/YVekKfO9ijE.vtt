DON DODGE: Hello everyone.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.110
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.410
Today my guest is Jason
Calacanis, my longtime friend,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.520
and it's a bit of a change for
Jason because normally he's in

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.590
this chair, so I've turned
the tables on him today.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.160
Welcome Jason.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.060
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, now
the interviewer is the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.700
interviewee.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.240
DON DODGE: That's right.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.560
JASON CALACANIS: It's
actually quite nice.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.060
I don't have the pressure of
having to come up with great

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.840
questions, you do.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.360
DON DODGE: Well, yeah.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.140
The pressure's on me today.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.970
All right.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.060
You've done a lot of things
in your life.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.390
You've been an entrepreneur,
you're an angel investor,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.860
you're a conference promoter,
you do it all.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.180
So let me start with
a simple question.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.040
Are entrepreneurs
born or made?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.760
JASON CALACANIS: That is a
question for the ages.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.300
I ask that question a lot when
I'm on my show and I get a

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.900
divergent set of responses.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.670
In the response of they're made,
you can find life events

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.480
that seem to make people
entrepreneurial, like having a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.270
parent who's an entrepreneur
is a pretty good indicator

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.950
that the person could become
entrepreneurial.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.640
Actually, I find a lot of
times a dysfunctional

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.500
relationship with one of the
parents in a lot of the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.680
entrepreneurs, like they had a
dad who was particularly hard

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.890
on them, or a mom who was
particularly hard on them and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.130
they had something to prove.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.220
I don't think that
they're born.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.630
I think they get made by their
childhoods in a large way, and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530
then sometimes when they get out
into the real world, just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.560
something happens in their
business career where they

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.080
experience some massive
frustration and they think,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.310
the world should be better than
this, or I'm being held

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.590
back, some critical moment.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.100
I had a father who was
entrepreneurial, and he was

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.820
very hard on me and very hard on
himself, just in running a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.120
restaurant and a bar
in Brooklyn.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.820
And that really set me up for an
incredibly hard work ethic

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.130
and to be very resilient and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.020
dedicated to building companies.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.240
But then also when I went into
the workforce, I just saw

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.160
people and I saw companies
that I worked at being

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.120
inefficient, and I always
reflected on the efficiency

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.479
and the diligence my dad put
into his businesses, the way

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.390
he cared, into what I
did as an employee.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.230
And when you go to sometimes
work at a big company--

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.780
I mean, we don't see this in the
tech industry as much, but

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.290
in the rest of the world,
efficient people who really

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.170
want to change the world are not
appreciated in a big media

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.380
company, or a big consumer
goods company, or a Wall

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.300
Street firm, or a bank,
or a law firm.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.150
In the technology industry,
we celebrate those people.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.270
We want to get those rabble
rousers into the companies,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.890
the people who are pushing
the envelope.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.560
In fact, people look for
that in employees.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.300
But in the rest of the world,
they're not appreciated.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.730
And so I think a lot of the
entrepreneurs I meet are

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.570
functionally unemployable.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.250
They basically run into bosses
and they say things to them

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.850
like, you need to learn how to
work within the system, you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.860
need to wait in line, you
need to respect the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.200
hierarchy above you.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.720
When you start hearing things
like that in your career, it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.250
means that you should probably
be an entrepreneur.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.490
It means that you're probably
not really a great employee,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.880
you're a great leader.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.100
DON DODGE: So do you think
there's a difference between a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.825
businessman and an
entrepreneur?

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:09.340
A businessman makes money, an

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.600
entrepreneur changes the world?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.180
Is there something like that?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.580
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.100
I mean, some people go to work
every day to put a roof over

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.610
their family's head and to put
food on the table, and there

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.290
is an honor and a respect
I have for

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.960
those people, obviously.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.683
There's nothing more noble than
being able to take care

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:30.230
of and provide for
your family.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.490
But you can even do that with
an entrepreneurial spirit.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.560
And so Mark Pincus from Zynga
talks about everybody being

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.180
the CEO of something
in his company.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.810
You could be in a big company
and still have that

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.860
entrepreneurial spirit where
you're thinking about how to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.560
innovate, and how to change the
world, and put a dent in

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.090
it, and try to move the
human race forward.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.830
And I think that's really what
entrepreneurship is is that

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.600
you're relentless in your
pursuit of making something

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.290
that didn't exist before, trying
to make the world a

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.570
little better, trying to make
the experience a little

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.310
better, looking at things and
saying, if that was 10% better

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.420
or 20% better or 200% better,
what would it look like?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.920
And then trying to take that
vision and make it reality.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.300
And the time between when you
see something visionary like

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.751
that and it becomes de rigueur
and people just look at it and

00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:24.340
go, well, of course you can
check into any location and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.990
have all your friends know where
you are, and you know

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.670
where all your friends are--

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.360
that took Foursquare a good
decade to figure out, and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.580
those kind of solutions, it's a
lot of hard work in between

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.150
doing that.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.280
And a lot of times people look
at that journey of, things

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.860
should be different this
way and I see the world

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.730
differently, I want things
to function the way

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.790
I think they should.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.040
It's so hard to make that
actually happen that most

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.790
people never do the first
step, which is trying.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.190
And that's 99% and 1%.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.230
Everybody knows that things
should be better, everybody's

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.280
got ideas of how to make
things better.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.590
Ideas are very easy, they're
a commodity.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.490
There's really not much
value in ideas.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.470
Really the person who says, I'm
going to take that idea

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.750
and really try to make it
actually manifest itself into

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.280
a product or service that people
can consume and engage

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.880
with and fall in love with,
that's entrepreneurship.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.530
That's the difference.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.770
DON DODGE: So what motivates
you as an entrepreneur?

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.360
JASON CALACANIS: That's
interesting.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.500
It's been different things at
different points in my life.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.530
I'm 41 now.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.600
And when I was 22 or 23,
I had a lot to prove.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.690
And I don't know exactly who I
was proving it to, in part

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.180
myself, in part my
dad, in part the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.410
people I grew up with.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.460
I wanted to prove that I could
do something more than just be

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.920
a cop or a bartender, which
was pretty much my career

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.060
path, was either a cop
or a bartender.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.680
DON DODGE: Because your
father owned a bar--

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.010
JASON CALACANIS: And
he was a bartender.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.405
DON DODGE: Your older
brother--

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:55.250
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah, my
younger brother became a cop

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.290
and then a fireman, and I have
great respect for what he

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.710
does, running into burning
buildings, a lot easier than

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.490
building websites.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.740
But I wanted to try to
do something really

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.440
great with my life.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.750
I just had this sense that I
wanted to be more than what

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.940
people expected of me.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.010
I think early on, a lot of
entrepreneurs, it's like they

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.620
have something to
prove like that.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.060
And then I incorporated
a lot of

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.270
competitiveness into what I did.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.030
I wanted to be better than the
other person doing it.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.890
And then I had to start making
up sort of goals for myself,

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.500
like I wanted to beat
people by 2x.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.370
It was like OK, Engadget became
bigger than Gizmodo

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.980
when I was building the blog
companies, and when I was 30

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.310
years old, 35 years old, I was
just like, I want to have

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.140
three times the traffic
of them.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.340
I don't want to just beat them,
I want to dominate them.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.870
You have these immature
motivations, I think, and

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.270
competitive motivations, and
then at a certain point when

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.650
you've accomplished something,
when I first sold Weblogs, Inc

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.260
and I was able to financially
not have to work again, and

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.925
had achieved some level of
success and pride in what I

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:06.120
had done, I had to take a deep
look in the mirror and say

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.640
this exact question,
what motivates me?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.570
And you have this big moment
like OK, I've made it to the

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.100
top of the hill.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.000
What now?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.210
And then you realize, you're
a mountain climber.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.410
You just love climbing
mountains.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.520
You're not trying to get to the
top of the hill, you're

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.980
just trying to climb.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.260
That's what I am.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.120
I'm just a climber.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.370
I like to climb.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.430
I love being at the base camp
and seeing people who've never

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.910
climbed a mountain saying,
I want to climb,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.470
it's my first time.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.670
Can you help me?

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.180
For me, that's angel
investing.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.460
For me, that's the LAUNCH
conference.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.200
I love seeing them go up the
cliff and all the excitement

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.840
of getting up to the
top and succeeding.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.410
And for myself personally, I
just love to build things, and

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.590
I love building teams, and I
love being involved with

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.150
people who are building teams.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.360
It's a rush for me.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.060
I mean that, to me, is
my greatest rush.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.450
The act of creation, the act
of people getting off the

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.440
bench and then saying, I'm going
to make that dent in the

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.510
universe, I'm going to try to
innovate, I'm going to try to

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.220
take this vision I have
and make it reality.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.200
And that's the motivation
for me today, I think.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.240
In what I'll call the second
half of my career, I get as

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.510
much enjoyment out of, and
probably more, helping other

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.140
people succeed, making other
entrepreneurs, making people

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.330
entrepreneurial, helping them
grow their visions.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.310
The best six weeks of the year
for me, putting my family

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.570
aside and personal life and
taking kids on vacation, which

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.960
is a whole level of joy
that transcends all

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.020
entrepreneurship, but the four
weeks, six weeks before the

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.270
LAUNCH conference and prior
to that, the TechCrunch50

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.200
Conference, where I coached
the companies.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.650
I helped always select the
companies, but I was always

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.030
the person who brought them
and coached them.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.950
And watching them give their
presentation three, four, five

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.790
times and go from a five or six
to a nine or a ten, that

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.150
to me was just like,
I love that.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.180
And I watched Dropbox launch and
Drew just gave a terrible

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.450
presentation the first time,
it crashed, it was just a

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.510
disaster with Dropbox.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.230
And then watching Mint, and
Fitbit, and Yammer, and

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.390
Redbeacon, all these great
companies, and now Space

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.290
Monkey, and Alltuition and the
latest crop of companies.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.890
Watching them succeed through
that process and then going on

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.250
stage and the world seeing them
and the world seeing what

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.120
I've seen for four or five weeks
in the laboratory, and

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.630
they're just as excited about
as I am, I mean, there are

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.870
hugs and tears and emotions
running very deep backstage

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.990
that people don't see between
myself, the other people who

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.080
produce the event, the judges.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.500
It's as close to a spiritual,
Zen moment as I have in my

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.110
professional career is those
moments after people get off

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.810
stage and I just tell them, you
did it, it was amazing.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.400
And they say, I couldn't have
done it without you.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.561
I live for that.

00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:52.700
I live for it.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.520
DON DODGE: It's almost
like being present at

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.190
the birth of a child.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.080
JASON CALACANIS: It
is in a way, yes.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.940
DON DODGE: It's an amazing
experience.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.670
JASON CALACANIS: Having
experienced the birth of a

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.720
child, it is, yes.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.780
It is exactly like that
experience of overwhelming joy

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.360
that something new is in your
life and you know life will

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.710
never be the same.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.050
DON DODGE: And you had a part
in making it happen.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.230
JASON CALACANIS: And you had
some part in making it happen.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.060
In the case of my beautiful
daughter, I

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.580
think I had about 0.1%.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.840
I think my wive did
about 99.9%.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.540
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.570
So when did you know that you
wanted to be an entrepreneur?

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.580
JASON CALACANIS: At a
very young age, 12,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.380
13, 14 years old.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.140
DON DODGE: And when did you
start your first company?

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.960
JASON CALACANIS: Well, putting
aside working for my dad,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.730
which was kind of
entrepreneurial being in his

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.210
startup, my first business was
my dad had somebody who owed

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.720
him money from a poker game
and backgammon, and this

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.230
person had gotten into
my father for a

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.390
decent amount of cash.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.910
Right now, you're probably
wondering, wow, where is this

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.420
story going?

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.510
And the guy was kind
of connected in a

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.600
Brooklyn kind of way.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.380
DON DODGE: Uh oh.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.562
JASON CALACANIS: And the
guy said, listen, John.

00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:00.540
I'm going to get you that money
I owe you from the poker

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.110
game and from the backgammon.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.240
But to hold you over, I
know your son loves

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.940
the Star Wars films.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.030
Here's a copy of The Empire
Strikes Back.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.550
And he handed him a VHS tape
with The Empire Strikes Back.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.390
Now, The Empire Strikes Back had
been in movie theaters a

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.020
year earlier, and Star Wars was
not out on VHS, and my dad

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.840
had a VHS player, which in 1984
or '85 was just crazy.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.160
And I was in junior high school,
it was '83, '84,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.080
something like that.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.710
And my dad came home, and he
said, hey, you know The Empire

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.140
Strikes Back?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.350
I was like yeah, we
saw it five times.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.090
He was like, here you go.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.300
How did you get this?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.410
Oh, you know, a guy
owed me a thing.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.710
The guy had obviously put a
camera up and taped The Empire

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.560
Strikes Back at a theater in
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and I

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.430
had a copy of the film.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.050
So then I charged my friends to
come over to the house, $1

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.910
each, to watch the film.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.930
And then they said, can
I get a copy of it?

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.475
And I said, well, I don't
know how to make a copy.

00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:55.210
And they said, oh, OK.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.350
And so then I started figuring
out how to put two VHS tapes

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.720
together, got my friend to give
me his VHS player, and

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.210
made copies of the tape, and
then I started selling illegal

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.150
bootleg copies of The
Empire Strikes Back.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.830
I think the statute of
limitation's over.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.265
But I literally was selling at
school for $35, I came up with

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:13.780
a price of $35, copies of
Empire Strikes Back.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.710
I had a line out the door.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.830
I'd literally sold 20 or
30 copies of them.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.100
DON DODGE: And that's when you
knew you wanted to be an

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.790
entrepreneur.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.660
JASON CALACANIS: I said, wow,
I'm printing money.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.240
I had no concept
of intellectual

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.390
property at the time.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.845
I just knew that it would take
me two hours to make a copy

00:12:27.845 --> 00:12:30.510
because you had to do
it in real time.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.930
You would put one tape in, you
would have the audio, video go

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.510
out into another VHS,
and you'd literally

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.040
record it in real time.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.820
It wasn't a drag
and drop copy.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.820
So it took me two hours to make
a copy, and if anything

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.530
got screwed up in the middle,
I had to start

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.080
over, and that happened.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.180
So it was like, oh wow, in
two hours, I made $35.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.580
I'm making $20 an hour or
whatever, $17 an hour.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.640
It was an incredible
revelation to me.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.560
That was my first business.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.110
And then after that, I started
programming databases.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.130
I just had an IBM PC Junior in
1982 or '83 at the same time

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.400
and just got into computers,
and learned how to use

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.990
databases and Lotus 1-2-3, and
started doing consulting work

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.460
for $10 an hour, $15 an hour
teaching people how to use

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.810
software and working in little
mom and pop offices, like a

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.860
lot of people did.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.520
DON DODGE: So Silicon
Alley Reporter.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.920
That was your first
company, right?

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.050
JASON CALACANIS: That was my
first big company, yeah.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.070
I just basically started a
magazine about the internet in

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.230
1995 and it was a photocopy.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.270
I put about $4,000 on my credit
cards to print it, and

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.930
it was a pretty scary moment
because I had done all the

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.370
Pagemaker, which was the
original sort of Quark Express

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.860
desktop publishing software,
and I made the magazine.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.370
I called it a magazine, it
was really tabloid paper

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.500
photocopied, folded in half,
and I found a place in

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.600
Manhattan, Village Printers up
on 45th Street and a guy named

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.000
Jose, if he still works there,
thank you, folded in half and

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.570
put a staple in the middle.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.140
And so I said, how much is it?

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.010
He said, it's like
$0.05 a copy.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.520
I said, great, 16
pages, whatever.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.720
It's eight pages and $0.40 a
copy or whatever, and I'll

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.460
take this many copies.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.342
So I go up there and I go to
pick them up, and he goes OK,

00:14:07.342 --> 00:14:08.876
it's $4,000.

00:14:08.876 --> 00:14:10.190
I said, wait a minute, it's
$2,000, [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.815
He goes, yeah, but
it's two-sided.

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:14.840
It's $0.05 a side to
make a photocopy.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.690
I said, you didn't say that.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.790
You said $0.05 a thing.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.290
He said, no, no, I
said both sides.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.740
I said, I can't afford that.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.600
He said, all right, I'll split
the difference with you.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.540
But I put the money on my credit
cards, and then that

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.010
magazine, obviously
you guys know the

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.980
history of the internet.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.910
The internet exploded during
that time and I started

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.450
hosting conferences, and they
started getting bigger and

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.260
bigger, and remember back in
1999 or 2000 or something, a

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.090
PR person had called me from
some bizarrely named company

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.860
in the valley and said, we want
to have this guy Sergey

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.895
give a keynote at your
conference in New York.

00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:45.710
I said, what's the name
of the company?

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.710
They said Google, and I said,
yeah, I heard about it.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.410
You guys are the ones who
provide the search software

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:49.980
for Yahoo, right?

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.980
And they said, yeah.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.830
I said, yeah, I don't think that
you guys are big enough

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.080
to be a fireside chat.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.635
I'll put Sergey on a panel.

00:14:56.635 --> 00:14:58.150
And the PR person was
like, listen, he's

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.090
really a smart guy.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.560
You really should give
him a fireside chat.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.330
And I said, all right, fine.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.480
I did a fireside chat with
Sergey Brin in 2000 or

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.290
whatever, right before the
bubble burst, and it was

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.960
great, it was before
they were public.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.010
And I still know Sergey to this
day, and he's a great

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.180
guy, a very smart guy.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.990
But that magazine basically
gave me the ability to sit

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.920
with entrepreneurs and
say, where do you

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.020
think the world's going?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.150
And then I was a journalist
and I wrote about it.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.610
And journalism is really this
incredible fast track to

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.770
becoming an entrepreneur,
because you get to talk to a

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.850
dozen people a week who tell
you which direction the

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.730
world's going, and boy, founders
and CEOs will tell

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.900
you everything.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.150
And when they tell you
everything, it's almost like

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.530
you get this sort of incredible
view of the

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.130
landscape from 20 different
people's perspective.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.200
Fred Wilson of Union Square
Ventures was doing

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.360
Flatiron at the time.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.910
His wife Joanne worked for me at
Silicon Alley Reporter and

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.970
sold the ads.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.410
So Fred was a VC who would be
telling me about all these

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.270
great companies we were seeing
and introducing people to me,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.320
I would meet people and send
them to Fred, who was a VC,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.760
and then I was just really in
this middle of the zeitgeist.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.580
And I also realized the power of
media and conferences, and

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.920
the person who puts the person
on the cover of the magazine,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.200
or throws the event, or pays for
the check at dinner gets a

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.660
disproportionate amount of
credit for everything that

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.040
occurs in that magazine, at
that event, or at dinner.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.760
And that's why I've always loved
to host events and host

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.550
things, because it's just a
way for me to get to meet

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.780
everybody, and anything that
occurs at that event, people

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.580
just attribute to you.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.420
Wow, Jason helped me because I
met my wife at this event or I

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.530
met my investor at this event.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.240
I get those stories all the
time, and I'm like, really?

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.530
I didn't even know you were at
that event, but that's awesome

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.830
that it impacted your life.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.790
I'm a very social guy.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.260
I loved being a magazine
editor.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.820
It was the time of my life, and
we grew it to 70 people

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.262
and $11.6 million a
year in revenue.

00:16:46.262 --> 00:16:48.960
DON DODGE: So you've done
Silicon Alley Reporter and

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.580
Weblogs, Inc, and Mahalo, and
Open Angel Forum, and

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:53.910
TechCrunch50.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.340
JASON CALACANIS: I love
creating brands.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.880
DON DODGE: LAUNCH, you're a
writer in your own right.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.020
Is there any separation, or
is that all just Jason?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.020
It's all one thing?

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.480
JASON CALACANIS: I think
that's all Jason.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.800
I used to fret over it a
little bit, and then I

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.550
realized, I have a little
entrepreneurial ADD, I get

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.700
excited, I have enthusiasm, but
I'm not going to try to

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.640
bridle it and put it all
into one project.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.590
If I want to do an event, and
I want to write my email

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.480
newsletter, and I want to host
This Week In Startups, and I

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.780
want to be the CEO of Mahalo
and pursue education and do

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.970
apps and all this stuff, I'm
going to do everything.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.610
And I look at one of the great
entrepreneurs of our time, not

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.730
Steve Jobs, Jay-Z, and he is
an amazing entrepreneur.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.550
He is an artist who's onstage,
and he is probably the

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.950
greatest rapper alive today,
in my opinion, he is, and

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.550
Biggie Smalls was probably
the best that ever

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.006
lived, rest in peace.

00:17:51.006 --> 00:17:58.870
But Jay-Z also ran a record
label, and manages other

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.380
people's careers and
a clothing line,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.160
and this other stuff.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.110
And I just think those rap
artists and people in the hip

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.530
hop space have a very good view
of the world, which is

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.030
why not try everything?

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.250
Why not do a little
bit of everything?

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.390
And if some people think you're
doing too much, that's

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.640
on them, that's not on me.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.490
People say oh, well, what do
your investors in this company

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.280
think about you working
on this?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.260
They love the fact
that I'm diverse.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.793
They love the fact that I get to
spend a couple of weeks in

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:29.960
the LAUNCH Conference, learn a
lot, and then parlay that into

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.990
my own day-to-day experience as
an entrepreneur, and I just

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.710
love being involved in a lot
of different things.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.040
So I don't fret over it
too much anymore.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.220
Although I will say, ever since
having a child, I am

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.470
getting a little tired.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.160
DON DODGE: How do you
measure success?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.690
JASON CALACANIS: That's a
great, great question.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.150
There's ways I measure success
in other people, right?

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.730
You can look at somebody's
exit, that's a

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.530
very tangible number.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.480
Mark Gibbons sold his company
for this many billions of

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.610
dollars, and what's the
valuation of that company?

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.270
That's a very literal thing.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.450
But for me, success is, how much
joy are you getting out

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.740
of what you're doing
every day?

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.530
How much excitement and
enthusiasm do you have for

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.570
that project and for the
people you work with?

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.880
And how much do you love coming
to work every day and

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.110
building stuff?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.390
And to me, that's really success
as an entrepreneur.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.720
And I have my own little
quirk, and it's just a

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.260
personal thing, but I like to
create brands that last the

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.480
test of time.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.420
Even if they're not functioning
anymore, like

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.080
Silicon Alley Reporter doesn't
exist, but that people hold

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.480
that special place in their
heart for them, that they

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.280
impacted somebody deeply.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.970
So even though TechCrunch50
doesn't exist on its own

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.630
anymore, it exists as Mike's
version in TechCrunch

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.090
disrupting my version in LAUNCH,
those three years of

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.690
TechCrunch50 were three of the
best years of conference

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.590
production ever done, the best
companies, and Mike and I had

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.360
a great collaboration there.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.120
Sure, there was tension.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.150
You put two huge elephants in a
room, something is going to

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.780
get knocked over, somebody's
going to get stepped

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.740
on sooner or later.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.950
But 10 years from now, 20 years
from now, we'll look

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.910
back on those years together as
some of the best years of

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.740
conference production ever done,
and the people who came

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.730
out of those three years feel
that those were a very

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.120
important brand to them.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.680
People feel that way about
Engadget, people feel that way

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.460
about Joystick and Autoblog,
they feel

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.510
that way about LAUNCH.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.800
Open Angel Forum I don't really
do any more in some of

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.590
the major cities because they
don't need it, right?

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.220
Angel List is sort of a more
powerful version of Open Angel

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.130
Forum, and angel rounds are
closing so quickly you don't

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.590
really need an Open Angel
Forum anymore.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.390
That was the reason I stopped
doing it was because every

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.290
time I would sign up five
companies for Open Angel

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.250
Forum, they would tell me a
week before the event that

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.715
they filled their round and that
they couldn't present.

00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:52.670
I said, OK fine.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.535
Then I'm only left with the
companies that are bad, I

00:20:54.535 --> 00:20:57.020
don't want to put on companies
or the weaker companies.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.810
But people still say, oh, at
Open Angel Forum, I invested

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.540
in Reportive, or I
met Backupify.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.370
So for me, that's my own little
personal quirk is, how

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.810
much did the brand
mean to people?

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.540
How well-crafted was
the product?

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.280
And I got that from my dad,
because he used to really take

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.520
pride and he used to say,
what's on the plate?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.450
What's on the plate?

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.490
He said, that's where it occurs,
that's the experience.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.000
What do you put on the plate?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.260
DON DODGE: Was that a
restaurant metaphor?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.530
JASON CALACANIS: It was
a restaurant metaphor.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.950
He said it doesn't matter.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:31.880
The waiter could be the worst
waiter in the world, it might

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.140
not be the fanciest designed
room, but if what's on the

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.440
plate is absolutely delicious
and awesome, people will

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.380
forgive it.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.630
When I was young, I was like, I
don't know about that, Pop.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.320
The room matters, and the waiter
matters, and sure, all

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.100
those details matter, but I
understand philosophically

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.970
what he was getting at, which
was the product at its core

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.240
transcends everything
around it.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.120
So in the example of the LAUNCH
Conference, the space

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.710
is a big, cavernous warehouse
that's not perfect, and the

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.880
sound's not always perfect
because it's so cavernous, and

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.850
the temperature might not be
easy to regulate, and maybe

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.830
the food's not perfect all the
time, but what's on the

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.170
plate-- and in the case
of a conference, it's

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.420
what's on the stage--

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.160
is perfect.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.160
And I know it's perfect because
I sit there in the

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.400
laboratory for six weeks, four
weeks, fretting over each

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.290
presentation and going over it
five or six times, and then

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.850
Tyler does it a couple
times and Karen

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.300
does it a couple times.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.150
I know what's on the plate is
going to be good, and that's

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.320
just where I focus my energy.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.540
And I think that's actually
where the world's going, and I

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.650
just wrote about this in an
email called "The Age of

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.390
Excellence." I think the
world has no more

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.040
place for good products.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.240
I think the concept of
"good" is going away.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.320
Good is the same as average
is the same as

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.200
bad in people's minds.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.920
Anything that's just
good, average--

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.520
because there's excellence,
and it's so clear when

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.390
something's excellent, people
are just drawn to it.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.150
And I think this was the problem
I had in search, which

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.070
was Google search results,
people can pick them apart on

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.340
the edges, but they're
excellent and

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.890
they get the job done.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.100
And then when I created a search
engine to compete with

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.200
it, it was sometimes a
little bit better,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.390
sometimes a little worse.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.880
It's very hard to compete with
something that's excellent,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.680
and people will not leave
something that's excellent for

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.940
another excellent thing,
or certainly not for

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.320
another good thing.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.500
And that's where competition
becomes so hard against

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.980
incumbents who have
a great product.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.240
And you see that with Apple,
you see it with Google with

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.700
search, you see it
with the iPhone.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.420
It's very difficult
to compete against

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.670
excellent, excellent products.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.230
It's got profound ramifications,
I think, for

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.040
the world and for employment
and for founders that

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.520
excellence is table stakes.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.630
Excellence is the baseline.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.880
It means if you can't create
that amazing, excellent

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.670
product and it comes out
average, you're better off

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.530
just turning it off and
then trying again to

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.770
make something excellent.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.500
And that wasn't the case just
five, 10, 15 years ago.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:59.260
Things like distribution, a
celebrity affiliation, some

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.560
patented business technique,
some marketing technique, all

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.170
these other things could
have mattered.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.430
But now we're going to a world
where what's on the plate is

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.760
all that matters.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.120
The product wins.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.820
If an app has a histogram with
five stars, four stars, and

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.260
then very little three, two,
and ones, whether it's on

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.510
Yelp, Amazon, or iTunes, people
buy it instantly.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.200
When the histogram becomes even,
people generally don't

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.140
buy it, or they question it, and
when the histogram becomes

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.930
upside down, when it looks like
an upside down pistol and

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.180
there's only one or two four-
or five-star reviews and

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.830
there's a lot of one- and
two-star reviews, people will

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.390
absolutely not buy it, and
that's going to happen in

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.960
every category.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.460
Right now, we see it in
products, we see it in

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.650
restaurants, we see it in apps,
but it's going to go to

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.490
television shows and movies.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.140
And people are not going to go
see Transformers Four or Five

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.180
if it really sucks, because
they're going to know the

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.470
histogram and the transparency
will be there, and they're

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.110
going to go find something on
Kickstarter, and they're going

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.120
to go spend their money on
something that's of quality.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.080
You see it on television
to a certain extent.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.600
People don't just turn on ABC,
NBC, and CBS and watch what's

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600
on there anymore.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.120
They seek out what's
on HBO, what's on

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.540
Showtime, what's on AMC.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.580
The most loved shows are
not on network anymore.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:20.070
Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire,
Walking Dead, The Wire, The

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.200
Shield, Damages, all these shows
that people fall in love

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.070
with and have high net promoter
scores and that

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.170
people are passionate about are
not on network television.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.670
DON DODGE: Well, that's because
the competitive

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.480
landscape has changed.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.330
So today, it's easy to
start a company but

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.950
hard to build a business.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.030
JASON CALACANIS: Starting is
easy, finishing is hard.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.420
DON DODGE: Do you think that's
because it's so easy to start

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.100
a company now, it's so cheap
to start a company, that

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.240
everyone is doing it?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.090
And it's very, very hard to
stand up above the crowd and

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.560
be noticed and be that excellent
product that

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.150
everyone wants to buy.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:56.460
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.180
That's exactly what's happening,
and I think you can

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.200
attribute it to two factors.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.810
One we'll call the open
source movement.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.230
When you started building
internet companies, you had to

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.060
go to Oracle and give them this
huge big dump truck of

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.220
money to start your company.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.740
Here, Oracle, here's $250,000
for a license.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.015
Now it's like, oh, I'm using
MySQL and I'm using Hadoop, or

00:26:20.015 --> 00:26:22.870
I'm using this HBase,
or whatever,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.130
I'm not paying anybody.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.970
And oh, you had to buy all these
servers from Sun, and

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.410
now it's like, I'm buying
commodity hardware

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.180
or I'm in the cloud.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.550
I'm on EC2, I'm on Rackspace's
cloud, and I'm just paying a

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.680
couple hundred bucks
for hosting.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.950
So all that cost has gone down
to what's essentially zero,

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.510
minimal cost.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.110
And then you have the Zuckerberg
effect, which

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.960
follows the Jobs, Larry, Sergey,
Bill Gates effects of

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.790
the past, which is the heroes
of our society are moving

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.540
towards entrepreneurship, people
who create beautiful

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.600
things that impact
people's lives.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.710
And it used to be our heroes
were celebrities, it used to

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.410
be our heroes maybe were
politicians in some cases, or

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.880
musicians, rock stars,
TV stars.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.120
And in those cases, maybe they
have artistic moments of

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.360
greatness, but when the movie
The Social Network came out, I

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.700
think that's a pretty clear
starting pistol that young

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.800
people aspire to create
Facebook, not a CD or a movie.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.830
They want to create
the next Facebook.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.050
And you have two sons.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:27.570
What do they want to do?

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.940
They want to start
companies, right?

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.490
DON DODGE: Right.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.940
JASON CALACANIS: And I think
every parent is facing that.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.470
So now, can all companies
be successful?

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.420
Of course not.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.770
But I don't complain about that
because if the cost of

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.760
launching a company is zero or
close to it and somebody gets

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.060
an angel round for $25,000 or
$250,000 or $500,000 and it

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.870
doesn't work out, the cost is
very low to society, to the

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.680
investors, to the
entrepreneur.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.210
They can always go to work
at a bigger company.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.300
So you do have issues like
there's too many entrepreneurs

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.550
out there, and there's too many
people who are B or C

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.790
level players trying to be the
CEO when really they're a

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.510
great VP of product, or they're
a great business

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.705
development leader, or they're a
great operations person, and

00:28:07.705 --> 00:28:09.690
they're taking the CEO slot,
and it would be better for

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.530
three or four of those companies
to consolidate and

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.820
really make a run at a
meaningful business.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.600
But that's OK.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.130
I don't think there's any
downside, and people, oh my

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.000
god, Y Combinator or
TechStars, most

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.680
companies will fail.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.630
If you look at Y Combinator or
TechStars as an alternative to

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.630
college, getting paid $15,000
or $25,000 to go build a

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.470
product for six months, you're
going to learn a heck of a lot

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.080
more than being $150,000
or $250,000 in

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.405
debt to the Ivy League.

00:28:36.405 --> 00:28:42.340
If Harvard was such a great,
amazing program itself, why

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.235
aren't there 100 Harvard?

00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:45.810
Why isn't there a Harvard
in every city that takes

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:51.260
everybody from IQ of 100
to an IQ of 120?

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.800
Well, it's because that program
is not so great.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.800
Harvard is great because they
have a great selection program

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.960
and it's got a great history,
and it's got a great logo, and

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.540
it's all charismatic
and a great legacy.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.700
But the fact is, that's not
a great product for making

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.550
people hyper-intelligent.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.980
It's a great place for
hyper-intelligent people to

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.830
spend four years, and then come
out as intelligent as

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.340
they were, and perhaps a
little more socialized.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.770
So the way I look at it is, you
go into TechStars, you go

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.420
into Y Combinator, you go into
even the funded, any of these

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.200
places, and you come
out much better.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.740
And that's back to your original
question about, can

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.820
you learn entrepreneurship
or not?

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.776
And the truth is, you can.

00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:29.980
You can learn it.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.020
Now, can you learn passion,
can you learn leadership?

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.360
Yeah, you can learn those
things, but there's certain

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.410
cases, with passion you have it
or you don't or whatever,

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.510
desire, hunger.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.470
Who knows, that's a harder
question to answer.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.730
But when it comes to
entrepreneurship, yeah, you

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.020
can learn a lot.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.060
And you can certainly a lot of
the blocking and tackling of

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.530
starting a company.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.340
In my day, starting a
company was hard.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.440
I sound like an old man at 41,
but 10 years ago, nobody knew

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.160
what a term sheet looked
like until you got one.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.750
Now, you just type in
"term sheet," you

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.630
see 100 term sheets.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.830
You ask any entrepreneur
for a term sheet,

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.980
they'll give it to you.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.770
People don't know what financing
documents look like,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.680
now you can get them for free.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.860
Wilson Sonsini puts out
free documents.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.410
Here's all the documents,
take a look at them.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.080
It's amazing how much
easier it is.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.880
And all that hardship, we like
to look back on it as

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.000
entrepreneurs, oh, we had to go
through and suffer through

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.580
all that stuff so it
made us stronger.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.600
Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.800
It was a waste of time.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.600
We could have spent that time
on product, we would've made

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.040
better products.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.470
So I don't have this bias about
it, but boy, what a

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.990
wonderful time we live in.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.240
People can take risk now.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.310
If you think about it like space
exploration, it's like

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.940
each of these start-ups, each
of these entrepreneurs is

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.560
sending a little probe into
the universe to see if the

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.560
planet is inhabitable.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.840
Who cares if most of them
don't come back?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.980
It doesn't matter.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.920
All that matters is that some
come back with signs of life,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.040
or water, or something of
value on that planet.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.020
That's the beauty of this.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.670
I don't buy this we're finding
too many start-ups things.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.720
Yeah, the valuations are a
little out of whack, yeah some

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.820
people who are B players are
getting funded, or C players,

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.590
and they shouldn't.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.340
Whatever, who cares?

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.850
What's the downside compared
to the upside?

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.380
What if we find life
on those planets?

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.421
What if we find the next Google,
what if we find the

00:31:14.421 --> 00:31:16.480
next Apple, what if we find the
next Facebook, what if we

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.950
find the next Airbnb, Dropbox,
Fitbit, Room 77, Space Monkey?

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.050
Let's find those
opportunities.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.420
DON DODGE: Absolutely.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.980
You've had a lot of success in
your career, you've started

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.610
successful companies, but it's
not always that way.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.230
JASON CALACANIS: Nope.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.210
DON DODGE: Let's talk
about pivots and

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.830
about changing direction.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:44.150
How do you know when it's time
to pivot versus when it's time

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.510
to persevere and push ahead?

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.360
JASON CALACANIS: That's a
timeless question, and it's

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.960
very relevant.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.790
There's no exact way to
know, I'll be honest.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.640
There are people who I
feel have given up on

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.600
problems and pivoted.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.760
You see it all the time where
people try to make a consumer

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.380
product and they say, you know
what, we're just going to sell

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.610
a white label version of it.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.260
And sometimes my heart breaks
because I'm like, how many

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.195
versions did you do?

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.520
Did you do one version
or two and gave up?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.000
Did you talk to those
customers?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.880
Did they tell you why they're
not using it?

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.560
Did you figure out why
they're not engaging?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.470
If you look at something as
simple as web-based video,

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.660
video on the web sounds crazy
right now since web video is

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.590
such a big market.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.690
People didn't believe that would
work 10 years ago, and

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.040
it took YouTube basically
picking up where iClips and

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.590
iFilm had left off.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.890
Those companies had given up,
they had sold, and iFilm had

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.610
gone into servicing people,
servicing their video needs,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.280
and real networks, and a lot
of people had tried to make

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.770
video work.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.630
And then YouTube said,
OK, people have

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.020
done 80% of the work.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.120
Let's do the last 20%.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.340
A large portion of YouTube's
success was the fact that

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.930
Flash had finally worked
for video really well.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.940
And nobody really had picked up
on that, and then Chad and

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.310
Steven, you had to give them a
lot of credit for realizing

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.870
that wait a second, video can
work without a plug-in?

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.840
Video could work seamlessly and
you could make it free?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.150
I mean, one of the reasons why
video didn't take off was

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.750
because people were so concerned
about the bandwidth

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:23.920
cost that it required a credit
card to put a video online.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.350
And really, the innovation of
YouTube was you didn't need a

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.120
credit card to put your
video online.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.960
It seems so obvious today, and
you didn't need a plug-in.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.990
It seems so obvious today.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.480
So I think persevering
is very good.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.780
Now, if you absolutely are
certain that you've explored

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.775
every option and that there's no
way to make it work, yeah,

00:33:43.775 --> 00:33:45.310
then pivot.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.430
I thought human-powered search
would work, and I really spent

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.190
two years, three years
of my career.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.680
We had moderate success, and a
lot of the innovation we had

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.560
in search you see in products
like Google and Bing today.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.540
Human is being put into Google
search results today with the

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.300
advent of Google+ and seeing
your friend's name, so it's

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.950
human, it's social.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.829
It's the same as human, it's
just done a different way.

00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:13.060
So in some way, I guess I get a
small victory by seeing that

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.679
happen, right?

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:18.480
But you can't make everything
work as an entrepreneur,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.935
that's unrealistic.

00:34:18.935 --> 00:34:21.639
And if everything you do in
your career is a home run,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.409
that means you're not swinging
hard enough.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.989
You're not swinging
for the fences.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.889
You cannot win every time.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.760
Two out of three things
you do should fail.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.444
If you're not, if you're
succeeding at everything, that

00:34:34.444 --> 00:34:37.510
means you set the benchmark
too low.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:44.510
I knew was time to pivot when
Google's results started going

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:48.260
from 10 blue links to 10 blue
links with some content at the

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.920
top, and a YouTube video,
and some news.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.020
And all of a sudden I was like
wow, that sort of was our

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.920
vision, and it's sort
of there already.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.560
OK, no problem.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.970
We'll just do something else.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.380
And you look at what
work you've done.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.490
I think the best pivots come
out of what lesson did you

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.270
learn from your failure?

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.300
What lessons did you learn from
your moderate success?

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.140
And I have to say, moderate
success is

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.790
much worse than failure.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.070
DON DODGE: It's like
the walking dead.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.360
JASON CALACANIS: That's
the kryptonite.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.600
If you have moderate success,
if you can get your business

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.010
to exactly the amount of money
your payroll is and your burn

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.500
is, and you just go sideways,
that's when you're truly

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.720
screwed because you're
going to take your

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.395
eyes off the prize.

00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:28.700
You'll be like, well, I'm sort
of making it, and then the

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.550
business goes like this.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.500
That's bad.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.935
DON DODGE: Let's talk
about passion.

00:35:32.935 --> 00:35:33.600
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.140
DON DODGE: Passion is an
important ingredient to any

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.060
start-up, any business success,
and your point about

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.990
if you're at that sort of break
even point and kind of

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.430
doing OK, it's easy to lose
the passion then.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.000
JASON CALACANIS: Yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.530
You're operating a business,
you're a mom and pop business.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.760
Nothing wrong with that, but
some people could have passion

00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:00.120
for running a small cafe, and
people are very satisfied with

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.810
the mochas, and you can bring
passion to that and I wouldn't

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.760
degrade the people
who are running

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.850
the mom and pop business.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.600
But hey, the game we're in is
to build really impactful

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.400
products that change the world,
and to do that, you

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.650
need to bring a level of
passion because it's so

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.790
difficult and the passion is
what's going to get you

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.610
through the difficult times.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:28.940
You will get your butt kicked
over and over and over again

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.110
if you're going after
something big.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.190
And you don't have the passion,
when you get knocked

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.960
out, you're not going
to get up.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.760
And man, I can tell you, the
best success of my career has

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.540
always come right after I've
gotten my butt kicked.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.720
Right after I've gotten knocked
down and I've got that

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.940
blood in my mouth, and I can
taste my own blood in my

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.500
mouth, like, oh god, this is so
hard, I don't know if I can

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.220
do it anymore.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.370
And you just pick yourself up
knowing you might get knocked

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.680
right back down, but you get up
and say, I'm going to try

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.950
again, that's when the
success happens.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.080
And entrepreneurship
is a test of wills.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.050
Who can fight through the
most pain and suffering?

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.640
Who can fight through the most
problems, the most headaches,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.900
the most uncomfortable
conversations, the hardest

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.280
problems to solve, the problems
where you bring five

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.450
smart people into a room and
nobody can figure out the

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.000
solution, and three people feel
one way and two people

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.130
feel another way, and the next
day it flips, and there's no

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.800
clear answer.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.000
That's when you know you're
on the verge of greatness,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.210
because most people when they
get into those incredibly

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.210
difficult situations, they
capitulate and they give up

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.340
and they throw in the towel,
and for good reason because

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.980
it's hard and it's painful, and
there's more painful and

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.900
hard times in entrepreneurship
than there are good times.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.630
It's just the nature of it.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.870
And if it was easy, everybody
would do it.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:55.660
And instead of 99% of people
going to work every day and 1%

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.850
going to be entrepreneurs,
it would be flipped.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.720
It's not easy.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.910
That's why most people
don't do it.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.800
So if you choose to do it,
know that in those hard

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.540
moments when you're getting
your butt kicked and when

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.130
things look the most dark,
that the darkest hour is

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.990
before the dawn.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.420
DON DODGE: Jason, you're one of
the most passionate people

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.180
that I know.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.150
Thanks for being with us
today and sharing your

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.020
passion with us.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.940
JASON CALACANIS: My pleasure.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.430
DON DODGE: Thank you.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:17.680
JASON CALACANIS: Just do it.
