ambiguity paradox confusion are also

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049
ambiguity paradox confusion are also
 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.960
ambiguity paradox confusion are also
some of my favorite subjects the two

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
some of my favorite subjects the two
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.440
some of my favorite subjects the two
lines that we often see in the Far East

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450
lines that we often see in the Far East
 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.440
lines that we often see in the Far East
it's they're supposed to represent

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450
it's they're supposed to represent
 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.630
it's they're supposed to represent
confusion and paradox and they guard the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
confusion and paradox and they guard the
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.109
confusion and paradox and they guard the
gate to heaven so if you want to get to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
gate to heaven so if you want to get to
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.630
gate to heaven so if you want to get to
heaven quote you have to be comfortable

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
heaven quote you have to be comfortable
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.830
heaven quote you have to be comfortable
with confusion and with paradox and one

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
with confusion and with paradox and one
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720
with confusion and with paradox and one
example of being comfortable with

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
example of being comfortable with
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.040
example of being comfortable with
paradox as we often hear that we should

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
paradox as we often hear that we should
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.910
paradox as we often hear that we should
accept life the way it is and but of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
accept life the way it is and but of
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.229
accept life the way it is and but of
course there are many things that we

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
course there are many things that we
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.530
course there are many things that we
don't accept so we can have the paradox

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
don't accept so we can have the paradox
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.229
don't accept so we can have the paradox
of accepting that we can't accept I mean

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
of accepting that we can't accept I mean
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930
of accepting that we can't accept I mean
we can't accept violence against women

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
we can't accept violence against women
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.319
we can't accept violence against women
or children or even against other men

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
or children or even against other men
 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.970
or children or even against other men
but we can accept that we can't accept

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
but we can accept that we can't accept
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060
but we can accept that we can't accept
that so the paradox in this case

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
that so the paradox in this case
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.170
that so the paradox in this case
extremely extremely important so it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
extremely extremely important so it's
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080
extremely extremely important so it's
not a whitewash to say hey I accept

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
not a whitewash to say hey I accept
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.770
not a whitewash to say hey I accept
everything that's nonsense to begin with

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
everything that's nonsense to begin with
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.149
everything that's nonsense to begin with
but where do you parts of where do you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
but where do you parts of where do you
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250
but where do you parts of where do you
say that you accept something something

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
say that you accept something something
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590
say that you accept something something
or not and being comfortable with the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
or not and being comfortable with the
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.890
or not and being comfortable with the
paradox of accepting but also accepting

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
paradox of accepting but also accepting
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.890
paradox of accepting but also accepting
that we do not accept certain things

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900
that we do not accept certain things
 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.660
that we do not accept certain things
that's that's how paradox plants plays

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
that's that's how paradox plants plays
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.140
that's that's how paradox plants plays
itself out and confusion is that we live

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
itself out and confusion is that we live
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.920
itself out and confusion is that we live
in an extremely complex world and it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
in an extremely complex world and it's
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230
in an extremely complex world and it's
not a straight and narrow most things

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
not a straight and narrow most things
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.560
not a straight and narrow most things
have an upside and a downside and to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
have an upside and a downside and to
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.469
have an upside and a downside and to
weigh them out is it's very difficult

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
weigh them out is it's very difficult
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530
weigh them out is it's very difficult
you know we we would love to have a very

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
you know we we would love to have a very
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.450
you know we we would love to have a very
simple answer a black-and-white answer

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
simple answer a black-and-white answer
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539
simple answer a black-and-white answer
is it good for me as a bad for me but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
is it good for me as a bad for me but
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.289
is it good for me as a bad for me but
that's very rarely the case we evolved

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
that's very rarely the case we evolved
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810
that's very rarely the case we evolved
to want to have simple answers because

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
to want to have simple answers because
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.420
to want to have simple answers because
the brain then doesn't have to work

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
the brain then doesn't have to work
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969
the brain then doesn't have to work
overtime to analyze any situation and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
overtime to analyze any situation and
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.730
overtime to analyze any situation and
the more complex the situation and the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
the more complex the situation and the
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800
the more complex the situation and the
more confusing the more the brain has to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
more confusing the more the brain has to
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.170
more confusing the more the brain has to
work that's why we don't like confusion

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
work that's why we don't like confusion
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670
work that's why we don't like confusion
we want to have simple straightforward

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
we want to have simple straightforward
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340
we want to have simple straightforward
black-and-white answers but that's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
black-and-white answers but that's
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.660
black-and-white answers but that's
probably not gonna happen for anything I

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
probably not gonna happen for anything I
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.030
probably not gonna happen for anything I
don't like the word right and wrong

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
don't like the word right and wrong
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.979
don't like the word right and wrong
because for different people right and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
because for different people right and
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.470
because for different people right and
wrong looks very different I think that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
wrong looks very different I think that
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.059
wrong looks very different I think that
it can be coached in a little bit of a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069
it can be coached in a little bit of a
 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.610
it can be coached in a little bit of a
different way so I like to look at

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
different way so I like to look at
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.819
different way so I like to look at
things that work or they don't work I

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829
things that work or they don't work I
 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.559
things that work or they don't work I
believe that human beings fundamentally

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
believe that human beings fundamentally
 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.679
believe that human beings fundamentally
want life to flourish we love and when

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689
want life to flourish we love and when
 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.780
want life to flourish we love and when
we see life flourish be it a new flower

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
we see life flourish be it a new flower
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.599
we see life flourish be it a new flower
or a tree sprouting in the springtime or

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609
or a tree sprouting in the springtime or
 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.240
or a tree sprouting in the springtime or
any beautiful new thing that we

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
any beautiful new thing that we
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.539
any beautiful new thing that we
experience a new baby it's it's just we

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549
experience a new baby it's it's just we
 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.839
experience a new baby it's it's just we
love it and we have a really positive

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849
love it and we have a really positive
 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.539
love it and we have a really positive
feeling towards when life flourishes so

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549
feeling towards when life flourishes so
 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.690
feeling towards when life flourishes so
right and wrong gets it very much into a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
right and wrong gets it very much into a
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.259
right and wrong gets it very much into a
mental status and we compared to a whole

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
mental status and we compared to a whole
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.420
mental status and we compared to a whole
list of what we think is good for life

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
list of what we think is good for life
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.509
list of what we think is good for life
and what we think is bad for life but

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
and what we think is bad for life but
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.729
and what we think is bad for life but
underlying I think it's much more

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739
underlying I think it's much more
 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.490
underlying I think it's much more
interesting to pay attention to whether

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
interesting to pay attention to whether
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.580
interesting to pay attention to whether
something works to have life flourish or

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
something works to have life flourish or
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.339
something works to have life flourish or
not so if you step on an ant obviously

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349
not so if you step on an ant obviously
 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.080
not so if you step on an ant obviously
that doesn't help very much for life to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
that doesn't help very much for life to
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.149
that doesn't help very much for life to
flourish is it right or wrong to kill a

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159
flourish is it right or wrong to kill a
 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.330
flourish is it right or wrong to kill a
mosquito I don't know you know I mean in

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
mosquito I don't know you know I mean in
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.789
mosquito I don't know you know I mean in
my book it's it works for me so the

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799
my book it's it works for me so the
 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.789
my book it's it works for me so the
mosquito doesn't give me malaria so it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799
mosquito doesn't give me malaria so it
 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.219
mosquito doesn't give me malaria so it
helps my life to flourish but obviously

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229
helps my life to flourish but obviously
 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.289
helps my life to flourish but obviously
it doesn't help the mosquitos life to

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
it doesn't help the mosquitos life to
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.699
it doesn't help the mosquitos life to
flourish so I believe it's much more

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
flourish so I believe it's much more
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.039
flourish so I believe it's much more
valuable to recognize it in terms of

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049
valuable to recognize it in terms of
 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.050
valuable to recognize it in terms of
working and not working rather than

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
working and not working rather than
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.840
working and not working rather than
right and wrong
