You're listening to Radio Lab.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>Radio from WNYC.</v>

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.750
Now for some reason.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.170
<v 2>The speaker phone doesn't ever want to go off.</v>

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.460
Can you guys call me right back and I won't put it on. Okay. All right.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.323
Sorry about that.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.490
<v 3>Hey I'm Jenna Barone. I'm Robert Krulwich This is Radiolab. And today.</v>

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
<v 4>Today we have a story about something that you might not know that you have but</v>

9
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.880
you definitely do have it here.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Sort of a crazy maybe even scary maybe scary even secret a crazy scary secret.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.630
Hello. Hello.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.300
<v 5>Power. Hey sign it comes to us from our producers Tracy hunt. Hey there.</v>

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.970
And Soren Wheeler. Yeah I'm here. OK. No speakerphone. No. OK.

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.930
So this story for us got started with this woman Laura Krieger.

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.230
Well I am a freelance Internet marketer. She's from Colorado.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.700
And in the mid 90s something happened to Laura that hadn't happened to anyone in

17
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.773
centuries.

18
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.910
<v 6>So we'll just want you to take effect in 1996 the day you got your jury summons.</v>

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.860
That very first one.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.390
<v 7>Well that was the day of jury duty I had I had totally forgotten about the jury</v>

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:26.391
summons until the day of and I picked it up and I read the back of the summons

22
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:31.260
and it's just something about six months in jail if you don't show up.

23
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.980
And so I didn't have a ride to the courthouse and so I called the court and

24
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.550
asked them if I really had to show up since I didn't have a ride and they're

25
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.390
like Yeah yeah you have to show up and I said Well I'll have to hitchhike then.

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.990
And if if something happens to me I said to them my blood is on your hands.

27
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.800
I wanted to make them feel guilty about making me show up but that didn't work.

28
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.880
<v 5>She said I had to show up anyway but whatever the point is Laura did get to</v>

29
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.230
court in Guilford County in Colorado.

30
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.920
And when she got there she walked in took a seat.

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.040
<v 7>I think there was about 40 jurors in the pool of jurors and first they fill up</v>

32
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:14.490
the box with 12 jurors and then they ask them questions about themselves.

33
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.980
<v 3>Real quick were you hoping to get booted off.</v>

34
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.770
<v 7>Oh yeah I was hoping to get booted off of course.</v>

35
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.820
Any any good red blooded American was hoping to get towards the end of jury

36
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.110
selection. I was I was one of the last ones to be selected.

37
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.120
<v 8>So the next day Laura and the 11 other jurors showed up to hear the case and the</v>

38
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.230
case was for this 19 year old girl and she was charged with possession of

39
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.310
methamphetamine.

40
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.590
<v 9>What happened was is that she was up in a central city which is a gambling town</v>

41
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.650
and that day she was driving in her van with her boyfriend.

42
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.080
<v 10>And eventually the two of them drove to this casino.</v>

43
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.250
<v 9>Her boyfriend jumped out of the van he went to the casino and then she kept</v>

44
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.230
driving and then the police pulled her over.

45
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.910
<v 5>They just for whatever reason pull her over.</v>

46
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 9>I don't know what she got pulled over for they just pull her over and the police</v>

47
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.310
that she got out and put her purse on the hood of the car and then made a

48
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:09.810
lunging movement towards it which they said give them probable cause to search

49
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:12.760
her purse because now they're thinking oh did she have a weapon in her purse.

50
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.770
<v 8>Like what is she trying to hide.</v>

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 9>And so the police opened up her purse and they start kind of rifling through it</v>

52
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.640
at which they found this one ounce of methamphetamine.

53
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.200
<v 10>And so one of the questions before the jury was is this young woman guilty of</v>

54
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.410
possession of methamphetamine beyond a reasonable doubt.

55
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.720
<v 3>So at the end of the trial Laura and the other 11 jurors got up and went to the</v>

56
00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:34.890
jury room to deliberate.

57
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 9>And so we talked about a lot of things.</v>

58
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.430
One of the things I remember we talked about was whether or not the police were

59
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:45.690
lying about you know her lunging towards her purse and things like that.

60
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.460
<v 11>There is also the fact that she did have this map but it was unclear whether it</v>

61
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:51.870
was actually hers or not.

62
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 12>Because according to the girl when her boyfriend got out of the van he put</v>

63
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:56.790
something in her purse.

64
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.450
<v 8>She said without her knowledge this girl saying the meth might be his.</v>

65
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.550
But it's definitely not hers.

66
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.920
<v 13>I mean to me that's the whole thing.</v>

67
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.150
It's it's an element no one of the possession charges that they have to

68
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:10.260
knowingly possess.

69
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.030
<v 12>So for Laura if she said she didn't know she had it and it could be her</v>

70
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:16.900
boyfriend then she's not guilty.

71
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.830
<v 14>It seems to her that it was just like a pretty big hole in the prosecution's</v>

72
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:25.710
case. I mean to me I just couldn't get beyond that.

73
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.120
<v 9>And so Laura turned to the other jurors and I said to him I was like Well isn't</v>

74
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:33.480
that enough reasonable doubt for you to a quitter.

75
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.160
And they were all like No she had it in her purse she knew it was there.

76
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.190
It's almost five o'clock. We need to convict her and go home.

77
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.350
<v 15>But Laura wouldn't budge. She just couldn't get herself to go along.</v>

78
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.240
And so she held out.

79
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.750
And that night when she went home she just kept turning this case over and over

80
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:55.860
in her mind.

81
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.090
<v 12>And she started wondering what the girl was looking at as far as a sentence.</v>

82
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.030
Right. But that's not technically what a jury is supposed to do.

83
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.310
No not like the judge in this case.

84
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.430
And generally the judge had told them you know like I'm the one that gets to

85
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.920
decide the sentence. You don't have to worry about the sentence here.

86
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.010
<v 13>You just have to find out whether she's guilty or not guilty.</v>

87
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.140
But I was worried about the sentence.

88
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.250
You know you have this when you're a juror you have somebody who's liberty in

89
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:28.690
your hand. And so Laura sat down on her computer she got online.

90
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.270
<v 11>And she found this criminal statute.</v>

91
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.070
And to her understanding this girl was looking at two to six years and she's

92
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:38.470
like that it just feels so out of.

93
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.430
<v 12>Whack. That doesn't feel right. Also it's a felony charge.</v>

94
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.990
<v 9>You know you can't arrest that.</v>

95
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.270
So the second day of deliberations you know we just went back and forth where

96
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.930
the police lie. Yes. We think the police are lying is that reasonable doubt.

97
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.510
No it's not reasonable doubt.

98
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.540
<v 2>After all my arguments about reasonable doubt were exhausted.</v>

99
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.920
<v 3>That's when Laura turned to the other jurors and tried this completely different</v>

100
00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:03.754
tactic.

101
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.230
She looked at him and she was like Look even if you think she's guilty.

102
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.520
<v 16>We didn't have to convict her for any reason that we could let her go.</v>

103
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.180
<v 15>But even if she broke the law we could say we don't agree with the law.</v>

104
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.070
<v 16>You know we're here we're here to be the conscience of the community.</v>

105
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.220
That's what I told them. You don't have to convict her.

106
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.510
<v 3>But wait that seems like I can I would imagine some people might be like What</v>

107
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:31.840
are you talking about of course we do we're supposed to just say whether she

108
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:34.090
broke the law or not. That's what a jury does.

109
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.700
<v 16>Right. Right. Well that's where everything broke down.</v>

110
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.620
<v 6>Because as it turns out when Laura started making this argument a whole series</v>

111
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:48.550
of events set into motion one of the jurors apparently they wrote a note saying

112
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.770
Laura's in here she's talking about sentences.

113
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.990
She's saying that she's only going to acquit this girl.

114
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.970
<v 9>That note got sent to the judge.</v>

115
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.710
<v 17>And apparently the judge</v>

116
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.100
exploded and called us all back in and declared a mistrial.

117
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.320
<v 18>And then about a month later the sheriff showed up at my house with a summons</v>

118
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.580
for contempt of court.

119
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.660
<v 19>Paul Grant represented Colorado juror Laura Craig home.</v>

120
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.630
And suddenly Laura's story caught fire after she refused to convict a young

121
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:18.250
woman in a drug case last year.

122
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.600
<v 18>I was the first juror in for 100 years that I was actually punished for their</v>

123
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:24.230
verdict. Prosecutor really.

124
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.140
<v 19>Well actually to end her 26 years.</v>

125
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.010
The point is when Laura told those other jurors they could essentially ignore

126
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:33.520
the law but they could disregard the facts if they disagreed with the law.

127
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.550
She had tiptoed what you're about to see is going to infuriate a lot of you in

128
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.340
to this very bizarre.

129
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.360
A lone juror tosses out the law almost like a loophole a legal loophole of some

130
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:46.840
kind.

131
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.840
I think it's absolutely appalling that on some sides people see as a trap door

132
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.770
to anarchy and on other sides people see it as like.

133
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.110
<v 20>One of the foundational bedrocks of what it means to be in a democracy.</v>

134
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.520
<v 21>It is something called jury nullification jury nullification.</v>

135
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.640
<v 0>I have to say the first time I heard about jury nullification I googled it and</v>

136
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.400
the first thing that came up was this YouTube video.

137
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.810
There was like a little explainer thing with an animation and I think it was

138
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.830
like the first thing that was said on the front and kind of frozen screen of the

139
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:31.600
YouTube video was you can get arrested for talking about this really.

140
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.650
<v 3>And I was like oh OK I'm hitting play on that. OK let's go.</v>

141
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.960
You can get arrested for talking about this.

142
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.960
<v 22>Yeah well that ends up being sort of true</v>

143
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.470
but also sort of not. Which is what makes it a loophole. Thank you. Yeah.

144
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.363
Just this way.

145
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.180
<v 3>Anyway as we dug into it we figured you know we're gonna need some help</v>

146
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.470
understanding this thing.

147
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.110
So I was thinking that would start with a little bit just you know kind of what

148
00:08:56.111 --> 00:08:57.620
jury nullification is. Yeah.

149
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.030
So we called up our favorite legal expert right Ellie missile and I am an editor

150
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:07.630
of Above the Law and the legal editor of More perfect on WNYC more perfect.

151
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.380
What is that. That sounds amazing. What does that. Well you know what.

152
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.940
It's not worth mentioning anyway. No but seriously.

153
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.960
Season to Season Two is coming anyway when we were talking to Ellie the first

154
00:09:19.961 --> 00:09:24.961
thing that we asked him was you know like just give us a pure uncut version of

155
00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.164
jury nullification.

156
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:26.590
<v 23>OK.</v>

157
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.590
So a pure aspect of jury nullification would be let's say I am the defendant I

158
00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:37.141
am accused of stealing a car I absolutely stole that car everybody saw they had

159
00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:38.230
me dead to rights.

160
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.770
All you have to have me on video my momma said he's thought it over his DNA is

161
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.920
in my DNA is in the car but I stole the car because my kid was sick and I needed

162
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.450
to get to the hospital to take him to the hospital. I had no other option.

163
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.050
And so I smashed the windows of somebody else's car. I hotwired it.

164
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.040
I put my car in the back.

165
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.450
I drove to the House will save to save my save my kid's life.

166
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.180
Now I'm up for child from the you know the guy who has the Audi that I live in

167
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.510
West Chester. The guy who has the alley is like he stole my car. Which is true.

168
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.820
I demand justice. Yeah.

169
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.130
And the jury says yeah no no we're just gonna let the jury would nullify that

170
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:21.231
clear that clear illegality that clear crime that I committed.

171
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480
<v 20>So it's like yes he took the car but the law the way it's written doesn't</v>

172
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:31.410
account for the fact that in this particular case that's OK with us. Right.

173
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.620
<v 24>So that's that's kind of the pure version of it and that's kind of the most kind</v>

174
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:41.730
of happy clappy. That's a very happy version. Yeah. Version of it. Right.

175
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.130
I could've stolen Justin Bieber's car.

176
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.740
I probably couldn't get convicted in a court for that.

177
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.800
<v 3>Nobody likes him. Nobody likes him. Right.</v>

178
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.940
So they could be saying the law is not nuanced enough.

179
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.220
They could be saying the punishment is off.

180
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.080
They could be saying in this case the supporters victim sort of deserved it or

181
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:01.830
they could be saying we disagree with this. All right. OK. Wait.

182
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.050
It's something I understand it's like so.

183
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.460
So here we have a situation where Laura says she doesn't agree with a sentence

184
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.450
like does she or any of the other jurors have like a right to do this.

185
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.570
Is there is there like something written in the Constitution that says they can

186
00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:17.050
do that.

187
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.970
<v 23>No there's nothing in the Constitution that that directly explicitly says yes</v>

188
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.630
you have the right to completely ignore the law and let off whoever you want to

189
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.700
if you feel like it. That's not a constitutional right. OK.

190
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.340
But it's not exactly a crime because Ellie says a jury is told to do what they

191
00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:38.341
think is best if they think their best is nullifying a law that's also not

192
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.870
exactly illegal which just to get back to Laura for a second is why the court

193
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.570
never actually charged her for jury nullification.

194
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.040
<v 10>Instead they found her guilty for not answering questions directly during the</v>

195
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:52.310
jury questioning process.

196
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.290
<v 3>But eventually that conviction was overturned on appeal because in general the</v>

197
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.520
things that are said in a jury room are protected. They're private. Yeah.

198
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.050
<v 23>So it's not a right. It's not a crime. What it is is a power.</v>

199
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.730
And so I think of it kind of like. A monster like. The X-Men.

200
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.520
3. So.

201
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.400
Wolverines power. Is he can he can he can detach.

202
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.480
<v 25>Steel adamantium claws from his hands.</v>

203
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.760
That's just a fact of Wolverine's life. He just. He has the ability to do this.

204
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.290
It's his power.

205
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.943
<v 23>Now.</v>

206
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.170
Is it a right for him to have claws shooting out of his hands.

207
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.820
No absolutely not.

208
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.440
Is it illegal for him to have claws shooting out of his hands. Well not really.

209
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.800
It's illegal for him to use them in certain ways. Right.

210
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.610
So Wolverine comes into your house and scratches you on the face that's assault.

211
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.640
We have a law against US law proscribing assault but Wolverine has the power to

212
00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:04.440
just walk around as he is with these claws in his hands.

213
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.650
It's built into the nature of his being.

214
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.780
<v 3>Mm hmm. Real quick to the people who care about superhero powers.</v>

215
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.150
We know that Wolverine's powers actually the ability to heal.

216
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.140
But Ellie's point still holds. Wait a second. This is throwing me off a bit.

217
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.020
So the jury like the claws.

218
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.120
So the jury has this claw like power or whatever but they know they're not

219
00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:24.930
allowed to use it.

220
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.670
I mean his simple point is that jury nullification is as fundamental to juries

221
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.590
as having claws is to Wolverine. That's just a fact of their existence.

222
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.260
But they still get in trouble if they use it lauded.

223
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.450
But then how did we end up in this weird place where you can do it.

224
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.430
You don't have the right to do it but you can do it.

225
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.510
But if you do it or even talk about it you might get in trouble.

226
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.080
That's certainly glad I'm super glad you asked that question because it gives me

227
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:52.620
a chance.

228
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.620
Hey Matt are you back there can you cue some like English John to seventeen

229
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.700
hundreds type music coming right up.

230
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.180
<v 8>All right now we're in the mood. All right. Explain. Yeah.</v>

231
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.130
<v 26>So I ended up finding this guy Jeffrey Abramson Professor of Law and Government</v>

232
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.990
at the University of Texas at Austin.

233
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.580
<v 6>And Jeffrey told me it all has to do with the sort of battle over who has the</v>

234
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:17.400
power to decide what the law is.

235
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.080
<v 26>And he says the opening shots of that battle go all the way back to the William</v>

236
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:26.490
Penn trial and 16 17 which is really the birth of religious liberty.

237
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.950
I guess you can also accuse him sounds of horses on cobblestone streets and to

238
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:34.470
do that just do it just do the horses.

239
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.330
<v 8>So much better. Thank you. OK.</v>

240
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.750
So in 60 and 70 London England we've got a guy William Penn William Penn.

241
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.130
<v 27>Time was a young man.</v>

242
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.600
He was a Quaker and one day he's walking through the streets of London to hold a

243
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.120
prayer meeting in Grace Church meeting Chapel.

244
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.950
He walks up to the chapel door but.

245
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.460
He finds it locked by the authorities.

246
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.380
And the reason the doors were locked was because there was actually this century

247
00:15:01.381 --> 00:15:05.370
old law on the books that made it a crime to essentially to be a Quaker.

248
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.730
But what Penn does say. That.

249
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.140
<v 3>OK. One for both of you and to hear you gather round gather Romeos.</v>

250
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.770
<v 28>Penn starts calling everybody together in the street. Boys gather round.</v>

251
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.420
And as more and more people stick together as a large throng like three or four

252
00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:26.670
hundred people show up. Come on come on. And so.

253
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.490
The authorities seize the occasion

254
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.630
to arrest him for a breach of the peace.

255
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.440
Take your hands off of him. And eventually.

256
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.090
<v 15>And get thrown in jail and he gets a jury trial.</v>

257
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.380
<v 29>The indictment is as follows that William Penn of London.</v>

258
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.500
<v 27>Now the government.</v>

259
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.360
McCain was pretty much just charging Penn for being a Quaker.

260
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.650
But the authorities thought they could go underneath the table and just

261
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:03.910
prosecute him for what was the common law crime of breach of the peace.

262
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.890
<v 29>Are you guilty as you stand indicted a matter and form as far as I said or not</v>

263
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:13.891
guilty I plead not guilty and matter and form and the case is pretty open and

264
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:14.590
shut.

265
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.740
<v 30>I mean he gathered hundreds of people in the middle of the street according to</v>

266
00:16:17.741 --> 00:16:22.330
law and the evidence he's guilty but his defense is.

267
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.760
<v 26>Show me what law in England makes it a crime to worship God in my own way</v>

268
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.540
so the jury went off to the jury room.

269
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.570
<v 30>But the jurors come back several times and say we cannot agree.</v>

270
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.860
<v 3>What was their hang up. Well I don't know how.</v>

271
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.360
Inside the heads of those people you can get.

272
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.430
But it seems like they just didn't feel like locking him up for that was the

273
00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.940
right thing to do. Even though it was technically against the law.

274
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.750
<v 10>Right.</v>

275
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.750
<v 30>And so the judge says that the jurors I am telling you that if the evidence</v>

276
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:58.791
shows that Penn preached to a throng on a public thoroughfare and he clearly did

277
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.610
you have to find him guilty of the crime of breach of the peace and then the

278
00:17:05.611 --> 00:17:10.611
judge locked him up in the jury room without food tobacco or rest facilities for

279
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:13.050
a quote considerable amount of time.

280
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.490
<v 15>End quote. And then finally they come back and acquit him.</v>

281
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.210
The judge accepts the acquittal and then orders the jurors to jail for perjury

282
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.070
put the whole jury in jail. Yeah they get locked up.

283
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.220
But there's one guy in the jury he's like This is not cool.

284
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.350
So that guy ends up filing an appeal.

285
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.800
<v 30>It went to the highest courts in the realm all the way to the king's court and</v>

286
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:39.801
the chief justice ruled that it henceforth would be illegal to prosecute jurors

287
00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:43.020
for a not guilty verdict.

288
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.830
<v 31>So this becomes the start of during a vacation.</v>

289
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.300
<v 32>And what it really was was the birth of this kind of bubble.</v>

290
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.330
This protected space called the jury room that you can't punish anybody for what

291
00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:01.040
they do in the jury room.

292
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.220
<v 33>So that notion crosses the Atlantic Ocean and becomes a part of the American</v>

293
00:18:06.651 --> 00:18:11.150
tradition of loss that when the colonies are coming up they have trial by jury

294
00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:15.170
and they have juries and smart people are writing things about how the jury is

295
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:20.120
the place where the people get to decide what happens and we have to protect

296
00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:20.450
that.

297
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.770
<v 34>You can't punish them for what they do and so you get people like Adams and</v>

298
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.550
Jefferson making grand arguments about the role of the jury.

299
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.660
<v 3>And actually Jeffrey says one of the things that we get from a jury is freedom</v>

300
00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:36.110
of the press when the seventeen hundreds this newspaper guy in New York that

301
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.880
supposedly libeled the king or the crown and to the jury in that case it was

302
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.240
pretty clear that he did.

303
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.670
But they decide that the law itself is unjust and boom there you go.

304
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.773
From the press.

305
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.840
<v 32>So this idea is sort of baked into our nation's beginning of trusting ordinary</v>

306
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.260
people to do the work of justice themselves.

307
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.960
<v 3>I mean ordinary people being white men at the time.</v>

308
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.070
<v 6>But then in the mid 80s hundreds. That starts to change because of two things.</v>

309
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.270
One more and more laws are being written and they're just more complex and

310
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:10.310
complicated. And it is harder for people understand.

311
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.900
Number two the legal world is becoming way more professional more people are

312
00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:18.740
getting legal training even judges who before it didn't have to necessarily have

313
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:21.650
legal training to become a judge. They're getting legal training.

314
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.970
And so and so now judges are seen as the experts in the law.

315
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.680
And then what happens is that you see more and more judges sort of take back the

316
00:19:30.681 --> 00:19:33.030
power to decide what the law is from the jury.

317
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:38.170
<v 30>And the United States Supreme Court made clear in a decision in 1895 that juries</v>

318
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:44.110
had no responsibility for deciding whether to enforce the law.

319
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.390
Question number one or what the law properly interpreted was question number

320
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.620
two.

321
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.920
And from this you get the sort of judge's instructions that are given to the

322
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:59.780
jury and we still have this sort of instruction today that ladies and gentlemen

323
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:04.370
of the jury the case is now upon you. It is your job to find the facts.

324
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.520
But it is my job to instruct you on the law.

325
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.070
<v 35>Now if they didn't it wasn't exactly that jury nullification became illegal and</v>

326
00:20:13.071 --> 00:20:18.071
more like just the court kind of pushed it down made it sort of unspoken thing.

327
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.060
And over the next 100 years or so it does.

328
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:28.180
I mean certainly there's times when jurors sort of refuse to convict the famous

329
00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:32.420
cases are like during prohibition and some arguments during the Civil Rights

330
00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:33.950
Movement and the Vietnam War.

331
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.960
But really the explicit idea of jury nullification the idea that this is really

332
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.890
a role for the jury stays mostly underground until.

333
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.790
<v 36>The claws come out. That's after the break.</v>

334
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.903

<v 38>Our country continues to grapple with the deep cultural divisions exposed by the</v>

341
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:38.880
2016 elections.

342
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.140
We felt hope there is some palpable change in how people are looking at us.

343
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.200
Well maybe we are looking at people.

344
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.210
WNYC is talking to a broad range of Americans about how we arrived at this

345
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:52.800
moment in our political culture.

346
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.220
I'm Kai Wright subscribe to the United States of anxiety culture wars from WNYC

Jad Robert Radiolab.

349
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.400
<v 3>So we're talking about jury nullification which is the power of juries to</v>

350
00:22:10.401 --> 00:22:12.170
perhaps ignore the law.

351
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.880
Tracy hunt and Susan Wheeler are reporters and you guys are saying it was

352
00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:20.570
underground for a while. Yeah and then what happened in the 90s happened.

353
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.953
Page. No.

354
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.160
<v 39>No. There was a perfect storm of two events both here in California.</v>

355
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.210
<v 27>First you have the Rodney King trial where you have this videotape.</v>

356
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.230
<v 11>We've all seen the pictures of Los Angeles police officers beating a man they</v>

357
00:22:39.231 --> 00:22:44.231
had just pulled over in this video you see Rodney King he's on the ground and

358
00:22:44.811 --> 00:22:48.890
police are surrounding him and they're kicking him and beating him with batons

359
00:22:48.891 --> 00:22:53.240
repeatedly showing to most reasonable observers that there was severe police

360
00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:58.241
brutality against an unarmed black man for Los Angeles police officers charged

361
00:22:59.091 --> 00:23:01.940
in the initially the trial was supposed to be held in Los Angeles.

362
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.080
<v 30>But because of concerns about media exposure they got moved to neighboring</v>

363
00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:09.110
Ventura County where the jury is almost all white.

364
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.320
<v 10>And after a months long trial and weeks of jury deliberations majority in the</v>

365
00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:18.730
Rodney King case has delivered its verdict and again to the California and

366
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.740
acquittal they acquit the officers not one of the four police officers seen on

367
00:23:24.171 --> 00:23:26.180
videotape beating Mr. King a year ago.

368
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.690
<v 40>He is guilty of using excessive force. They've all been found not guilty.</v>

369
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.600
And of course they are know like what happened in L.A. after that.

370
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.040
<v 41>Five days of riots and we've seen rocks and bottles and various things go a car</v>

371
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.310
schoolboy then 60 people were killed. He was bleeding unconscious in the street.

372
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.170
You can see a white plume of smoke.

373
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.210
There was about a billion dollars worth of damages.

374
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.870
There are several other plumes just like that in this area.

375
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.190
<v 8>I must say I'm scared of what we all saw what happened.</v>

376
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.520
And it looks very much to African-Americans in Los Angeles that these white

377
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:05.561
people in Simi Valley California had voted race rather than evidence to acquit.

378
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.850
<v 42>I'm 43 years old.</v>

379
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.750
I have witnessed this for 43 years of my life.

380
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.620
The injustice I cannot even convey to you the heart.

381
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.900
<v 35>So according to Jeffrey that was round one and then just three years later OK.</v>

382
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:27.810
<v 26>It's a white white car you get round to believe that this is the police.</v>

383
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.190
Trust me. OJ Simpson ready to go white Ford Bronco.

384
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.360
<v 43>There you see the police the media the OJ Simpson truck guy with charges laid by</v>

385
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:35.631
L.A.

386
00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:39.350
police against OJ Simpson in connection with the brutal slaying of his ex-wife

387
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.300
Nicole and 25 year old Ron gold.

388
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.210
<v 26>There is massive blood and bloody footprints.</v>

389
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:49.270
One of the bloody gloves massive DNA evidence blood drops leading up to and

390
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:54.210
inside the house in his bedroom. And yet a predominantly black jury.

391
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.550
<v 44>We the jury in the above entitled action find the defendant or job Orenthal</v>

392
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:01.480
James Simpson not guilty of the crime of murder. Acquit.

393
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.250
When you heard the verdict can we can we ask your reaction.

394
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.580
<v 3>So while many black people thought that a white jury ignored the law in the</v>

395
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:13.130
Rodney King case was shot.

396
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.120
Now many white people felt that a largely black jury.

397
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.840
<v 45>I think it's absolutely appalling it gives me no faith in the jury system</v>

398
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:21.674
whatsoever.

399
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.090
<v 11>And then the same thing in acquitting OJ is guilty.</v>

400
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:29.380
<v 20>Now he's claiming he got out because the jury was mainly black and according to</v>

401
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:34.850
Jeffrey these two cases together they've sparked a national conversation about

402
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.940
jury nullification.

403
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.140
<v 30>The day after the OJ Simpson verdict The Wall Street Journal around a first page</v>

404
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:47.201
story essentially arguing that in inner cities throughout the country black

405
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:52.460
jurors were remarkably acquittal prone.

406
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.210
<v 3>In other words according to the article there was a spike in acquittals among</v>

407
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:59.690
black jurors in cases where the defendant was also black.

408
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.520
<v 30>And the most likely explanation is a kind of jury revolt.</v>

409
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.200
<v 3>Now Jeffrey actually argues that this idea of a jury revolt was overstated in</v>

410
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:12.590
part because he says you can never really know if a jury is actually ignoring

411
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:13.424
the law.

412
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.490
<v 46>But sometimes we as prosecutors would persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</v>

413
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.670
But the jurors would still find him not guilty.

414
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.090
<v 3>Georgetown law professor Paul Butler who was a prosecutor in D.C.</v>

415
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:28.460
at the time says that's exactly what was happening.

416
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.160
<v 46>Did that feel wrong to you. It did.</v>

417
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.350
You know it felt wrong personally because you know like every prosecutor I want

418
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.860
another notch on my belt so yeah ticked me off.

419
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:45.170
But the reason they were doing this is because they didn't want to send another

420
00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:50.171
young black man to jail which Paul says was mostly what his job was.

421
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.700
If you go to criminal court in D.C.

422
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.250
you would think that white people don't commit crimes.

423
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.910
They're just utterly absent from the criminal court.

424
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.020
And obviously that's not a reflection of the real world.

425
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.360
And over the years day to day locking up black people it takes a psychic toll.

426
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.920
Paul says he started to ask himself did I go to law school or put black people

427
00:27:12.921 --> 00:27:16.790
in prison. And for me the answer became No.

428
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:22.090
<v 21>Well now a black law professor is urging black juries to use nullification in</v>

429
00:27:22.431 --> 00:27:23.910
their fight for racial justice.

430
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:28.340
<v 46>That led me to not only understand what these African-American jurors were doing</v>

431
00:27:28.341 --> 00:27:31.870
in D.C. but in cases of non-violent crimes to endorse.

432
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:36.350
<v 47>If you let a guilty defendant off isn't that the same as really taking the law</v>

433
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.610
into your own hands.

434
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.320
It absolutely is the same as taking the law into your own hands as a political

435
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.513
protest.

436
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.223
<v 48>Responded.</v>

437
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.080
<v 49>So yeah I mean that one sort of seems to grow directly out of the racial mix of</v>

438
00:27:56.381 --> 00:27:59.710
things that were going on in both Rodney King and in the OJ case.

439
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.220
<v 3>But as this was all bubbling up there is a group called the fully informed</v>

440
00:28:03.221 --> 00:28:08.110
jurors association that started actually in this tiny butthole of a town in

441
00:28:08.111 --> 00:28:12.250
Montana with these like super libertarian you could say that because you are

442
00:28:12.251 --> 00:28:16.810
from Montana. Yes Jack I am from Montana. I am allowed to say that.

443
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.880
And they started this group that was that was basically advocating for jury

444
00:28:21.881 --> 00:28:26.881
nullification writing up pamphlets you know sending out things eventually the

445
00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:30.480
internet comes along and attention to during nullification just can't.

446
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.120
<v 33>There's cleansing jurors in Atlanta in the mid 1990s started acquitting sports</v>

447
00:28:37.121 --> 00:28:41.590
like bookmaker people defendants on a regular basis even though like in the past

448
00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:43.930
those cases it's been seen as slam dunks.

449
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.250
And in the post trial interviews jurors were saying that they saw the reason was

450
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.130
they saw no moral difference between betting on sports and playing like the

451
00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:52.060
Georgia Lottery.

452
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.710
By the time you get medical marijuana initiatives and around 1996 all sudden

453
00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.300
it's become much much more difficult for prosecutors to convince juries convict

454
00:29:01.301 --> 00:29:02.620
in marijuana cases.

455
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.910
And so prosecutors are deciding not even to file charges in those cases it comes

456
00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.040
up in gun rape cases. During that time.

457
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.910
<v 3>So you have like this spasm of interest largely because of these two kinds of</v>

458
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:17.500
race related trials and then suddenly you have it kind of spreading sort of in

459
00:29:17.501 --> 00:29:18.334
all these different places.

460
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.130
GROSS Yeah but you do rose and in fact today what you're seeing is this kind of

461
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.580
raising activism warning would you like a brochure which goes.

462
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.820
<v 8>Around getting the word out about jury nullification pressure because jurors</v>

463
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.230
worry where would you like a brochure about you do a lot of this is happening at

464
00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:40.060
courthouses all across the United States in Philadelphia in Florida just say

465
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.670
your name and who you are what you let you do.

466
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.480
<v 50>We actually sent a reporter to Denver to talk to this guy.</v>

467
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.090
<v 51>Yeah yeah. Sheriff my name is Mark Yano Charlie.</v>

468
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.260
You spell that last name I a N N I C E L L I.

469
00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:01.130
I am an activist for jury nullification three days a week.

470
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.300
<v 8>Very cold very hot rain or shine Mark would show up at the courthouse and here's</v>

471
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.740
some other people were out here talking about. CARY Right.

472
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.020
And they would just stand near the steps of the court and hand out these

473
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.410
pamphlets that basically say that because you're right as a juror to the not

474
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.680
guilty if it's a bad law designed by bad politicians you know you have the right

475
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:26.590
to vote your conscience juries is there to represent the conscience of the

476
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.280
community.

477
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.660
<v 50>You have the right to judge the law.</v>

478
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.140
<v 52>You could vote not guilty and not tell anybody.</v>

479
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.160
And as you're right it's perfectly legal. And that's how you get rid of bad law.

480
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.850
And these people various sorts of various sorts.

481
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.590
<v 8>You'll get the kind of guns rights people you get the libertarians out west with</v>

482
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.080
Occupy Denver you get like occupiers like Mark can you make it sound like a

483
00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:52.840
racial justice people who think there are too many brown people in jail.

484
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.720
So jury nullification is a very big tent.

485
00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.880
See there's a there's a there's a prosecutor to see who's got the LV tote bag.

486
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.430
<v 53>Which is really like a brochure about a jury.</v>

487
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.820
<v 54>But then the thing is here's where we get to the getting in trouble hard guys</v>

488
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:10.780
like Mark we got arrested here who hand out these pamphlets in front of

489
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:12.730
courthouses. They sometimes get arrested.

490
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.750
<v 52>We will distribute the information.</v>

491
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.480
They came though and they got several videos right here for the fully informed

492
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:23.140
Jury Association and we were handing them out to everybody.

493
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.400
I got arrested for Southern clothes.

494
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.580
So he's looking good 21 years in prison under what grounds.

495
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.510
<v 3>Jury tampering almost always jury hampering yeah huh.</v>

496
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.150
But no one ever says no once again recantation is they can't go because

497
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:37.984
obviously it's not.

498
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.990
And so they get usually they get arrested for for jury tampering but then these

499
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:47.200
cases will go and they'll get appealed and eventually I don't think we've found

500
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:51.790
a case where this isn't true every single case the price the charges will get

501
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:53.740
thrown out because it's free speech.

502
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.950
We are now in a First Amendment free speech of war.

503
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.490
Okay. Julian can you hear us. Yeah up here. Okay. This is Julian heckling.

504
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:14.180
He became a kind of a jury nullification activist hero of sorts when he was

505
00:32:14.181 --> 00:32:18.500
arrested in 2010 at the federal district court here in Manhattan.

506
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.880
<v 50>Well I made nine appearances at this courthouse and was arrested five times and</v>

507
00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:27.110
he was about 78 years old at this point and he was just handing out flyers.

508
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:31.790
Yeah. Yeah. Do you have like a desk or like a table set up or you know any man.

509
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.880
<v 55>I stand up I have a sign that says jury information and I just as I got a bit go</v>

510
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.600
by. I just pass out this one page flyer.

511
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.120
<v 50>Do people come up to you when they see jury information like are there some do.</v>

512
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.790
<v 55>Yeah I do more of them run away.</v>

513
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.400
<v 10>And he just show up at courthouses like all over the place like in New Jersey</v>

514
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.790
and Pennsylvania and like in Philadelphia and and in Florida.

515
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.640
<v 3>And actually when we talked to him he was in Orlando staying with his friend</v>

516
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.940
Mark and they were heading down to the local courthouse the following Monday to

517
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:05.240
urge people to nullify laws they don't agree with basically because they see

518
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:09.620
nullification as a kind of a check on en times when the government or a law goes

519
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.060
in their view too far.

520
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.230
<v 55>We have many cases like this that have shown it when the slaves when the slaves</v>

521
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:17.450
were escaping from the south and going up north.

522
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.760
People were running them up into Canada and they were told that they had to

523
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:26.540
return home after all the slaves were property what they were guilty of was

524
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:29.030
theft when they didn't return these slaves.

525
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:33.740
<v 3>This is probably the most famous example of jury nullification cases where</v>

526
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.280
northern jurors even though they knew someone had harbored a slave and was

527
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:40.190
therefore guilty they would just refuse to convict.

528
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.090
<v 55>They didn't do it.</v>

529
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.470
That's how the that's actually the most important during nullification case that

530
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:49.030
this country probably ever had because they just let the slaves they just set

531
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.450
them up to Canada they were just violating the law. Out.

532
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.040
That's the point of having a jury.

533
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.810
In fact Thomas Jefferson made the statement The only thing that will save this

534
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:00.950
country is the jury.

535
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.900
<v 3>The only thing</v>

536
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:08.790
hey by the way if you need to stop and take a drink of water don't don't

537
00:34:08.791 --> 00:34:09.330
hesitate.

538
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.070
<v 55>I need to stop and cry a little.</v>

539
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:12.683
<v 56>Mm hmm.</v>

540
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.430
<v 55>Because anyway let's go and you don't mind if I cry while we talk about this.</v>

541
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.080
Just touches me pretty much.

542
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.570
<v 3>I mean what is it. I don't.</v>

543
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.420
<v 20>I of course I don't mind if you cry I got some curious what what is it that's</v>

544
00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:27.290
hitting you in that emotional

545
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.350
I'm sorry I think about these cases that I just can't believe what's happened to

546
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:34.184
this country.

547
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.930
<v 55>I can't believe how corrupt this country has become.</v>

548
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.350
<v 3>And you're seeing that corruption in people being locked away put away for</v>

549
00:34:44.351 --> 00:34:47.740
things they shouldn't be put away for for drugs for example.

550
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.480
<v 55>Do you know that we now are the number one prison state in the world.</v>

551
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.780
We have the highest percentage of prisoners in any country in the world.

552
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.010
That's the United States of America and of course a lot.

553
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.560
But look at the people 40 percent of the people are in there for drug

554
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:03.394
violations.

555
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.570
Why does the government have any right to tell you what you can do with your

556
00:35:07.571 --> 00:35:10.360
body. It's the same thing for prostitution.

557
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.650
Why should the government be able to tell you whether you can have sex or

558
00:35:14.651 --> 00:35:18.580
whether you can't have sex or why you can smoke a cigarette or why you can't

559
00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:19.510
smoke a cigarette.

560
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.020
Now I understand why the government tells you you can't shoot somebody else.

561
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.850
To me that makes sense.

562
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.290
But if you want to shoot yourself that's your business anyway.

563
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.490
And I'll tell you something.

564
00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.840
We're going to the courts even though to pass out this literature and Monday in

565
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:35.440
Orlando.

566
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.440
That's why I'm down here and I met in contact with the judge and he's been in

567
00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:43.840
contact with me and he's informed me that if I show up I'll be arrested.

568
00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.520
What is the case in North and probably have 50 or 100 people hug.

569
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.580
<v 50>I hope along with me Jillian and you're going to be.</v>

570
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.040
Is that what you're doing at the courthouse.

571
00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.480
You're going to be passing out the jury pamphlets.

572
00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.760
<v 55>That's exactly right. And the judge has promised us that we'll be arrested.</v>

573
00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:02.970
He said he he.

574
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.510
I'm asking all my people to come with guns and shoot the cops that come after

575
00:36:07.511 --> 00:36:08.344
us.

576
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.980
<v 3>You're not serious about that are you. I am serious.</v>

577
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.730
Well I mean not that that would be the thing that you just said you understand

578
00:36:15.731 --> 00:36:17.500
why the government would stop someone first.

579
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.190
<v 55>I mean that that crosses a line and right issue there comes a time when you've</v>

580
00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:25.960
got to stop it. And I think that time as much as December 5th

581
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:28.790
it's got to be ended.

582
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:34.040
You've got to start killing the police and the guards and hopefully the judges

583
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.090
until they learn how to behave well. But that's not justice either.

584
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.580
The point is we've tried now for years.

585
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.560
It doesn't seem to sink into them that it's their job to uphold the law not to

586
00:36:45.561 --> 00:36:48.830
keep throwing people in prison for 70 years I've been doing this.

587
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.970
And this is the first time it ever occurred to me that I would ever have to do

588
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.450
such a thing. But I can't help it.

589
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.720
I have a hard time no reason why you will be arrested and taken away.

590
00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.510
And if they're going to try and do it I want them killed.

591
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.640
<v 3>But you realize symbol I have a hard time believing that you believe that that</v>

592
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.450
deserves killing. Court clerk who has a job.

593
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.880
<v 55>How do you know to arrest me.</v>

594
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.240
They've been warned that I've sent them the letter.

595
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.760
I've told them anybody that comes within 15 feet of me.

596
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.790
That's an officer of the court or an appointee of the court that they're to be

597
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:28.050
removed one way or the other.

598
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.540
I've come to the conclusion that it has to be ended.

599
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.040
Well I think that if you're in I should see that it's ended on December 5th

600
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.650
I put up with it anymore.

601
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:43.600
<v 3>I think that if you're in a position of considering doing what you've just said</v>

602
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.050
you're considering doing that.

603
00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.940
Then my dad isn't gonna do anything.

604
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.100
<v 55>It's only if they do something. Well OK.</v>

605
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.970
No matter what we have to do it's not gonna happen again.

606
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:59.560
<v 3>Julian I'm going to interrupt you there and just say you know I think I think</v>

607
00:37:59.561 --> 00:38:03.850
we're probably best off just ending the conversation and letting our microphone

608
00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:06.970
person go home and letting me anyway letting you heard my opinion.

609
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.280
<v 55>It's not only my opinion it's my intention.</v>

610
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:14.320
<v 57>Yeah. We hear you. We got it. OK. Thank you very much for having me.</v>

611
00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.620
OK thank you. OK.

612
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:17.943
<v 58>Bye bye.</v>

613
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.750
<v 59>Holy. Oh my God. I you have the tape sinkers No.</v>

614
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.520
Yes I do. You want to just give me give them. Yeah.

615
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.500
When I talk to them you never said anything.

616
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.990
<v 60>Well yeah. What happened after that interview or the tail end of that interview.</v>

617
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.260
So after we hung up we felt we had an obligation to call law enforcement down

618
00:38:55.051 --> 00:38:59.040
there because he it sounded very much like he was making a direct threat with a

619
00:38:59.041 --> 00:38:59.880
time and a place.

620
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.060
And so that Monday he and his friend Mark did show up.

621
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.430
Neither of them were armed.

622
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.000
Neither him or mark any of the other people he'd been wanting to show up.

623
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.670
No it was just them. Nobody else showed up.

624
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.860
<v 61>And the police say that somebody who works at the court and told him that he had</v>

625
00:39:16.861 --> 00:39:18.780
to leave that he was trespassing.

626
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.160
He refused to leave a police officer then also came.

627
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:28.460
He was shouting things about shooting police officers at one point.

628
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:33.590
Apparently he attempted to hit the the court worker but he actually didn't.

629
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:39.710
And he was charged with threatening public workers assault and trespassing.

630
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.210
<v 62>So what happened then.</v>

631
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:47.330
<v 10>So the charge for threatening public workers that was dropped the prosecutors</v>

632
00:39:47.611 --> 00:39:48.690
dropped that charge.

633
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:53.610
But he is still facing two misdemeanor charges of assault and trespassing.

634
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.033
<v 63>Mm hmm.</v>

635
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.980
Did it when you're sitting there in that interview did that change in any way

636
00:39:58.981 --> 00:40:03.240
your feelings one way or the other about jury nullification.

637
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.780
Because I kind of feel like it did for me a little bit.

638
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.370
My aunts will be really short.

639
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.030
<v 64>No Why no.</v>

640
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:17.870
I think he's just sort of sounds like a angry frustrated person.

641
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.560
<v 10>He's he's he's angry about people not letting him talk about what he wants to</v>

642
00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:27.640
talk about in front of a courthouse. Mm hmm.

643
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.420
<v 56>Join us.</v>

644
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:37.140
<v 20>I guess not. I mean I did hear when I was talking to him.</v>

645
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.930
I mean partly because I was had been thinking about jury nullification you know

646
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.040
sort of in the most heroic terms is like this chance to stand up against an

647
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:48.610
unjust law.

648
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:53.610
And this conversation just made me realize it can also it also that kind of gets

649
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.700
like twisted up with this really deeply anti-government idea.

650
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.380
You know like you talk to these people and you hear arguments that sound like

651
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:08.050
burn it down. That's the end that's my problem.

652
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.510
That burn it down instinct.

653
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.980
That's I was always sort of at a distance from me and it felt just much much

654
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:18.340
closer. Yeah that's kind of my hand when I hear that tape.

655
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.370
<v 63>I think that's the strain and that's the kind of thinking that you bump into a</v>

656
00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:24.574
lot.

657
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.590
That I find one of the most frightening things I find it more frightening than

658
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.453
almost anything.

659
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:35.040
<v 3>What was that idea that like we the people should should be should be triumphant</v>

660
00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:38.460
over everything like that. I find that to be a really scary.

661
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.660
I hope so.

662
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:44.310
<v 65>I think like Tracy I I've always thought of this as a checks and balance kind of</v>

663
00:41:44.311 --> 00:41:48.090
thing like you have a system we have a legislative branch that passes laws.

664
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:53.210
And yes the laws are ill conceived or or or circumstances change or you find out

665
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:55.410
a consequence of the law.

666
00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.440
You know people of one race are constantly going to jail and really gross aren't

667
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.060
getting electrocuted or not.

668
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:04.850
And then you get these you get these ordinary people walking into these poor

669
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.590
decision points and saying you know what. This doesn't work. This isn't.

670
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.210
Doesn't feel right. It's just wrong.

671
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.260
And that's like if you don't have that then the legislators don't get that

672
00:42:13.261 --> 00:42:15.090
little prick in their little bubble.

673
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.550
<v 3>I totally hear you. I mean I've never advocate for going along with a bad law.</v>

674
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.700
And I think you are you are rife with bad laws right now.

675
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:29.100
<v 63>But there's something potentially corrosive about saying to a person you can</v>

676
00:42:29.101 --> 00:42:30.270
just negate the law.

677
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.830
Think about all the times when white juries in the south refused to convict

678
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.820
people of horrible things. You know it's like that.

679
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.700
<v 3>I mean I had a jury nullification.</v>

680
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.480
That's that's absolutely jury nullification and that's like that is that is the

681
00:42:45.481 --> 00:42:49.090
history of like post reconstructions s you know. Yeah.

682
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.360
But you can make those same arguments on the other side.

683
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.230
<v 66>Think about what juries did during the civil rights movement.</v>

684
00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.770
This is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor speaking at NYU in 2016 if it

685
00:43:01.531 --> 00:43:06.531
weren't for jury nullification we would have many civil rights individuals who

686
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.560
would be convicted felons or otherwise for things that today we think are

687
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:14.790
protected by the First Amendment.

688
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:21.530
There is a place I think for a jury nullification finding the balance of that

689
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.160
and the role that a judge should or should not play.

690
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:31.550
Our forefathers did not believe that juries necessarily always got it right but

691
00:43:32.821 --> 00:43:37.821
it was I think what they believe is that the jury getting wrong was better than

692
00:43:38.311 --> 00:43:39.510
the crown getting it wrong.

693
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.050
<v 67>It goes at some fundamental level to how we want as a people to be governed.</v>

694
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.060
Do we want to be governed by experts. We want to be governed by each other.

695
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:02.250
What power do we want each of us to have over the other one.

696
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.270
<v 38>This is what this question really comes down to this is once again elegant style</v>

697
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.150
legal editor at the WNYC show more perfect.

698
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.530
The older I get the more comfortable I become with the idea of.

699
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:15.840
An unelected.

700
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.600
<v 24>White man sitting in judicial robes deciding everything as opposed to 12 random</v>

701
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.610
jerk offs from the street. Really.

702
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:30.020
And I say that knowing full well that that is a horribly elitist and kind of

703
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.010
terrible for that reason solution to the problem.

704
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.760
<v 3>We have also puts hand it concentrate power in two mostly white hands.</v>

705
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.480
<v 24>It concentrates power into mostly white and concentrates power into the system.</v>

706
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:49.880
When we're saying that one of the only benefits of jury nullification is to be a

707
00:44:49.881 --> 00:44:51.320
check on the system. Right.

708
00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:57.310
If you look at it only from the perspective of the defendant then jury

709
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.690
nullification seems like a great way to protest the system right.

710
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.110
But I'm kind of I've I've started to look at things more from the perspective of

711
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:11.790
the victim. Which victims are getting justice in which victims are not.

712
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.140
And when I start to look at it from that angle what I see is juries nullifying

713
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.470
cases when the victim is of color or when the victim is a woman.

714
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.670
Try try bringing a rape case try bringing a date rape case in this country.

715
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.660
Try it. It's really hard.

716
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.270
And one of the reasons why it's really hard is the jury is the jury sitting

717
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.200
there talking about.

718
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.440
<v 23>She was asking for or talking about what was she were talking about how why was</v>

719
00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:39.000
she out that lay any damn way right.

720
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:43.950
<v 24>That's not that's that's that's a jury doing that to the woman as much as any as</v>

721
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:45.420
any other part of the system.

722
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.580
So when I think about it from the perspective of the victim and how is how.

723
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:53.400
What are the avenues of justice for the victims.

724
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.850
If you're a person of color if you're a minority if you're an Other.

725
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.960
I feel like the jury makes it very hard for you as the victim to get justice.

726
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:05.790
I feel better about the judge not caring if the people that you shot happened to

727
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:09.120
be white or black. A jury cares a lot about that.

728
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.560
If you can't convict a cop when you know we did it when you saw him do it when

729
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:15.410
you can't convict the cop who's not.

730
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.470
Well Scott you can't convict that we can't even indict the cop who choked Eric

731
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.730
Garner to death in broad daylight.

732
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:26.150
That that to me requires a much more drastic rethink of how we do things in this

733
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:29.010
country.

734
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.720
And to me the the first people to go have to be these g d jurors.

735
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.620
<v 68>I find that really persuasive. I I don't.</v>

736
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:45.800
And on ice and maybe that's because I've served on a bunch of juries.

737
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.840
I've been on about six now and I have time and again been amazed at what one

738
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:54.360
time I was in a murder case.

739
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:58.840
<v 62>Some man had been accused of stabbing a woman 22 times and she died on a</v>

740
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.830
staircase and the forewoman and in New York they just picked the person who's

741
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.750
picked first becomes the four the foreperson. She came in.

742
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:12.670
She sat down and look how many of you noticed the defendant's lawyer was asleep.

743
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.750
A lot of the time every hand went up we'd all seen this show.

744
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.220
Here's here's what I want you to do.

745
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.640
Let's let's go back over everything that we know and essentially retry the case.

746
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.750
And we we we actually we went we went together through every bit of evidence

747
00:47:30.511 --> 00:47:32.820
looking for some some doubt somewhere.

748
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:37.140
We staged the stabbing we we went back over the distances where the put could

749
00:47:37.141 --> 00:47:39.960
the guy have gotten from here to there in that amount of time.

750
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.600
I live in that neighborhood. I don't think you can maybe you can we we can't.

751
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:47.610
We basically did the job of the court. All over again ourselves.

752
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.690
And when we were done. OK let's let's vote now.

753
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:56.370
And when it became clear to the forewoman that we were going to convict because

754
00:47:56.371 --> 00:48:00.750
she was counting the votes. And finally the 12th vote went to convict.

755
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.500
<v 69>She just shorter than her chair.</v>

756
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.560
So when she got off her chair she actually was smaller than when she was sitting

757
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.520
on a chair. But she asked us all to hold hands.

758
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.640
We just spent five days we've been sequestered in a hotel.

759
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.750
Each of us had policemen guarding us because there was some violence about it.

760
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.070
So we are standing on here where she has a safe hold hands and then she looks up

761
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:23.904
at the ceiling.

762
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.240
And it's one of those ordinary rooms and she's addresses the the woman who is

763
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:31.554
killed.

764
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.680
And she says she says we have spent the last few days trying to do something

765
00:48:36.721 --> 00:48:41.280
that is just you know you were there you died at his hands or didn't.

766
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:47.160
We decided that you did it and we hope and we pray that this is a system that

767
00:48:47.161 --> 00:48:49.410
works and that you are getting justice.

768
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.960
<v 70>Then she said God bless America</v>

769
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.713
that's amazing.

770
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:04.390
<v 71>Even though I think you're you're expressing that kind of faith in democracy</v>

771
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.160
that it's I think is in short supply right now.

772
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:36.220
Big thanks to producers Soren Wheeler and Tracy hunt.

773
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.680
We should say a couple of things too.

774
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:43.250
First of all Jeffrey Abramson his book is called We the jury and also Judge Fred

775

<v 3>And one more quick note.</v>

782
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:10.200
Laura credo the woman from the beginning of the story the juror who got punished

783
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.440
she actually passed away earlier this year.

784
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:18.480
And we just want to say what a pleasure it was to talk to her and how lucky we

785
00:50:18.481 --> 00:50:20.010
feel to have been able to tell her story.
