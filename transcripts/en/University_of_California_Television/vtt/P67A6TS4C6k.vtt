00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:04.050
(faint techno tones)

00:00:11.493 --> 00:00:13.290
- We're very, very happy
to have Amy Westling

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.440
to kick off our conference this morning.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.440
Amy is the executive
director of the association

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.360
of Regional Center Agencies in Sacramento,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.360
also called ARCA and Amy
is gonna give us an update

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.300
on what ARCA is doing
these days. So Amy...

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.010
- Amy grew up in Sacramento

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.670
and if she doesn't give you the thumbs up

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.282
for Lady Bird, the movie, I will.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:40.880
(laughing)

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.913
Welcome back.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.650
- Good morning everyone.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.750
Thank you so much for
having me here this morning.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.520
I was sharing with people over
coffee and juice this morning

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.680
that I was here last year at
the very tail end of a day

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700
and people were a little bit tired

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.890
and so I guess it's sort
of like Icarus pushing,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.750
or not Icarus,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.900
it's the guy who pushed the
rock up the hill, Sisyphus.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.710
It's escaping me this morning,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.634
which tells me it's too early
to really talk about Medicaid.

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:29.490
(audience laughing)

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.630
So you'll have to bear with me

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.870
and I will do my absolute
best to try to make Medicaid

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.340
and the financing of the
services that people rely on

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.650
as interesting as possible,
but I'm not working with

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.813
terribly compelling information here.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.870
My apologies, I did not provide the staff

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.350
with a biography of myself.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.410
I did want to note before
I got started that I,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.490
prior to working at the Association

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340
of Regional Center Agencies

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.300
I did work for Central Valley
Regional Center for five years

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.270
and I know some of my
Central Valley friends

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.340
are in the audience.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.240
I also worked for Alta
California Regional Center

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.640
for five years and also worked

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.790
for Disability Rights California.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.350
So that's just my way of
saying that this really

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
is a passion of mine and
unfortunately passion has

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.800
to be backed up with financing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.820
and that's why we're all here at 8:00 a.m.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.113
to talk about Medicaid.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.173
Maybe...

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.080
Oh, okay, little bit of
a delay probably in me,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.750
not the system.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.560
So Just first things first,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.240
I have no financial
relationships to disclose,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.920
no conflicts of interest

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.260
and won't be promoting
any commercial products

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.713
or services here today.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.028
Except for of course go see Lady Bird.

00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:09.060
(audience laughing)

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.780
But I don't have a
financial interest in that,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.640
so I think that's okay.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.410
Fantastic coming-of-age story

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.073
about a young girl being
raised in our state's capital.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.370
This morning we're gonna
talk about the basics

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.370
of federal Medicaid rules,
special Medicaid programs

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.300
and really the heart of it all;

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.060
how we can advocate for the
essential Medicaid programs

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.253
that people with developmental
disabilities rely on.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.423
So first let's talk about
the basics of Medicaid.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.840
Medicaid began in 1965.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.840
It was and is a federal
program that was developed

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.395
at the same time that
Medicare was developed.

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.840
The goal, the stated goal of the program

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.010
is to improve a range of health

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.630
and medical services for
Americans of all ages.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.520
It and Medicare came along
at a time when medical costs

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.350
were increasing, medical
complexities were increasing

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.870
and prior to this most
families were on their own

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.660
when it came to taking
care of medical issues.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.230
Here in California we like
to make everything special

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.420
and unique and branded for ourselves,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.280
so we call it Medi-Cal,
but in most other states

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.600
it's known as Medicaid except for Kansas,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.190
where it is called KanCare.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.899
Isn't that cute?

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.180
(audience laughing)

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.180
And really at its core, it is
about providing key supports

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.290
and services to people through a state

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.960
and federal funding partnership

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.780
and we know that the federal government

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.420
when they pay for something
have strings attached.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.660
So we're gonna talk a little bit

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.963
about what some of those strings are.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.040
I was at a budget hearing yesterday

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.330
and really the message
that we all took home was

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.010
that we're well past the point

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.247
in any government funding where
you can say, "give us money

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.313
"and we'll go do good things,"
and Medicaid is no exemption.

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.220
So who qualifies for Medicaid?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.133
This is gonna become important later.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.430
All states are required

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.730
to cover certain populations in Medicaid.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.990
First are families with minor children

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.403
who are living under the
federal poverty level.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.750
The additional population that's required

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.430
is individuals with disabilities on SSI.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.520
And usually people with
developmental disabilities

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.580
find Medicaid eligibility,
especially adults,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.313
through the second category.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.100
Some states through the
Affordable Care Act chose

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.100
to expand Medicaid eligibility,
including California,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.230
and we provided Medicaid eligibility

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.980
to individuals at a slightly
higher income level 138%

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.033
of federal poverty level as
well as childless adults.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.720
Medicaid is funded, as I mentioned,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.720
through a state and federal
financing partnership.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.710
In government we have to
have acronyms for everything,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.920
so FMAP is the state's percentage

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.300
of federal reimbursement
for its Medicaid services.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.450
California and about 14
other states have a 50% FMAP

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.970
and this means for every two
dollars that California spends

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.130
in Medicaid services
the federal government

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.083
reimburses the state one dollar.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.782
A state's FMAP percentage is determined

00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:04.960
by its overall economic prosperity.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.190
So California and about 14 other states

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.010
are at the lowest end of FMAP,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.910
because they are the most
prosperous economically.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.600
I looked it up this morning

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.340
and the state with the
highest FMAP is Mississippi.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.340
In Mississippi, the FMAP, it's over 75%.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.360
So to put it in context,
for every four dollars

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.890
that Mississippi spends
on Medicaid services

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.113
they get three federal dollars back.

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:44.788
Additionally, there's an
old virtue in government

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.660
that you pay for what
you want to see more of.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.590
So there are little bonus FMAPs for things

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.210
that the federal government
wants to see more of,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.930
to incentivize states to make changes.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.425
For example, when we were
talking a couple of minutes ago

00:08:02.425 --> 00:08:07.425
about the Affordable Care
Act expansion population,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.470
the way that the federal
government incentivized states

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.600
to expand funding and expand eligibility

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.500
to that population was
through changing the FMAP

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.910
for those populations.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.140
So for instance, in the early years

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.360
of the Affordable Care
Act some of those programs

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.135
were reimbursed at 90%, even
if the state's FMAP was 50%.

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:36.880
So there were huge incentives
for states to jump on board,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.673
but we know not all states did.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.160
The federal government, as I mentioned,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.560
has strings that they
attach to Medicaid funding.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.560
Each state must submit what are
called State Plan Amendments

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.520
to the federal government
for review and consideration.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.520
A State Plan Amendment outlines how

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.310
and under what circumstances
services will be provided

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.900
and those are known as SPAs because again,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.500
we need acronyms for everything.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.500
It's important to know
that a SPA is a service

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.520
that is provided to all eligible people

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.420
who are Medicaid eligible
within the state.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.420
The Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.540
again we have an acronym,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.740
but this one's weird because
there should be two M's,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.740
it's CMS, approves, denies or
comments on SPA applications.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.950
This is how the federal
government controls the quality

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.320
and expectations for
services that are provided.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.390
Fun fact, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.200
used to be called Healthcare
Financing Administration,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.610
but it sounded too bureaucratic

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.433
and the acronym for that
was pronounced, Hick-fah.

00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:00.254
(audience laughing)

00:10:00.254 --> 00:10:02.463
So CMS kind of rolls off
the tongue a little better.

00:10:04.863 --> 00:10:09.503
So there are four basic rules in Medicaid:

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.760
First, whatever a state puts in their

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.853
State Plan Amendments must
be provided statewide.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.630
There must be comparable services,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.060
so there have to be standards that explain

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.240
in what instances
services will be provided.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.870
And those services are then available

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.950
to everyone who's a Medicaid recipient

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.543
who needs those services
and meets the criteria.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.310
There have to be reasonable promptness,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.500
so you have to have time
and distance requirements

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.423
for meeting needs and there
must be provider choice.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.487
So you can't say, "this
is our orthopedist,

00:10:48.487 --> 00:10:53.003
"take it or leave it,"
for an entire state.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.180
There are different
mandatory benefits for adults

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.020
and children with the
belief at the federal level

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.500
that children with appropriate services

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.060
and supports can reach their
developmental potential.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.380
But for adults there's
a very specific list

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.603
of the things that Medicaid
is required to pay for.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.710
For children, it's a much
broader, much softer kind of list

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.350
and it's provided through
a program called EPSDT

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.183
which stands for

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:35.803
Early Periodic Screening
Diagnostic and Treatment.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.140
I believe that the next speakers will go

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.600
into a little more detail on this,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.600
but it really is a scheme
whereby children are supposed

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.228
to receive services that they
need and including screenings

00:11:50.228 --> 00:11:55.228
and diagnostic work and
that they're supposed

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.940
to receive treatment to address
their developmental needs.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.330
So there aren't supposed
to be these hard caps

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.940
on services like you will often find

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.433
in the adult service system.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.820
So let's talk about what services

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.090
are actually mandatory for adults.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.270
Inpatient and outpatient
hospital services,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.393
nursing facilities, home health,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.223
physician, family nurse
practitioner services,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:29.330
laboratory and X-ray
services, family-planning,

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.120
birth center, nurse midwife
and tobacco cessation

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.270
only if you're pregnant

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.980
and transportation to
medical care, that's it.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.850
Those are the mandatory services.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.850
But states are allowed to go beyond

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.192
that to provide what are
called optional benefits.

00:12:48.192 --> 00:12:50.820
If you're looking at this
list you can probably think

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.050
of a lot of holes that would exist

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.725
in a state if those are
the only guarantees,

00:12:55.725 --> 00:12:59.030
if those are the only medical safety net

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.203
for adults eligible for Medicaid.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.263
So let's talk a little
bit about other services.

00:13:07.277 --> 00:13:09.707
When you see the list of
optional services you'll go,

00:13:09.707 --> 00:13:12.227
"Oh my goodness, I can't imagine a state

00:13:12.227 --> 00:13:13.967
"not providing some of these."

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.343
So for example, prescription
drug coverage is not mandatory.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.690
Physical speech occupational therapy,

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.690
rehabilitative services, podiatry,
optometry and eyeglasses,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.210
dental care, private duty nursing,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.120
inpatient psychiatric services

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.810
for two specific populations
and Hospice care.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.130
So California has gone
well beyond the list

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.170
of mandatory services and provides many

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.553
of these optional benefits as well.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.660
Okay, so those are the basic foundations

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.440
and now we're gonna talk a little deeper

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.810
into Medicaid theory and practice.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.341
I know everyone was
looking forward to this.

00:14:04.341 --> 00:14:06.640
(audience laughing)

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.520
So optional benefits; I
wanted to highlight a few

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.760
of the optional benefits
that I didn't have

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.060
on the prior list that
really are key and critical

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.040
for individuals with
developmental disabilities.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.820
One of the optional
benefits is personal care.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.270
Here in California we provide this as

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.560
In-Home Supportive Services
which is personal care

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.811
that an individual directs themselves

00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:33.410
through the IHSS program.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.149
They select their own providers.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.669
They manage their staff themselves.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:43.669
It's system that is developed
to help people to remain

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.453
in their homes rather than
an institutional setting.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.570
So remember I said the federal
government sometimes puts out

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.250
little Easter eggs to
make states do things,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.743
encourage not make?

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.280
The community first choice option

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.860
known as the 1915(k) State Plan Amendment

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.453
is one of those things.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.170
So in this program it targets
people who have a level

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.510
of care that would otherwise
put them potentially

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.710
in a nursing facility,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.270
and it allows for the
provision of services

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.566
such as personal care through this program

00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:31.566
at an increased FMAP
of 56 rather than 50%.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.527
You may be thinking,

00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:35.527
"Wow that's a lot to do

00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:37.737
"for six additional percentage points."

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.260
But it is something that
the state of California

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.400
was doing for the most part
anyway through our IHSS program

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.400
and so for eligible individuals
we created a 1915(k) program

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.740
to seize that additional 6%
which amounts to hundreds

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.823
of millions of dollars in
the state of California.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.403
An additional optional
benefit is case management.

00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.970
California, again, provides
this through a program called

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.570
Targeted Case Management

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.720
and there are various community agencies

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.380
that provide this service
such as Regional Centers

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.023
and other service systems.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.860
Services in an intermediate
care facility for individuals

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.943
with intellectual disability,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.743
that's another benefit that
we provide here in California.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.780
And then I wanna talk briefly
about the State Plan Home

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.230
and Community Based Services

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.073
or the 1915(i) State Plan Amendment.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.520
So this is a service that is provided only

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.740
to individuals with a
developmental disability

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.900
and the definition that was
used is the same definition

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.210
that was used for Regional
Center eligibility.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.661
It allows the state to capture
significant federal dollars

00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:03.980
for the provision of
Regional Center services,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.980
things like residential
care, supported living,

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.590
transportation, a whole array of services

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.160
that previously the
state hadn't found a way

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.660
to bill the federal government
for, for certain populations.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.790
We'll talk a little bit
more in a few minutes

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.580
about how the state is
recovering federal funds

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.980
for other populations
supported by Regional Centers,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.790
but I did want to put it on your radar

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.510
that this was a program that
was developed as a result

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.010
of the Affordable Care
Act that allowed the state

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.050
to capture additional federal dollars

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.543
for Regional Center services.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.920
So those are all State Plan Amendments.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.310
State Plan Amendments
are those things you have

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.410
to provide to people

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.443
as long as they meet the
basic eligibility criteria.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.060
But beginning in 1981 the
federal government decided

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.480
that states could waive
certain Medicaid requirements.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.960
Remember we talked about there
needs to be comparability,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.680
there needs to be a statewidedness,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.230
there needs to be a whole
variety of guarantees

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.203
to people in the Medicaid population.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.490
But beginning in the
80s states could waive

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.020
certain Medicaid requirements

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.850
and we call these programs
where there's a waiver

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.233
of requirements, we came up
with the catchy name of waivers.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:37.670
So the 1915(c) waiver allows
for the waiver of comparability

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.920
and statewidedness to provide home

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.113
and community-based services.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.110
What this means is that this
type of waiver allows the state

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.280
to provide services just
to a specific population

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.280
and that population is then entitled

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.800
to a very specific package of services

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.113
that's not available to the
broader Medicaid population.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.810
So in California our
biggest 1915(c) waiver

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.880
is our developmental disabilities waiver

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.850
and it allows for people who are served

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.850
by the Regional Center who
have significant deficits

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.380
in life skills to receive
services and for the state

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.500
to receive reimbursement
from the federal government

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.880
at a 50% match for those services.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.480
Now we talked a little
bit, a few minutes ago

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.660
about the 1915(i) State Plan Amendment

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.870
and what that did was allow the state

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.600
to bill for these same services,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.010
but for people who did
not meet the criteria

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.520
for the states developmental
disabilities waiver.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.520
So maybe it was people who,
they didn't meet criteria

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.220
for admission to an ICF facility,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.530
which is one of the
requirements of the 1915(c),

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.040
you have to say if not for these services

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.450
this person may be supported
in this other environment.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.460
Whereas the 1915(i) is much broader.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.460
So together the 1915(i) and
the 1915(c) allow for the state

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.100
to recoup approximately 40% of the cost

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.980
of Regional Center services
and supports to people

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.570
and this a huge deal
because we're operating

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.933
in a system that's well north
of six billion dollars today.

00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:44.690
About 2 1/2 billion dollars

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.690
is coming from the federal
government to support our system.

00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:58.710
There are some rules about waivers.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.640
As I mentioned, they
allow for the provision

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.123
of additional services.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.030
The services must be cost-effective,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.950
so if you are providing
services it has to be cheaper

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.340
on the aggregate than
providing those same services

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.283
to people in an institutional setting.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.830
States can cap enrollment on their waivers

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.690
and each person is
limited to participation

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.923
in only one waiver.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.290
So many states control the size

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.310
of their developmental disability system

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.120
by capping enrollment in their waiver.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.600
In California we have, I
think last time I checked,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.733
somewhere around 140,000
people on our waiver,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.230
but other states cap their
waivers not based on demand,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.640
but based on fiscal realities.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.900
So there are states that say,
hey of course you're entitled

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.810
to waiver services through
basically their structure

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.960
that looks something
like Regional Centers,

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.663
as soon as a slot opens up.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.170
So there are states in this country

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.053
where individuals can wait
for services for decades.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.530
So one of the things we always
talk about in California

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.440
is that we pride ourselves

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.590
on there's not a wait at the front door.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.550
There's not the acknowledgment of a need

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.290
and then people being turned away

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.500
until someone exits the waiver

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.610
by either moving out of
state or passing away.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.515
We don't do that.

00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:35.240
We always talk about this entitlement

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.530
and it's a very lofty
thing that we talk about,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.100
but we need to recognize
that's the impact.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.961
In California, people who have
a developmental disability

00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:48.840
can apply for services
and if found eligible

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.823
can receive the services they need.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.580
In other states people apply for services

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.950
and are told absolutely you qualify

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.303
and we'll get back to you.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.123
So this is a huge deal.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.853
I wanna talk for a moment
about Katie Beckett.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.840
Katie is a reminder that one person,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.330
one individual story,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.333
can make a huge fundamental difference.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.630
So when Katie was four
months old she got very sick

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.090
and at the end of her illness
she ended up being dependent

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.673
on a ventilator many hours of the day,

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.930
and the weird way that
federal Medicaid rules work,

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.290
if a child lives at
home with their family,

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.270
the family's income is considered

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.630
when determining if the
child is Medicaid eligible.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.103
But if a child lives on their own,

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:53.760
in this case in a hospital,
their family size is one.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.820
It is only that child that is considered,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.260
because they're not considered

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.873
to be living with their family.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.780
Katie's family wasn't
a family of high means,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.660
but was high enough not
to qualify for Medicaid

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.570
and so Katie lived continuously

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.880
in a hospital for three years,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.160
because if she left that hospital

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.490
she would rejoin her family

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.303
and she would no longer
qualify for any services.

00:24:21.448 --> 00:24:26.180
It's interesting because, at the time,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.930
Katie's care in inpatient hospitalization

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:33.763
was think about 6,000 dollars a month.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.230
I would love to see us
return to those days, right?

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.950
Where 6,000 dollars gets
you a month of hospital stay

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.100
with ventilator dependence.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.840
But nonetheless her care at home

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.830
would've been 1,000 dollars.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.140
Her mother pushed the issue and raised it

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.210
and pushed the federal government

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.980
and the story made it all
the way to President Reagan

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.977
who said, "This is ridiculous."

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.660
Based on Katie, the
Institutional Deeming Program

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.160
was created where children
with significant disabilities

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.700
can qualify for Medicaid
regardless of family income

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.343
to allow those children to stay at home.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.330
At the time the belief was that one

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.233
or 200 kids would be helped,

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.660
we've hit half a million children

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.813
that Katie's journey has touched.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.120
So this brings us to what
can we do about all this?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.650
We hear a lot of discussion

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.170
at the federal level about Medicaid.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.040
How many people watched the debates

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.020
in December where legislators
were talking about,

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.960
we need to do something about Medicaid

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.853
and we need to fix it and we
need to do all these things?

00:25:57.967 --> 00:26:02.850
What you heard a lot about was the desire

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.463
to control costs in the Medicaid program,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.970
but I will tell you when people
think about Medicaid outside

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.800
of our arena, if we close our eyes

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.600
and think about somebody
we know who's on Medi-Cal

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.910
we probably are thinking about people

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.860
with developmental disabilities
because that's our reality.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.520
But lawmakers weren't thinking about that.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.550
They were thinking about
the other population.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.650
People who are on Medicaid because

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.963
of low socioeconomic status.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.283
So a lot of these debates went on and on.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.560
Additionally, another uncertainty

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.440
is always the state budget.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.570
We saw during the recession the cutting

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.730
of benefits that were optional.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.900
Things like adult dentistry.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.810
Things like eyeglasses.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.503
Those kinds of things
where the state made tough,

00:27:00.503 --> 00:27:03.720
tough decisions related
to those optional benefits

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.553
it would provide.

00:27:04.553 --> 00:27:07.193
So those are some of the
uncertainties in our world.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.020
It's important that people
who know the reality

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.600
of individuals with
developmental disabilities

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.180
and their families and the supports

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.810
that are oftentimes needed,

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.810
it's important that we become
part of that conversation,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.290
that we stay informed,
that we get engaged,

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.990
that people tell their own stories

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.993
and at the end of the
day that we all show up.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.880
So I spend a lot of my life
reading political commentary

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.830
and I sit there with my
hot tea in the morning

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.550
and I read and read and
read politico in the papers

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.890
and all of this and it can
be a little bit overwhelming.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.120
Has anyone else been
overwhelmed by the news

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.893
and the politics lately?

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.530
So here's what I want you to do.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.390
I don't want you to just say forget it,

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.390
throw up your hands and give it up.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.310
Find some trusted
sources and stay engaged,

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:14.293
stay informed, but don't obsess about it.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.377
Don't sit there and
wring your hands and say,

00:28:19.377 --> 00:28:20.430
"What are we going to do?"

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.920
Because action planning is next.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.300
But find sources you trust, read those,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.370
stay on top of it and put it away.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.850
But keep it in the back of
your head and keep track

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.000
of when important things are coming up

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.723
in healthcare policy debates.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.800
First and foremost,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.290
you need to know your representatives are.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.120
You can go to the Assembly
or Aenate website here

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.010
in California or the
website for the Senate

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.920
or the House of Representatives.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.810
Find out who your representatives are

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:00.550
and then do something
remarkable, go out and meet them.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.932
They hold events in your communities.

00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:05.880
Our state-level representatives

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.623
often hold the coffee get
together kinds of things.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.023
Call or write, get to know them.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.620
And then when there are
key votes coming up,

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.750
call or write to them.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.200
It's not because one
person's voice is going

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.380
to make a difference,
(clearing throat) excuse me,

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:32.070
it's because so few people
actually pick up that phone

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.530
that for every phone call they get

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.970
they assume there's 100 people

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.290
just like you sitting in their districts.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.333
Call them.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.340
When you tell your story
there are some guidelines,

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.340
but first and foremost, know
that stories are powerful,

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.270
know that there are people who are paid

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.100
to work Capitol Hill who wear suits,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.173
who look very professional
and who are a dime a dozen.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.110
But know that you are the
expert in your own story

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.170
and that those stories of real life people

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.773
are the most compelling.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.090
When you tell your story be
short, be clear, be truthful,

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.403
be constructive, focused and memorable.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.700
Don't hide the lead, put it out in front,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.910
but also let them know
what it is you need.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.318
Let them know what it is
that makes a difference

00:30:32.318 --> 00:30:35.830
in the lives of either
yourself or your family members

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.994
or the people you support,
because those things,

00:30:39.994 --> 00:30:44.994
those things make a difference
and they make an impact.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.800
When people work in legislative settings

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.030
they are so removed
oftentimes from what I like

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.373
to call real people,

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.030
because they don't get the opportunity

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.470
to spend time hearing from actual people

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.630
who are impacted by policies,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.363
so those things are very, very powerful.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.360
Showing up, find out when the hearings are

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.320
and go if you can.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.490
It was interesting during last
fall's health care debate,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.270
one of the most effective
groups is a group called ADAPT.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.653
Has anyone heard of them?

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.140
One of the things they did
was try to change the face

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.060
of a Medicaid recipient in people's minds

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.530
and they were very effective.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.910
These are people who have
significant disabilities who came

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.733
in wheelchairs and staged
what they called a die-in.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:48.170
They removed themselves
from their wheelchairs

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:52.303
and refused to get up and
many of them got arrested,

00:31:52.303 --> 00:31:54.500
but they sent a message

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.530
that a few people can be very powerful.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:02.530
And they shifted the
debate to remind people

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.460
that when you're talking
about a Medicaid recipient

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.740
you're talking about a whole
swath of our population

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.740
and that you need to understand
that when you're looking

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.460
at dollars and cents that you're talking

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.520
about real people's lives
and their support needs

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.883
and that those things have value.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.960
So go to hearings if you can.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.950
Additionally, watch for
hearings outside of Sacramento

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.360
or Washington, sometimes
there are hearings

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.271
that take place in other locations.

00:32:36.271 --> 00:32:39.510
Find public meetings or
forums where your legislators

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.073
are going to be, they will remember you.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.223
Thank you so much.

00:32:47.073 --> 00:32:50.073
(audience clapping)
