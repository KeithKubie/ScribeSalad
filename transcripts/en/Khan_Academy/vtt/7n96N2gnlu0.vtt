00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.270
the first Saudi state,
the Emirate of Diriyah,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.270
was ended in the Ottoman-Wahhabi War.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.020
It was ended by the Ottomans,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.420
but it was by actual Egyptian forces

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.520
that retook control of Mecca and Medina

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.250
and then laid siege to
the town of Diriyah,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.360
which was the center of
the Emirate of Diriyah.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.920
The last emir, who was
also considered imam,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.230
so a religious leader,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.770
of the Emirate of Diriyah was Abdullah,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.240
who was beheaded by the Ottoman Turks.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.860
Now, that wasn't the end
of the House of Saud.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.270
As we have alluded to,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.400
there's going to be two more Saudi states.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720
A cousin of Abdullah's
father, Turki bin Abdullah,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.230
who had gone into hiding after

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.720
the Egyptian forces had
taken control of Diriyah,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.240
was able to come back
to power in the 1820s,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.290
and he establishes the second Saudi state,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.200
the Emirate of Nejd.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.990
And as we talked about
in the previous video,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.220
the Nejd refers to that
central Arabian region,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.830
which was really the stronghold
of the House of Saud.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.440
And we can see here
that the Emirate of Nejd

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.660
eventually expands to much
of the Arabian Peninsula,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.310
although it never took
control of Mecca and Medina,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.760
which were back under Ottoman control.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.550
Now, this emirate will
last until the last decade

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.550
of the 19th century, as
we get into 1890 and 1891,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.393
when a rival tribe, the Rashidun,
are able to take Riyadh.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.000
At that time, Turki bin
Abdullah's grandson,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.380
Abdul Rahman bin Faisal,
is now emir and imam,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.870
so both the head of state
and as imam religious leader.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.400
When the Rashidun take over,
he and his family go into exile

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160
with Bedouin tribes in the south

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.990
and eventually make their way to Kuwait.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.040
Abdul Rahman himself eventually
focuses more on religion,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.980
but his son, Abdul Aziz,
will end up becoming

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.150
one of the most significant
figures in all of Saudi history.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.200
In 1902,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.593
he is able to take back Riyadh.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.490
He and roughly 40 men are able
to scale the protective walls

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.470
of Riyadh by climbing
bent-over palm trees.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.440
They're able to take the town.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.000
And then from there,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.100
they establish what ends up
becoming the third Saudi state.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.250
He soon takes back the Nejd region

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.640
and then, in World War I,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.520
takes the side of Great Britain
against the Ottoman Empire.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.300
After World War I, he's
able to take the Hejaz,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
this western region of
the Arabian Peninsula,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.770
including Mecca and Medina.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.630
And in 1932, it's officially
proclaimed a kingdom,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.880
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.910
which included both
the Hejaz and the Nejd.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.860
And all of this was
done by King Abdulaziz.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.450
And as you can see here,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.470
his reign covered half
of the 20th century.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.660
And over the next 70 years,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.240
every king of Saudi Arabia
has been one of his sons,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.730
and the current Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.600
Mohammed bin Salman, is his grandson.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.030
And King Abdulaziz and Saudi Arabia

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.560
become major actors on the
global stage when, in 1938,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.750
major oil reserves are discovered

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.000
in Saudi Arabia near the Persian Gulf.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.210
And these end up being some of the largest

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.860
oil reserves in the world.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.850
So this became a strong
incentive for major world powers

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.000
to become allied with Saudi Arabia,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.120
especially the United States.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.600
This right over here is a picture of FDR,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.790
the American president,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.660
meeting King Abdulaziz in 1945,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.700
near the end of World War II.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.650
And you could appreciate
the strategic importance

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.450
of these oil reserves.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.810
They're important for growing economies,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.910
and they are also important
from a military point of view.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.840
World War I and even more so World War II

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.710
are defined by mechanized militaries

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.320
that need oil in order to operate.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.260
And just to get an
appreciation of Saudi Arabia's

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.910
continued strategic importance
from an energy point of view,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.360
this right over here shows
the production of petroleum

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960
and natural gas for the
United States, Russia,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.600
and Saudi Arabia over
the last several years.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.710
And these tend to be
the top three producers

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.530
of petroleum and natural gas.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.340
But if you focus on petroleum,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.860
you see that, for most
of this time period,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.430
Saudi Arabia was the top producer,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.460
and it's actually true of
most of the post-war era.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.210
Recently, the United States
has passed up Saudi Arabia,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.160
but even then Saudi Arabia is incredibly

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.470
strategically important
because it uses far less

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.950
of its petroleum than
the United States does.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.530
So Saudi Arabia is still the world's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.110
largest exporter of petroleum,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.450
and the reserves that
Saudi Arabia has access to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.560
are far cheaper to access than, say,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.010
the reserves in the United States.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.270
So they continue to be very strategic

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.463
and very important actors
on the global stage.
