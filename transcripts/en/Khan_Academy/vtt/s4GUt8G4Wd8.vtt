00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.035
- [Teacher] In the last
video we discussed the great

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:06.066
compromise made at the
Constitutional Convention in 1787,

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.927
where delegates who were
trying to craft a new

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:14.128
governmental system for the
United States agreed on how

00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:18.198
the legislative branch of the
government would be set up,

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:22.398
and the agreement they made was
that it would be a two house

00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:26.565
or bicameral legislature with
a House of Representatives,

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.060
where the representatives
would be apportioned

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.093
based on state population,
and then a Senate where

00:00:36.093 --> 00:00:40.260
every state would get two
senators regardless of its size.

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:44.495
This is just one example
of how the framers

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:48.718
of the constitution tried to
introduce a notion of balance.

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:51.856
In this video, I wanna zoom
out a little bit and look at

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:55.873
the broader constitution,
because the legislative branch

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:57.973
was really only one part of it.

00:00:57.973 --> 00:01:00.988
In fact, there are seven more
articles of the constitution.

00:01:00.988 --> 00:01:04.359
So here, I'd like to spend
some time taking a closer look

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.706
at some of the other articles,
paying special attention

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:11.592
to the executive branch
and the judicial branch,

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:14.507
but before we do that, I
just want to take a moment

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.887
to marvel at the size of the constitution.

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:22.054
Not because it's so big,
but because it's so small.

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:26.517
This is the first page
of the constitution,

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:29.715
famously starting with, "We
the people," but the entire

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.995
original constitution
could fit on four pages.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:37.099
Compare that to the constitutions
of many other nations

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.878
which are hundreds of pages long,

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:43.729
and I think the idea here
in having a constitution

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.873
that's really only seven articles long

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.804
was that it was gonna set down principles.

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:54.075
This wasn't going to be a
whole set of laws that outlined

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:58.262
everything that a state
should do in any situation

00:01:58.262 --> 00:02:01.847
but rather a set of
broad ideas around which

00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:04.597
lawmaking decisions could happen.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.112
In a way, you could
think of the constitution

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:12.527
as being kind of broad
enough to be flexible.

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:16.378
They spoke in larger
generalities that could be

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:19.409
applied to many different situations,

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.576
and I think the proof that
this was a good way to think

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.467
about putting together a
constitution is just in the fact

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.292
that we'd still have
this constitution today,

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:35.338
more than 200 years after
it was written in 1787.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:39.481
The US Constitution is the
oldest constitution in the world

00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.314
that is still in effect
at the national level.

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:47.584
I think that's a pretty big deal.

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:50.825
How did this constitution work?

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:53.900
Well, let's look a little bit
more closely at these first

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.954
three articles and the branches
of government they created.

00:02:57.954 --> 00:03:01.520
One of the ways that the
framers of the constitution

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.687
attempted to remedy the problems
caused by the single branch

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.665
government under the
Articles of Confederation

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.612
was creating a three branch government.

00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:15.373
One branch, established in Article 1,

00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:18.126
would be the Congress
and within this building

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:22.030
is the House of
Representatives and the Senate.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.751
And this would be in
the eyes of the framers,

00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.218
really the most powerful of the branches.

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:32.607
They gave Congress the power to make law,

00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:35.940
to tax, to raise an army, to coin money.

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.499
They really envisioned
that most of the day to day

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.337
operations and most of
the power of government

00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:52.670
would fall under the duties of Congress,

00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:57.201
but one thing that the
Articles of Confederation

00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:00.140
had lacked was a powerful executive,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.802
so the second branch of government,

00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:05.938
established in Article 2
is the executive branch,

00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:08.369
the head of which is the president.

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.906
The job of the executive
would be to enforce

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:15.156
or carry out the laws made by Congress,

00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:20.434
and that would include doing
things like waging war.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.714
Remember that the first
president was George Washington,

00:04:23.714 --> 00:04:27.521
who had been the General of
the Revolutionary Armies,

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.900
but the president could also
kind of have the front lines

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.067
on dealing with foreign nations,
so negotiating treaties,

00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:39.429
and would also have the power

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:42.762
of appointing many government officials.

00:04:45.594 --> 00:04:48.936
And lastly, the third branch
would be the judicial branch

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:51.718
of government, established in Article 3.

00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:55.199
The head of the judicial branch
would be the Supreme Court,

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.114
the highest court in the land.

00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:59.424
Of course, there are
many other smaller courts

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.298
below it at the state and district level.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:05.063
The Supreme Court's job,
along with other courts,

00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:09.058
would be to interpret the
law, to see whether or not

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:12.086
things done by Congress and the president

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:15.289
fell within the bounds
of the constitution.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.178
And the framers really thought
that the judicial branch

00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:21.992
would end up being the
weakest branch of government,

00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:25.977
although both the presidency
and the Supreme Court

00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:28.546
have grown in power over the years.

00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:31.589
Now, this is an incredibly brief overview

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.314
of these three branches.

00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:36.298
These articles include lots more in them

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:39.597
about the specific powers
of each of these branches

00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:42.912
and the kinds of
requirements one would need

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.612
to become a representative or president,

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.457
so I highly recommend
that you read more about

00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:51.045
the Constitution and
check out these articles.

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:53.768
But what I want you to get out
of this is that the framers

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:57.909
here were trying to separate
the powers of government,

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.236
so they wanted to make sure that to avoid

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.263
having too much power in government.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:08.229
Remember that they are trying
to escape from the monarchy.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.964
They want to make sure
that government power

00:06:11.964 --> 00:06:15.761
is kind of diffused among
these three branches

00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:19.007
with the idea that they're
going to have to argue

00:06:19.007 --> 00:06:21.978
with each other to get things
done, they're going to have to

00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:25.007
cooperate with each
other to get things done,

00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:28.800
so the separation of
powers is one of the key

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.176
principles of the Constitution.

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:34.792
Another key principle
is checks and balances.

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:37.816
What do I mean by checks and balances?

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:41.807
Well, this is the idea
that each of the branches

00:06:41.807 --> 00:06:45.974
of government has the power
to check in the sense of stop,

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:52.444
like checkmate in chess, the
other branches of government.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:55.658
I think of this as kind of like a giant

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:59.241
governmental game of
rock, paper, scissors.

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:04.880
Now, there are many ways
that these branches can

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.711
check each other, but I just
wanna give a couple of quick

00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:10.843
examples to help you understand
what that might be like.

00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:14.093
Alright, say that Congress makes a law,

00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:19.020
and the president doesn't like that law.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.298
The president can use the power

00:07:21.298 --> 00:07:23.715
of the veto to kill that law,

00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:28.742
and if Congress gets annoyed
enough with the president,

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:32.908
they might use their power
to impeach the president.

00:07:32.908 --> 00:07:35.255
What about the judicial branch?

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.935
The judicial branch's
main checking function

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:41.852
is declaring laws unconstitutional.

00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:48.108
The president or Congress may put through

00:07:48.108 --> 00:07:50.857
a law that the Supreme Court says

00:07:50.857 --> 00:07:54.190
is not consistent with the Constitution.

00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:58.556
The judicial branch can then kill that law

00:07:58.556 --> 00:08:01.065
by declaring it unconstitutional.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:03.055
What happens if the other
branches are unhappy

00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:04.933
with the judicial branch?

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:07.522
One way that the president
can check the judicial branch

00:08:07.522 --> 00:08:09.863
is through appointing judges.

00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:14.030
This would kind of change
the composition of the court,

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:19.559
the people on the court, and so over time,

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:23.787
the presidency can influence
who is on the Supreme Court

00:08:23.787 --> 00:08:25.967
and how they rule on laws.

00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:30.006
And lastly, if Congress isn't
happy with the Supreme Court,

00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:33.235
they might be able to impeach justices,

00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:36.818
or change jurisdiction
of the lower courts.

00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:42.533
In this way, like the
separation of powers,

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:45.644
the framers intended to make sure that

00:08:45.644 --> 00:08:48.364
one branch couldn't get too powerful,

00:08:48.364 --> 00:08:52.448
because it would be able to
check the other branches.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:56.615
You could really think of
this as being a brilliant way

00:08:58.568 --> 00:09:02.089
of harnessing peoples' natural inclination

00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:04.384
to look out for themselves.

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:08.144
As rivalries developed,
as people tried to do

00:09:08.144 --> 00:09:11.991
what they thought was
best, they could help keep

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.058
government honest by
fighting among themselves,

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:18.116
and as they all strove
and checked each other,

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:22.283
it would keep all of government
from becoming too powerful.
