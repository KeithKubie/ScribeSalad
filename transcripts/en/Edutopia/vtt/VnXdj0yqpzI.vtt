00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:09.256
&gt;&gt;Niklas: As people are willing
to buy more, they're making more

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:10.756
and they're charging more for it.

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:13.556
&gt;&gt;Erin: And how does that relate
back to our free market principles?

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:17.386
&gt;&gt;Niklas: As demand goes
up, supply goes up.

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:20.446
&gt;&gt;Kisa: Because we assess
student Mastery of Competencies,

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:24.746
we have a better understanding of
exactly what the student can do.

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:29.526
It's a more equitable system for
assessing student understanding.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:32.836
And it also puts the ownership of
the learning into the kids hands.

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:34.006
&gt;&gt;Daniel: You're being assessed

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.976
on Competency Number 3,
Presentation of Learning.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:45.106
&gt;&gt;Kisa: Competency-Based Learning
is the idea that students are trying

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:47.216
to meet certain big picture
understandings.

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:50.916
Not complete a bunch of tasks
and jump through a bunch of hoops

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.516
and average a bunch of scores out.

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:58.306
&gt;&gt;Erin: I want to make sure that you
guy are aware of the Competencies.

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.746
&gt;&gt;Danielle: The Competencies
are anywhere between five

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:04.966
to seven statements that say, "These
are the focus areas for this course."

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.666
This is what you need to
demonstrate that you know

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.326
to have mastered this course.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:13.276
&gt;&gt;Kisa: The most fundamental shift
an individual teacher could make is

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.876
to just pick those traditional
categories you used to have

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.566
in your gradebook, Quizzes,
Tests, Homework,

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:20.356
and shift them to the
Enduring Skill Sets and Habits

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:21.976
of Mind for your discipline.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:23.606
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to
have like two of each--

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:26.366
&gt;&gt;Kisa: And the kids, because that's how
they're being assessed start to think

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.986
about things a little bit more in terms

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.596
of the Enduring Understandings
you're trying to get at.

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:31.156
&gt;&gt;Erin: Good morning!

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:34.256
I'd like you to start
working on your project today.

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:36.486
It goes with Competency 2.

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:38.536
It is over here on the walls.

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:43.056
&gt;&gt;Erin: I think the Competency-Based
approach is better,

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:45.456
because it gives students the ability

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:48.326
to demonstrate competence
in a variety of ways.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:50.216
&gt;&gt;Niklas: In Economics class,

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:56.026
the Competency that we are demonstrating
is Supply and Demand Systems.

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:59.826
&gt;&gt;Niklas: So they charge 100, 200,
300, up to 600 dollars for it,

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.616
because it's fairly cheap to make them.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:04.206
&gt;&gt;Niklas: We have individual
freedom when it comes

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:05.726
to the work that we can do.

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:09.476
&gt;&gt;Kaylee: We can do a test,
or we could do a project.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.866
Either like a PowerPoint or a poster.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:14.836
&gt;&gt;Erin: So you're still
set on this SpongeBob idea?

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:15.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.006
&gt;&gt;Erin: I have two students

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.986
who have been hounding me
about a SpongeBob episode.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:21.866
&gt;&gt;Student: He has to buy the
chocolate bars, and has to buy bags

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:22.776
to carry the chocolate bars.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:25.616
&gt;&gt;Erin: Is that part of the episode?

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:25.936
Okay.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:26.646
&gt;&gt;Darin: The whole episode really talks

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.826
about how there's different
ways of selling things.

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:31.386
There's different styles
of how you sell them.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:32.416
&gt;&gt;Erin: So your product
that you're going

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:33.946
to focus on are the chocolate bars.

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:37.266
&gt;&gt;Erin: They believe that selling
chocolate bars demonstrates the concepts

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.726
of Demand and Supply very well.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Consumer tastes and
preferences, definitely demonstrated.

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:41.746
&gt;&gt;Erin: Right.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:45.046
&gt;&gt;Erin: So I challenged them
to create a series of graphs,

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:48.256
and then analyze each graph
and look at that interplay

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:49.846
of Demand and Supply and the prices.

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:52.626
&gt;&gt;Erin: What could you look at?

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:53.476
&gt;&gt;Kaylee: The preferences.

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:53.576
&gt;&gt;Erin: Okay.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:56.456
&gt;&gt;Kaylee: And then like
the number of sellers.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.316
&gt;&gt;Kaylee: I'm not a very
good test-taker,

00:02:58.806 --> 00:03:01.996
but with the project we're able to
say, "This is what I need to do,

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:05.486
and this is what I need to work
on, rather than just trying

00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:07.096
to cram it all into our minds.

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:09.036
&gt;&gt;Erin: So it sounds like
you've got two ideas,

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.076
but we need to come up with two more.

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:10.536
&gt;&gt;Kaylee: Okay.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.746
&gt;&gt;Erin: Choice allows them the
opportunity to be cognizant

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:18.596
of their learning style,
and how they learn best.

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:19.866
&gt;&gt;Erin: We'll continue
with this tomorrow.

00:03:20.346 --> 00:03:20.976
Have a good day!

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:25.516
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Ladies and gentleman, when
you start to think of your procedure

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.736
from the lab, remember
you are in charge today.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:32.366
&gt;&gt;Julianna: Since this is
completely our decision how we do it,

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:36.516
we have to write our materials,
procedures, all that stuff that we did.

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:39.556
&gt;&gt;Daniel: The whole idea of
Competency-Based, it puts ownership

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:43.386
in the students' hands, to demonstrate
that they were able to master

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:44.976
that particular competency.

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:46.066
&gt;&gt;Daniel: As close as you can.

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:48.686
&gt;&gt;Daniel: You can have one
area of the room on something

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.486
that other students have
already finished.

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:51.476
&gt;&gt;Student: See this right here.

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.066
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Sometimes you'll have

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.896
in a different corner students
going back to revisit something.

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:57.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Which one's this?

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:57.646
Sugar.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:03:58.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Sugar.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.716
And then this is NACL.

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.816
&gt;&gt;Kisa: They have to
meet each Competency.

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.136
&gt;&gt;Student: Procedure 1 was get--

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:05.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Get the chunks of candy.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.106
&gt;&gt;Kisa: So they could do a
really good job with the concept,

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:11.086
but not do a really good job
with their science process.

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:15.706
They don't redo that assignment,
but in the next lab that we do,

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:19.716
maybe that student does
a formal lab report.

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:19.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Here.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:21.616
&gt;&gt;Kisa: Or they could take
a written test instead.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.266
They could do an essay on something.

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:26.666
And you don't just move on with
a big gap in your understanding.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.426
We don't let you do that!

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:29.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Drop, drop.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.066
&gt;&gt;Kisa: Because you're assessing the
student in a way that fits the student--

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:34.696
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Excellent, good job.

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:37.236
&gt;&gt;Kisa: You're getting a better
assessment of where the kid really is.

00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:40.176
&gt;&gt;Student: You have your price,
and then you have like the supply.

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:43.126
&gt;&gt;Kisa: Competency-Based
education is just, in general,

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:45.626
much more fair for every student.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:46.616
&gt;&gt;Julianna: Ready?

00:04:46.776 --> 00:04:46.976
Go!
