00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.810
Let me draw a function
that would be interesting

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.490
to take a limit of.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.880
And I'll just draw it visually
for now, and we'll do some

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.390
specific examples
a little later.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.870
So that's my y-axis,
and that's my x-axis.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.180
And let;s say the function
looks something like--

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.950
I'll make it a fairly
straightforward function

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.760
--let's say it's a line,
for the most part.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.100
Let's say it looks just
like, accept it has a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.080
hole at some point.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.690
x is equal to a, so
it's undefined there.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.030
Let me black that point
out so you can see that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.110
it's not defined there.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.780
And that point there
is x is equal to a.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.180
This is the x-axis, this is
the y is equal f of x-axis.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.120
Let's just say
that's the y-axis.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.030
And let's say that this
is f of x, or this is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.880
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.740
Now we've done a bunch
of videos on limits.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.160
I think you have an
intuition on this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.850
If I were to say what is the
limit as x approaches a,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.020
and let's say that this
point right here is l.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.480
We know from our previous
videos that-- well first of all

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.940
I could write it down --the
limit as x approaches

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.690
a of f of x.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.560
What this means intuitively is
as we approach a from either

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.980
side, as we approach it from
that side, what does

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.290
f of x approach?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
So when x is here,
f of x is here.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.490
When x is here, f
of x is there.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.080
And we see that it's
approaching this l right there.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.320
And when we approach a from
that side-- and we've done

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200
limits where you approach from
only the left or right side,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.750
but to actually have a limit it
has to approach the same thing

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.670
from the positive direction and
the negative direction --but as

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.380
you go from there, if you pick
this x, then this is f of x.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440
f of x is right there.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.460
If x gets here then it goes
here, and as we get closer and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.860
closer to a, f of x approaches
this point l, or this value l.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600
So we say that the limit
of f of x ax x approaches

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.960
a is equal to l.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.640
I think we have that intuition.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.360
But this was not very, it's
actually not rigorous at all

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.480
in terms of being specific
in terms of what we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.290
mean is a limit.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.340
All I said so far is as
we get closer, what does

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.440
f of x get closer to?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.360
So in this video I'll attempt
to explain to you a definition

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360
of a limit that has a little
bit more, or actually a lot

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.180
more, mathematical rigor than
just saying you know, as x gets

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.990
closer to this value, what
does f of x get closer to?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.290
And the way I think about it's:
kind of like a little game.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:48.640
The definition is, this
statement right here means that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.150
I can always give you a range
about this point-- and when I

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.190
talk about range I'm not
talking about it in the whole

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.960
domain range aspect, I'm just
talking about a range like you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.980
know, I can give you a distance
from a as long as I'm no

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.360
further than that, I can
guarantee you that f of x is go

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.160
it not going to be any further
than a given distance from l

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.030
--and the way I think about it
is, it could be viewed

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.490
as a little game.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.840
Let's say you say, OK Sal,
I don't believe you.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.900
I want to see you know, whether
f of x can get within 0.5 of l.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.460
So let's say you give me 0.5
and you say Sal, by this

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.760
definition you should always
be able to give me a range

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.330
around a that will get f of
x within 0.5 of l, right?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.980
So the values of f of x are
always going to be right in

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.160
this range, right there.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.300
And as long as I'm in that
range around a, as long as I'm

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.890
the range around you give me, f
of x will always be at least

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.030
that close to our limit point.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.830
Let me draw it a little bit
bigger, just because I think

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.870
I'm just overriding the same
diagram over and over again.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.770
So let's say that this is f of
x, this is the hole point.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.340
There doesn't have to be a hole
there; the limit could equal

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.020
actually a value of the
function, but the limit is more

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.560
interesting when the function
isn't defined there

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.910
but the limit is.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.770
So this point right here-- that
is, let me draw the axes again.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:44.010
So that's x-axis, y-axis x,
y, this is the limit point

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.310
l, this is the point a.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.630
So the definition of the limit,
and I'll go back to this in

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.690
second because now that it's
bigger I want explain it again.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.090
It says this means-- and this
is the epsilon delta definition

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.260
of limits, and we'll touch on
epsilon and delta in a second,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.790
is I can guarantee you that
f of x, you give me any

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.860
distance from l you want.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.450
And actually let's
call that epsilon.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.590
And let's just hit on
the definition right

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.050
from the get go.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.090
So you say I want to be no more
than epsilon away from l.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.510
And epsilon can just be any
number greater, any real

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.960
number, greater than 0.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.320
So that would be, this distance
right here is epsilon.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.810
This distance there is epsilon.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.480
And for any epsilon you give
me, any real number-- so this

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.810
is, this would be l plus
epsilon right here, this would

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.030
be l minus epsilon right here
--the epsilon delta definition

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.030
of this says that no matter
what epsilon one you give me, I

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.650
can always specify a
distance around a.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.000
And I'll call that delta.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.710
I can always specify
a distance around a.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.320
So let's say this is delta
less than a, and this

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.440
is delta more than a.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.365
This is the letter delta.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.680
Where as long as you pick an x
that's within a plus delta and

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.440
a minus delta, as long as the x
is within here, I can guarantee

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.160
you that the f of x, the
corresponding f of x is going

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.350
to be within your range.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.060
And if you think about it
this makes sense right?

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.630
It's essentially saying, I can
get you as close as you want to

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.980
this limit point just by-- and
when I say as close as you

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.430
want, you define what you want
by giving me an epsilon; on

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.940
it's a little bit of a game
--and I can get you as close as

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.000
you want to that limit point by
giving you a range around the

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.680
point that x is approaching.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.420
And as long as you pick an x
value that's within this range

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.570
around a, long as you pick an x
value around there, I can

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.440
guarantee you that f of x will
be within the range

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.290
you specify.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.270
Just make this a little bit
more concrete, let's say you

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.490
say, I want f of x to be within
0.5-- let's just you know, make

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.380
everything concrete numbers.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.750
Let's say this is the number 2
and let's say this is number 1.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.575
So we're saying that the limit
as x approaches 1 of f of x-- I

00:07:16.575 --> 00:07:18.880
haven't defined f of x, but it
looks like a line with the hole

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.480
right there, is equal to 2.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.820
This means that you can
give me any number.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.380
Let's say you want to try it
out for a couple of examples.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.220
Let's say you say I want f of x
to be within point-- let me do

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.680
a different color --I want f
of x to be within 0.5 of 2.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.970
I want f of x to be
between 2.5 and 1.5.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.650
Then I could say, OK, as long
as you pick an x within-- I

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.190
don't know, it could be
arbitrarily close but as long

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.920
as you pick an x that's --let's
say it works for this function

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.790
that's between, I don't
know, 0.9 and 1.1.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.980
So in this case the delta from
our limit point is only 0.1.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.320
As long as you pick an x that's
within 0.1 of this point, or 1,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.640
I can guarantee you that your
f of x is going to

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.740
lie in that range.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.220
So hopefully you get a little
bit of a sense of that.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.750
Let me define that with the
actual epsilon delta, and this

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.580
is what you'll actually see in
your mat textbook, and then

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.110
we'll do a couple of examples.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.730
And just to be clear, that
was just a specific example.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.870
You gave me one epsilon and I
gave you a delta that worked.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:36.270
But by definition if this is
true, or if someone writes

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.290
this, they're saying it doesn't
just work for one specific

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.900
instance, it works for
any number you give me.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.800
You can say I want to be within
one millionth of, you know, or

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.180
ten to the negative hundredth
power of 2, you know, super

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.590
close to 2, and I can always
give you a range around this

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.270
point where as long as you pick
an x in that range, f of x will

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.540
always be within this range
that you specify, within that

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.240
were you know, one trillionth
of a unit away from

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.470
the limit point.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.270
And of course, the one thing
I can't guarantee is what

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.760
happens when x is equal to a.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.580
I'm just saying as long as you
pick an x that's within my

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.950
range but not on a, it'll work.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.720
Your f of x will show up to be
within the range you specify.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.680
And just to make the math
clear-- because I've been

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.250
speaking only in words so far
--and this is what we see the

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:33.460
textbook: it says look, you
give me any epsilon

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.810
greater than 0.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.390
Anyway, this is a
definition, right?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.730
If someone writes this they
mean that you can give them any

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:52.800
epsilon greater than 0, and
then they'll give you a delta--

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.590
remember your epsilon is how
close you want f of x to be

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.760
to your limit point, right?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.530
It's a range around f of x
--they'll give you a delta

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.860
which is a range
around a, right?

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.520
Let me write this.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.830
So limit as approaches a
of f of x is equal to l.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.210
So they'll give you a delta
where as long as x is no more

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:23.025
than delta-- So the distance
between x and a, so if we pick

00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:27.950
an x here-- let me do another
color --if we pick an x here,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.340
the distance between that value
and a, as long as one, that's

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.840
greater than 0 so that x
doesn't show up on top of a,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.980
because its function might be
undefined at that point.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.750
But as long as the distance
between x and a is greater

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.400
than 0 and less than this x
range that they gave you,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.450
it's less than delta.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.930
So as long as you take an x,
you know if I were to zoom the

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:55.680
x-axis right here-- this is a
and so this distance right here

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.240
would be delta, and this
distance right here would be

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.920
delta --as long as you pick an
x value that falls here-- so as

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.520
long as you pick that x value
or this x value or this x value

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.560
--as long as you pick one of
those x values, I can guarantee

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.010
you that the distance between
your function and the limit

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.670
point, so the distance between
you know, when you take one of

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.460
these x values and you evaluate
f of x at that point, that the

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.170
distance between that f of x
and the limit point is

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.560
going to be less than the
number you gave them.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.470
And if you think of, it seems
very complicated, and I have

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.690
mixed feelings about where
this is included in most

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.640
calculus curriculums.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.345
It's included in like the, you
know, the third week before you

00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:44.670
even learn derivatives, and
it's kind of this very mathy

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.560
and rigorous thing to think
about, and you know, it tends

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.720
to derail a lot of students and
a lot of people I don't think

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.010
get a lot of the intuition
behind it, but it is

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.050
mathematically rigorous.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.910
And I think it is very valuable
once you study you know, more

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.910
advanced calculus or
become a math major.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.330
But with that said, this
does make a lot of sense

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.160
intuitively, right?

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.550
Because before we were talking
about, look you know, I can get

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:12.945
you as close as x approaches
this value f of x is going

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:13.960
to approach this value.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.620
And the way we mathematically
define it is, you say Sal,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.970
I want to be super close.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.180
I want the distance to be
f of x [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.640
And I want it to be
0.000000001, then I can always

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.540
give you a distance around x
where this will be true.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.320
And I'm all out of
time in this video.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.260
In the next video I'll do some
examples where I prove the

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.120
limits, where I prove some
limit statements using

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.330
this definition.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.370
And hopefully you know, when we
use some tangible numbers, this

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.440
definition will make a
little bit more sense.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.270
See you in the next video.
