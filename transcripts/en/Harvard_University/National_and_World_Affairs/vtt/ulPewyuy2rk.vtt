00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.250
when I was named President I was very surprised
to receive letters from young girls all over

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.949
the world and from parents and young girls
on all of the world

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.560
talking about how much it meant to them that
the President was a woman

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.420
mm-hm

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850
this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.060
feel they can do anything that the world was
open to them in a way they had wanted to be

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.060
before they've learned about my appointment

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.720
so when I went to China I went to visit and
girls' school in shanghai

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.850
and the young girls were intrigued as was
I with them

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.180
interested and women's roles interested in
how they could pursue their own dreams
0:01:19.180,0:01:21.210
and he same way

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.680
yes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.680
he said he for important okay

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.100
uh-huh

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.680
it would be important to try to continue with
this effort to reach out to young women

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.990
across the world when I did travel

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.830
I mean it is an incredible opportunity being actually addressed by the president of Harvard

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.740
and that it actually opens your eyes that she's female

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.190
and it shows how human she is
and how down to earth

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.829
and then you realize

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.290
this is what you actually need

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.160
and this is crucial to the school in south
Africa

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.770
what you guys are doing is incredible

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.380
and I think we realized that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.270
it makes anything seems possible

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.270
It was highly appreciated

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.930
and I guess I'm kind of had a sense of

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.509
an obligation to 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.709
fill that role

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.310
if it could be important to young girls

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.969
if it could be a motivation to

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.209
uh be ambitious about education and be ambitious
about the possibilities that I should use

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.489
my presidential status to follow up on that

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.529
I learned that 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.529
if you want something then you should go for it

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:45.400
the possibility of reaching Harvard is actually reality now instead of a just a very good dream

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400
So I have actually learned a lot
