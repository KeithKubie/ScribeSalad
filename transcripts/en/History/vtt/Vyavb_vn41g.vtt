00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.503
FRANK: So today we're going
to see a guy name Joe,

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.105
and he's been restoring
multiple buildings

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.973
throughout the city here.
MIKE: This is it right here.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.142
FRANK: Oh, this is--

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.111
MIKE: See, I like this.
Coffee bar.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.312
FRANK: I could do a coffee.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.080
MIKE: Hey-hey.
JENNY: Hi, welcome.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.448
MIKE: How're you doing?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.783

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:17.984
MIKE: Hey, you Joe?

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.652

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.087

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.089
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.
JENNY: Hey, Jenny.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.424
MIKE: Nice to meet ya.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.059
JENNY: Hi, how are you?
MIKE: Is this your place, Joe?

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.460
JOE: This is Jenny's.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.195
MIKE: Danielle was telling us
on the phone that you've got

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.397
a lot of buildings down here,

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.165
and you guys have been
working with Main Street.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.601
JOE: Yeah, we got ten
downtown buildings in all.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.702
MIKE: Really?
In this town?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.036
JOE: In this town, yeah.
MIKE: Really!

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.505
You guys want to show us
around a little bit?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.672
JOE: Oh, okay.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.840
MIKE: Yeah, I'd love
to see what you're doing.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.309
JOE: We've been successful
with the buildings

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.180
that we've done,
and success breeds success.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.150
People see you do it,
then they'll do it.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.486
JOE: This is the old
Hopkins County Bank.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.988
MIKE: Wow, look at this, Frank!
Dang!

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.990
FRANK: This is like
a staple of the city.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.992
MIKE: Wow, this is cool.
FRANK: Wow.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.528
MIKE: Dang, man.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.763
Oh man, look at that ceiling!

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.298
FRANK: Wow.
MIKE: Whoa.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.834
How high is that?
JOE: That's 32 feet.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.903
MIKE: The inside
of the place is like...

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.772
Ralph Lauren meets
Jeremiah Johnson.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.476
There's canoes, there's guns,
there's taxidermy;

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.646
but then you have the
backdrop of this bank.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.980
MIKE: What is this place?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.083
JOE: A place to store
stuff that I collect.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.351
[laughs]
FRANK: This is your...

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.820
MIKE: So, this is your man cave.
JOE: [laughs] Yeah!

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.254
MIKE: This is cool, man.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.389
FRANK: Gonna look around
here a little bit.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.625
You got...
This is just right up my alley.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.060
What about this item here?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.597
JOE: Yeah, that's a Warren
Paint Company display.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.998
It was in a,
you know, a store...

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.200
FRANK: Sure.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.634
JOE: ...and it sold paint
and varnishes out of it.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.803
Warren's was
a Nashville company.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.406
FRANK: Obviously
this would be quart-size,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.608
pint, half-pint...
JOE: Yeah.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.176
FRANK: ...and
just a little guy.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.344
I mean, and it's...
JOE: Yeah.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.812
And there's storage,
down below...

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.581
FRANK: Down below here,
you would actually open it up

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.349
and then you have product.
JOE: Uh-huh.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.652
But it was on the floor of
one of their stores, I'm sure.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.287
FRANK: It's a really,
really cool piece.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.455
FRANK: Whatever
you put in there,

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.656
it's gonna look beautiful.
JOE: Yeah.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.258
FRANK: What are
you thinking on this?

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.559
JOE: What would you do?

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.161
FRANK: I'd do $1,100.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.996
And I'd load it myself.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.500
[laughter]

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.934
JOE: How about 13,
and I'll load it?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.836
FRANK: 12 and we both load it.
JOE: Alright.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.204
[laughs] Yeah.
FRANK: Alright.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.806
You got-- alright.
Alright, [laughs].

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.275
You're gonna help me now!
You said, you said.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.880
MIKE: Hey, how about these
three big green lights?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.781
JOE: Oh, the industrial lights?
Uh...

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.084
I'll take 200 apiece for them.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.053
MIKE: [whistles]
500 for all of them.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.422
JOE: How many's up there?
MIKE: Three.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.957
JOE: I'd do 550 for them.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.659
MIKE: How about 525?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.027
JOE: Alright.
MIKE: Alright, we're doing it.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.362
JOE: [laughs]

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.431
MIKE: It takes people like
Joe and Jenny, collecting,

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.235
restoring, rebuilding,
to make things happen.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.803
JOE: Alright.
FRANK: See ya, Joe!

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.071
Take care!
[honks horn]

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.439
JOE: Alright,
see you later!
