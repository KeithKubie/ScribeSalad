00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.103
Voiceover:Let's say that
we've got a position vector, P

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:07.305
and it is equal to or
represented as a column vector,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.616
right over here, 2, 1.

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:12.712
If we wanted to plot this,
and that is what I'll do.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.269
Let's plot it.

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:17.202
If we were to plot it,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.102
that's my Y axis,

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:23.743
this right over here is my X axis.

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:27.252
If we assume that the first entry

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:32.759
here is X coordinate, 1, 2, 1.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.557
Our position vector is
going to be right over here.

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:37.572
We could represent it.

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:38.451
We could represent it in

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:40.903
this kind of vector symbol, like that.

00:00:40.903 --> 00:00:42.537
Where the tail is at the origin

00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:44.912
and the tip, the head, is at that point

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.472
or we could say it's really
representing this position,

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:50.353
right over here on the coordinate plan.

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:52.568
What I wanted to do in this video

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:57.175
is apply a transformation
to this position vector.

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:58.344
The way I'm going to do it

00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:01.003
is I'm going to multiply our vector, P

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.249
by a matrix and then the resulting product

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.225
is going to give me
another position vector.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:09.015
So, what do I mean by that?

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:13.354
I could have a transformation
matrix, capital T

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:23.673
and let's just say it is
equal to 2, 1, -1, and 2.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:27.092
What happens if I multiply TxP?

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:28.865
Let's do that right over here.

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:35.217
TxP, so first let's just make sure that

00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:38.772
this is actually a valid operation

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:40.734
that matrix multiplication

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.531
or matrix vector
multiplication is defined here.

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:47.072
Let's just look at what T and P look like.

00:01:47.087 --> 00:01:48.077
I'm gonna copy and paste.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.393
That is T and this is P right over here.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:03.364
Can we multiply a 2x2 matrix

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:06.128
times a column vector like this,

00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:09.106
which is essentially 2x1 matrix.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.217
Well sure, as as we know

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:13.230
matrix multiplication is only defined,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.776
or at least conventional
matrix multiplication

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:19.739
is only defined if the first matrix number

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.325
of columns is equal to the number

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:27.357
of rows in the second
matrix, right over here.

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.399
We see there, both of those are 2.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.987
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:39.478
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:43.743
What's interesting about that is

00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:45.444
that this is another column vector.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:46.841
This is another position vector.

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:48.862
You took this vector P,

00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:50.870
multiplied it by this
transformation vector

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.381
and we're gonna get another 2x1,

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.498
which we could think of
as a position vector,

00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:55.765
which we could plot.

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.179
What's essentially happened is

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.787
this transformation vector has moved,

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:02.531
has essentially given this point.

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.412
It has given us a new point.

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:06.032
Let's think about what that is.

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:08.318
This first entry here,

00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:09.618
we're essentially thinking about,

00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:12.575
we're going to deal with the first row

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:15.355
and the first and the only column, really.

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:17.453
Let me do, use a color
that I haven't used yet.

00:03:18.606 --> 00:03:21.877
We're gonna think about
this row and this column.

00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:23.965
It's gonna be 2x2, which is 4,

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.334
plus 1x1, which is 1

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:29.887
or this is just going to be equal to 5.

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:32.271
For the second entry, right over here.

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:35.521
It's going for the
second row, first column.

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.608
It's gonna deal with the second row here

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:40.024
and the one and only
column, right over here.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:46.541
-1x2 is -2, plus 2x1, which is 2.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:52.761
-2+2 is just equal to 0.

00:03:52.761 --> 00:03:55.884
Now, we have the position 5, 0,

00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:57.567
which is right over here.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:03.989
1,2,3,4,5

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.987
So, we started with this point,

00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:08.111
this position vector, I
guess you could say, P

00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.350
As transformed it to this
other position vector

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.786
and I guess we could call this P prime.

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:18.568
If you wanted to draw them as vectors,

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:21.582
this right over, kinda
tradition vector form,

00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:24.479
that right over there is P prime

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.304
and this right over here is P.

00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:31.040
This right over here is P.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.382
This is P actually, let me
make sure there's a prime.

00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:34.881
This is P prime

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.022
and the way we got from P to P prime

00:04:37.022 --> 00:04:41.315
is using this transformation matrix.
