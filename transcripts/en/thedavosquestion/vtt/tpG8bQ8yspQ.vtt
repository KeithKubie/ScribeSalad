achieving gender parity is key if we are going

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.469
to resolve the crises which we see across
the world. Personally, I think the best thing

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.000
that I can do to help is to just as an advocate,
advocate for the fact that actually we really

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.250
want to make a difference in the world. Men
and women working together is far more powerful

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.300
then men and women working in their separate
silos. Let's come together using our separate

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.460
skills and celebrate the diversity and the
creativity that comes out of an equal partnership

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.181
between men and women.
