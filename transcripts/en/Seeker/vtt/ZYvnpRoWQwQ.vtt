00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.270
Gravity from the Sun and moon work together
to give us tides here on Earth.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.740
And in return, Earth’s gravity is cracking
the moon’s surface.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.190
Talk about a bad tradeoff.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.360
Scientists have a pretty good idea of how
the Moon formed.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.920
The current theory is that about 4.5 billion
years ago, a Mars-sized object, called Theia,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.080
collided with the Earth, ejecting material
into space.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.029
This material then collected over what was
left of Theia’s core, forming Earth’s

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.850
only natural satellite.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.609
Unfortunately...we are slowly crushing it.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.109
For most of us, the moon is a cold, unchanging
structure pitted with craters from impacts.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.579
However, current images of its surface prove
that it is much more active than previously

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.640
thought.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.789
Distributed throughout its entire surface
are over 3,000 lobate scarps, which are thrust

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.969
faults indicative of compression.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.959
There is a pattern in the orientation of these
lobate scarps, suggesting that there is some

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.089
outside influence.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.079
Hint: it’s us!

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.379
Well, the Earth more specifically.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.170
Thrust faults form when one block of crust
slides up another and are commonly found on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.920
Earth in mountain ranges such as the Himalayas,
but they're also found on Mercury!

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
Mercury's globally distributed fractures suggest
the planet’s mantle has cooled, shrinking

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.509
its interior and distorting the crust.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.250
Similar structures have been found on the
moon, captured in images from NASA’s Lunar

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.770
Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.640
To date, nearly three-fourths of the moon’s
surface has been imaged, showing us smaller

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.049
versions of the scarps found on Mercury...but
with one big difference.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.250
Earth's gravity is affecting how these scarps
are appearing on the moon's surface.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.390
Without our gravity, the lobate scarps would
be evenly distributed with random orientations,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.659
but that’s not what we see!

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.729
Instead, near the equator and mid-latitude
regions, most of the scarps were oriented

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.350
north-south, whereas at the poles they were
mostly east-west.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.619
Researchers say that these findings are consistent
with the Earth’s gravitational tidal forces

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.590
affecting the moon’s surface.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.719
Interestingly, the lobate scarps are geologically
young.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.520
They are estimated to be less than a billion
years old with some of the youngest only a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130
hundred million years old.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.389
Granted, to us, that age seems unfathomable.

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.190
But they are less than 25% the age of the
moon.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.540
In relation to the age of the Universe, that’s
nothing.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.790
The age estimation comes from the scarps appearing
to cut across small craters.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
Because the moon is constantly bombarded by
meteors, the small craters are usually replaced

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.530
by larger ones relatively quickly.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.400
So, if the lobate scarps are cutting through
these young craters, they must have formed

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.629
later in time.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.430
So then what is the fate of our moon?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.379
Well, if the moon continues to cool and contract,
it is likely to form new lobate scarps, likely

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.040
following the same pattern of orientations.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.470
The shrinking size, roughly 100 meters over
the last billion years, is unnoticeable to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470
us.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.129
As the moon continues to get further from
us every year, its decrease in angular size

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.470
will far outweigh its change in physical size.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.830
Of course, in about 5 billion years when the
Sun burns through the hydrogen in its core,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.900
it will expand into a red giant.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.379
And at that point, the moon’s compression
will be the least of its worries.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.200
Do you think we have a chance of surviving
when that time comes?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.819
Let us know in the comments.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.370
Even though the moon is shrinking, it can
look much larger when it is near the horizon.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:32.349
