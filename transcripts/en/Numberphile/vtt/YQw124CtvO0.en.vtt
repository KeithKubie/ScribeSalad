00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.500
It's fairly large. There are bigger ones.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.920
But it's a nice big number, yep.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.359
And it's a particular number, it's a number I've had

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.189
some association with, you might say.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.420
This number is 129 decimal digits long,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.160
so it's probably more than your calculator can handle easily.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.640
Although maybe these days calculators are getting pretty smart.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.780
But it's something a computer could work with easily,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.680
and in fact computers have, and might have good reasons to work with them.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.280
This number has a history that goes back to the late '70s.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.640
We created this number as a challenge.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.560
I don't remember the number, I haven't memorized it.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.000
So if you'd like I could read you a few of the digits. So, 114...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.730
3816257578888 (That's four eights in a row) 676692...

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.000
357799761466 [deep breath] 120

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Brady: "Haha, alright."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.879
1021829

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.640
That's the first line.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.500
Brady: "How does it end?"

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.600
And it goes on for a while and it ends 879543541.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.320
So 129 digits all together.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
We didn't read them all, but

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.479
they're posted on my website if you want to see them.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.860
They'll be in the description of the video,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.540
and this number has a name as well, so it's got a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.950
much shorter name than the number itself.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.189
It's sometimes called RSA-129 because it has

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.580
a hundred and twenty nine digits.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.140
So RSA, those are the initials of three of us that worked on a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.000
interesting cryptographic system back in the '70s.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780
R is my first initial of my last name.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.540
S is for Adi Shamir and A is for Len Adleman.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.120
And the three of us invented a particular cyrptographic

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.900
system that's based on big numbers like the one you just heard.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.480
So where does this number come from?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.280
This number we created as part of an experiment to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.740
challenge, to find out more about the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.540
security of the cryptographic scheme

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.970
that we proposed. The scheme that we proposed was

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.560
based on products of large prime numbers.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.080
So this number has an interesting property,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.060
it's the product of a large prime number p

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.320
and another large prime number q.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.780
And you multiply those two prime numbers together and you get this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.560
number RSA-129.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.700
So that's why it was created, and we created it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.840
secretly choosing p, secretly choosing q.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.890
In fact we forgot how we created p

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.890
and how we created an q. Nobody should have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.760
known, and not even us actually

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.370
after the number was created, what those

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.739
numbers p and q were. They where multiplied

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.140
together, they're uniquely determined by

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.330
the product. There is only one p and one q that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.520
multiply together to give this number.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.940
But the security of the cryptographic

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.810
scheme that we proposed depends on

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.150
assumptions like that, that nobody should be

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.820
able to find out a p and a q from the product p times q.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.120
Brady: "Who generated the number? It was you, wasn't it?"

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.840
Yes, Adi and Len and I did that.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.080
We generated the number, we rolled some dice,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.340
we generated some random numbers

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.680
and we multiplied on some prime numbers that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.569
were near the initial numbers we

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.000
generated and then multiplied them together.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.680
So we generated them, maybe in my

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.970
subconscious somewhere it's there.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.120
I doubt it.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
Brady: "But you didn't write them down on a scrap of paper?"

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
We didn't write them down, no.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860
Brady: "Why not? Why didn't you keep them in a safe or something

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.000
so you knew the answer to the puzzle?"

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.320
Well if the puzzle gets

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.780
solved then we will find out the p and the q,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260
and if the puzzle didn't get solved, that's fine.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.020
Why risk having it get stolen or something if somebody broke

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.460
into my wallet or wherever I would keep those numbers?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.740
Finding a prime number is not

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.000
that hard actually. I mean you just

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.760
need to find big numbers, and finding big

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.709
numbers isn't that hard. Big random numbers

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.850
aren't so hard you can roll some dice

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.100
or use other methods.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.620
So we can take some big random

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.239
numbers and then you can see is that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.819
number prime? Well maybe not, maybe it's even

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.740
so it's obviously not prime.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.740
So maybe you can add 1 to it, and see if that number is prime.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.700
And there's an easy test for primarily which I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.709
don't need to go into here.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.870
But it's easy to test if a number's prime. And so you can

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.730
just search a little bit, and primes are

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.100
actually quite common. So it doesn't take

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.260
much time to find a large prime number.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.000
And then you got your number p and you can do the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.260
same thing start it with a different

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.540
starting point to find your number q.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.670
And then you've got a big prime number p and a big prime number q.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.900
RSA was a response to an open

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.480
problem posted by Diffie and Hellman.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.420
Diffie and Hellman had this idea that you could have

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.020
a way of doing cryptography called public key cryptography

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.960
where you could tell somebody

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.720
how to encrypt without telling them how to decrypt.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.430
So the idea of RSA is that the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.220
core difficulty that you give an

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.820
adversary is the product of factoring a large number.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.700
And so you might choose two

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.860
large prime numbers, multiply them

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.880
together and post that as your public key.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.130
So if I'm sending a message to you

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.350
using your public key, and you've got

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.919
posted as your public key the product of two prime factors

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.810
you do yourself need to know those two

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.380
prime factors in order to do the decryption effectively.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.840
So you'd keep those secret.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.180
That's your secret key.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.600
You don't tell anybody. You need those to decrypt.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.160
In the case of this challenge we

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.180
weren't decrypting messages sent to us,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.140
so we didn't need to record the factors.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.600
But in practice with RSA

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.850
you'll need to have one party who knows

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.039
the prime factors and everybody else who knows

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460
just the public key, the product of those two prime factors.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.690
We came up with the idea and

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.600
it seemed to work. It seemed to have the right kind of properties.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.580
It gave the ability to post

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.980
a public key in such a way that

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.560
nobody could figure out how to decrypt

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.200
something that was encrypted with that public key.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.880
But there's a missing piece then, and still now, to some extent.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.140
We don't really know how hard factoring

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.080
the products of two large prime numbers is.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.580
And so we set out a challenge.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.300
And that was the first challenge. Actually there was

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.020
many more challenges later.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.420
A whole ladder and sequence of challenges, but RSA-129 was the first one.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.920
And we said, you know, this we think is a hard problem.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
We don't think you'll be able to solve that.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.780
We put an estimate in a column,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.720
actually, that Martin Gardner wrote about this,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.139
estimating it would take

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.820
40 quadrillion years to factor this

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.639
particular product, RSA-129, and we

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.289
offered a hundred dollars to anybody who

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.090
could do it. And the goal there was just

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.600
to learn about the difficulty of factoring.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.090
If somebody could factor it, we'd say, well,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.550
you're off, Rivest and Shamir and Adleman, as to how hard

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.720
factoring is. Maybe it's easier than you thought.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.900
And so we offered a hundred dollar prize.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.800
So at the time, it was an open problem,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.200
and still is an open problem as to how hard it is.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.560
It was poorly studied at the time.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.340
There were some papers published.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.930
Not like now. After RSA

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.789
factoring has become an object of much

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.380
more study. But before then it was

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.360
more of a curiosity, and a few

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.300
people studied it. So we had to search

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.189
around to find people who had thought about

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.180
factoring. But it seems to be hard.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.700
There were no good algorithms.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.580
It's also the case that RSA is flexible in the sense that you

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.169
can choose prime numbers of any length

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.719
and build an RSA modulus that way.

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.180
So you can build numbers of products of

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.939
250 digit primes, or 200 digit primes, or

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.669
200 digit primes, or whatever you like.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.560
You can make it much more challenging for

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.939
the adversary by choosing the primes large,

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.710
larger, so it seemed like factoring

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.419
would be a good foundation,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.680
and the question really is, how big should the primes be chosen?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.680
So with RSA-129 it sat there for quite a while.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.000
I mean we had that number was published

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.819
in the late '70s. During the

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.360
'80s, not much happened.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.909
Computers started getting faster. The internet

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.069
started happening. In the early '90s

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.589
the web happened, you know, but that

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.720
number was just sitting there, and

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.120
seemingly ignored for a long time.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.440
But then in '94 a team of researchers came up with a factorization.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.719
And they used the increases in computer speed to factor

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.240
the number. They use the internet to get

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.800
a team of people all over the planet to

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.659
factor the number. They used better

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:21.520
algorithms to factor the number.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.779
And after a lot of work they were able to

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.120
produce the two prime factors that when

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.639
multiplied together gave RSA-129.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.460
And that was what a shock to us.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.780
Brady: "Was it? I mean, if everyone's working on the one

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.060
specific case, I would have thought maybe it

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.440
would be easier to crack, if all

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.980
the people were looking at the one number."

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.480
You can sort of predict the growth of

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.319
technology. So the the speed of computers

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.509
you can predict. The amount of, the number

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.860
of computers you can get together to

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.180
work on a problem you can predict pretty well.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.189
What you don't know how to predict so well

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:52.480
is the better, the improvement

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.560
in algorithms. And that's really what the key was here.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.720
Better algorithms.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.060
Brady: "Did this, like, undermine anything?

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.460
Or, like, where had the technology, where had cryptography

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.960
gone since then?"

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.140
Cryptography had evolved tremendously since then.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.880
It was, it was a surprise to us.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.200
It didn't mean that RSA was in any way disabled or dead,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.000
it just meant that numbers of that size shouldn't be used.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.360
Those numbers were too short. The primes were too short.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.600
And that was the lesson there.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.880
And that was one of the things we wanted to learn from this

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.060
challenge. Is that a reasonable size to use,

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.229
or do you need to use larger numbers?

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:26.940
People still use RSA, they just use larger numbers than this now.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.000
So, instead of a 129 digit number

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.920
they might use a 200 decimal digit number

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.440
or a 300 decimal digit number, say.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.360
So larger numbers seem to be immune

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.160
from these kinds of attacks, still.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.180
So we had offered a hundred dollars

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.560
for the factoring of this, and so we had to pay up. And we did.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.560
So, we wrote a cashier's check for a hundred dollars,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.120
and then gave it to the team of

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.460
Derek Atkins, Michael Graff, Arjen Lenstra and Paul Leyland

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.560
were the team that led this,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.900
there were many other people were involved as well,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.700
and so we wrote a hundred dollar cashier's check for them.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.180
At the time I thought it

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.310
was probably, and maybe still is, the

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.199
cheapest purchase of lots and lots of

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:01.970
computer time ever.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.740
So it really, a hundred dollars for

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.280
that much computing time was really quite a coup I thought.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.760
How do you feel about quantum computing?

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.000
So quantum computing seems to be

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.420
coming along, people keep working on it,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.280
there's quite a bit of money involved on

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.160
the research side of things. I would love

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.540
to see it fall flat on its face and

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.880
not work at all. It would be the demise

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.740
of RSA should quantum computing happen.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.500
Let's say you're the bank and you give

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.540
out two numbers, they're public, so everyone

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.420
can know them, they're not secret numbers

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.520
and everyone can know them, and we choose the number three and the number ten.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.520
The bank also have a secret number...
