reflecting on past historical events

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:24.890
reflecting on past historical events
 

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:27.080
reflecting on past historical events
it's not necessarily what I'm here to do

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:27.090
it's not necessarily what I'm here to do
 

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.870
it's not necessarily what I'm here to do
but what I can say I guess is just that

01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880
but what I can say I guess is just that
 

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.590
but what I can say I guess is just that
they make the obvious point that the

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:32.600
they make the obvious point that the
 

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.430
they make the obvious point that the
that the administration the Bush

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440
that the administration the Bush
 

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.220
that the administration the Bush
administration gave a range of

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:37.230
administration gave a range of
 

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:39.020
administration gave a range of
justifications for going to war in Iraq

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:39.030
justifications for going to war in Iraq
 

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.450
justifications for going to war in Iraq
and I think two different individuals

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460
and I think two different individuals
 

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.600
and I think two different individuals
within the administration at that time

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:43.610
within the administration at that time
 

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:45.750
within the administration at that time
were motivated by very different things

01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760
were motivated by very different things
 

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.100
were motivated by very different things
this is always the case and you know

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:48.110
this is always the case and you know
 

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:49.990
this is always the case and you know
you're you're surrounded by people who

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000
you're you're surrounded by people who
 

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.490
you're you're surrounded by people who
come with very different perspectives

01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:51.500
come with very different perspectives
 

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.859
come with very different perspectives
and backgrounds and and sometimes they

01:20:53.859 --> 01:20:53.869
and backgrounds and and sometimes they
 

01:20:53.869 --> 01:20:57.700
and backgrounds and and sometimes they
their policy motives diverge but their

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:57.710
their policy motives diverge but their
 

01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.169
their policy motives diverge but their
policy judgments converge and an overlap

01:21:02.169 --> 01:21:02.179
policy judgments converge and an overlap
 

01:21:02.179 --> 01:21:04.930
policy judgments converge and an overlap
and so I think there were individuals in

01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:04.940
and so I think there were individuals in
 

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.040
and so I think there were individuals in
the bush ministration who were very

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:06.050
the bush ministration who were very
 

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:10.590
the bush ministration who were very
motivated by the plight of Iraq's people

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600
motivated by the plight of Iraq's people
 

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.760
motivated by the plight of Iraq's people
there were people who were motivated by

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:12.770
there were people who were motivated by
 

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:15.330
there were people who were motivated by
the weapons of mass destruction

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:15.340
the weapons of mass destruction
 

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.410
the weapons of mass destruction
allegations and so forth there were

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:17.420
allegations and so forth there were
 

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.320
allegations and so forth there were
people who were motivated by you know

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:20.330
people who were motivated by you know
 

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:26.100
people who were motivated by you know
911 and you know the the pretty fragile

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:26.110
911 and you know the the pretty fragile
 

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.689
911 and you know the the pretty fragile
sort of connect the dots to that but it

01:21:28.689 --> 01:21:28.699
sort of connect the dots to that but it
 

01:21:28.699 --> 01:21:30.250
sort of connect the dots to that but it
was it was something that motivated

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:30.260
was it was something that motivated
 

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.609
was it was something that motivated
individuals so you know I think that the

01:21:33.609 --> 01:21:33.619
individuals so you know I think that the
 

01:21:33.619 --> 01:21:37.570
individuals so you know I think that the
motives are varied and and the those

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:37.580
motives are varied and and the those
 

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.870
motives are varied and and the those
sort of strands came together and and

01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880
sort of strands came together and and
 

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.950
sort of strands came together and and
convince the president who I think was

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960
convince the president who I think was
 

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.510
convince the president who I think was
probably motivated by all of the above

01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520
probably motivated by all of the above
 

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.680
probably motivated by all of the above
and more and I guess what I would say is

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:47.690
and more and I guess what I would say is
 

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:50.800
and more and I guess what I would say is
that once the war in Iraq started

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:50.810
that once the war in Iraq started
 

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:54.280
that once the war in Iraq started
because the welfare of Iraqis you know

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:54.290
because the welfare of Iraqis you know
 

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:57.430
because the welfare of Iraqis you know
quickly deteriorated it also took on I'm

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440

in the US military and took on

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:00.010
in the US military and took on
 

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:04.149
in the US military and took on
heroically really the task of of trying

01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159
heroically really the task of of trying
 

01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:07.240
heroically really the task of of trying
to protect Iraqis and and strengthen

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:07.250
to protect Iraqis and and strengthen
 

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.649
to protect Iraqis and and strengthen
security so they weren't as vulnerable

01:22:08.649 --> 01:22:08.659
security so they weren't as vulnerable
 

01:22:08.659 --> 01:22:12.490
security so they weren't as vulnerable
to attack so in that sense while I think

01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:12.500
to attack so in that sense while I think
 

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.290
to attack so in that sense while I think

but over time you know the the US

01:22:26.649 --> 01:22:26.659
but over time you know the the US
 

01:22:26.659 --> 01:22:29.160
but over time you know the the US
military had to become in a hurry

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:29.170

in late two thousand three and two
thousand four you know the the United

thousand four you know the the United
 

01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:46.359
thousand four you know the the United
States took on some of those

has capabilities today that that it
didn't have back then but it's also of

01:22:54.939 --> 01:22:54.949
didn't have back then but it's also of
 

01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:57.850
didn't have back then but it's also of
course very overstretched by having and

time which again is one of the reasons

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:08.510
time which again is one of the reasons
 

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:12.609
time which again is one of the reasons
that the president is so mindful of the

01:23:12.609 --> 01:23:12.619
that the president is so mindful of the
 

01:23:12.619 --> 01:23:16.839
that the president is so mindful of the
costs and and and the downsides of

01:23:16.839 --> 01:23:16.849
costs and and and the downsides of
 

01:23:16.849 --> 01:23:20.200

military action and so determined to
 

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.419
military action and so determined to
ensure that the scope of the Libya

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:22.429
ensure that the scope of the Libya
 

01:23:22.429 --> 01:23:25.089
ensure that the scope of the Libya
action is limited in duration and that

01:23:25.089 --> 01:23:25.099
action is limited in duration and that
 

01:23:25.099 --> 01:23:27.910

we very quickly move to a support role

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920
we very quickly move to a support role
 

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.089
we very quickly move to a support role
because there are many countries who in
