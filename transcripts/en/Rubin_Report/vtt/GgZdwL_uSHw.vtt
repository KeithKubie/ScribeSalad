1
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.700
All right.
Wow.

2
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.540
When you get back on the grid and you really get back on the grid,

3
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:37.450
we are alive for the second time today.

4
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:41.740
I am the guy on the show wearing the shirt of the show.
Uh,

5
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.800
get into that a little bit more,
just a second.

6
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.090
But I wanted to do just a live stream just directly with you guys.

7
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.480
It was great to sit down with Ben and I knew that was going to be fun.

8
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.130
I knew it was going to be kind of Cathartic.

9
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.600
I knew it was going to be a little nutty.

10
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.890
It was just going to be a little bit of everything.
Uh,

11
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.940
because after not ingesting the news since August 1st about 34 days a,

12
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.570
obviously I had missed a lot,

13
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.890
but I also had time personally to kind of work on some things I wanted to work

14
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:13.360
on,
clear out some space in my brain.
Uh,
there was a one week period,

15
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:16.000
so I actually,
the last week,
uh,

16
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.240
so all of last week before I got back on ended up being a work week.

17
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:22.390
I wasn't on my computer and I was in,
um,
you know,

18
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:25.000
I wasn't doing anything obviously on social media or emailing or that kind of

19
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:25.750
stuff.
Um,

20
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.600
but I was taking a couple of phone calls and we were doing a lot of work here

21
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.170
because as of today we launched a new website,
Dave rubin.com,

22
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:36.560
which we had been trying to get for tea at least 10 years,
maybe 15 years.
Uh,

23
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.250
there's Dave Rubin in the middle of the country somewhere who had this family

24
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:40.084
website,

25
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
but he slowly wasn't using it or he was using a less and less over the course of

26
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:46.420
a couple of years.
We're finally able to get that from him.

27
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.960
So we now have Dave rubin.com.
So all things Ruben report,

28
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.400
you can still go to Ruben report.com.

29
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.950
It's going to send you over to Dave rubin.com,
uh,

30
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.910
and all things Rubin report will be there.
You can find out more about the show.

31
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:01.240
You can also find out my live events.
I'm back into standup again.

32
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.830
I'm on tour with Peterson.
Actually.
I leave tomorrow morning,
uh,

33
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.790
to head out to Rochester tomorrow.
Then Long Island,
my home island,
uh,

34
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.110
on the sixth.
Then we're up in Connecticut.
Uh,

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.400
then on the eighth I'm doing an event in New York City with uh,

36
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.300
with Faisal and guitar.

37
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:18.910
He's been on the show and with Eric Weinstein and a couple other people,

38
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:20.880
I think Melissa Chen is hosting now in anyway,

39
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.480
there's just a ton of stuff going on.

40
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.140
It was just incredible to be away for a bit.
You know,

41
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:28.120
like I saw a couple of people on Twitter.

42
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.180
I actually only looking at my Twitter mentions once or twice today when I saw a

43
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:32.200
couple of people like,
oh,

44
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:36.790
how can you say you're like a newsperson or in the news or whatever and take

45
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:41.260
time off from all of this.
Like,
you know,
that's not possible.
And it's like,

46
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.310
actually I feel I feel more clearer on things now.

47
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.520
I sent like a little bit of clarity with some things and I think getting away

48
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:55.420
from the noise is,
is important,
is as important as being part of it all the time.

49
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:57.490
And I think everyone could use a little bit of an escape more.

50
00:02:57.491 --> 00:03:00.880
I think part of the problem right now is that we have enough escaped.
So yeah,

51
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.680
so launch a new website.
We redid the set,
which was a tremendous amount of work.

52
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.030
So we wanted the set to look a little bit more like my,
uh,
my house itself.

53
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:12.910
We want it to be a little more,
a little more slim and trim a can.

54
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.560
We've jumped to the wide shot for a second.

55
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.970
Is that possible while we're doing this?
So,
uh,
we,
uh,

56
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.900
giving me a signal,
we can't do it.
Okay.
We can't do it.
That's all right.

57
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:23.290
All right,

58
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.110
well what we're gonna do is I'm going to talk a bit about Patriana in a second

59
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.110
and we'll do some behind the scenes video stuff on Patrion.
That'll a,

60
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:34.030
that'll show you that.
Um,
there we go.
We're going to do a picture.

61
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.760
We're going to do a picture.
Okay.
Uh,
yeah.

62
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.960
So we wanted to set just to fuel a little more,
uh,
a little more minimal.

63
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.720
I love the set that we had before.
We had it for about two years,

64
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.810
but it's good to just freshen things up.
So we've got new artwork on the wall.

65
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.680
The picture that is behind me and behind the guest are done by Kaitlyn rose.

66
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.041
Janet,

67
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.810
who's done a bunch of artwork for us and I have a lot of her art in my house.
Um,

68
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.690
these shelves right here,
I don't want to brag people.
All right.

69
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.430
You can bring it back to yeah,
either way.
Uh,

70
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.160
the shelves over there don't want to brag,

71
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:07.440
but they are from Ikea and I do have a bunch of them in my house.
Uh,

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.670
in the middle of the thing there.
Uh,

73
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
we've got some of my old standup tapes from the late nineties.

74
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.730
We've got every book that is now on the set,
by the way,

75
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.430
is a book of a guest of the Rubin report.

76
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.400
We thought that was pretty cool before we had a mix of just some other people

77
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:26.080
who have influenced me and things.
Um,
we have new carpet,
new tables,
new chairs.

78
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.930
Um,
we changed some lighting things.
Um,

79
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:32.590
so basically it was just like a big reinvestment in all the things that we're

80
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.290
doing here.
I think it's good to just,
hey,

81
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:35.680
I think it's good to reinvest in things.

82
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.780
I think it's good visually just to mix things up.
And,
uh,
I think I just wanted,

83
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.170
I just felt like doing something fresh after taking a big,
a big break like this.

84
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:48.220
So new website,
a new set,
you may have noticed we have a new theme song.

85
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:53.050
So I found,
so one of the things I was doing when I was off the grid,
uh,

86
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.200
was I was listening to a lot of music and I've lately really,

87
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.280
really been into non vocal musics or just,
you know,

88
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.270
like music,
but no singing,
no words.
I get it.
You love a girl,
you lost the girl.

89
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.870
Okay.
It's all good.
Uh,
so I've really been into simply if lately,

90
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.480
which I really liked.
I always liked these sort of long melodic,

91
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.100
a sort of futuristic d but kind of eighties throwback music,

92
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.240
a interludes that,
you know,
the movie oblivion.
I really love the soundtrack Tron,

93
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:22.450
the movie.
I love the soundtrack.
Um,
Ho,
you know,

94
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.030
there's a bunch of this stuff out there.
Um,

95
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.680
so I was really into simply then I came across this guy,
marvel 83,
uh,

96
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.940
and I just loved everything.
The guy who was doing it was just while I was away.

97
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.320
It was just speaking to me,
the tenor of it,
the tone of it,
it felt like,

98
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.520
sort of real but also thoughtful and decent.
So there was a song by him,

99
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:45.700
which you can check out on youtube later,
uh,
called Venice beach.

100
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.920
And that was the song that I really wanted to be the theme song.

101
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:51.820
And we laid it in a couple of times.
We couldn't get it quite right.
Um,

102
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.430
so we ended up going with another song called every evening,

103
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:58.100
which I did just as much and he's kind of sampling his own song from that.
Uh,

104
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.000
and he's a great guy.
And,
uh,
we,
we chatted a bit.
He's in the Czech Republic.
Uh,

105
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.030
so marvel 83 if you're watching,
thank you for the,
for the song.

106
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.960
So we reinvested all that and as you can see,
the,
we have a new graphics package.

107
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:11.800
So the,
the video that you saw when we came in and the,

108
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:15.830
the lower thirds as we call them in the guest's name pop up and swipes and all

109
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:20.180
kinds of other stuff is all new.
But the real big thing.
And then I'll,

110
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.100
I'll take your questions and I'll talk a little bit more about,
uh,

111
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.010
being off the grid and that kind of stuff.
Uh,

112
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.210
the real big thing that we relaunched today was we relaunched our patriot and

113
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:31.760
now we got on Patrion in June,
I think of 2016 and I,

114
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.820
we were basically the first of these sort of political talk show things to be on

115
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:43.190
Patrion.
It was a lot of video game things.
It was a lot of um,
more anime stuff.

116
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.530
I don't know,
that kind of thing.
And we jumped in and,

117
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.740
and I've told the story before,
but the night before we launched and we had,

118
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.900
we had left our jobs at a TV.

119
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.420
We left our salaries and insurance and the whole thing.

120
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:57.200
I said to David and mirror,
I was like,
look,
this thing could go bus tomorrow.

121
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:01.520
Like maybe we really just screwed up.
And I don't think we did,
but we shall see.

122
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.760
And within hours of launching we realized that we were going to be okay on the

123
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:08.000
show has grown exponentially since then.
We've expanded the team.

124
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.310
We just had another higher actually over the summer,

125
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.380
which is thanks to you guys on Patrion.

126
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.490
So we just hired Helen who is now my assistant and assistant to the Rubin report

127
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:18.040
and she's just great and I'm sure uh,

128
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.490
you guys will meet her at some point as well.
And,

129
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.260
and we're still looking to expand beyond that and some graphics people and some

130
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:25.310
other things.
Um,

131
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.970
so the show is just grown and grown and grown and I'm really proud of what we've

132
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:29.660
built.

133
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.320
And what we realized though was we wanted to clean up Pedro cause we were in so

134
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:37.280
early that we did some things that maybe we wanted to do differently.

135
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.900
You guys know I do this day,

136
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.070
I do an 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM day once a month where I do these one on mostly one

137
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.590
on one chats with people who are the very high tier people.

138
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.530
And we realized that because I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson now,

139
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:51.410
and this is basically we're rolling into 2019 on this,

140
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:54.410
I'm about to do another like 50 stops with him,
16 in Europe,

141
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.000
which is all on Dave rubin.com.

142
00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.380
I don't think the European stuff actually is there yet because we're finalizing,

143
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.980
I might miss one or two in the middle.
Um,
but uh,

144
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.260
we've got all our dates on there and stand up dates and all that.

145
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.180
But the point is we're,
we're expanding,

146
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.880
we're building everything we're doing and we felt that I was just,

147
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.570
I didn't have as much time to do the one on ones and we want it to change the

148
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:18.260
tiers.
So in many cases,
if you are on Patriot and you're one of our patrons,

149
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.360
you are now getting more for less.

150
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.750
We're going to try to make the livestreams and Ama is this kind of thing a

151
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.220
little bit bigger and more engaging.

152
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.970
But also one of the things that I really realized when,

153
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.440
when we were off the grid was that,
look,
everyone looked,

154
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:34.910
the Internet's great.
Social media,
it's all good.
You know,

155
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:37.970
we can complain about it all the time and obviously we all have issues with it

156
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:42.620
and people are seemingly acting crazy and behaviors online or re leaking into

157
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.230
real life and okay,
all that stuff.
Um,

158
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.340
but I do think that overall the conversations that are happening,

159
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:52.730
this is a net good.
I still think it's a net good.
Um,

160
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.100
but the trolls and the haters,
not even the trolls as much,

161
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.190
but just like haters and just all that stuff are just ran sacking everything.

162
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.530
They,
they're just like going through and destroying everything.

163
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.430
So our feeling was if we can build some real community on patrion where for,

164
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.720
you know,
a couple bucks you can get in and,
you know,

165
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.890
we post all our videos there,

166
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.470
you can chat with people who you might agree with my disagree with,

167
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.590
but do it in somewhat of a respectful manner.
And if you won't do that,

168
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.300
we'll just return your money and that's it.

169
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.800
We thought it would be a cool thing to do.

170
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.420
So that's why we launched Reuben select and we posted a video this morning all

171
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.020
about that.
So,
uh,
you know,
since we launched originally on Patrion,

172
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:32.130
as I said back in I think June of 2016 we really haven't done,

173
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:35.770
I think maybe one other time we did a real push for it.
Uh,

174
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.820
but we do want people to know about it today because by being on Patrion,

175
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.250
you guys have allowed me to say no.

176
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.160
I said no to at least three networks in the last three,
uh,

177
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.690
in the last year that wanted me to join and be part of things I've said no to

178
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:53.040
bigger money offers a whole series of other things because I'm controlling what

179
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:55.950
we do here.
And we've got a great small businesses and that,
as I said,

180
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:58.750
we're expanding on that really is because of you guys.
So a,

181
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.510
here's what we're gonna do.
So anyone,

182
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:05.511
if you go to patrion.com/rubin report right now,

183
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.510
anyone that donates any amount will get alive.

184
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.550
Shout out on the stream right now.
Uh,

185
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:15.480
I've got a handy iPad here with all sorts of questions and a bunch of other

186
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.050
things.

187
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.970
So Ruben report.com/patrion and a donate any amount right there.

188
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:25.700
And you're going to get a live shout out.
Um,
and then we are going to,
Oh,

189
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.640
I,
I'm sorry.
It's not any amount.
It's level one or above.

190
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.250
You'll understand it when you get there.
Level one or above.

191
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.680
I'm going to give you a shout and if I did any amount it would be completely

192
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.280
insane and I'd be screaming my head off for the next five hours.
So,
uh,

193
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.300
or if you increase up to level one,
um,
and then let's just see.

194
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.740
I want to get this all straight.
Okay.

195
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.690
If you join level five or above while I am alive.

196
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.550
All right.
Now I will Skype with you as a thank you after this show.
That's right.

197
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:57.030
I'm devoting the whole day to it today.
Uh,
and then I head back out on the road.

198
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.130
So if you donate to level five or above,

199
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:03.300
you're going to get a Skype one on one video.
Thank you from me to day.

200
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.060
I promise you that a couple of just came in and John and Ben,

201
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.440
thank you very much.
Um,
and if you,
so level one,

202
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.380
you're going to get a verbal shout out.
Level two.
Okay.

203
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.550
Why am I wearing this shirt?

204
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:19.050
So this was our original patrion exclusive tee shirt.

205
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.930
So only people who are at the,

206
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.090
the the t shirt level of patron for the last two years have this shirt.

207
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:26.130
It's kind of fun cause I see it out in the Peterson crowds.

208
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:28.710
Sometimes people have worn it,
um,
to,

209
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.350
to stand up shows and wherever else I've seen him at one or two on the street.

210
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.270
So I went at the mall the other day.
So if you donate,

211
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:39.660
but we're not using these shirts anymore because now our new patrion shirts are

212
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.500
Reuben select shirts.
So these are the old shirts.
We've got a bunch leftover.

213
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.320
So there's a limited amount because we're not going to be printing anymore of

214
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:46.590
them.

215
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.590
So if you donate now while I am live at level or level two or above,

216
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.400
you are going to get the original Rubin report.
Patrion tee shirt.
That's right.

217
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.520
We're going to send that to Ya.
Uh,
and uh,

218
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.550
the select members are that are getting the new t shirts.
That's at a,

219
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.930
at a higher level,
a shout out to Jack.
Okay.
All right.

220
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.420
So I want to make this a little bit about that kind of fundraising and,

221
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:12.790
and talking about that.
But I also want to answer your questions.

222
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.620
I know you guys have a lot of questions about,

223
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:17.290
about the off the grid thing and just catching up on everything and everything

224
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:20.880
else.
Um,
so let's go,
let's just start doing some stuff.
Uh,

225
00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:23.080
and I'm going to go to patrion first though.

226
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:27.910
I will jump in on super chat as well.
Um,
when is Kanye west coming on the show?

227
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.570
I am pretty sure it's going to happen.
Like,
just give me a little time on it.

228
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:33.520
It's one of these things.
It's out there in the universe.

229
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:37.030
This guy operates in the universe.
We're going to make it happen at some point.

230
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.170
Um,
Yo Dave,
where do you get your shirts,
your dress shirts?

231
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:44.680
I think they're awesome.
So most of my dress shirts,

232
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.470
I'm hesitant to say it because then everyone's going to start wearing them and

233
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:52.000
then it won't look as cool.
Uh,
but most of my dress shirts are Ted Baker,

234
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.170
uh,
which you,
there are Ted Baker stores.
I think they're in a Nordstrom or,

235
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.800
or Bloomingdale's,
but I've got about five of those on rotation that I,

236
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:03.190
that I really do dig and I know people really like them but please don't wear

237
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:05.920
them all over the place cause then then it won't be special anymore.

238
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.010
And that's obviously very important.
Um,

239
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.740
Reuben always seems to come back on the grid around my birthday.

240
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.530
Nine five happy birthday to you.
Please interview Michael Notes.

241
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.670
I'd be happy to have Michael on the show.

242
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:18.720
I think there was some discussion about it before I got off the grid.
We'll,

243
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:22.350
we'll make it happen.
We've got some great shows coming up.
By the way.
I'm,

244
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.380
we've already booked out basically through October because of my travels are so

245
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:29.960
crazy.
We had to get ahead of the eight ball here,
our guests next week.
Uh,

246
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.460
probably is the biggest get we've ever had.

247
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.200
We've been in the works on this thing for Gosh,

248
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:39.460
a eight months or so.

249
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:42.520
We were supposed to have this person on in May and then there was a little

250
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:45.460
hiccup,
but next week it's probably our biggest get yet.

251
00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:48.850
And I think sort of what will be viewed as a game changing interview.

252
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.600
So I'm super psyched about that.
As I said,
I had to Rochester tomorrow,

253
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:56.200
then Long Island and Connecticut.
Then I come home for that interview.

254
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.330
Then I head out to four different cities in Florida with Peterson.
Uh,

255
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.460
then I actually have a couple of days at,
at my parents' house.
Uh,

256
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:07.910
then I'm down in a grand rapids.
We're,
we're,
we're all over the place.
So a lot,

257
00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:11.680
lots happening,
lots happening here.
Uh,
remember you're going to get a shout out.

258
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.590
If you join a level two or above,
you're going to get a shout out right now.
Like,

259
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:17.620
Jonathan,
you just got to shout out my friend.
Thank you very much.

260
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.320
And if you jump in and level five or above,
you're going to get a Skype.

261
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:24.140
Thank you from me right now.
And by the way,
the whole point of,

262
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.380
of creating Reuben select,
as I said,

263
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:30.250
not only do I want to create a community there where you can actually chat and

264
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:34.930
engage with and respond to people without just the endless noise.
Look,

265
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:37.270
that thing's always going to exist.
Look,
this is the beauty.

266
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.490
This is the catch 22 of the Internet,
right?
We,

267
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.110
we put all of these things out there or I don't know that we put them out there.

268
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:48.240
All of these things got out there,
Twitter,
Facebook,
myspace,
Friendster,

269
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.320
all of these social media things and we never knew exactly what we were doing

270
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.400
and we started being friends with our coworkers.
And then,
you know,

271
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:58.040
connecting with someone from 20 years ago who then you would never going to

272
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.070
connect with again after one connection and all of these things.

273
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:05.060
And it just became this like giant cacophony of craziness.

274
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.930
And I know how many of you care about these issues that we talked about on the

275
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:12.590
show just as much as I do.
And I think by creating a little home,

276
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.770
a little space for that,
and by throwing a couple of bucks in,

277
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:19.430
it's going to eliminate 99% of the haters.
I mean,
that's the irony.
The,

278
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.090
the anti to get in the game is so low because you can create a zillion burner

279
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:26.930
accounts on Twitter and just a million anonymous accounts and the bots have been

280
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.950
ramped up and all of that stuff,
uh,

281
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.630
that is ruining a lot of the goodness and it's making good people crazy.

282
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:37.400
So I really want it to try to create or at least foster,

283
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.821
uh,

284
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:42.680
an atmosphere where people would be able to have good conversations and my guys

285
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.710
will be in their furthering the conversations.
I'm going to jump in,
you know,

286
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:48.410
when I'm on the plane and I have time and I'll be checking in with you guys and

287
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.090
responding and all that good stuff.

288
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.120
And so the level five tier that we have on Reuben select now is the group Google

289
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:58.310
hangout.
So I used to be doing all these one on ones in a couple of groups.

290
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.980
We've expanded the group,
Google hangouts to a bunch of them.

291
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:04.100
I think there are a hundred slots total and we do groups of 20,

292
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:08.300
and then groups of 10 and groups of five,
depending on how much,
uh,
you donate.

293
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.130
And I have to tell you,
they have been amazing.
I mean,
the,

294
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:15.260
the last two years that I've been able to once a month talk to a group of you

295
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:16.460
guys from all over the world.

296
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.120
Sometimes I'm talking to people from Australia and Mexico and Japan and Brazil,

297
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.640
all in one group.
And people have gotten to know each other.

298
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.210
It's also helped me frame some of my ideas because when you talk to people all

299
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:29.780
over the world and they're every gender and sexuality and religion and all that,

300
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.380
and you go,
wow,
we're all kind of thinking about the same stuff.

301
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.390
It really makes you see how actually a small the world is and,

302
00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:42.110
and,
and that we can all care or be concerned about the same things.

303
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.840
It's pretty great.
Molly,
welcome aboard.
Thank you very much.
Michael,

304
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:48.860
how you doing,
my friend?
Uh,
all right,
let's see.
Uh,

305
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.150
do you see any viable way back to civility for a political party that is called

306
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:57.020
the other side and it's 30% of voters Nazis.

307
00:16:57.021 --> 00:17:01.580
So Ben and I touched on this a little bit earlier.
Um,
it's gonna be tough,
man.

308
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:05.540
There's a fly in here,
a fly has made its way into the new Reuben reports that,

309
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.250
um,
it's going to be very tough if you're,

310
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.260
if your strategy and your go to move is always to say that the other people do

311
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:19.580
this because they're racist.
It's hard to back out of that.
Right.

312
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.610
And this is where the Democrats find themselves.

313
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:26.480
It seems pretty clear to me after talking to Ben that there was no backing away

314
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:28.610
from that,
that if anything,
it's just gotten worse.

315
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.240
So I don't know how much worse it has to get.
I mean,
this is,

316
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.710
this is the million dollar question.

317
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:38.711
How much worse does this sort of collectivist leftist monster have to get before

318
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:45.320
it implodes?
Now,
look,
he could implode if they do really badly in the midterms.

319
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.393
It could start in,

320
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.410
but I don't want to talk about this only through an American lens because this

321
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.020
isn't an only an American phenomena I'm getting,

322
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:55.230
I'm getting messages from all sorts of people all over the world that are

323
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:57.660
dealing with this in their own countries.
Mexico,
for example,

324
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:59.640
just voted in a very left government.
So

325
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.410
<v 2>yeah,</v>

326
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.130
<v 1>I don't know how you do it.
How do you,
how do you call someone a Nazi forever.</v>

327
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:09.840
And then finally you wake up and you go,
oh,
well I guess you're not a Nazi.

328
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:13.800
I'm just an asshole.
Then you got to really turn the Lens on yourself,
which is,

329
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.050
which is a tough one.
But I do know this,

330
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:18.480
that for the last couple of months I've been on this tour where Peterson,

331
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:21.720
I've done all sorts of speaking events.
I've been back on tour,
doing stand up.

332
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:26.721
We've sold out every single show that I've done and I am meeting thousands and

333
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.960
thousands of great people out there and people who agree and disagree,

334
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.980
and I'll have it.
One of the shows we were in,
uh,
Seattle,

335
00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.120
I brought Eric Weinstein on.

336
00:18:37.121 --> 00:18:39.640
So what I tried to do at the standup shows is I usually do about an hour or a

337
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.310
stand up and then I bring on one of the IDW guys.

338
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.540
So I've brought on Eric Weinstein.

339
00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:46.240
I brought on Bret Weinstein abroad on Christina Hoff summers.

340
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.770
We have special guests come into the show in Salt Lake City and,

341
00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:52.990
and a whole bunch of others.
Um,
but in the audience I had,
there was a,

342
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:57.991
there was a black Magda hat wearing Trump supporter and I'm only mentioning his

343
00:18:58.121 --> 00:19:01.480
race because people seem to,
if you look at the world through this Lens,

344
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.960
then this is important.
And this white guy who happened to have a shaved head,

345
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:09.520
so basically look like a skinhead and he was a,
he was a liberal,
right?

346
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:12.670
So these people are flipping the script and we kinda got into it and I was

347
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:13.630
playing with both of them in the crowd.

348
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.160
They got up in the middle of the show and hugged.

349
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.340
So I'm telling you there are great things happening out there in the media.

350
00:19:18.341 --> 00:19:21.760
Doesn't want you to see it because they want to keep you in this endless fight

351
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:25.540
machine and,
and just these hate machine and all this other stuff.
Um,

352
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.040
but don't,
don't fall for it.
Just don't fall for it guys.
All right,

353
00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:34.780
quick shout outs to Jeremy Thomas,
Noah,
he and Jacob Chevy and Beth.

354
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.150
Great names,
people,
all very short names.

355
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.180
Lot of one and two syllable people right there.
Okay.

356
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.200
We're going to need some vice spray in here.
I'm being attacked over here.
Um,

357
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.400
okay.
Here we go.
I'm going to jump back into a patrion.
Um,

358
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.100
<v 2>yeah.</v>

359
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.060
<v 1>Is there any chance of an IDW summit in the future to bring together all the</v>

360
00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:58.240
thinkers?
Everyone has come to be drawn to while you guys collaborate?

361
00:19:58.241 --> 00:20:00.430
Very frequently in everyone's schedules are packed.

362
00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:04.150
It would be very exciting to bring together this group with their diverse fan

363
00:20:04.151 --> 00:20:08.020
base is for a large forum discussion.
Um,
I can't say too much on this,

364
00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:12.730
but there are a lot of discussions about that.
Um,
there discussions not among,

365
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.760
not only amongst ourselves but amongst a lot of representation.

366
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.020
We're trying to figure it out.

367
00:20:17.021 --> 00:20:21.070
So also you gotta remember Jordan and I are now on tour basically through the

368
00:20:21.071 --> 00:20:24.880
rest of 2018 and then we're going,
I think to Australia in 20,

369
00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:27.520
in February of 2019 and then maybe one or two.

370
00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:31.570
I think it's going to end officially in March.
Uh,
Sam's doing live shows again,

371
00:20:31.571 --> 00:20:32.890
Ben just did a couple of live shows.

372
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.770
So there's like a tremendous amount to coordinate.

373
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.230
The beauty of this thing is we know it's all working.

374
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.250
Every single one of us that is doing this stuff is working and people are coming

375
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:46.690
out and spending their hard earned money to listen to people talk about ideas.

376
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.890
Uh,
and as I said before,
the shows with Jordan,
I,

377
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.150
those are the ones that I'm most familiar with.
Obviously they've,

378
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.090
they've just been a true joy.
I mean,
they've been a true joy.

379
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:57.820
A couple of protesters here and there,
and I kind,

380
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.340
I've walked out and I've talked to some of the protesters and whatever,

381
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.360
but we have to just coordinate a massive bunch of stuff and also figure out what

382
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:10.660
do we all want.
We all want and need different things.
Some of us have shows,

383
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.010
some of us are academics who are now caught on the outside of that,

384
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:18.250
Bret Weinstein and Heather hiding,
for example.
Um,
you know,

385
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:20.640
somebody like Eric Weinstein,
who's been sort of the,

386
00:21:20.641 --> 00:21:24.370
the architect of this whole thing.
The guy's got a job.
He works at Tlo capital.

387
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.730
So we're trying to figure out how to figure out all of this and get all the

388
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:29.650
parts right.
And um,
you know,

389
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:32.350
one thing I can tell you for sure is there isn't a lot of ego management.

390
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:34.300
I know you'd think that maybe with all these,

391
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.050
these big names and fan bases or whatever that you'd have like a lot of that

392
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:39.970
kind of stuff.
There really hasn't been any of that.

393
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:40.990
We're trying to figure it out.

394
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:44.470
I know a bunch of you saw that picture when the bunch of us Rogan Peterson,
Sam,

395
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.200
Ben,
Eric,
me,
went out to dinner.
Um,

396
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:50.470
it's like we just had a freaking great time and we barely talked about politics.

397
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:53.980
We talk about psychedelics more than we talked about politics.
So,
so trust me,

398
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:58.150
we're,
we're working about on all these things.
Uh,
all right,
reminder level one,

399
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.910
if you go to Ruben report.com/patrion right now,

400
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:05.830
or Dave rubin.com/donate a,
you're going to get a verbal shout out.

401
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:08.260
If you jump in at level one or above level two or above,

402
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.710
we're going to send you the original Rubin report.
Patriotic tee shirt.

403
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:13.210
We've only got limited amounts of the left.

404
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:16.090
We are not making them anymore because they're going to be Reuben select tee

405
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:20.230
shirts right now.
So this tee shirt that I'm wearing can be yours,
paypal,

406
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.550
a level five or above.
Uh,
the,
I'm going to Skype you right after this.

407
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.590
We're going to shut down and I'll Skype you as a personal thank you.

408
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:30.100
I will gladly say hello.
We can talk one on one for a couple minutes.

409
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.810
Happy to do that.
Uh,
Steve,
welcome aboard and thank you very much.
Um,

410
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.580
what else did I want to tell you?
All right,

411
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:40.240
let's jump into questions for a second.
Um,
superchat loved the new set.

412
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:44.020
Keep up the good discussions.
That is the plan.
Um,
hey Dave,

413
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:46.480
I'm going to be at the Connecticut 12 rules for life event.

414
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.790
I was wondering if you're going to be opening or be part of that event.

415
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:51.490
Thanks so much.
Love the show.
A lot of people,
the good work,
I will be there.

416
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:54.220
So I opened up the show.
I do about 10 or 15 minutes to stand up.

417
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:57.400
I get everybody going and screaming and laughing.
Jordan comes on,

418
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:00.700
he does about an hour and a half.
As I've said before,
it's different every night.

419
00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:01.534
It's,
it's,

420
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900
it's been a true joy to watch and it's humbling as shit for somebody like me

421
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:09.400
because it's like,
man,
this guy changes it up.

422
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.980
He explores where his intellect wants to go.

423
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.330
I can see him weaving in and out of ideas and kind of pushing an idea further

424
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:19.780
one night and then really jumping the next night,
the Q and A's.

425
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.150
Then I jumped back in.
He does the hour and a half.

426
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:23.770
I jumped back in for about a half hour,

427
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:27.820
45 minutes of Q and a where I take some audience questions.
And that's,
to me,

428
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:28.660
that's my favorite part.

429
00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:31.120
And I actually think the audience probably likes it the most because Jordan and

430
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:33.220
I get to play around.
I get to make them laugh,

431
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:35.560
make the audience after the audience loved seeing the guy left.

432
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.510
So you're going to absolutely have a ball.
Uh,
so,
uh,
look forward to that.
Um,

433
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.230
by the way,
if you've pledged at the a level five tier or above,

434
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.860
email contact@rubenreport.com with your Skype name so that we know we can grab

435
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:52.070
you on Skype after this.
Oh,
we're actually,
if you've pledged any of the things.

436
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.580
So if you've pledged a,

437
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.210
and I need your Skype name or if you pledge and we need your shirt size and

438
00:23:56.211 --> 00:24:00.500
mailing address and all that contact@rubenreport.com.
Kevin,

439
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:04.880
how you doing man?
Thank you very much.
Welcome aboard.
Welcome back Dave.

440
00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:08.150
Where did that red chair run off too?
Okay,
so we have all the,

441
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:12.750
so we were trying to figure out what to do.
So it was a,
it was a crazy month,
um,

442
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.850
of doing all this.
Like even though we were off the grid,
we busted our asses.

443
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:19.950
Special shout out to a mirror who coordinated all of this.
Uh,

444
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.060
David and I were away for a little bit and there was just like boxes being

445
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.250
delivered everyday and things being moved.
And you know,

446
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:27.950
it all looks so easy like when you guys see it,
but it really wasn't.

447
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.000
So basically the entire set then got moved into our control room and it was just

448
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:33.740
stacked up and you couldn't move anywhere.

449
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.300
So we're trying to figure out what to do with all the stuff because you know,

450
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.470
part of me is like,
you know,
we should,
I don't know what to do.

451
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:45.110
Like I wanted to put some of it in my house.
Like I liked the stuff.

452
00:24:45.111 --> 00:24:47.230
I know a lot of people would want the red chair.
You know,

453
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.280
we have to have the green chairs where the guests set.

454
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.140
We've got the artwork that was behind me.

455
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:52.670
We've got the artwork that was behind the guests.

456
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.890
I think that maybe we're just going to just offer it to the highest bidder or or

457
00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:00.710
not even to the highest bidder.
You know what,
this is what we'll do for now.

458
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:01.910
Let's just see if something that happens here.

459
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:04.700
I have no idea and I'm just doing this off the top of my head.
If you,

460
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:06.560
if you want to make an offer on any of this stuff,

461
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:09.110
just email us with what you want to offer.
We've got the right chair.

462
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:12.710
We've got the old table.
By the way,
we've got the chairs,
we've got some artwork.

463
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.020
Pick something that was on the old site.
Make us an offer.

464
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.760
If you don't have a lot of money,
you make a case.

465
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:18.420
Why we should just send you something.
I don't know.
Let,

466
00:25:18.421 --> 00:25:21.030
let's just see what happens.
Let's just see,
uh,

467
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.120
what happens and maybe we'll send you guys some stuff.

468
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.350
I can't make any promises yet.

469
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:26.260
Let me just see what kind of response we get on that.
But that,

470
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.560
that sounds something like that.
Sounds Nice.
Um,
let's see.

471
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.530
Um,
uh,
thoughts on the war on,

472
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:40.940
in and out and thought on.
Eric Bauman's call for a boycott on the burger chain.

473
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.310
Literally as we were having lunch just now.

474
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:46.400
David said something about the war on,
in and out.
I'm a little unclear.

475
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:47.540
They donated some money.

476
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.350
Someone at in and out donate some money to a conservative cause I will be very

477
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:53.930
clear on this.
I don't know the exact details of the story yet.

478
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.530
In and out is delicious.
I get it.
Animal style.

479
00:25:57.531 --> 00:26:00.800
And now because I'm doing the Paleo thing,
I do protein style,
which is no bun.

480
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:02.000
You just get it on the lettuce wrap.

481
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.960
It is absolutely delicious and much like Chick-fil-a,

482
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.440
I'm not going to stop eating it,

483
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.190
eating it because some hysterical person doesn't want me to eat it.

484
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:13.320
So that's all I can say about that.
Keegan,
welcome aboard Dave.
Welcome aboard.

485
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.580
Shawn,
welcome aboard.
Thank you guys.
Appreciate the support.

486
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:20.180
And remember when you're jumping in at that level one or above,

487
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.640
you now have access to all of our videos in the patrion feeds.

488
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.890
So if you're sick of what's going on,

489
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:27.770
on the youtube comment section or just fighting with people on Twitter,

490
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.220
if you spend a little more time there,
me and my team will be in there.

491
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.240
But more importantly than us,

492
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:35.000
you'll be able to interact with some other people who actually want to engage in

493
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:37.940
these ideas.
And I know that friendships have been formed over these things.

494
00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:42.230
When we've done the,
uh,
the,
the group hangout things.
I've now I've,

495
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.960
I've become with some of these people also some of the one on one people and the

496
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:48.090
group people,
but I've been to dinner with some people.

497
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:50.820
We've done some business deals with some people I know people have done other

498
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:54.330
business deals with other people.
So we can actually create a secondary,

499
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:55.650
I'm not trying to replace Twitter,

500
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.900
I'm not trying to build a new internet or any of that,

501
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:01.320
but I think we can create a little bit of a home for some cool people who

502
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:05.370
actually want to engage ideas and be respectful and also meet other likeminded

503
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.890
people.
I think that's what we can create.
So it's pretty cool.
Brian,

504
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:11.720
welcome aboard Josh,
welcome aboard.
Thank you guys.
Uh,

505
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.380
remember level five or above.

506
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.230
I'm going to Skype with you right after this thing level two or above.

507
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.770
You're going to get the last few patrion shirts.

508
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.990
They're all being switched to Ruben's select.
After this,

509
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.470
we've got a couple more left and you're going again.
Did you see that?

510
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:29.850
I just whacked that fly like Mister Miyagi over here.
Gimme some chopsticks guys.

511
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.250
All right,
here we go.
Um,

512
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.790
thoughts on the loss of Austin Peterson.
Ah,
did he lose?
He lost him.

513
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.840
So I didn't even know that.
Uh,
uh,

514
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.660
like one of the only politicians I like trumped endorsed Republican in name
only.

515
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:48.360
Josh Holly also thoughts on Larry Shop,

516
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:52.710
Libertarians in lost cause district.
So first off,
I didn't know that I had any,

517
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:55.950
I guess I didn't even know that that election.
I guess it was the primary.

518
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.220
What was that?
What election was they was the republic.
No,
I get it.
Yeah,

519
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:03.090
I guess it was the Republican primary and Trump endorsed this other guy.
Hallie.

520
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.560
That's a shame.
I really like Austin.
We have a couple of disagreements.
Um,

521
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.930
but I think he's a decent guy who's in it for the right reasons.
And I,
and you,

522
00:28:10.931 --> 00:28:13.410
you haven't seen the last time,
I promise you that.
Uh,

523
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.800
Larry Sharp I had on the show about two months ago.
Really liked the guy,

524
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:21.120
libertarian running for governor of New York.
I think he's got big ideas.

525
00:28:21.121 --> 00:28:25.500
I think he's,
he's pretty fearless.
He's,
he's a good,
um,

526
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.970
advocate for the ideas of libertarianism and limited government.
Um,

527
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.280
so I hope he gets a good showing.
You know,

528
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.250
the second part of the questions was about,
um,

529
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.790
libertarians in lost cause districts.
You know,

530
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.930
nothing's always a lost cause.
And I know that argument.

531
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:45.270
There's always this argument that I now see more from the right,

532
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:50.070
but it flips every now and again.
So for example,
I'll tell you like,
it flipped,

533
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:52.560
like there used to be an argument that,
um,

534
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.790
Ralph Nader would hurt Democrats more because he was going to get more votes

535
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:00.660
from Al Gore than he would've got from George W.
Bush.

536
00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:02.520
And that probably was true.
Uh,

537
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:06.120
but now that is flipped where it's like generally speaking,
Libertarians,

538
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.570
which is the only viable potential third party thing at the moment and far more

539
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:10.404
than the Green party,

540
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.740
they're going to siphon off more votes from Republicans and Democrats,

541
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.050
which Republicans than are like,
well,
Whoa,
Whoa,

542
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:20.040
forget the third party because we don't want to risk it.
I,
you know,
that's a,

543
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:22.260
that's a short term strategy that I understand.

544
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:24.780
But if you really want to change ideas over time,

545
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:27.150
you need to start getting some of these people involved.

546
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:32.010
So I don't know that we're not getting a libertarian or even a more classical

547
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:36.510
liberal presidential candidate,
certainly from the Democrats in the next,

548
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.890
you know,
for eight years.

549
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.620
But what you can do is you can start flipping little districts,

550
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.770
probably more so in the middle of the country where libertarian ideas I think

551
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:47.390
have a better route than say in big cities.
Um,

552
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.350
you can start flipping some of those and getting some more of those ideas out

553
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:52.330
there.
I mean,
look,
why is this show working?

554
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:53.830
Why do I get the amount of hate that I get?

555
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:57.450
It's because I've given a little room for these ideas to,
to grow.
So,

556
00:29:57.451 --> 00:30:01.900
so it's pretty awesome.
Yon.
Welcome aboard at the a level one level.

557
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.810
Thank you very much my friend.
Uh,
at the level two level,

558
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:07.090
you're going to get a Reuben report,
tee shirt,

559
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.360
limited edition because they hate me in printed anymore at level five and above.

560
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.150
I'm going to Skype with you right after this thing.
Okay.
Let's see.

561
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.600
I got the meet and greet for Jordan Peterson in Westbury.

562
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:19.660
Will you be at that meet and greet as well?
So first off,

563
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.990
I'm super psyched for this show.
It's on September six.

564
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:27.070
That's my home towel.
Long as it's not a town,
but uh,

565
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:30.670
I grew up in long island.
I'm from Long Island.
I Love Long Island.
Uh,

566
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.820
grew up a couple of towns over.
Actually I will be at the show.

567
00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:37.120
So the meet and greet situation.
So this is what they do at these,
um,

568
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.010
you pay a little bit extra,

569
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:42.520
I don't know the number off hand and you can meet Jordan.
He does a private talk.

570
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:46.360
It's often for about 30 or 40 people.
He answers a couple of extra questions.

571
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:48.730
You get a picture with them,
an autograph.
Um,

572
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.250
I was just going for this last three months.

573
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.520
I would just go out into the crowd after and I had talked to as many people as

574
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:58.330
possible and it was all good.
Um,
my guys and the promoters,

575
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:01.600
my agents and the promoters said it was just too much of a mess to have me doing

576
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:04.100
that.
Um,
and also because,
um,

577
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.880
I generally like to stay as late as everyone will make.
Uh,
you know,

578
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.100
I don't want anyone to walk out there and be like,
oh,

579
00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:12.190
Ruben didn't say hi to me and all that.
So I'd be hanging around for a long time.

580
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.250
So we're actually doing a separate meet and greet for me.

581
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:17.350
So my meet and greet will be first then Jordan.

582
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:21.220
Some people are going to go to both,
some people are going to go to some,
um,

583
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.010
I don't know the website off the top of my head.

584
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.220
I think it's OMG vip.com/dave-ruben,

585
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.120
something like that.
Close enough slash Dave Rubin,

586
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:38.150
O m g vip.com/dave Ruben and you can buy tickets to the meet and greet for me.

587
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.830
I'll hang out and I'll sign autographs and take selfies and all that good stuff.

588
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.300
Um,
and usually Jordan and I,
we stay as long as we possibly can.
Uh,
so we didn't,

589
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:49.030
we haven't even really started promoting that yet cause I've been off the grid.

590
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.770
Uh,
but I'd love to meet you in Westbury if you want to come on,
come on down.
Uh,

591
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.560
Patriot.
Do you consider Majid Nawaz and Douglas Murray as part of the IDW?
Why?

592
00:31:58.561 --> 00:32:02.440
As I've said from the beginning,
I don't know that it's for me specifically,

593
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.610
certainly,
but I don't know that,

594
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:08.500
I don't know who it's for to say who is really part of this a morphous thing,

595
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:12.460
but I certainly would consider those to have them.
Uh,
the both of those guys.

596
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.300
Part of it.
Look,

597
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.500
I think one of the things that you have to have if you're in this is you have to

598
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:19.450
have an,
a willingness to have difficult conversations.

599
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:22.840
Module is absolutely having that about reforming his own religion.

600
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.530
Douglas who certainly having that when it comes to dealing with immigration

601
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:30.280
specifically,
but,
but a slew of other issues for Douglas as well.
Um,

602
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.010
but I think you also have to be tried by fire a little bit.

603
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:35.800
Those guys had been through the hate machine.
Um,

604
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.470
I think that for whatever the differences are,
you know,

605
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:43.430
Douglas a is a gay conservative,
Majid is a liberal Muslim.

606
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:45.800
Again,
all these label things like we've,

607
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:47.870
we've put a pretty diverse group of people here together.

608
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:50.940
I love both of those guys.
We had a wonderful dinner at,
at Douglass's,

609
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.360
a house with his partner and,
and Jordan and his wife and,
and uh,

610
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.250
my gene and his wife.
Just a great dinner in London while back.

611
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:01.760
So these are good people.
Where is Emma?
You know,
I tweeted out a picture of Emma,

612
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.490
14 years old,
greatest dog alive,
uh,

613
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:07.910
that we were going to be in here and she left right before we started.

614
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:11.810
So if you want to send her in,
feel free.
But you know,
she's an old timer now.
Uh,

615
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.490
Marusha thank you very much.
Welcome aboard to Patrion.
Oh,
by the way,
guys,

616
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.140
please,
if you're watching this and you did what we do here,

617
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.860
please click the little bell on Youtube and make sure you're getting all

618
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:25.640
notifications.

619
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.510
I am still getting a slew of people telling me they are not getting our

620
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.210
notifications,
that are videos never show up in their feed.

621
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.720
Youtube keeps telling me basically that you people are idiots and you don't know

622
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:38.990
how to subscribe.
Uh,
we used to have a personal contact at Youtube.

623
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.410
Then that person said,
uh,
no,
I'm not going to do this anymore.
Basically,

624
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:45.730
I'm moving on to other things.
They didn't give us another person to talk to you.

625
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.600
They just gave us the form,
whatever it is,
what it is,
uh,
with youtube.

626
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.750
Um,
but please make sure notifications are on,

627
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:57.110
or I know people go weeks without seeing it.
Are People still get unsubscribed.

628
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.990
We looked at our,
our subscription thing today and it's like,

629
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:02.990
it jumps and then it lowers into jumps and it lowers and to keep growing.

630
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:05.510
But we know it should be growing a lot faster than it is,

631
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:08.090
although it's growing quite fast.
Um,

632
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.150
one other thing on Patrion by on a youtube,
by the way,

633
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.770
I just found out this this morning,
so that we posted,
I thought,
well,

634
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.010
I think what,
we're pretty,
some pretty great shows.
While we were gone,

635
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.760
we posted a colon,
new are,
uh,

636
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:24.740
we posted Katherine verbal saying we posted Jeffrey Tucker and we posted,

637
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.900
uh,
who was the other person.
Oh.
And,

638
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:31.760
and Dr Deborah Sill a pretty interesting diverse group of people.
Um,
the Deborah,

639
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:34.290
so full episode now she's a,
a,

640
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.110
a a sex researcher and we had a long ranging co conversation on gender and

641
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:42.260
equality and a series of things that got demonetized.
You know,

642
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.350
I think it has a couple of hundred thousand views and back it monetize.

643
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.020
So that's the type of thing,
that's exactly why we're on Patrion.

644
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:50.330
If we were relying on the,
on the youtube money,

645
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:52.810
even when it suddenly gets better and they monetize things raw,

646
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.760
you just don't know what the hell is going to happen here.
Um,

647
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.390
so patrion is our way of,

648
00:34:57.391 --> 00:35:01.610
of sort of safely funding these things so that I'm relying on you guys,

649
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.220
which I guess ultimately that's not relying either.

650
00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:06.590
Like anyone can come and go as they pleased,
that's fine,

651
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:09.590
but at least we're not only reliant on that.
Um,
so yeah,

652
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:14.180
still give verbal shout outs.
Welcome aboard,
Sean.
Thank you very much.
Um,

653
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:19.190
let's see.
Can the importance of protecting the values of Western civilization be

654
00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:23.480
overstated?
No,
I don't think they can.

655
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.630
I think we don't talk about them enough and we don't explain why the values of

656
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.160
Western civilization of free speech and opening cruelly,
uh,

657
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.730
open inquiry and um,
and

658
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.420
education,

659
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.260
secular education and um,

660
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.300
and not giving too much power to any one person or government.

661
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.890
These things have all been huge parts of Western civilization.

662
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.330
These are the cornerstones of what I think will give the opportunity for the

663
00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:02.220
most people to be free this freaking fly.
Um,
I need those chopsticks guys.
Um,

664
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.150
so I think we need to do a better sell job.
For some reason.

665
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:09.300
The West almost seems to be suffering from its own success where it's like

666
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:13.200
something becomes so successful that then it breeds sort of a next generation of

667
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:16.170
people who hate it because they don't know what real suffering is.

668
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.640
So when you hear all of these young people at colleges now who are,
you know,

669
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:23.220
they're literally at colleges,
you know,

670
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:26.850
wearing designer stuff all walking around with iPhones and Nike's and all of

671
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.340
this stuff telling you how oppressed they are.

672
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.700
They have no freaking idea what oppression is.
You know what I mean?

673
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.580
You're not oppressed for being gay in this country.

674
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.160
You're not oppressed for being black in this country.

675
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:40.440
You're not oppressed for being any minority.

676
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:44.880
We have welcomed more of all of these people to this place to make a better life

677
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:48.030
for themselves.
And in almost every case it's worked.
And if you don't believe me,

678
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.020
think about your grandparents right now.
You person watching this,
okay,

679
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:55.050
pause for a moment.
Think about your grandparents here.
I'll think about mine,

680
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.173
<v 3>okay?</v>

681
00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:01.720
<v 1>Do you have it better or worse than them?
And in almost every single case,</v>

682
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.830
you're going to have it better.
And that is pretty freaking great.

683
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.680
And on top of all of the studies by a book that I have right over here that

684
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.330
Steven pinker has written about,
it's called the enlightenment.

685
00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.550
Now talking about all of the trends that are,

686
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.840
that are positive in the world where there's less mass violence and genocide and

687
00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:23.080
there's more trees being planted and all sorts of other things.

688
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.070
But it's very easy.
If you always go to the fear center of the brain,

689
00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:30.870
you can get people believing all sorts of horrible things and that are,

690
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.240
the wheels are coming off all the time and got Western civilization is evil.

691
00:37:34.241 --> 00:37:36.340
It doesn't mean it's perfect,
but nothing's perfect.

692
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.270
And the people who think they can eat engineer perfection almost always are the

693
00:37:40.271 --> 00:37:44.730
people who engineered some horrible,
horrible thing.
Okay,
let's go,
uh,

694
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.770
how much money do you use when a video is demonetized?

695
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.000
It's almost impossible to say because a,
it depends obviously on the video views.

696
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.020
What I can tell you is this,
and this is,
this is rough and uh,

697
00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:57.400
if one of my guys want to correct me,

698
00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.630
but youtube basically pays out a $2 CPM.

699
00:38:02.631 --> 00:38:07.150
So that's basically we get $2 per thousand views.

700
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.530
Um,
I can't remember off the top of my head if that's before they are 55% cut or

701
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:15.070
after.
Um,
but I think it's about $2 per thousand views.

702
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.540
So that's pretty much it.
So then you could extrapolate numbers after that point.

703
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.530
So it really depends.

704
00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:24.400
But it also now I think has to do with watch time and a series of other factors.

705
00:38:24.401 --> 00:38:28.810
So in a case like the Deborah,
so one,
um,
where I know I laughed,
I saw,

706
00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:32.290
I definitely had at least 120,000 views or something like that and it probably

707
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:35.440
has more now.
Uh,
and it probably had a great watch time cause we,

708
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:39.160
I think we did about an hour or so and it was a really engaging conversation and

709
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.330
the watch times on this channel are extremely good.
Our watch times last month,

710
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:45.370
last I saw was something around 20 minutes of video.

711
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:47.620
That's almost unheard of on Youtube,
right?

712
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.570
People Watch things for two seconds and click away.

713
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.260
So you do get some benefits related to things like that for putting up quality

714
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:56.590
content that people are actually watching and engaging with.
Um,

715
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.260
so a video like that,
I'm not going to do all the math in my head,

716
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:00.640
but we definitely lost a couple hundred bucks,

717
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:03.070
maybe a thousand bucks on something like that.
And again,

718
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.670
youtube can do whatever it wants and it's on us,
as I discussed with Ben earlier,

719
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:08.320
to figure out if there's some alternatives.

720
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.900
I know there's a lot of discussions being had about that stuff,

721
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.650
but as we figure all that out in other way,
if you,
if you care about this stuff,

722
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:18.070
join us on Reuben select and there's a bunch of different tiers and depending on

723
00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:20.790
what you want,
by the way you can get,
so this is the old Rubin report.

724
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.290
Sure you can,
there's a new Rubin report shirt.
We've got Ruben report mugs.

725
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:27.100
I autographed some stuff.
We've got the one on one hangouts.
Uh,
well no,

726
00:39:27.101 --> 00:39:30.730
we don't have the one on.
Yeah,
it's anymore,
man.
We got the group hangouts,

727
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:34.240
which we've expanded to now a hundred slots.
We've got,
uh,

728
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.470
some behind the scenes stuff.

729
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:38.590
We're going to do some more live ama as a whole bunch of other stuff like that.

730
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.460
Uh,
all right.
Let me do a little,
a little radio reset for you guys right here.

731
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.060
So I'm doing a Little Ama back on the grid.
Uh,
it's good to be back in.

732
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:49.990
Nice to talk to you guys again.
Uh,
I,
so far I've stayed away from,
uh,

733
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.090
from all that,
whatever hate may be coming my way.

734
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:53.870
I'm not really paying attention to,
um,

735
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.980
just having a good day here with my team and,

736
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:59.100
and doing the live stream abandoned with you guys.
Uh,

737
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.550
but what we are doing here is I wanted to tell you guys about Ruben select,

738
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:05.430
which is our new patrion programs.

739
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:10.450
You can go to patrion.com/ruben report or Dave rubin.com/donate and depending on

740
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:14.710
what tier you jump into,
there's all sorts of different or awards.

741
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.920
And right now if you donate at level two or above,

742
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.020
we're going to send you this tee shirt level one or above.

743
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:23.560
I'm going to give you a verbal shout out right now and level five or above.

744
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.600
I'm going to Skype with you right after this.

745
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:28.480
Or if you're a current patriot and you just move up to one of those levels were

746
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:32.680
good to go.
All right,
let's see.
Uh,
this is a good one on superchat.

747
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.330
Imagine Trump didn't happen.

748
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:39.040
What are your criteria for electing the next president in 2024 are you leaning

749
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:41.320
more liberal,
conservative,
or hopeful that liberals,

750
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.320
Libertarians will pose a serious threat to the establishment?

751
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.900
Here's what I would love to see.
Let's just,
not even,

752
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.000
Trump doesn't even have to be part of this discussion for a second.

753
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:55.240
What I would love to see and what I think will happen post Trump,

754
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.620
whether it's post Trump in in two years or if he gets a second term,

755
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:03.820
is I think that the bulk of people who are still quiet now because they're sort

756
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:07.930
of afraid of being yelled at and they're afraid of the mob and they're afraid of

757
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.460
being attacked and all of those things.

758
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.460
I think most of these people are waking up and most of us are.

759
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:17.200
These people were good,
decent people.
We disagree on some stuff we,
we feel,

760
00:41:17.201 --> 00:41:19.480
you know,
everyone feels like everything is the worst.

761
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:22.460
It's the worst it's ever been.
And the pickle,

762
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.930
political tenor is the worst it's ever been and it can't get worse.

763
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:30.760
We're not killing each other over politics yet it can get a lot worse.

764
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.410
Let's stop it from getting there.

765
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.960
But what I will happen is the outrage machine on both sides.

766
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.660
We'll eventually start crushing itself.

767
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:40.460
And I think we're seeing that on the left at the moment.

768
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.930
It'll start crushing itself and there will be an avenue for some decency.

769
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:47.720
So what I would love to see I,
this is the best situation.

770
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:49.070
And then I'll tell you what I,

771
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.100
what I think I would go for the best situation I think would be for a truly

772
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:59.770
principled conservative to run against a truly principle and liberal.

773
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.790
What you would have by that is you could have a real limited government

774
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:09.500
conservative who may be conservative on things like abortion and uh,
you know,

775
00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.940
would be for death penalty in a,
and a bunch of other things versus a liberal,

776
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:15.560
I mean an old school liberals.

777
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.060
So I would say someone more from the classical liberal family who believes in,

778
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.800
there's some sense of limited government,

779
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:25.910
but that the government when done right,
can do good things.
And again,

780
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:28.850
this is where I talk about why I still consider myself a liberal instead of a

781
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:33.140
libertarian.
But I'm always happy to have that conversation and I get it.

782
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:34.100
I am very intrigued.

783
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:37.820
I love talking to libertarians and the endcaps caps about how to disassemble the

784
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:40.580
whole freaking thing.
I think that's a really fun intellectual exercise.

785
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:41.990
Where do you draw that line?

786
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:46.250
Where is it a point where you absolutely need the government that that's an

787
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:47.600
interesting intellectual exercise.

788
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.370
I think there is a chance that we will have lanes for some decent people to come

789
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:56.750
out of what feels like a real sort of crazy mess right now.

790
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.970
I would love to have that debate and I think we will get there.

791
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.660
I actually do if we don't just tear ourselves apart,

792
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.000
which I don't think we're going to do.

793
00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:11.480
I know that's counter to what almost everyone is saying.
Um,

794
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.740
but I really think we can get to a place where having a real fight over these

795
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:20.300
ideas are real fight over policy.
Why is the death penalty right or wrong?

796
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.260
Why is,

797
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.850
why is abortion right or wrong or why is it in the federal government's interest

798
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:30.130
to even have an make it an issue?
Um,
Roe v Wade as a,

799
00:43:30.131 --> 00:43:32.750
as a federal issue versus status.
You,
all of these things,

800
00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:36.620
whatever side you're on,
we should be allowed to talk about these things.

801
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.270
And that's why it's very cool.

802
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.050
I think when we look at the amount of people that are watching the show,

803
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:45.350
watching Shapiro,
listening to Sam watching or listening to Rogan,

804
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.330
it's like there is a massive group of people growing and growing and growing

805
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:53.330
there.
Okay.
Hearing different ideas that are okay,

806
00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:57.950
watching people debate ideas and argue over things and not hate each other.

807
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.710
And I think as these people,
and they're mostly young right now,

808
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:04.820
as they gain more power and they gained more influence and they have more of the

809
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:08.810
influential jobs may be in mainstream,
I think some good things are gonna happen.

810
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:11.270
So I'm very hopeful for that.
Um,

811
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.900
do I think ultimately a libertarian could pose a threat to the establishment?

812
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.600
I think of court.
Well,
of course the answer's yes.
Right?

813
00:44:17.601 --> 00:44:22.130
Like if you gave me the greatest,
most charismatic,
really principled,

814
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:23.750
well thought out libertarian,

815
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:28.820
I think those ideas really could win out the day in,
in many,
many cases.

816
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:32.490
Especially now where there's such tumbled politically.
Um,

817
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.530
Gary Johnson obviously was not that guy.

818
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:37.080
And I hate throwing the guy under the bus cause I think he's a decent human

819
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:39.060
beings.
So I'm not throwing him under the bus.
I'm just saying,

820
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:43.530
I don't think he was that guy.
But if there was a really,
really clever,
smart,

821
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:48.270
energetic,
um,
photo Janet,
you know,
Libertarian,
no,

822
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.150
I'm not going to do it by the way people,
uh,
out there.

823
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:55.200
I think that that would pose a real threat.
And again,
it's like,
you know,

824
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.710
it's always,
people always say,
well,
do we want a,
we want a revolution,
Bernie.

825
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:02.130
I want a political revolution.
And it's like,
you know,
a revolution.

826
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:04.110
You could say political revolution because it sounds nicer.

827
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:06.990
But the more these people talk about revolutions,
think about it.

828
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:09.540
If you live in America right now,
do you want a revolution?

829
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.890
Is it that bad that you want to revolution?
Probably not.

830
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.620
It doesn't mean we can't make it better,
but it,
the,

831
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.610
the way we talk about these things is very dangerous.

832
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.400
This is still a freaking good place and I'm going to keep fighting to,

833
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.800
to make it better.
All right,
let's jump back to our,

834
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:30.780
give a couple shout outs here.
Steven Ryan,
Max.
Welcome aboard guys.

835
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:31.920
A level one or above,

836
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:35.430
you're going to get a verbal shout out level two or above the last few original

837
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:39.990
Patrion Rubin report shirts because we're going Reuben select shirts after this,

838
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.970
uh,
and level five or above.

839
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:46.520
I'm going to Skype with you right after patrion.com/ruben report and Rubin

840
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.440
report.com/donate.
And remember the,

841
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.140
the wider idea here is not only are you funding this show,
but I promise you,

842
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:55.080
once you download that Patriot App and look what's going on in the feed there

843
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:56.670
and see those conversations,

844
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.980
there'll be conversations that you want to be part of.

845
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:02.130
And it doesn't matter if you're anonymous or using your real name as long as

846
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:04.650
you're doing it kind of respectfully and decently.
And by the way,

847
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.250
if a massive amount of trolls decided to suddenly pay me to,

848
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.910
to ransack the place,
we'll,
we'll just boot him.
I don't want their money.

849
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:16.560
So I'm exercising,
I guess a little bit of control over over the,

850
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:19.470
the big thing,
the big monster that the Internet has come.

851
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.970
If you've joined at any level,
by the way,

852
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:24.750
and we're going to send you a tee shirt or if we're going to do a Skype with you

853
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:26.100
or anything,
uh,
email us,

854
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:29.280
contact that Rubin report.com and as long as I'm talking about that,
uh,

855
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.430
somebody asked before about the set,
if you want any of the old set stuff,

856
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.280
we're still trying to figure it out.
What to do.
Make me your best offer.

857
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:38.220
Make us a pitch.
Either a financial pitch or a,
I don't know.

858
00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:40.830
Whatever the hell you are.
What,
tell me something.
Tell me something fun.

859
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.920
Contact Rubin,
report.com.
I doubt we're going to part with the red chair.
Uh,

860
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.190
cause I think we're keeping that for when I do bigger panels,

861
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.410
but we've got the two guest chairs,
we've got the table,

862
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:52.740
we've got some artwork and a bunch of other stuff.
I don't maybe make an offer.

863
00:46:52.741 --> 00:46:57.240
Let's make,
make me an offer I can't refuse.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
Um,

864
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:01.550
here we go.
Um,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,

865
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.890
um,
do you think all leftists agenda and I mean,

866
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:09.120
black lives matter or me too or Europe,
immigration is controlled centrally.
Uh,

867
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.200
it,
it can be something more than stupid people talking about equality,
I think,

868
00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:16.980
you mean can't,
um,
I don't know.
I got into this a little bit with Ben.

869
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:19.800
Like all of these things these days,
it's like,
you know,

870
00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:23.760
these Twitter campaigns to attack people and all these anonymous accounts that

871
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:27.030
kind of look the same and use the same language.
And it's like,

872
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.280
is there some central controlling of this?
And it's,
look,

873
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:34.390
I'll go down a conspiracy theory.
I'm happy to do that.
But,
uh,

874
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.010
as Carl Sagan said,
and as I quote,

875
00:47:36.011 --> 00:47:39.190
often extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

876
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:43.570
So I would need some actual evidence to see that there are really coordinated

877
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:46.630
centralized campaigns on all of these things.

878
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.990
I think there are some high level talks about all of this.

879
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:57.040
So there's no doubt that the BLM people are talking to the me two people and

880
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:58.900
they're talking to these people in that people.

881
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.580
And that there's a coordination of all of this stuff,
um,
at some level,

882
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:06.010
but I don't know that it all trickles down.
It's hard to,

883
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.160
it's hard to really understand.
I guess that's a little bit part of the problem,

884
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:12.400
but it's also weird how it seems to be happening in all these countries all at

885
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:15.190
the same time.
Uh,
you know,
fortunately I think,
you know,

886
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:19.900
America has one great leg up on the rest of the world,
which is,

887
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.590
um,
our first amendment,
our right to free speech.

888
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:25.240
And not to say other countries don't have free speech,

889
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:29.560
but it is so enshrined as the First Amendment,

890
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:34.561
the most important thing you can have is our ability to express ourselves.

891
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.660
And as long as we have that and the government doesn't take that away,

892
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.550
we can fight these bad forces.

893
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:42.400
It's what I'm doing every day and I suspect many of you are doing in your life.

894
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.470
Uh,
shout out to James and shout out to Luke.
Welcome aboard.
Um,
all right,

895
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:52.270
let's see.
Uh,
Dave,
how's Your Gaming Hobby with Collin going?

896
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:55.240
What are you enjoying?
Will you be streaming on twitch with friends?
So we've,

897
00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:59.320
we've thought about maybe doing a s a twitch thing or a little more with video

898
00:48:59.321 --> 00:49:03.040
games in general.
I think maybe I would do something like that just purely,

899
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.340
purely for fun.
Um,

900
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.720
as I've been traveling I haven't had as much time to be jumping in.

901
00:49:07.721 --> 00:49:11.380
I do have an intent to switch cause one of you guys sent me one and a,

902
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:14.170
I've taken that on the road a little bit but I'm also trying to write,

903
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:17.080
I'm trying to read,
I'm also just occasionally trying to catch up on some sleep.

904
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.780
So like I'm a little bit like sort of between things.

905
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:23.080
My brother visited for a week and we played a ton of NBA live.
We were playing,

906
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:25.750
I was the uh,
the 91 trailblazers.

907
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:29.840
He was usually the 86 Celtics.
We split a couple games,
played,

908
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:34.390
played some Mario Kart with my nephew.
Um,
we played,
um,

909
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.850
what's that game that everybody was telling me to get?

910
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:40.840
Not Smash Brothers the game.
It's Sorta like contra on ps four.

911
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.660
You blow up a whole bunch of shit with eighties video game camp or eighties

912
00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:48.400
movies,
characters bust,
Bang,
bust,
bust,
but not bang bus.
That's something else.

913
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.310
Um,
Bob,
uh,
somebody helped me with this.

914
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:53.410
Someone will throw it in the comment section.
You're a button,

915
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:56.740
you can be like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and all these guys

916
00:49:56.741 --> 00:50:01.630
and Chuck Norris and you're blowing stuff up and a boom bust,

917
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.520
bust,
bang,
boom,
something or something.
Um,
let's see.
All right,

918
00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:09.250
I'll move on,
but somebody get me that way.
Yeah.
Um,

919
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:11.860
let's see.

920
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.090
Have any of the commenters you've hosted in formed or deeply impacted your

921
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:18.130
beliefs?
Um,
well look,

922
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:21.460
I've certainly been influenced by people and I try to keep an open mind and

923
00:50:21.461 --> 00:50:23.500
really hear people.
I really do.
I think you,

924
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:26.500
most of you guys know that that first time I had Larry elder on when we were

925
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:30.260
discussing racism and he just beat me into a pulp.

926
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.990
Um,
I think you know,
that that was one of my wake up moments.

927
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.740
Obviously Larry has really affected me.
I would say this.

928
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.920
I would say that being on tour with Jordan,
it's,

929
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:43.070
it's been a privilege and it's been a life changing thing.
I mean look,
this is,

930
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.330
this guy is probably the top public intellectual we have in the world right now.

931
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.800
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that,
the most influential at least.
Um,

932
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.450
and as we go from sold out city to sold out city and I watch him as I said

933
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:59.750
before,
explore his own intellect,
challenge his own beliefs,
you know,

934
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:00.770
go away for a week.

935
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:03.890
So he could do these couple events with Sam Harris where they went at it

936
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:07.640
intellectually and then see how that changes the way Jordan talks about this or

937
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:09.470
that and does it all respectfully.

938
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.510
And how also he survived the hate machine and the awful articles and all of
that.

939
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.810
If anything,
they've all made him stronger.
I would say.

940
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:22.310
He's moved me a little bit on,
you know,
I bought,

941
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.760
I think I've always understood the archetypal stuff and the need for stories and

942
00:51:25.761 --> 00:51:26.510
things like that.

943
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:31.510
He does bring it back to why he thinks the west basically needs those stories

944
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:37.460
through a religious prism to survive what's going on right now.

945
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:38.241
I think that's a,

946
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.180
that's a really interesting point that I've been thinking a lot about.

947
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:44.300
I thought about it a lot actually when I was away.
Um,

948
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.390
so these guys have all influenced me in different ways.
Um,
you know,

949
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:51.080
Eric Weinstein not only brilliant mind on economics and math and all that,

950
00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.230
but there's such an empathy.
There is a human that I think I've,

951
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:58.580
I've taken some of that in.
Um,
look,
I get to sit with great,

952
00:51:58.581 --> 00:52:00.650
incredible people that not only do I get to interview,

953
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:05.240
but many of whom have now become my friend.
It's,
it's awesome.
It's great.

954
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:07.280
And if you weren't effected by these people,
you know,

955
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:09.860
I said this at the end of the last show with Jordan before we took the break,

956
00:52:09.861 --> 00:52:11.160
I was like,
you know,
it's,

957
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.780
you guys get to come here and be with him for two hours and experience this.

958
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:17.060
And I know how important it is for you guys.
Well,

959
00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:19.190
I've been on tour with the guy for months and you know,

960
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:21.410
we have private time in the,
in the green room before,

961
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:25.520
and we talk about some of the things that we're struggling with or,

962
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:28.490
or thinking about or whatever it is.
And it's like,
man,

963
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:30.700
if you don't change after you do something like that,
I,

964
00:52:30.701 --> 00:52:33.260
I don't know what would change you.
So the best I think I can do is keep,

965
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.240
keep exploring my own thoughts,
keep seeing where,
uh,
where the truth takes me.

966
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:39.321
All right,
Ruben,

967
00:52:39.321 --> 00:52:43.460
report.com/donate we now are Reuben select where we're building a really great

968
00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:44.930
community.
I'd love to get that number.

969
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:46.370
I'm not worried about the financial number.

970
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:50.720
What I would love to do is I think we have about 4,700 patrons.
I'd love,

971
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:54.920
I'd love to get that to a to 5,000 in pretty short order to really help build

972
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.860
out that community over there.
And I think,
uh,
you guys will really dig what,

973
00:52:58.861 --> 00:53:01.070
what's going on over there.
We have a special feed.

974
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.640
So basically if you go to level one,
if you go to the $5 a month tier,

975
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.940
you'll have access to all of the bid.
Every video we post on youtube,

976
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.010
you'll have access to in the patrion feed.

977
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:13.130
And then you'll be able to interact with some more likeminded people without all

978
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:15.860
the,
all the craziness.
If you go to level one or above,

979
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:18.770
I'm going to give you a verbal shout out right now.
Level two or above.

980
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.980
You're going to get a tee shirt,
the classic as we call it,

981
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:26.040
Ruben report tee shirt that is no longer being produced and a level five or

982
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:28.140
above.
We're going to give you a Skype thank you.

983
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:33.120
Immediately after the livestream.
Okay.
Oh,
the video game people,
Bro.

984
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:35.010
Force.
I don't know what the hell I said.
Bang bus.

985
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.300
I knew it was something like that.
It's Bro Force,
not bang bus.
Okay.
Very good.

986
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.950
Um,
thoughts on a Reuben report,
movie night or Ruben report.
Book Club.

987
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:46.590
We're thinking about both of them and we almost included both,

988
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:51.180
both two different degrees in this new Reuben select a tier thing that we're

989
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:54.630
breaking down,
but we,
we bit off a tremendous amount this summer.
As I said,

990
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:59.040
we expanded the team with a new hires.
We built out the new set,
the new website,

991
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:03.240
Dave rubin.com.
Um,
just the new graphics,
new music.

992
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.360
It was like a whole slew of stuff.
Um,

993
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:10.350
so we didn't feel we could lay that out and have it done properly immediately,

994
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.760
but especially,
especially,
I love the movie night one,
the book ones great.
Uh,

995
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:15.331
the movie night.

996
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:18.150
I just think maybe it would be a little more fun and as a less of a lift for

997
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:20.940
people.
Um,
so just a little,
a little patience on that.

998
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:23.460
I think you guys know we've been pretty positive.
Uh,

999
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.670
we've been pretty good I should say about,
uh,
you know,

1000
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:30.360
following through with the things that I talk about here.
So,
uh,
let's see.
Keep,

1001
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:33.320
uh,
keep believing in us and we'll keep going.
Patron,

1002
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.590
how do you discuss ideas without hatefulness turning the topic negative because

1003
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:40.590
I'm losing people.
I considered friends over a rational question.
Okay.

1004
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.850
I'm really glad you asked this.
I get asked this all the time.
Uh,

1005
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:45.930
and I want to tell you a little insider,

1006
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.460
something that happened to me during the break.

1007
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:52.380
So I mentioned to you guys that I had a,
uh,
a very good friend,

1008
00:54:52.381 --> 00:54:56.310
lifelong friend,
uh,
that about a year ago,
um,

1009
00:54:56.311 --> 00:55:00.450
we met at a bar and he just went on a row.

1010
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.590
We hadn't seen each other in awhile,

1011
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:05.790
but he just went on a relentless assault about politics.
He Ma,
you know,

1012
00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:09.990
he's got a,
he's massively anti Trump.
He's a progressive lefty.
Okay,
fine.

1013
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:14.640
That's no problem.
I have,
I was that and I have many friends that are still left,

1014
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:16.560
these and all of that,
but he went on this,

1015
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:22.050
what became a very personal attack to me.
At one point I paused him and I said,

1016
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:27.000
do you think it's possible that I believe what I believe as much as you believe

1017
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:30.510
what you believe?
And he looked me straight in the eye and said,
no,
and I thought,

1018
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:33.560
this is crazy.
This is someone I know my entire life.
You're attacking life.

1019
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.980
My very integrity.
Now after that,

1020
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.670
we didn't talk for about eight months or so.
Um,

1021
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.670
he sort of called me and left sort of a half a poly.

1022
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:47.280
I actually paid the bill for both of us and I just walked out of the bar.

1023
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:49.830
I've never done anything like that.
And I think you guys know,

1024
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:53.760
this is not how I conduct conversations,
right?
So I wasn't,

1025
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:55.820
I wasn't happy with it.
But,
um,
we,

1026
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.610
we basically lost contact for about eight months over these last couple of
weeks,

1027
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:04.140
uh,
had this little break here.
He and his wife came over for dinner and I,

1028
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:07.860
in my mind,
I was thinking,
look,
if,
if he wants to go down that route again,

1029
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.700
then even me,
even someone who,

1030
00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.350
who is willing to engage in all these ideas,

1031
00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:15.900
willing to talk to people I disagree with,
but I won't be,

1032
00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:18.750
I won't be personally insulted or personally attacked.

1033
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.700
And I made it clear that I was off the grid anyway.

1034
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:24.190
So we weren't going to talk about current events.
Um,
so we didn't,

1035
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.560
we didn't talk about current events,
we didn't get into any of that stuff.

1036
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:30.550
We just talked about kids and basketball and video games and whatever else there

1037
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:35.440
is movies and whatever.
Um,
and,

1038
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:39.970
and but my feeling was if it goes down that route,
well then I gotta end this.

1039
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.200
Like I don't need a,

1040
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:45.880
a friend in this case who is just going to personally attack me.
Like I'm not a,

1041
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.070
I'm a decent human,
but I'm not a punching bag.

1042
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.380
And I think that's how a lot of you guys feel too.

1043
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:54.130
It's like you can keep making overtures to try to explain yourself.

1044
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.180
You can keep saying,

1045
00:56:55.181 --> 00:56:57.550
well I believe this and this and this and that's different than you.

1046
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:59.260
And the person goes,
well you're racist.
And you go,

1047
00:56:59.261 --> 00:57:00.670
well I haven't said anything racist.

1048
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.300
You can only do that so many times when you have to have some self respect.

1049
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.440
So I think this is a little bit different for everybody,
but it's a,

1050
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:13.690
it's a really tough one,
right?
It's a really,
really tough one.
Where do you say,

1051
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:17.640
well,
I cannot do this anymore or I need a break from this,
whether it's a,

1052
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.340
a friend or a family member or something else.
Um,

1053
00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:26.460
I think the best thing that you can do is try consistently to be as human as you

1054
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:31.330
can with them.
I,
it sort of sounds cliche,
like what does that really mean?

1055
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:36.331
But it's like try always to really like look at them,

1056
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:38.950
get close,
get clothes in there,

1057
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:43.540
look at them and you got to tell me I'm a racist to my face because I believe in

1058
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:45.670
states rights or whatever the hell it is.

1059
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.970
And it's like their arguments have become really,

1060
00:57:48.971 --> 00:57:52.480
really thin and that's why they're so angry all the time.

1061
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.160
I had one other quick thing.
We had another couple over here.
Uh,
and uh,
the,
the,

1062
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.220
the boyfriend who I'm less friendly with who was a,
again,
a big lefty,

1063
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:03.510
but I'm happy to do our thing.
We got into it over politics and,

1064
00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:06.060
and he was really,
you know,
he's coming at me with a lot of it,

1065
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:10.030
just general talking points in the left,
systemic racism,
all of these things.

1066
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:12.190
And the Republicans are so mean and Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1067
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.010
And I kept coming back with good arguments,
good arguments,

1068
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:17.020
good organs and it kept escalating and kept escalating.

1069
00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:21.610
And there was a moment where I knew I could go in for the kill and if I went in

1070
00:58:21.611 --> 00:58:23.800
for the kill,
either he was going to come around to,

1071
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:28.600
he was going to wake up enough,
let's say,
or he was going to go crazy.

1072
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.460
Like it was not,
the night would have been a blowout.

1073
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.520
And because I was on this break and off the grid and everything else,

1074
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.350
I just wasn't up for it.
So like all right,
when I had him there,

1075
00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:40.900
I let it go and then we'll continue that conversation.

1076
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.730
So you got to figure out what works for you.

1077
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:45.790
But I know it's not easy and it doesn't and it doesn't feel good to turn the

1078
00:58:45.791 --> 00:58:49.180
other cheek all the time.
And some point when you're getting abused long enough,

1079
00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:53.020
you got to speak up for yourself.
Um,
okay.
People.
Ruben,

1080
00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:56.470
report.com/patriot and I want to read off a couple more your names.

1081
00:58:56.471 --> 00:59:00.370
If you join in at level one,
I'm going to read your name right now.
Live.

1082
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:03.550
Shout out for Ya.
Uh,
it's also,
uh,

1083
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.110
Dave rubin.com/donate.
Uh,

1084
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:09.850
if you jump in at level one or above a,
we're going to do a,
a,

1085
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:11.950
a verbal shout out for you right here.
Level two or above.

1086
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:15.160
You're getting their shirt a level five or above.
I'm going to give you a Skype.

1087
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:19.060
Thank you right after this.
Uh,
okay.
Yeah,
you can go to Rubin,

1088
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:23.660
report.com/donate and figure out what you want to do over there.
Okay.
Uh,

1089
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:25.990
and also by the way on this,
uh,
on these livestreams,

1090
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.751
then I'm going to keep doing,

1091
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:30.170
we're always going to prioritize the patrion questions because so many things

1092
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:34.910
fly in a that I'm going to give preference to the people who,

1093
00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:39.860
who are the,
who are the supporters,
uh,
so to speak.
Um,
let's see.

1094
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.840
Um,
there is no utopia.
So in systems designed for societies,
we was,

1095
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.490
we must always grade on the curve.

1096
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:50.450
The United States is clearly on the top of that curve for benefits to mankind by

1097
00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:53.270
a large margin.
Is there any country that comes close?

1098
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.010
So I basically agree with you here.

1099
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:58.640
This is the line about all these people that want utopia ended up bringing us to

1100
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:02.300
dystopia because they think if they can just manage everything with central

1101
01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:06.530
planning and big government,
that good people and good things will happen.
Well,

1102
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:10.760
it rarely does when you keep giving power to some centralized thing that's above

1103
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:14.840
you.
Okay?
So in terms of benefits to mankind,
by a large margin of the ad,

1104
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:17.720
the United States has done more good.
Yes,

1105
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:21.620
I know people love to dog about this or that and have we made mistakes and,

1106
01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:23.600
and gone to wrong wars.

1107
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:26.690
And all of these in all countries have done terrible things.

1108
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:29.720
And if you want to be part of the international community,

1109
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:32.120
you're gonna make mistakes.

1110
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.790
And we're going to have presidents that aren't going to be perfect and who are

1111
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:37.250
going to do things that one half of the people don't like,

1112
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:40.610
and that the other half of the people don't like in all of these things.
Um,

1113
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.380
but I just fundamentally believe that the freedoms that we have in the United

1114
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.140
States are our freedoms.
That if they were everywhere,

1115
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:50.900
and I'm not saying we should nation state and force these freedoms on everyone,

1116
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:53.060
but imagine if every country in the world,

1117
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.360
if all people on this earth had the freedoms that you,

1118
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.860
if you're watching this in the United States,

1119
01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:01.430
imagine if people everywhere had the exact freedoms that you have.

1120
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.510
Why is it that when,
when we've done,
uh,
you know,

1121
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.140
gigs in London or in Canada or in some other places,

1122
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.770
people are starting to become more and more concerned about free speech because

1123
01:01:12.771 --> 01:01:16.490
they don't have the protecting the protections that we have.
So we've got,

1124
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.270
we've got great things here and we shouldn't forget them.

1125
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.570
And it doesn't mean you have to bow to the United States all the time.

1126
01:01:23.571 --> 01:01:28.270
It doesn't mean you have to say we're flawless and,
and all that.
Uh,

1127
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:33.310
but it means that you have to respect what are our founding fathers built

1128
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.280
because they built something pretty great that gives more power to you than the

1129
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:38.150
people above you.

1130
01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:41.870
And don't just give that up because it sounds good or it's easy.
Uh,

1131
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:46.140
shout out to Agnes.
Welcome aboard.
patrion.com/rubin report.
All right,

1132
01:01:46.141 --> 01:01:48.140
so I'm gonna go a little bit longer.
And then,
uh,
we,

1133
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:49.370
we've obviously had a long day here.

1134
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:53.360
I got early flight to Rochester and then we'll go from there.
Um,

1135
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:58.370
let's see,
uh,
um,
Doo Doo,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo,
Doo Doo.
The,

1136
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.490
um,
what's the rational counter to the intellectually dishonest word police that

1137
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:06.830
aggressively ignores context.
For example,

1138
01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:11.360
the monkey it up story or Connor dailies father comments from the 1980s.

1139
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:14.490
So I don't know the second one as for the monkey it up story.

1140
01:02:14.491 --> 01:02:16.880
So I just heard about this with Ben and hour ago.
Obviously,

1141
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:20.160
I didn't know the news until,
until that,
uh,
and the,

1142
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.190
you should watch the video where I give a good explanation on this,
but look,

1143
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.940
Howard Cosell as I mentioned,
was fired from,

1144
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:30.720
I think it was CBS after being basically the biggest sports broadcaster in the

1145
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:34.440
nation because he said something about a black football player monkeying around

1146
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:35.100
or something.

1147
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.730
And it turned out because the guy had jumped over somebody else while playing

1148
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:39.271
football.

1149
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:41.700
And it turned out that that's what he used to say about his grandkids as they

1150
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:46.290
were like wrestling with each other.
He used to call the monkeys.
Was He racist?

1151
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.330
Um,
you know,
did,
is there is sensitivity there perhaps?

1152
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.190
Um,
but yes,
this intellectual dishonesty where we're like,

1153
01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:01.950
where were gerrymandering the truth?
Actually,
that's,

1154
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:04.320
I guess what we're doing,
um,
is,

1155
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:09.321
is terrible and someone should not be fired for a verbal gaffe.

1156
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:13.770
Uh,
you know,
look,
it's up to a private company to do whatever they want to do.

1157
01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:14.910
Okay.
That's one thing.

1158
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.640
But unless you have a history of racism or do something that is truly,

1159
01:03:20.641 --> 01:03:24.900
truly racist,
not just use a word in a way that someone else doesn't like it,

1160
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:30.000
we're going to get to a place where everyone will be afraid to speak.
Actually,

1161
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.560
that is one of the things that came up when I,

1162
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:34.550
when I would see people at the hardware store,

1163
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.350
at Starbucks or whatever for the past month and people would come up to me and

1164
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.040
there has our hazard off the grid and Dah,
Dah.

1165
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:43.950
Many people would tell me something like,
oh,
I wish I could,
uh,
you know,

1166
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:47.190
just get off the grid.
I Guy,
I can't do it.
Whatever my job,
I can't do it.

1167
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:47.641
I don't know.
I mean,

1168
01:03:47.641 --> 01:03:50.550
everyone I think can do it for at least for a little time and maybe not for a

1169
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.510
month.
Um,

1170
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:56.130
but a lot of people were saying how they've really self selected out that

1171
01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:58.980
they're getting on Facebook much less.
They're tweeting much less.

1172
01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:02.850
They're checking newsfeeds less.
Look,
that's good in a,
in a short term,

1173
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:04.130
at some level.
Because if it's,

1174
01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.930
if you're distracted by that or it's making you frustrated or giving you a

1175
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:10.170
headache or giving you short term memory loss or all sorts of things.
Okay,

1176
01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:13.440
all good to,
to control that,
that's fine.

1177
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.050
Where it becomes bad is when,

1178
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.840
if all the good people start self selecting out,
then we got all the,

1179
01:04:19.841 --> 01:04:22.920
the bad people in the haters and the angry people that are running the whole

1180
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:26.010
conversation.
Now we've got a problem there.
Again,

1181
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.550
this is partly why we wanted to do this Reuben selecting because I think we can

1182
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:33.390
start building some community around some of the right ideas.
So it's Ruben,

1183
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:38.391
report.com/donate or patrion.com/ruben report.

1184
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:42.540
Kirk,
thank you Mike.
Thank you.
Um,
all right,
here we go.

1185
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:44.550
Level five or above.

1186
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.710
I'm going to Skype with you right after this level two or above,

1187
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:48.350
you're going to get this Ruben report tee shirt,

1188
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.620
which is not being printed anymore.

1189
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.170
Level one or above verbal shout out right now.
We'll do,

1190
01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:53.970
we'll do maybe 10 or 15 minutes more here.

1191
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.630
So get in some good questions here if you can.
Um,

1192
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.260
so if Trump can avoid any major scandal and keeps us out of war,
what each,

1193
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:04.830
what chance do you think?
Uh,
he has,
uh,
being reelected in 2020,

1194
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.160
so I'm just catching up on some of the stuff that Ben enlightened me on that's

1195
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:10.800
happened with Trump over the last little while with this Michael Cohen stuff.

1196
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:13.980
And the rest of it,
I would say short of being impeached,

1197
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:16.920
if the Democrats win the house by a landslide and then just impeached the guy

1198
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.861
short of that,

1199
01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:21.820
if the Democrat path is to keep going down with the democratic socialist,

1200
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:26.860
then I suspect Trump will be reelected.
I think that that fringe thing,

1201
01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:29.290
which seems like it's mainstream because the mainstream loves it,

1202
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:32.500
but it's a fringe set of lefty ideas.
Um,

1203
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:36.460
progressivism is not mainstream.
Most people do not buy into this.

1204
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:38.560
Most people do not buy into identity politics.

1205
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.860
Most people do not buy into big government.
Most people don't.

1206
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:43.870
They want to live and let live and that's it.

1207
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:47.440
And I think that the Republicans are better suited to carry that mantle.

1208
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:50.260
They fail at it often and they fight,
you know,

1209
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:53.530
they'll tell you about low taxes and low spending and then they never freaking

1210
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:57.610
do it,
but they've got a little bit of a better insider track on that than the

1211
01:05:57.611 --> 01:06:01.150
Democrats.
If the Democrats decide to become a little more moderate,

1212
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:05.410
find some old decent liberals,
find their JFK,
find there,
Daniel,

1213
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:09.310
Patrick Moynihan,
etc. Then I think there's a chance,
but I don't think anyone,

1214
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:10.420
well,
let's look at it this way.

1215
01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:16.000
I don't think anyone that voted for Trump in 2016 if the Democrats keep going

1216
01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:18.040
down that road is going to be like,
oh,

1217
01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:20.410
the Democrats are the better option than this.
Right?

1218
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:23.920
If the economy is okay and we're not in an extra war and there's been no major

1219
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:25.000
terror attack or something,

1220
01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:28.570
that's really a game changer that we can't figure out right this moment.

1221
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:31.420
I don't think anyone that voted for Trump a link and go,
oh,
that,

1222
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.510
that's much better.
I was wrong last time.
That's much better.
Now,

1223
01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:37.330
the issue will be is if,
if,
uh,

1224
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.300
the Trump people are the Republicans or conservatives wherever,
if they're just,

1225
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:42.910
if they're voters just don't come out because they're just depressed,

1226
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:45.670
they're like,
oh,
we don't like Trump anymore.
We don't like this thing,

1227
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:48.640
but we're just not going to vote.
And then the Democrats are really enthused.

1228
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:50.050
Well,
the,
then that will happen.

1229
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:54.460
So there's really no way to fully predict any of this.
Uh,
as I said to men,

1230
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:58.450
you know,
these,
these,
um,
off year elections,
the 2018 thing,

1231
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:01.960
conventional wisdom is that there's going to be a massive blue wave.
Again,

1232
01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:06.700
I don't think that people who are generally conservative or old school,

1233
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:10.540
liberal or libertarian are going to look at the Democratic alternative,

1234
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.990
which we used to be a little more moderate,
but now has gone really left and go,

1235
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:15.640
that's better than this.

1236
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.960
Even if this thing is extremely imperfect and surrounded and mystery and all

1237
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:24.100
sorts of weird things.
But if the people that like that don't vote well,
then,

1238
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:28.000
then you just,
you just don't know.
All right guys,
about 10 minutes more.

1239
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.120
patrion.com/ruben report or Ruben report.com/donate we're building up our

1240
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:38.110
community on Ruben select,
which is our new patrion program.

1241
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:40.660
And there's behind the scenes videos,
there's live ams,

1242
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:44.590
there's these big group hangouts where I get to talk to small groups of 20 of

1243
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:48.070
you at the same time or 10 of you or five of you depending on what level you

1244
01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:50.710
jump in at.
And I talked to people all over the world on video.

1245
01:07:50.711 --> 01:07:54.880
Everyone sees everybody.
It's real cool and fun and uh,
and really,
really great.

1246
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.690
Uh,
so hopefully you guys will jump in on that if you,
if you just,
uh,

1247
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.930
if you like these ideas and you want to throw in for what probably costs you one

1248
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:05.380
beer a get in on it.
Um,
okay,
here we go.

1249
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.930
Um,
uh,
what about NASCAR driver?

1250
01:08:10.931 --> 01:08:13.750
Conor Daly lost his sponsored cause saying his dad said before he was born.

1251
01:08:13.751 --> 01:08:16.790
So I haven't heard about this yet.
That sounds completely bananas,

1252
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:20.600
but very much the sort of where we're at in,
uh,

1253
01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.940
in 2018 but that sounds completely insane.
Uh,

1254
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:27.290
can you please have guests on about comic gate and Star Wars?

1255
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.350
What are your thoughts on how these things are filled with identity politics?

1256
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.470
People have asked me this a little bit before.
Look,
I last yet.
I just sucked.

1257
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.370
I didn't want it to suck,

1258
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:38.060
but there were so many sucky things in there that I can't even begin to.

1259
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:40.610
Just real quick in terms of suckiness,
who the hell snuck?

1260
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:43.520
You're not going to tell us really?
How is he not,
not Darth pledges,

1261
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.440
just boring and lazy.
They way they kicked the can down with,
with,
uh,

1262
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.850
raised parents.
Ridiculous purple haired.

1263
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:51.230
Laura dern shouldn't have been in the movie.

1264
01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:54.460
That should have been admiral ackbar is an aging old,
uh,

1265
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.330
admiral who doesn't have any ideas left.

1266
01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:58.820
That's what you're thinking the whole time.
And then at the last moment,

1267
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:03.140
he does this amazing maneuver and blows up,
uh,
one of the star destroyers.

1268
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:05.810
But instead you have this character that you just met that you don't care about

1269
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:10.100
who's a big celebrity.
And it's like ackbar gets killed off camera.
Leah.
Uh,

1270
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:13.730
there's no force in space.
Stupid.
Why did Luke project himself,

1271
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:16.580
they're forced if he was going to die anyway,
not,
why not have the fight,

1272
01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:18.140
have the freaking fight and die,

1273
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:22.370
pull an ob one and let yourself die at the last moment.
Uh,
so many stupid things.

1274
01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:25.700
The,
the,
the fricking gambling planet,
which was utterly pointless.

1275
01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.190
All that aside,

1276
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:31.940
the identity politics part of it actually is quite annoying as well.
Um,

1277
01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:35.300
it seems as if the way they framed it as these are all white,

1278
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:40.130
generally older but white men,
right.
That's what,
uh,

1279
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:45.350
the first order is white men and they're fighting this diverse group of young

1280
01:09:45.351 --> 01:09:49.570
people who just want freedom.
And it's like we get it.
We get into it.

1281
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.340
You're doing here just,
you know what though?

1282
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.810
I loved force awakens and I think JJ can clean this thing up.
Um,
all right,

1283
01:09:56.811 --> 01:10:01.550
shout out to Leo all.
I am,
I am specifically told here not DiCaprio.
So,

1284
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:05.820
uh,
I don't know where that guy is,
but uh,
thank you Leo.
All right.

1285
01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.250
Couple of minutes more level one,

1286
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:08.930
if you jump on right now in the next couple minutes,

1287
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:11.990
I'm going to give you a verbal shout out right now a level two.

1288
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.870
We're going to give you the Rubin report shirt that is not being printed
anymore.

1289
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:17.760
We only got a couple left level five.
We're going to give you a,

1290
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.190
a level five or above.

1291
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:22.580
I'm going to Skype with you and thank you right after this.
Okay.
Let's see here.

1292
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:24.643
Um,

1293
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.170
<v 4>uh,
um,</v>

1294
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.540
<v 1>what's your opinion on Peterson solution for in cells specifically regarding</v>

1295
01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:38.530
forced monogamy?
So I think it's actually enforced monogamy,
not forced monogamy,

1296
01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:40.420
which is different.
Um,

1297
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.290
forced monogamy would be mean actually forcing people to be monogamous

1298
01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:46.780
enforcement.
Origami is basically talking,

1299
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.560
strengthening the ideas of marriage is basically what it means.

1300
01:10:50.561 --> 01:10:54.670
I know that's a hard for a lot of New York Times writers to grasp.
Um,

1301
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:58.540
so I,
I would want to hear him fully extrapolated.

1302
01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:00.250
I've heard him talk about it a little bit.

1303
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.920
He's talked about it on the tour a little bit.
Basically,

1304
01:11:02.921 --> 01:11:05.740
I think when people talk about insoles,
I want to get this totally right.

1305
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.220
They're talking about sort of this group where they feel are young males who

1306
01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:13.350
often are into sort of video games who have just removed themselves from the

1307
01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:18.120
equation.
They,
they are getting their sexual needs met with porn.
Um,

1308
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.420
they're not interacting with the opposite sex.
I wonder,

1309
01:11:21.421 --> 01:11:24.510
I guess actually you could probably be a gay in cell.
Is that,
is that a thing?

1310
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:27.330
A gay,
so that,
that must be a thing too,
right?
Um,

1311
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.380
but in effect you just sort of cutting yourself off from these personal

1312
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:35.130
relationships,
um,
and just sort of living online,
uh,
something,

1313
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:36.990
something to that effect.
Um,

1314
01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:38.330
<v 5>yeah.</v>

1315
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:41.150
<v 1>You know,
I think that Jordan's book,</v>

1316
01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:45.020
I think 12 rules for life is a pretty good antidote to that.
The book is called,

1317
01:11:45.021 --> 01:11:47.150
you know,
the subtitle is an antidote to chaos.

1318
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.300
And really what he's talking about there is get your life under control,

1319
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:53.720
want to fix the world,
but guess what?
You can't do it if your room's not clean.

1320
01:11:53.721 --> 01:11:57.620
And that's just sort of a metaphor for some bigger things.
Go be the top lobster,

1321
01:11:57.621 --> 01:12:00.380
all of the,
all of those little funny catchphrases the guys using.

1322
01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:02.630
I'm actually have a much bigger meaning,

1323
01:12:02.631 --> 01:12:06.140
so I'd want to hear him talk about it specifically a little bit more before I

1324
01:12:06.141 --> 01:12:10.890
come in on his feelings about it.
Uh,
now GM,
thank you very much.
Welcome aboard A.

1325
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:14.270
All right,
this'll be my last official pitch people.
So if you want in,

1326
01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.160
you've got five more minutes and I know you want in,
you want in get part B,

1327
01:12:19.161 --> 01:12:22.550
part of a same feed where people are talking about these ideas.

1328
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.650
Rubin report.com/donate or patrion.com/rubin report.

1329
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.260
We've got the feed there.
You can interact with people,

1330
01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:33.650
you can do it anonymously or not.
We're gonna,
we're gonna boot the haters.

1331
01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:36.470
I don't want their money.
You guys will be your,
your funding this show,

1332
01:12:36.471 --> 01:12:37.790
your funding,
our expansion.

1333
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.480
Why are we were just able to hire some new people and Redo the set.

1334
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:42.500
We didn't have to do this,

1335
01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:47.501
but you guys enable us to do things and get new graphics and get new music and

1336
01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:51.440
all of that stuff.
Uh,
you guys are the ones that absolutely enable us to do it.

1337
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.250
And we got some slots open at the level five or above tiers where you can get in

1338
01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.380
the goop Google hangout.
I do this monthly,

1339
01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:59.540
I chat with you guys all over the world video chats,

1340
01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:04.370
we talked back and forth and all that good stuff.
Okay,
let's see.
Um,

1341
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:10.520
uh,
what am I doing here?
Um,

1342
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:19.160
uh,
man,
there's a lot of stuff here.
It's hard picking things.
Okay.

1343
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:24.350
Um,
Rucka and malice stated they're both interested in a debate.

1344
01:13:24.351 --> 01:13:27.860
Would you host hosted objectivism verse anarchism?

1345
01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:30.380
So you're talking about Rocka Rocka Ali,

1346
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.380
former guests to the Rubin report and I assume you're talking about Michael

1347
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.760
Malice,
also former guests to the Rubin report.

1348
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:38.720
They want to have a debate on objectivism verse anarchism.

1349
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:42.350
That's kind of interesting cause obviously objectivism sort of,
oh,

1350
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:43.390
is almost like a,

1351
01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.640
you could say a strain of libertarianism with sort of more of a,
um,

1352
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.410
more of an ethos around morality.
Uh,

1353
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.240
verse anarchism where malice is an anarchist.
Let me,

1354
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:57.260
let me talk to the guys privately before I make any,
any promises here.

1355
01:13:57.261 --> 01:13:59.180
Let me just see what's going on.
I could,
for all I know,

1356
01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:01.700
I'm walking into saying they'd been at each other's throats and I'm going to

1357
01:14:01.701 --> 01:14:05.030
commit to it and then,
uh,
God only knows what's going to happen.
So we'll,

1358
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.910
we'll see.
Uh,
oh,
I guess they agreed to have it online.
All right,
let,

1359
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:09.760
let me see about it.
We're,

1360
01:14:09.761 --> 01:14:12.520
we're kind of booked at least through October right now,
but let me see about it.

1361
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.120
Um,
okay.
Let's see.
Um,

1362
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.970
oh,
this is interesting.
Our property based ideals,
libertarianism,
laissez faire,

1363
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:29.470
cetera in need of an update because of the advent of products which don't fall

1364
01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:33.460
under laws of production software,
automated services,
et Cetera.

1365
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.260
That's interesting because now we've got sort of these decentralized things and

1366
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:41.770
these things that don't need constant more and more and more production.

1367
01:14:41.771 --> 01:14:43.870
And we're in,
you know,
look,
this is a little bit,

1368
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:48.870
this is sort of ancillary really related to when people are yelling about $15

1369
01:14:48.871 --> 01:14:52.000
minimum wage.
What I always bring this back to,

1370
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:54.670
and I've heard many economists talk about this,

1371
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.460
is that we're going into a more automated economy.

1372
01:14:57.461 --> 01:15:00.250
So the more you say that the jobs that are the most disposable,

1373
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:02.920
which are the jobs that generally have minimum wage,

1374
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.580
the more you say we're gonna have to inflate those wages.
The more the companies,

1375
01:15:06.581 --> 01:15:08.140
and this is what any company would do,

1376
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:11.980
this is what you would do if you owned a company.
You wouldn't look to cut costs,

1377
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:15.250
and especially if you're now having this wage thing that's artificially not by

1378
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:17.800
what you can pay,
but the government is coming in and saying,

1379
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.530
you're going to have to pay more now you're seeing your profits go down.

1380
01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:21.960
You're going to try to figure out how do you,

1381
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:24.910
how do you get that to go this way again?
Well,
how are you going to do it?

1382
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.150
You're going to fire all your employees at Mcdonald's in order with iPads.

1383
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:30.640
We see this happening with fast food joints already.

1384
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.350
I've seen this happening at a whole bunch of,
you know,

1385
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:33.520
I've been traveling all over the country.

1386
01:15:33.521 --> 01:15:36.370
I see this happening at all sorts of places now where you don't talk to people,

1387
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:38.050
you just pressing buttons and then something you know.

1388
01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:41.020
Then one guy at the end hands you something,
but that guy can be replaced to,

1389
01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.690
and then there's one guy that probably fixes all the machines.

1390
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.160
So I do think we have to,
we have to rethink,

1391
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:51.660
we have to rethink almost everything.
We're,
we're at an interesting precipice in,

1392
01:15:51.661 --> 01:15:55.360
in human society right now.
And we have to rethink,
uh,

1393
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:58.860
how we're interacting with each other.
How do we,
how do the,

1394
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:03.900
is there goodness left in these crumbling institutions in a time now where

1395
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:07.180
people don't trust mainstream media?

1396
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.950
How it's now on you to figure out who to trust,
right?
I,
I assume some of you,

1397
01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:13.960
you watch this,
you,
you like what I'm talking about.

1398
01:16:13.961 --> 01:16:15.460
You liked the conversations I'm happening,

1399
01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:18.550
but I certainly shouldn't be the only person that you trust and you shouldn't be

1400
01:16:18.551 --> 01:16:23.110
getting all your only information for me.
I certainly hope that you don't.
Um,

1401
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.260
so we have to explore all sorts of new things,

1402
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.540
but that's why I'm so hopeful for everything right now.

1403
01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:32.410
It's like there's such hope.
There's such energy.
If you see,
you know,

1404
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:35.410
I read all these articles and it's like comedy is dead.

1405
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:38.650
And television is dead and there's nothing new or original.
It's like,
man,

1406
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.480
we're such chaos right now.
Or,
or perceived chaos.
You can be creative.

1407
01:16:43.481 --> 01:16:46.900
Come to one of my standup shows,
see what's going on.
I'm barely doing a set.

1408
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:50.560
I'd go up there with maybe five jokes and I'm fiddling with the crowd for an

1409
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.290
hour and a half and people have a freaking ball and I have fun and it's live and

1410
01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:57.730
it's interactive and we people are heckling me and I'm heckle and back and it's

1411
01:16:57.731 --> 01:17:01.470
all good natured and fun and the same time people are right now stand up comedy

1412
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:03.520
dead and is that standup comedy is dead.

1413
01:17:03.521 --> 01:17:08.521
It's that the ideas of leftism are dying in realtime and because so many comics

1414
01:17:09.231 --> 01:17:10.520
come from outline of thinking,

1415
01:17:10.521 --> 01:17:13.610
now they've moved over to whining about it because that's also a part of the

1416
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:15.290
part and parcel of the whole thing.
Lance,

1417
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:17.860
I want to give you a shout at all right people two minutes more.

1418
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:20.000
Who's going to allow me,
uh,

1419
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:25.030
Ruben report.com/donate or patrion.com/ruben report level one or above.

1420
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:28.010
You're getting a verbal shout out.
Only two minutes left level two or above,

1421
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:30.470
you're getting the Rubin report shirt not being produced anymore.

1422
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.570
Level fiber above,
uh,
Skype immediately after this live stream.
Let's see.

1423
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.890
Um,
uh,

1424
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.220
would you ever considering hosting a mock debate between two ideological Lee

1425
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:47.360
oppose guests who have to argue for the other side?
That would be interesting.

1426
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:51.440
So this would be along the lines of something that a bunch of us have talked

1427
01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:55.130
about,
but Eric Weinstein was really big on the idea of really strong man in your

1428
01:17:55.131 --> 01:17:56.990
opponent that really if you want to have a true,

1429
01:17:56.991 --> 01:18:00.920
serious argument that you'd want to steal man,
your opponent's views,

1430
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:04.160
not mock your opponent's views,
not personally attack your opponent.

1431
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.550
And we see plenty of this out there and just doing anything for clicks or

1432
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:10.970
anything you would really want to steal.
Man,
those views go this,

1433
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.720
this set of ideas,
this bulleted list of ideas.

1434
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.390
This right here in this box

1435
01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:23.300
is exactly what this person is saying.
I disagree with all of these things,

1436
01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:25.070
but this is what this person is saying.

1437
01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.620
Now you can attack their motives or any of that.
You say,

1438
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:30.380
this is what they're saying,
and then you say,
here's how I disagree with it.

1439
01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.930
Now we pretty cool to actually have two people that disagree with things,

1440
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.610
steel man,
each other's views and then argue against themselves.

1441
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:40.610
That would be actually pretty cool.
Let me,
uh,
let me think it through.

1442
01:18:40.611 --> 01:18:43.490
I've obviously got a couple of people in the chamber that I think maybe could do

1443
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:47.240
it.
Uh,
so that,
that would be pretty great.
Uh,
all right.
Uh,

1444
01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:48.170
I'm going to say my goodbyes.

1445
01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:51.680
So if you're jumping in a Reuben portadat compensation patrion rubric,

1446
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:56.000
more.com/donate or patrion.com/ruben report,
uh,
you got to do a quick,

1447
01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:00.050
um,
I think we're going to build a really great diverse community there.

1448
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:04.480
I think you guys can see we've reinvested in the studio here.
We've got a,

1449
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:08.330
a huge,
huge guest.
I think potentially our biggest guests ever next week,

1450
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:11.180
which I'm,
I'm super psyched about.
Um,

1451
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.520
you know where I'm going back out on tour with Peterson,

1452
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.950
I'm hitting up all these standup clubs again,

1453
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.740
we're trying to figure out how to build out some bigger IDW things.

1454
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:22.520
I think there's some technological answers on some of the big questions you guys

1455
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:27.200
have been asking for awhile.
Uh,
I'm,
I'm truly feeling more energized than ever.

1456
01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:30.650
It was great to be off the grid.
I today it was like when I woke up this morning,

1457
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:33.920
I was not nervous,
but I was a little like,
ah,
here we go again.

1458
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:35.120
Even though I love what I do.

1459
01:19:35.121 --> 01:19:37.640
Like I don't know that there's anyone that loves what they do more than I do,

1460
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:42.080
but I was like,
Whoa,
here we go.
The monster is back.
Let's,
let's do it.
Uh,

1461
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.900
I'm going to figure out personally out to how to manage that a little bit more.

1462
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:45.980
I told Shapiro today,
you know,

1463
01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:49.820
he does a regular Shabbat where he's off the grid from Friday night,

1464
01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:53.120
usually to Saturday night.
He sometimes,
he said he extends that over the weekend.

1465
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:55.370
I've been trying to do the weekend thing.

1466
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:56.960
I'm going to try to do that a little bit more,

1467
01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:01.760
just manage all of this stuff because I really think that that one of the

1468
01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:05.540
reasons that you guys watch this is because I've provided you with a little

1469
01:20:05.541 --> 01:20:10.350
relief or reprieve the craziness.
And believe me,
I'm,
um,

1470
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:12.690
it's good for you,
but it's good for me.
So let's,

1471
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:16.410
let's keep building that together.
We're going to keep doing great shows here.

1472
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:20.190
Do more stuff on the road,
as I said,
and uh,
and hopefully,

1473
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:25.230
hopefully I will continue to grow as you've seen.
And I will,

1474
01:20:25.231 --> 01:20:29.010
I promise you that I will be,
I will be honest about my opinions and,

1475
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.300
and thoughtful when I'm talking to people and curious and all of that good
stuff.

1476
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.340
Uh,
if you pledged people,

1477
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.230
email us@contactatrubenreport.com and we'll take care of it,

1478
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:43.620
whether you're getting a t shirt or whether you're getting a Skype with me in a

1479
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:43.621
few minutes,

1480
01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:47.220
which I'm happy to do a email us your t shirt size and your mailing address.

1481
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:49.320
We'll get that shirt out to you immediately.
Oh,
Linda,

1482
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.400
I think you're the last one.
Lindo welcome onboard Linda.
Um,

1483
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:56.100
and also I mentioned it before,
I wasn't really thinking about it beforehand,

1484
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.460
but we've got all the old set stuff,
so may make us an offer we can't refuse.

1485
01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:02.100
We'll figure it out.
We're gonna figure out what to do with some of this stuff.

1486
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.360
Um,
you know,
and if you know,
who knows,
just send us an email,

1487
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:11.040
contact every report.com.
We'll see what's what.
Um,
all right guys,
uh,

1488
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:14.360
thanks.
It's been a great first day back.
I got a couple of hours now to,

1489
01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:18.840
to have dinner and get out of the studio and stretch the legs and then I'm off

1490
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.960
to Rochester with Peterson tomorrow night.
Uh,

1491
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:24.300
I will be in Westbury Long Island.

1492
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:27.720
That's my hometown show on a Thursday night.

1493
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:31.170
Then on Friday night I'm doing an event in New York City with Eric Weinstein and

1494
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:34.650
Faisal Al Mutar and Melissa Chen,
uh,
which I'll tweet about and a little bit.

1495
01:21:34.651 --> 01:21:36.900
I saw they tweeted about it earlier.
Uh,

1496
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.420
then I got a couple of days and then a bunch of shows in Florida.

1497
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:42.480
Then I'm back here and I'm back here before that.

1498
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:45.180
Got The big show that I just mentioned and a couple of shows in Florida,

1499
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:46.740
and then we keep the beat going on.
We've got,

1500
01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:48.380
we've got tons of great guests coming up.
I'm,

1501
01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:51.150
I'm super psyched for a lot of this stuff we're going to be doing.

1502
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.640
This is just the beginning.
We're at the beginning again,

1503
01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:56.460
