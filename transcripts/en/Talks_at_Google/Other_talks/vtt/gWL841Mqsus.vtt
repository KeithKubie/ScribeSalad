00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.759
Jeff Huber: I'm Jeff Huber.
I'm SVP of engineering here at Google, responsible

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.010
for ads and aps products.
And on behalf of Women at Google -- the group

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.199
 -- and the "Talks at Google" series, please
join me in welcoming Padmasree Warrior, the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.571
CTO of Cisco.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.571
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:26.850
Jeff Huber: She'll be speaking on "A Look
at The Future," which includes her perspective

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.140
on market and technology transitions that
are changing the nature of work, how we connect,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.940
the future of computing -- including lots
of video and collaboration -- and I bet some

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.630
thoughts on Smart Cities as well.
Prior to her role at Cisco, Padrasree was

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.079
the CTO of Motorolla.
She joined Motorolla in 1984, rose through

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.960
the ranks there to be responsible, to be their
CTO.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.329
And she directed Motorolla Labs, and led a
team of 26,000 engineers.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.003
She's very actively involved in the community
as well, is on the board of the Joffrey Ballet

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:06.409
 -- and, being a Chicago native myself, one
of my favorite museums, the Museum of Science

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.170
and Industry.
In 2004, she received the National Medal of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.770
Technology, and in 2007, was inducted into
the Women in Information Technology International's

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.640
Hall of Fame.
And just last night was recognized by the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.150
Forum for Women Entrepreneurs and Executives
with their Annual Achievement Award, which

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.960
is a great accomplishment.
And given that this is a bit of a geeky audience,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.990
Padmasree also recently surpassed one million
Twitter followers, [laughter] and as you'll

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.560
see, is far more interesting than Ashton Kutcher
or Oprah Winfrey.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.680
With that, Padmasree Warrior.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.070
Padmasree Warrior: Thanks, Jeff.
That's quite a generous introduction.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.159
Hi, everyone.
It's my great pleasure to be here today.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.790
I know some of the folks at Google have been
working very hard for over a year to get me

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.989
here, so I appreciate very much your patience.
And it's actually a great opportunity to share

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.040
my perspective on future and kind of treat
this more as a dialogue.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.939
Because I think, as we all know, any vision
we have for the future as time passes becomes

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.840
very trite and mundane.
And that is really the power of technology.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.049
Innovation really is the magic that makes
imagination become a reality.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.810
So my goal is not so much just to see beyond
the future, but it's actually to enable it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.761
 -- enable it through technology.
And that's why I enjoy my role so much as

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.139
the CTO.
So with that, what I want to do is to talk

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.510
a little bit about how certain technologies
 -- certain technology frameworks -- are really

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.510
going to change how and where work gets done
in the future, and also reflect a little bit

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.379
on what "connected life" might look like,
and how Cisco and other companies in the technology

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.719
industry are working hard to make all of this
a reality, and talk a little bit about the

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.279
future of computing as a platform to do many
of these things.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:22.199
And then, I want to share some views about
what all this means for business -- for leadership.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.309
And, in that context, I'll talk specifically
about women leaders, because that's a topic

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.809
near and dear to my heart.
Lastly, about education.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:35.659
How might education look like in the future?
And hopefully, have lots of time for questions

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.989
from the audience in the room and those that
are watching online.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.709
So, you know, if you think about future, one
of the things that we see happening is, more

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.030
and more there is a demand for tools and applications
and platforms that enable intercompany collaboration.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.401
So a few years ago -- for those of us that
have been in the industry for a long time

00:03:55.401 --> 00:04:01.469
 -- a lot of companies and corporations focused
on enabling cross-functional teams and engineers

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.749
to work more closely with designers and marketeers.
And really, it was all about How do you get

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.760
diverse groups within a company to work together?
And the manufacturing industry probably pioneered

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.879
a transition where they started to look beyond
their own walls, and started thinking about

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.880
How do you extend business processes to include
suppliers, and not just suppliers from the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.860
point of purchase one step out, but multiple
steps out, and realize that there's a huge

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.009
amount of productivity gains that they could
get from this.

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.430
And many other verticals are now following
suit.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.010
So what does this mean?
This means now we have to think through developing

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.590
enterprise applications that, not just connect
within the enterprise Internet work, but also

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.139
go into the cloud and deploy certain applications
from the cloud.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.470
It brings very interesting challenges for
all of us in the industry to do that with

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.970
security and interruptability.
Because each enterprise today uses different

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.810
platforms to provide the connectivity.
At the same time, increasingly companies are

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.199
depending on clusters of experts to get together
and work on critical projects.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.729
And, you know, this is a very interesting
idea also.

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.850
At Cisco -- Cisco is a company with about
65,000 or so employees, over $30 billion in

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.229
revenues.
We do business in almost every country on

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.840
the planet.
And it's a company that's stitched together

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.520
with 130 acquisitions over its history of
25 years.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.800
And we just recently did an analysis.
We have close to 250 CEOs in the company.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.889
They all came from some form of an acquisition
or another.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.990
So the challenge is, How do you enable these
experts, these entrepreneurs, to create and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.840
innovate and tap into expertise that's outside
of the walls of the company, right?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.770
And so, the power of being able to do that
is, Experts choose the projects that they

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.740
want to work on rather than being assigned
by their boss to go work on a project.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.591
And so, this is a dynamic process and it's
self-forming and improves agility and, in

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.729
fact, produces better results.
So at Cisco, the way we drive innovation -- and

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:13.760
we pursue at any time between 30 to 50 market
adjacencies, as we call it, are really a portfolio

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.249
of growth opportunities.
And part of my responsibility as the CTO is

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:24.979
to make sure these portfolio growth opportunities
get the oxygen they need to foster the innovation

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:31.830
within the company as well as tap into ideas
outside, right? So we have a program that

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.020
we call I-Prize and I-Zone, where we collect
ideas from various parts of the globe and

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.610
incorporate that into our own innovation portfolio.
So this notion is very interesting, because

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.560
that sort of suggests that, perhaps organizations
will not be organized functionally or in a

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.669
structured fashion in the future.
We have to think through How do we make these

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.180
more social webs, almost, but in the context
of work.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.569
So, think of the postures of experts concept
to be at the foundation of that.

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:08.180
The next major shift that will change how
work is perceived is, the emergence of millennials.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.979
So, people born after 1975.
Probably some of them may be in this room

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.520
today.
And this generation brings with them the notion

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.749
that they want to have access to work whenever
they want to work, right?

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:27.680
So I always say this -- and already we do
this -- that the concept of "going to work"

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.749
will go away in the future.
We will simply "do work" wherever we are.

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.469
And that ties into the next trend, which is
mobility.

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:41.340
Already there's a huge demand for -- and expectation
 -- that we will have access to every enterprise

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.289
application on any form of device, whether
we are mobile, fixed, or nomadic.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:51.150
And the access is really not pertinent.
And so, How do we solve that problem?

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.949
So, what all of this means to the future of
work is, there's a huge demand for us to create

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:05.650
a platform that now can integrate voice video
and data and provide those capabilities and

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.710
applications in a secure, interoperable way,
both from on-premise access as well as in-the-cloud

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:17.031
access, which is big set of challenges, but
lots of room for innovation for all of us

00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:21.009
to drive this.
The second area I want to talk about is "Connected

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:23.639
Life.”
And again, you know, here mobility is a huge

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.389
factor.
I used to work for a mobile company before

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:33.120
I came to Cisco, and I often used to tell
people, "Every second on planet Earth there

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.709
are four babies born.
Every second on planet Earth there are 32

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:41.949
mobile phones sold.”
And so, the impact of what mobile communications

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:47.950
is going to do to help people get connected
and communicate is just -- we probably haven't

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.120
even scratched the surface yet.
And I actually believe that the term "mobile

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.510
Internet" will be redundant in the future,
just like we don't say "mobile e-mail.”

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.840
We just say "e-mail," and we expect to get
it wherever we are.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:06.209
Internet access will be very pervasive, and
hopefully seamless between whether we are

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:11.579
mobile or whether we have a fixed access.
The second interesting thing in the "Connected

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:14.640
Life" area -- and Cisco is driving a lot of
this -- is, video.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.920
Video, we believe, will be a killer ap in
the future -- everything from user-generated

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.269
video content.
We acquired recently a company called Pure

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:28.490
Digital, which makes the Flip Video Cam -- high-density,
video camcorder, if you have one.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:34.199
And it's now become my favorite toy.
And we're trying to figure out, How do we

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:38.889
bring that capability into the enterprise
phase, all the way to high-density, high-resolution,

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:44.959
multipoint telepresence?
And then, with the availability of on-demand

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:51.120
content now, consumers' expectation has shifted.
The debate is not really about content ownership

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.639
anymore.
How do you consume content more in a community

00:09:54.639 --> 00:10:00.310
and make that a more community experience.
So we recently launched an initiative to wire

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.741
up sports' stadiums -- Dallas Cowboy Stadium,
and a couple of other stadiums.

00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:08.970
And people often wonder, "What is Cisco doing
wiring stadiums up?”

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.920
And the intent is not just to provide an immersive
video experience in the stadium, but we are

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.630
working on, How do you extend that into the
home?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.389
So, from your home you can have an immersive
experience as if you're in the stadium watching

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:27.220
your favorite sport.
So there is a lot we can do to sort of make

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.610
content consumption much more interactive
and much more of a social experience in the

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.149
future.
The other change that's driving "Connected

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:39.910
Life," I would say, is more recent.
Probably this shift we've seen in the last

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.350
six months or so.
And it's probably one of the good things that's

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.949
come out of the economic crisis the world's
going through, and has gone through.

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:52.269
And this is the fact that, there's now a lot
of stimulus money from many different governments

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:58.860
around the world to think about how technology
can be applied to traditional protocols like

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:04.829
healthcare, like transportation, like energy.
So a lot of recent movement in Smart Grid.

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:09.560
For example, Smart Connected Cities, Smart
Buildings, How do you make buildings much

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.390
more energy efficient, and What role does
IP Networking play to make that happen?”

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.970
Same thing in health care.
We are working on -- we have telepresence

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.949
capability.
How do you extend that to promote and make

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:28.089
remote health care available, where a doctor
can interface with a patient when proximity

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:33.350
is not needed to provide health care to remote
locations where maybe there is no physical

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.230
medical facility available, but we can provide
that through telepresence?

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.810
So lots of things going on in, I would say,
what I would call "Lifestyle Optimization,"

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:48.100
applying technology, and what we traditionally
thought of IT mostly as a B to B, but in different

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.639
protocols, going into healthcare, sports,
education, etc.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:57.210
Lastly, Computing -- and probably this is
something you all know more than I do.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:02.610
Some of us have been in this industry long
enough to see the evolution from the 60's,

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.660
from mainframes to minicomputers to PCs, more
recently, the web.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.569
And we believe the next evolution will be
to Cloud Computing.

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:15.790
But we have to help enterprises make the transition,
because they already have a lot of investments

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.190
that they've made in data centers.
And, How do you help take advantage of their

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:26.750
investments companies have made with virtualization
so that you can scale Cloud Computing to become

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:33.680
more of a marketplace with workload portability,
federation, and security as to move data between

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.980
the Cloud and apply with data center, for
instance.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:42.589
So that, we believe, is three big shifts that
we will see: Future of work, future of Connected

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:46.190
Life, and Computing.
And then, you can kind of think and say, "Okay,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.589
what does this mean to the Internet?" Wherever
we go -- wherever there is a platform for

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:55.180
the next ten to 15 years.
And first, I want to look backwards and say,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.750
What did the Internet really allow us to do,
or What did we really focus on as an industry

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.529
in the last maybe ten, 15, 20 years, right?
The network really focused on providing data

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:07.310
transport.
It was really about moving small bits of data

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.590
from point A to point B.
And e-mail was probably the killer ap in the

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.050
first phase of the Internet.
And it was really a messaging platform.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:20.310
We all used it mostly for asynchronous messaging,
using e-mail initially.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:25.209
And the entire industry back then was focused
on optimizing price-performance ratios.

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:29.430
So MIPS and megabits were the two metrics
we all focused on.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.519
Fastest network and most bandwidth that you
could push traffic through.

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:39.200
And really didn't worry about things like
power consumption, cooling water requirements,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.279
data center footprint.
Those things were all afterthoughts.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:47.649
We didn't worry about those things.
And essentially, applications were vertically-integrated

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:50.649
with infrastructure.
So if you had to deploy a new application

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:54.069
and enterprise, you had to deploy new infrastructure
with it.

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:58.259
So what we believe will happen in the second
phase of the Internet, or -- as I call it

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:03.990
 -- the "Next Internet," is experiences now
have to scale almost exponentially as billions

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.519
more devices and billions more people connect
to the network.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:11.800
Which means, now we have to think about the
network being more than data transport.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.680
It has to be enable media experience.
We've already seen this happen to the music

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.120
industry.
Not too long ago, -used to buy pieces of furniture

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.722
to store physical forms of music.
And you know?

00:14:23.722 --> 00:14:26.850
Now, I have this little thing that looks like
a dresser.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.259
It's camouflaged like a dresser, and if you
open it, there's drawers to store CDs in.

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:33.259
It's become an antique now.
I don't know what to do with it.

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:38.310
You know, so that how we consume music is
dramatically changed by the Internet.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.220
And the same thing I think will happen with
video next.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.480
And collaboration I already talked about.
The challenge we have is, How do you develop

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.019
an enterprise-class collection platform and
bring things that are now in the consumer

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:56.490
web with -- we just talked about Twitter,
and Jeff mentioned I have over a million followers

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.490
on Twitter.
I love Twitter.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.060
I think it's just a great application.
Allows me to have conversations that I normally

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:08.250
wouldn't have in my normal course of the day,
and allows me to actually meet many new people

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.420
on Twitter.
And so, How do you make those concepts come

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.509
into the enterprise and make them more robust
to drive productivity in the enterprise?

00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:20.870
So that's really what I mean by "collaboration
enterprise platform" -- to engage in realtime

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:26.329
interactive communications and create content
and create intellectual property together,

00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:32.199
both by participation from outside the corporation's
boundaries and inside -- the talent that's

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:35.100
inside the corporation.
Last thing, sustainability.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.380
And here kind of think about two areas.
One is, How do we apply Internet principles

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:47.060
and IP networking to improve building's energy
efficiency, city's energy efficiency, etc.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.319
The other area is, How do you actually develop
IT itself to be more energy efficient?

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:55.699
How do we build routing switching, data center
products to be much more energy efficient?

00:15:55.699 --> 00:16:00.709
So we focused on both those areas.
And lastly, Virtualization and Cloud Computing,

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:06.750
How does that change compute, right?
But a prerequisite for all this is broadband

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.829
penetration.
And I think that's where we're lagging behind

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:13.769
in several parts of the world, including the
United States.

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:18.829
And data says that actually ten percent increase
in broadband penetration in developing markets

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:23.939
drives GDP up by 1.4 percent.
So, I think the challenge we all have in the

00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:27.490
industry is to drive that forward and make
sure there is broadband available, so that

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:32.820
we can deploy a lot of these technologies
and make the planet more smarter and greener.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:40.750
So at Cisco, we are focused in four areas
that drive our technology strategy very broadly.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.660
The first area is video.
Second is collaboration.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.300
Third is Smart, Connected Communities, and
I'll tell you a little bit about what we mean

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.839
by that.
Virtualization and Cloud Computing.

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:56.080
So, if you look at all of these, virtually,
a lot of these opportunities drive network

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.649
traffic.
They drive bandwidth, and they drive innovation

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:01.670
on the network.
And that's our agenda.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:09.630
And so, really you know, we expect that annual
IP traffic will reach two-thirds of a zettabite,

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:17.950
or 667 exabites, by the end of this year.
So, if you think about it, by 2013 -- so about

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:27.810
four years from now -- we will see global
IP traffic increase almost five-fold from

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.460
where we are in 2009.
That's really mind-boggling if you think about

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.650
it.
And on the consumer Internet today, about

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.690
a third of the traffic is driven by Internet
video.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:49.280
So, thanks to YouTube and Hulu and others,
and Internet video itself in 2013 will be

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.390
almost 700 times bigger than the entire U.S.
Internet backbone was in the year 5000.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.571
So that was in 13 years.
And so, lots going on that will drive a lot

00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:07.030
of traffic onto the network.
The other interesting data point is actually

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:12.510
mobile data.
By 2013, 62 percent of mobile data traffic

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.060
will be video.
So a lot of applications that we can create

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.120
and think about creating that will drive that
traffic.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.100
So we love video, all forms of video in any
form, and we're making big investments.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.360
You probably saw today Cisco announced our
intention to acquire Tandberg, which makes

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.390
desktop video conferencing.
We already are a leader in very, high-end

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.520
telepresence.
And I talked about Flip, so we are looking

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.850
at video as an end-to-end architecture, everything
from user-generated video to high-density,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:47.140
high-resolution video.
Smart Connected Communities -- I want to talk

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.830
about a little bit.
This is, you know really, I believe that we

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.480
will evolve to what I call the "Industrialization
of the Internet.”

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.850
And so here, the challenge really is, How
do you connect the cyber world with the physical

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.960
world?
So it's using sensor networks, perhaps.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.150
And not just actually connecting "people to
people," but "people to things" and "things

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.820
to things.”
And this has been talked about for a number

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.900
of years.
We've always talked about the Internet of

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.510
Things.
But what is really driving an acceleration

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.030
these days in this area is the rapid urbanization
of the planet.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:27.870
50 percent of the world's population by the
end of 2009 will live in cities.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.770
And these cities add roughly 180,000 people
every day.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.440
That's like creating two new Tokyos every
year.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:42.940
And we expect that, by the year 2050, there
will be a hundred new cities with over a million

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.620
people each.
And, in one sense it's good, because a lot

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.790
of the consumption happens in these cities,
but at the same time, you know, cities consume

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.670
roughly 75 percent of the energy today, and
they produce 80 percent of the emissions.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.120
So the challenge we have is, How do we enable
these cities to be smarter?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.020
And we are launching pilots in South Korea
in cities like Icheon and Songdong where we

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.270
are helping them build Smart Cities where
the network actually becomes a platform for

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:15.190
enabling urban services, so where you can
get information about traffic on your mobile

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.330
device.
We're enabling buses to have information about

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.450
traffic congestion, and How do you route traffic,
and doing things like that.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:29.420
We're also working on making buildings smarter
by connecting HVAC systems with IP networks,

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.920
so that you can bring those things onto a
same platform.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.200
We acquired a company called Richards-Zeta
that has middleware capabilities that allows

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.600
us to do that, and we are bringing more intelligence
from the switching and routing into interconnecting

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.880
the HVAC onto a single platform that can be
managed through software.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.050
Smart Grid is another area that's very interesting,
and we think that there will be 82 percent

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:59.680
increase roughly in the energy demands globally
by the year 2020.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:08.470
So, in the next 20 years or so roughly.
And DOE -- U.S. Department of Energy -- estimates

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:14.420
that just modernization of the U.S. grids
alone will help us save roughly 50 to 100

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.530
billion dollars over the next 20 years or
so.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:23.990
So Smart Grids, if deployed properly, has
the capability to reduce peak loads by almost

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.990
15 percent annually.
And so, if you translate that, what that means

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.351
is, in the U.S.
alone over the next 20 years, if we deployed

00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:39.830
Smart Grids, we would be able to save the
need -- or eliminate the need really -- for

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:45.050
almost a hundred large coal-fired, power plants.
So that's tremendous.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.770
That's almost like taking 30 million automobiles
off the road.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:53.320
So again, Smart Grid is another area where
we can think about, essentially our focus

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:59.750
is, How do you enable intelligent communication
between power-generation, transmission stations

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.360
and home, connecting back into smart metering
at home or commercial buildings?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.930
And so, lots of exciting things.
And fundamentally, I believe that if you look

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:17.180
forward ten years or so, six of the major
sectors will look very different from how

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.580
we have been in the past.
You know, that's health care, transportation,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:30.090
energy, public services perhaps, you know,
IT or communications itself, and how technology

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.300
gets deployed, etc.
So, you know, there's a lot of change going

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:40.810
on, which then brings us to the question of,
How will business look like in the future?

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.350
And here, I'm speculating, so I'm really open
to a dialogue with you.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:50.120
I think really successful businesses in the
future have to be able to operate on multiple

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.360
dimensions.
And I think many of us actually faced this

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.220
challenge recently.
We have to innovate, and we have to focus

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.930
on operational excellence.
In the past, it was okay to do one or the

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.800
other.
I mean, there were companies that prided themselves

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.260
on being very innovative, and there were companies
that prided themselves on being operationally

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.170
really good.
And you know, they could get the maximum operating

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.290
margins out just by squeezing costs and so
forth.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.060
And more and more, we are finding you have
to do both.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.790
And that, I think, brings up an interesting
challenge for all of us.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:23.320
And the other interesting thing is, we have
to have global scale, because it is a connected

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.280
world and economies are connected -- as we
found out recently as well.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.950
But you have to have agility at the same time
along with the global scale, and How do we

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.240
do that?
And the other thing that's interesting.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.660
I just read recently a report that said, high
school students or actually, even middle school

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.760
students or kids between the ages of 13 to,
I think, 19.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.480
And there was a survey that was done, and
almost 75 percent of them said that they do

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.670
not want to work for a big company.
So you can kind of think of this environment

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.690
in the future where there will probably be
all these little start-ups.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.880
Or small companies, right?
And so, What is the notion of a big company

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.860
anymore, and How will that change?
What does that mean to business?

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.240
Which brings me to, How will leadership change
in the future?

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.711
And I spoke last night about -- in the context
of women's leadership -- and maybe this is

00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:14.240
more of my perspective as a woman leader,
but I think it applies broadly to leaders

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.480
as well.
You know, traditionally leadership was about

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.870
commanding and making decisions.
I had a team of 26,000 engineers in my previous

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:26.090
job, and it was great power.
If I said, "Do this," and I could feel like

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.230
everybody would do it.
But I think, more and more, leadership is

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.940
about influence.
It's, How do you get companies to change direction

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.080
or Industry to change direction or Government
to change direction?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.570
And that means leaders have to now figure
out, How do you expand your sphere of influence?

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.850
It's not just what you control, but it's,
How do you influence outside your boundaries?

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.600
And this is where a lot of the social networking
tools help us.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.470
I think Twitter -- I spoke last night about
how it helps me expand my sphere of influence.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.240
This is a skill leaders didn't have to worry
about a few years ago.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.120
In fact, leaders prided themselves about being
very private.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.640
We were told, "You can't say some things in
public." "Don't say that.”

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.120
PR always told us, "Don't do that," "Don't
say this.”

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.420
And so, now we have to figure out, "Well,
say it." but "How do you say it?" What do

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.600
you say?
And, What not to say?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.510
And, How do you -- the fact that you belong
to multiple communities is a strength, and

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.000
that's another area where you can expand your
sphere of influence, right?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.800
For example, I belong to a community of engineers.
I belong to a community of Silicon Valley

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.830
leaders.
I belong to a community of women.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.490
I belong to a community of working mothers.
I went to Cornell, so I belong to a Cornell

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.320
Alumni community.
There's various communities we belong to,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.050
and more and more, a challenge for all of
us, as we become leaders is, How do you leverage

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.780
these communities, and, In what way is it
appropriate to bring some of these communities

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.870
to overlap in what you are doing?
So those are some new leadership skills that

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.830
we would have to learn.
The second skill is about collaboration.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.161
And this is interesting, because I actually
think of collaboration as being very different

00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:05.780
from teamwork or "consensus-driven committees"
as we used to call them, right?

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.750
You know, it's not -- collaboration doesn't
necessarily mean teamwork and everybody gets

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.370
along and does things.
It actually means you're okay in sharing an

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:18.320
idea before it's fully formulated.
You have an idea, and you want to share that

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.350
so other people can add -- other experts can
add -- to that idea to make it stronger.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.060
And, How do we do that?
What's the right way to do it?

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.890
And, What's the most appropriate to do it
quickly, so that you are not forever gathering

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.260
input.
At some point you have to move on.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.320
So collaboration -- how to collaborate.
What it means, I think, is another leadership

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.530
skill that we would have to garner.
And the third is really, being more than just

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.340
being a pioneer or a trailblazer.
And again, this is in the context of women

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.780
that I talked about last night at this forum
for women entrepreneurs and executives.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:58.410
When I started in the industry almost 20 years
ago, there were very few women -- in engineering,

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.680
especially, and in leadership positions.
So there were women that were considered to

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.100
be trailblazers and pioneers, who sort of
formed the way, and we were told we had to

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.761
be different.
Women were told they had to dress different,

00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:16.420
act different, speak different, maybe more
like a man, dress like a man.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.780
I think more and more, what people really
appreciate is authenticity.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.160
Leadership is all about being real, who you
are.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.091
So I encourage all the women to really be
women, and be successful by the fact that

00:27:28.091 --> 00:27:32.620
you are a woman leader and a woman engineer,
or a technical or marketing expert, or whatever

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.291
it is.
So I think this notion of trying to be different

00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:40.420
or being a pioneer by being different is going
to change in the future.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.410
So I think those are some things that I think
about how leaders of the future, some of the

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:49.320
challenges that they will have to deal with.
Which brings me next to education.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.470
And this might be controversial, but I actually
think there's a big difference between education

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.790
and learning.
And if you think about it, right?

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:03.440
The famous Einstein quote about -- I forget
the exact quote, but it's something like,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.560
"It's a miracle that curiosity survives formal
education.”

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.470
And in a way, it's so true, because now content
is available.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:17.010
And so, the fact that education is really
about teaching content has to change.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:21.850
It has to become more about How do you teach
how to learn, because students these days

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.000
can access content anywhere.
So, What do you do with that content?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.810
How do you actually make -- my view is education
is more discreet, it has a beginning and an

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.450
end in some ways, whereas learning is continuous.
We have to teach our children how to learn

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.651
continuously.
And, What do you do with all this information

00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:41.670
that's available? And, How do you create something
with it?

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.660
So I think education perhaps will also take
on a new meaning in the future and become

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:52.250
more about learning -- I hope, anyway.
So I'll stop there and take questions from

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:58.110
all of you if you have any.
I think that's my last step.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.040
And I think there's a microphone on the side.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.350
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.660
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:14.580
Q I go to the microphone so people can hear
me.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:21.870
You mentioned really needing to drive innovation
and operational excellence, which has been

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:28.400
not historically viewed as necessarily complementary.
Agree that that is the necessity and reality

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.740
of today.
How do you think about that with your teams?

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.840
And as a leader at Cisco applying that across
Cisco?

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.770
Padmasree Warrior: That's a great question.
It's a very tough thing, because right now,

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.960
I think innovators pride themselves as not
being process-driven.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.860
They don't want to follow process.
Process is evil.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.160
And people that are good at process think
of innovators as being these crazy people

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.760
that just keep coming up with ideas and they
don't know what to do with them.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.880
You know, and I said as a company we were
pursuing 30 adjacencies, which is a lot for

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.280
a big company.
And each of those we expect to be a billion-dollar

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.900
opportunity almost.
So that's where we expect our next $30 billion

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.020
of growth to come from.
And we think we have to go to 50.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.070
And so, one of the challenges is, "Okay, What
do you do?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.650
How do you know which ones of these are right?”
And "How do you know which ones you want to

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.230
accelerate and doubledown on, and which ones
you want to slow down?”

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.840
So I actually came up with this methodology
with some of my peers at Cisco.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.601
We've taken Geoffrey Moore's Chasm Model -- if
you are familiar with that -- which talks

00:30:23.601 --> 00:30:28.800
about technology at option life cycle, and
there's a chasm and there's prechasm, post-chasm.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.720
And we've actually taken that, and most of
the growth opportunities, if you think about

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.540
it, fall in the prechasm mode.
You know, when you're an innovator, you're

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.130
thinking about something that's still early.
You probably don't know if there's going to

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.650
be a market yet.
And so, how you measure that is going to be

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.830
very different than something that's going
to be more of a mature business.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:53.740
And we have come up with ways, by allowing
different types to measure progress on something

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.610
that's innovative, but there is still measurement.
And you still have to.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.652
You know, I tell people this, "You don't graduate
with your Ph.D. just because you're brilliant.

00:31:01.652 --> 00:31:04.350
You still have to defend your thesis.
There's a process.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.620
And there's a gate you have to go through.”
Similarly, if you're asking for funding within

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.570
a company or from an outside company, you
still have to hit some metrics.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.750
And so, we're trying to put some of those
metrics in the discipline, but at the same

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.290
time allowing people the freedom to create
and come up with great ideas.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:27.361
Q Hi. Congratulations on your award last night.
I was lucky among a few of us to hear you,

00:31:27.361 --> 00:31:33.260
and it was really just a fantastic speech.
Sometimes you hear these speeches, and they're

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.740
galvanizing.
That was one. So thank you.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.311
I'm curious about your Twitter experience,
if I can do that in a clear, limiting way.

00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:44.741
We struggle all the time with quality, at
the scale of the Internet, with the information

00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:50.590
that's managed out there.
It's impossible to manage at our scales, but

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.120
at the personal scale, when you have a million
followers, how do you crowd source in meaningful

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.440
ways?
You mention that you got a lot of value from

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.610
that.
How do you manage that, I guess?

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:03.780
Padmasree Warrior: Yeah. It's a great question.
You know, in the beginning, when I first started,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:08.730
I was one of the earlier adopters of Twitter.
I think, when I started, there were very few

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.660
people on Twitter.
And at the time, I felt like I could say anything

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.080
I wanted to, because nobody was really reading
it.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.020
And then, all of a sudden, you find out that
everybody's reading it, right?

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.520
I recognize that Wall Street Journal is following
me, and everybody else is following me.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.680
So now, you know, then you realize, "Oops.
Maybe I have to be more careful what I say.”

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.740
But actually what I've found to be most useful
for me is, when I am thinking about a concept,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.320
for example, collaboration.
I was preparing to give a keynote at one of

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.960
the large conferences, and I was thinking
about the future of collaboration, What does

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.750
it mean to the enterprise? And I said, "Okay,
let me use a collaboration platform to ask

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.500
that question.”
I asked people, "What are your five predictions

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.930
for the future of collaboration?”
I got a ton of input from people everywhere.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.400
I mean, people in the industry, out of the
industry, analysts, you know, just people

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.220
that are users of the technology.
And I gathered all that input, and I think

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:04.190
this is a room for an ap on -- somebody has
to create for Twitter, if somehow you can

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.500
get -- today it's manually, you know, I gathered
all the information, and I had one of our

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.520
smart engineers at Cisco develop a piece of
software for me where it's tracked and it

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.130
creates for me, What are the words that are
appearing most frequently?

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.280
So things like "mobile.”
Things like "making it more productive and

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.330
robust.”
Those types of things came up in this prediction.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.100
Which in turn, influenced my view, and therefore,
our strategy for Cisco.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.780
So I think to me, that those kinds of uses
are the biggest benefit I get.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:39.110
I also write haiku on Twitter that has nothing
to do with my work, just because I like writing

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.250
haiku.
And now, I have all these people that love

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:45.970
poetry following me on Twitter.
So, I mean, I think it's just -- the fact

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.560
that it's so easy and simple, and you have
to keep it to 140 characters, in a way forces

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.950
you to be really crisp about your point, and
the input you get is also likewise pretty

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.590
crisp.
So in a way I use it both to relax, share

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.840
my personal thoughts, as well as share things
that relate to work.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.650
I have in a way become a channel for Cisco's
marketing.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:11.480
Now, I get tweets from our Cisco marketing
people saying, "Hey, can you please tweet

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.409
this?”
And I send back saying, "Isn't this your job?”

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:18.869
So it's actually become more fun now.

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:19.929
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:28.710
Q Hi. Thanks for coming.
I read a few years ago that John Chambers

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:34.490
was saying that learning is going to be -- he
made a rounding error in a traffic, and you

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.049
talked about education -- how that's going
to change.

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:44.960
How do you see the role of technology companies
in driving that change in education, and how

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.250
do you see that happening?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.250
Padmasree Warrior: In education?

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.250
Q In education, yeah.
Especially in higher education, like four

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.940
years, a degree, like Ph.D.'s.
How do you see that changing?

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.220
Padmasree Warrior: Yeah. I think there is
a lot, and I think this is just emerging.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.980
You know, one of the things we are doing -- I
guess several things we are doing -- one of

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:05.039
the things we are doing more to actually just
to increase the level of education in primary

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:10.740
schools and schools in general in developing
countries is deploying things like "telepresence"

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:16.630
to promote teachers to access students remotely,
and get access to education, right?

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:21.310
Because I think that the advantage with something
like telepresence is that it's a very immersive

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.760
presence.
You see the person as if they're there.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.420
They're life-size, and they're just right
there.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.829
So we're doing that type of thing.
We also have things like Networking Academies

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.799
where Cisco actually deploys these academies
worldwide.

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:36.530
And I forget the number of people that go
through this.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.550
It's a very high number.
It's something like 300-, 400,000 people that

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:46.869
have graduated through these networking academies
where we train people to actually manage the

00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:49.320
network, operate the network -- about networking
actually.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.069
So we do specific domain expertise.
Now, we are thinking about, "Okay, we have

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:56.900
that infrastructure.
We've trained people on networking.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.569
What else could we use it for?”
So recently, with the Obama administration,

00:36:00.569 --> 00:36:07.510
we used our networking academy infrastructure
in Michigan to help retrain the work force

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.930
to do additional things.
So we are doing that type of thing, which

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.720
is more -- I guess you could say it's -- vocational
education.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.210
But in higher education, how that'll get transformed.
We have to think through, you know, just like

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:23.869
we're thinking about virtual health care How
do you get this content -- I think one of

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:27.540
the challenges we all have in the industry
 -- there is a lot of information now, right?

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.289
I think we've all made that happen.
And now, the challenge is, How do you provide

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:35.930
relevance to that information?
How do you connect people, community, and

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.299
information with this triangle?
How do you provide relevance to that? And

00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:42.630
so, that's one of the things we're working
on in researchwise.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.769
And I think if you do that, then we can think
about education being very different where

00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:51.490
I was talking earlier about.
Perhaps you can tell the students there's

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.279
relevance to these sorts of information, and
they can go access that.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:37:02.069
And then, the education is really about, What
do you do with that piece of information?

00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:07.440
Q Hi. I'm a product manager in one of the
research teams here, and one of the things

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.359
I think about a lot is "productizing research.”
I'm curious to hear your views on, What are

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:17.680
some effective ways to accelerate that research
to product? Specifically, because Cisco in

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:25.420
general I see as a company that does R&amp;D by
acquisition for the most part.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.680
And from your experience in Motorolla, I'm
curious to hear what do you think works and

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680
what doesn't?

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.859
Padmasree Warrior: Yeah. That's a great question.
You know, I think they're very different models.

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:40.780
When I was at Motorolla, we had a research
lab with close to 800 people that were doing

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.070
essentially, I would say, pretty fundamental
research, working with universities.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:48.900
And then, we had a very disciplined way of
transferring that into commercialization.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.260
Cisco here, right?
We have a very small focus on research.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.490
Mostly, we fund universities to do the research.
The philosophy at Cisco is that, We let the

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.310
people that are really good at doing research
do the research, and we will either acquire

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:06.209
or create, focus more on developing.
But we do tap into -- Cisco uses what I call

00:38:06.209 --> 00:38:11.720
 -- I was talking about this earlier, this
notion of I-Prize and I-Zone -- very effectively,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.049
where we post a problem and let innovators
bid on it, and we have a competition and whoever

00:38:17.049 --> 00:38:22.440
wins, and the competition, I mean, it's judged
by independent judges, not just Cisco teams.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.210
We have VCs and people from academia participate
in that.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:30.319
And the winning idea gets $250,000 seed-funding
from Cisco.

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:33.910
And we usually negotiate something for the
intellectual property, and so forth.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:38.009
So we do it that way at Cisco.
But I think -- to answer your question about

00:38:38.009 --> 00:38:42.450
some of the things from overall my experience
about research -- it's very important to do

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.940
research, because that's how you discover
things, you know, which is mostly in the invention

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.840
phase.
The challenge is, How do you translate those

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.410
inventions to innovations, right?
And this is where you have to tie very closely

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.490
with, What is the market transition going
to be?

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.869
I think it's very critical.
One of the big challenges in bringing things

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:05.130
to market is actually catching the transition
at the right time.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:09.130
You know, timing is very important, because
you can be too early in the market and have

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.420
a failed product, or you can be too late,
at which point, you won't make very good margins.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.349
And so, you have to get the timing right.
And the biggest challenge that I felt when

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:21.700
I was leading research organizations is getting
the timing right on when you take something

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:27.400
out of research and move it more into product
development, and How does that hand-off happen?

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.020
And so, to do that, really, you need to have
input from multiple directions, right?

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.430
You have to have a feel for, What are the
global trends in the market dynamics? And

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.110
sometimes it's hard to predict.
That's, like I was talking about, the "Internet

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.490
of Things" has been in research phase almost
for 10, 15 years.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:47.559
People have been working on sensor networks.
But it's only recently, we've seen commercial

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:52.299
need for it, mainly driven by Smart Grid.
And the Smart Grid demand happened because

00:39:52.299 --> 00:39:55.200
energy has become a problem.
Now, there's stimulus money going into it.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.940
So other factors change that.
So somehow, you have to have a feel and your

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.589
finger on the pulse of the changes that are
going on in the marketplace.

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:07.940
And whether you do that in the research organization,
or you work with other parts of Google that

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.690
does that, I think that's very critical.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:23.420
Q Hi. So you've worked at two very interesting
and hallmark technology companies at Motorolla

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.510
and Cisco.
Just curious your observations on the relative

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:33.549
places, sort of cultural differences, the
corresponding management, leadership challenges

00:40:33.549 --> 00:40:36.980
that those present?
And then also, you've made the transition

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.390
from the Midwest to Silicon Valley, and your
observations on life and business differences

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.390
between those two?

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.249
Padmasree Warrior: Right. I tell people I'm
lucky I lived in Chicago and Palo Alto, two

00:40:46.249 --> 00:40:48.650
of the best places in the world to be.
You know?

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.859
So yeah, very different companies Motorolla
and Cisco in some ways, but very similar in

00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:55.569
other ways.
I think the similarities are that both are

00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:57.700
very global with large footprints across the
globe.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.060
And, you know, I consider myself a global
citizen.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.170
I love being part of a global company.
So, those are the common things.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.920
Both very heavily engineering driven.
And I'm an engineer, so I love that.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.009
I think the main difference is that, Motorolla
is probably more of a consumer company, mainly

00:41:16.009 --> 00:41:21.710
because of the handset business.
And Cisco is much more of an enterprise-driven

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:27.609
company, although we have a big push into
consumer and other areas, which means that

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:31.619
the, How you sell and How you go to market
are very different in both companies.

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:36.980
Cisco has a very superb sales process.
I would say one of the best I have seen in

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:41.009
any company.
Our sales teams are amazingly good.

00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:45.150
And it's great to have them backing you when
you're meeting with customers.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.579
And this is something I love doing -- the
customer-facing interaction, which Motorolla

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:53.280
didn't have so much, because we sold mostly
to carriers, and you know? And it's not so

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.630
much direct-selling into consumers or into
customers.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.020
So different from that perspective.
Also, Cisco is a much newer company.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.249
Motorolla is almost 80 years old now, I think,
and Cisco is about 25 years old.

00:42:04.249 --> 00:42:10.869
Actually, this year is I think, our 25th anniversary.
So I think that, in itself, brings very different

00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:13.259
nuances.
As we were talking about earlier, Cisco is

00:42:13.259 --> 00:42:18.710
a company that's made up of acquisitions.
So there's a very heavy, entrepreneurial spirit

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.079
in the company, just because it's a collection
of little companies in a way.

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:28.690
But the culture at Cisco is very family-focused.
We sort of, John Chambers always talks about

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:33.220
this, and he calls it the "Cisco Family.”
And even when he was interviewing me to come

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:37.190
to Cisco, and we talked almost for a year
before I finally said yes.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:43.569
I think Randy shared this story last night
at FWE, at the event.

00:42:43.569 --> 00:42:48.220
But, you know, when you say "Cisco is a family"
it kind of sounds corny a little bit.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:55.180
But in a way, it's true.
There is the notion that, "We compete outside

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.769
the company, and we work together inside the
company" which is very powerful.

00:42:58.769 --> 00:43:01.329
I think this is sort of like the foundation
for collaboration and the clusters of experts

00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:09.170
that I was talking about.
Moving from Chicago to Palo Alto, there are

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:14.200
no winters here, which is great.
I think you can't beat the weather in California.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.890
That's great. And really, I feel like this
is the pulse of a lot of things that are related

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.749
to technology and innovation.
Just having this opportunity to talk to people

00:43:23.749 --> 00:43:28.930
like you is something that is -- for some
reason -- not as much there in the Midwest,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.329
which is surprising.
Great schools there.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:34.520
University of Chicago, Northwestern, Urbana
Champaign.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.500
Two national labs, Fermi and Argonne.
So a lot of tech gets created, but probably

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.400
more in the invention area rather than in
the innovation area.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.460
So it's, in a way, that's another change.
But, you know, I've been coming.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.420
I've been in the semiconductor industry a
long time.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.410
So I feel like I have been coming here all
the time, but now, I have finally moved here.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:44:00.180
So I think this has been a slow transition,
maybe over a long number of years rather than

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.220
an abrupt transition.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.839
Q So I was going to ask you a similar question
as Jeff's, but maybe a follow on.

00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:11.680
Just around some of the personal career choices
you've made, and going from a very large company

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.799
to another very large company.
And it's interesting parallel in Google.

00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:18.150
We're not Cisco.
We're not Motorolla.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:23.099
But like, we are at a very different stage
of our growth, and how you've thought about

00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:26.430
your career path and the size of the company
you've decided to join?

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.869
Padmasree Warrior: Yeah, actually, you know,
I don't know that the size of the company

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:35.859
is as much of a factor, because all big companies
start small, and they grow to become big.

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:38.710
And it's kind of an interesting dichotomy,
you know?

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.730
All small companies want to be big, and all
big companies want to be small.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:47.500
It's kind of a weird thing.
But I think some things apply, whether it's

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.579
a big company or a small company, right?
The ability to get things done and the ability

00:44:52.579 --> 00:44:56.660
to figure out How do you go after something?
I mean, those are the same whether you're

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.769
in a big company or in a small company.
So I think the career choices I have made,

00:45:00.769 --> 00:45:06.100
I have mostly probably have to do with looking
for an exciting opportunity where you can

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.940
make a difference, rather than whether it's
a big company or a small company.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.390
And I think that means -- and as I was talking
about last night -- you kind of have to step

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:16.180
out of your comfort zone.
And that's what I have done.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.650
You know, I mean, I spoke last night.
I'm originally from India.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.220
I grew up in India in a small town in the
southern part of India and decided to do engineering

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:29.180
in the northern part of India.
And I left my home when I was sixteen.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:35.119
And went to New Delhi to do engineering at
IIT, which is one of the hard-core, male-dominated

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:39.730
engineering schools in India.
And my first day of registration after I registered,

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.130
I discovered there were five women in a class
of 250.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.260
And I told this story.
I called my dad the next day, and said "I

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.130
want to come home." And he said, "It's too
late.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.269
You decided to go there.
Now, you stay there.”

00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:56.579
And I thought he was like the meanest dad
in the whole world back then.

00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:00.839
I thought I was very clever, and I knew how
to get around this problem.

00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:04.730
So I called my mom.
And then, I told her how much I was missing

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:08.690
her cooking.
Now, I have a teenager now, and I know if

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:13.299
he called me and said he was missing my cooking,
I would have him home on the next flight.

00:46:13.299 --> 00:46:18.820
But my mom had more sense than that, I think.
She said, "You stay in school; I'll send you

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.819
food.”
And so, I ended up finishing my engineering

00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:23.130
school.
And so, that was the first time I moved out

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.589
of my comfort zone.
And then, I left India to come to the U.S.

00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:30.230
to go to graduate school.
I went to Cornell, did my Masters in chemical

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:33.859
engineering, and we were talking earlier about,
"How you go from chemical engineering to being

00:46:33.859 --> 00:46:38.150
CTO of Cisco?”
Yeah. So I finished my degree in chemical

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:42.020
engineering at Cornell, and I started in the
semiconductor industry as an engineer -- as

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:48.289
a line engineer actually -- and then, worked
up to become the CTO for Motorolla, semiconductor

00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:50.900
business.
And then from there, I went to run a business

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.079
which had no technology.
It was all operations, managing supply chain

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:58.970
costs, and taking beatings from customers
every other day, because shipments didn't

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.599
happen or something.
And then, I became CTO for Motorolla.

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:07.260
So the point is that, I think, as you look
through your career opportunities and your

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:13.460
growth opportunities as a leader or personal
growth, I think it's to make those transitions

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.990
and use those transitions as opportunities
where you can derive a lot of growth.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:22.259
And that can happen in a small company, big
company, personal life, you know, where you

00:47:22.259 --> 00:47:25.090
go through a lot of growth when change happens
in your life.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:35.140
So, how do you take all of that which defines
you, who you are as a leader and as a person.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.180
Q Congratulations first on your award last
night.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.430
I function as a project manager here at Google,
and one thing that came to my mind is, you

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:46.140
were talking about how processes and innovation
are not necessarily considered as going hand

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.470
in hand.
So, how have you managed to integrate the

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.319
two together, and what are the models that
have worked at Cisco -- especially given the

00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:55.020
next phase of Internet that you are working
on?

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.710
Padmasree Warrior: Processing, and what was
the other thing?

00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:58.710
Q Innovation.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.250
Padmasree Warrior: Okay. Great question. Yeah.
I mean I think this is something that's my

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.259
job.
You know, what I'm asked to do is, How do

00:48:04.259 --> 00:48:09.080
you apply process to innovation?
So all the engineers sort of hate me.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:15.049
But, you know, I keep telling them I think
the advantage of having a process, but the

00:48:15.049 --> 00:48:18.460
process has to be flexible.
I don't think you want to do process for process'

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.920
sake.
I think you have to think about, How do you

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.509
use the process to help people accelerate
what they're working on?

00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:32.119
Right? So the way we've been able to develop
that is to sort of look at, you know, the

00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:37.730
30 or 50 ajacencies that we are pursuing.
And they vary -- everything from putting a

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:42.319
router in space to using video as the next
big architecture, right?

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:47.630
One is very big, one is a very niche opportunity.
Highly technically challenging to think about

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.950
routers in space, and they require very different
kinds of metrics.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:57.989
And so, the process has to be such that, it's
really flexible to allow that diversity that

00:48:57.989 --> 00:49:00.559
innovators need and the room they need to
create.

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:04.230
And it's not about -- you shouldn't measure
them on Did you make a mistake, and How many

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.160
mistakes you made.
It's not defects that count, right?

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.029
It's not the traditional quality metric.
But it's, What do you do when you make a mistake,

00:49:11.029 --> 00:49:15.070
and How do you -- when you find that you have
an experiment and it didn't yield the results

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:19.660
you were expecting, that's still a result.
And so, you have to accept that as a success

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:25.910
and go to the next thing.
So it's actually having that type of flexibility

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:29.859
in the process, I think, is very important.
Otherwise, you get very bureaucratic and bogged

00:49:29.859 --> 00:49:36.099
down and nothing ever gets done.

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:41.150
Q So I have a question.
I think earlier you mentioned that a lot of

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.980
young professionals are preferring to work
for a smaller company versus a bigger company.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.000
What do you think companies like Google or
Cisco can do to retain and attract, you know,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.404
talented youth to come and work for their
companies?

00:49:52.404 --> 00:49:56.540
I imagine these are the type of people who
have the entrepreneurship and innovation to

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.579
really help make any company great.
And so, it seems like it would be important

00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:02.079
to attract or retain them.

00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:07.670
Padmasree Warrior: Yeah. This was actually
a report I had read that talked about how

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:12.640
schools students -- when asked what they want
to do -- almost 80 percent of them or something

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.569
said they don't want to work for a big company.
They want to work for little companies with

00:50:16.569 --> 00:50:20.210
few people, which made me think, "Well, what
does that mean to companies, right?

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:24.750
In the future, How will they operate?”
So that's kind of where I was quoting that

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.650
data from.
What I think we can do, and what we should

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.150
do is, sort of create that agility within
a big company.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:33.390
Big companies, by the way, have a lot of advantages,
right?

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:38.660
And there was an article in The Economist
recently that talked about how, "Big is Back.”

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:44.019
I think when times get tough, having scale
helps.

00:50:44.019 --> 00:50:49.380
Then being part of a big company is very attractive,
because you know you have cash, you have very

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.299
high margins, and the business is not going
to go away, and you can take the hit for a

00:50:53.299 --> 00:50:57.900
few months or a few years and come back.
So there's definite advantages to scale, but

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.329
we have to combine the agility and the flexibility
with the scale.

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:04.749
And I think this is a generational shift that
we will see.

00:51:04.749 --> 00:51:10.329
As kids that are growing up -- I have a teenage
son, and to him e-mail is dead.

00:51:10.329 --> 00:51:14.340
I mean dead.
If I e-mail him, I have to text him or post

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.079
an update on his Facebook saying, "I've sent
you an e-mail, please go read it.”

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:21.570
And he always asks me, "Mom, why do you leave
me a voice mail on my mobile phone?

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:24.020
I know I have a missed call, and I know you
called me.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.499
I'll call you back.”
He never checks his voice mail, which is very

00:51:26.499 --> 00:51:29.819
frustrating to me, because I grew up with
e-mail and voice mail.

00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:32.960
So I think this notion.
I mean, what they require is very different,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.690
so we have to figure out what motivates them.
It's the flexibility, it's the ability to

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:41.349
"do work" not necessarily to "go to work.”
And, How do you enable that to happen?

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:45.079
I think those kinds of things -- we have to
give them that flexibility yet be attached

00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:49.349
to a more stable entity, perhaps, which could
be attractive.

00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:54.680
&gt;&gt; Maybe a last question.
You mentioned your interest in poetry and

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:59.960
sharing your haikus on Twitter.
Springing this on you a bit.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.289
Any chance you have one you'd like to share?

00:52:01.289 --> 00:52:02.309
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:06.849
Padmasree Warrior: I'll probably write one
tonight.

00:52:06.849 --> 00:52:08.369
&gt;&gt; Okay. Write one tonight and dedicate it
to Women at Google.

00:52:08.369 --> 00:52:10.410
Padmasree Warrior: All right. I will do that.
Thank you.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.410
&gt;&gt; So, thank you very much, Padmasree.

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.411
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
