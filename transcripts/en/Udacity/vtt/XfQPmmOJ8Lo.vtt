00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I'd like you to take a short quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to describe a kind of testing that somebody is doing, 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and you're going to tell me which of the kinds of testing that we've discussed

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that it's most like.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have a piece of software under test,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and this is some sort of a really critical embedded system,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
maybe, for example, it's controlling airbags on a vehicle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And this vehicle is going to be out in the field for many years,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and so cars get subjected to fairly extreme conditions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They have a lot of heating and cooling cycles.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They get exposed to salt and mud and water,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and so the cars are in a fairly harsh environment.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And one of the things we're going to want to know

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is how the software responds to defects that get introduced

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
into the automobile's wiring 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
as this vehicle ages in the field, that is to say as people are driving it around

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the salty roads in Michigan or whatever.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And so what we're going to do is using maybe a simulator or something 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we're going to make it look like a wire that's used

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for this processor that's used for software running on this processor

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to talk with other modules, so cause a really big distributed system,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so the software under test here is just one of many pieces of software

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
running on the car.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're going to use some sort of a simulation module

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to simulate a noisy wire, and that basically means, for example, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a wire whose insulation has rubbed off and that is not perfectly 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
conducting signals anymore.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's getting junk injected into it because it's banging against the car's frame or something.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The question is what kind of testing are we doing?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And your choices are regression testing,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
unit testing, stress testing, or white box testing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Please right now click the box that best describes what we're doing.
