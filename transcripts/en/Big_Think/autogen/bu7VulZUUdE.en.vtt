bunny and smart as a fox and there's a
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600
bunny and smart as a fox and there's a
reason for that because the Fox is a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
reason for that because the Fox is a
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090

basic ingredient is language because you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
basic ingredient is language because you
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.860
basic ingredient is language because you
have to be able to communicate your

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.010
knowledge to the
next generation and to the best of our

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020
next generation and to the best of our
 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.140
next generation and to the best of our
knowledge animals do not communicate

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
knowledge animals do not communicate
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.770

there's no language there's no culture
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.230
there's no language there's no culture
but which animals can communicate their

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
but which animals can communicate their
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.140
but which animals can communicate their
knowledge to the next generation and so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
knowledge to the next generation and so
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360

predator and predators tame seem to be

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
predator and predators tame seem to be
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.320
predator and predators tame seem to be
smarter than prey and then you ask

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330
smarter than prey and then you ask
 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.200
smarter than prey and then you ask
another question how many animals on the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210
another question how many animals on the
 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.080
another question how many animals on the
earth satisfy these three basic

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
earth satisfy these three basic
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.510
earth satisfy these three basic
ingredients and then you come to the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520
ingredients and then you come to the
 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.670
ingredients and then you come to the
astounding conclusion the answer is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
astounding conclusion the answer is
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.910
astounding conclusion the answer is
almost none so perhaps there's a reason

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
almost none so perhaps there's a reason
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.250
almost none so perhaps there's a reason
why we became intelligent and the other

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
why we became intelligent and the other
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530
why we became intelligent and the other
animals did not they did not have the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
animals did not they did not have the
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.480
animals did not they did not have the
basic ingredients that would one day

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490
basic ingredients that would one day
 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.450
basic ingredients that would one day
propel us to become intelligent then the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
propel us to become intelligent then the
 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.340
propel us to become intelligent then the

intelligence can you take an ape and
make the ape intelligent well believe it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850
make the ape intelligent well believe it
 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.410
make the ape intelligent well believe it
or not the answer could be yes we are

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260
case and the brain itself and so in the
 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.250
case and the brain itself and so in the
future not today but in the future we

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260
future not today but in the future we
 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.010
future not today but in the future we
may use gene therapy to begin the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020
may use gene therapy to begin the
 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.500
may use gene therapy to begin the
process of making perhaps a chimpanzee

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510
process of making perhaps a chimpanzee
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.990
process of making perhaps a chimpanzee
intelligent we know the genes that will

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000
intelligent we know the genes that will
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.030
intelligent we know the genes that will
increase the size of the brain we've

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040
increase the size of the brain we've
 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.690
increase the size of the brain we've
isolated now the gene

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700
isolated now the gene
 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.180
isolated now the gene
you manual dexterity by which you can

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190
you manual dexterity by which you can
 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.510
you manual dexterity by which you can
make tools we have found the genes which

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
make tools we have found the genes which
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.630
make tools we have found the genes which
give you the ability to articulate

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640
give you the ability to articulate
 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.880
give you the ability to articulate
thousands of words and so it may be

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890
thousands of words and so it may be
 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.580
thousands of words and so it may be
possible to tinker with the genome of a

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590
possible to tinker with the genome of a
 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.070
possible to tinker with the genome of a
chimpanzee so that they have a larger

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080
chimpanzee so that they have a larger
 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.680
chimpanzee so that they have a larger
brain case they have better manual

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690
brain case they have better manual
 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.620
brain case they have better manual
dexterity and they have the ability to

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630
dexterity and they have the ability to
 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.410
dexterity and they have the ability to
articulate a larger vocabulary but then

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420
articulate a larger vocabulary but then
 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.290
articulate a larger vocabulary but then
what do you get you get a primate that

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300
what do you get you get a primate that
 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.920
what do you get you get a primate that
looks very similar to a human and so my

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930
looks very similar to a human and so my
 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.500
looks very similar to a human and so my
personal attitude is why bother we

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510
personal attitude is why bother we
 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.300
personal attitude is why bother we
already have humans just look outside

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310
already have humans just look outside
 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.240
already have humans just look outside
the door so why bother the manipulator a

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250
the door so why bother the manipulator a
 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.860
the door so why bother the manipulator a
chimpanzee because as you make a

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870
chimpanzee because as you make a
 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.020
chimpanzee because as you make a
chimpanzee more and more intelligent it

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030
chimpanzee more and more intelligent it
 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.050
chimpanzee more and more intelligent it
becomes more and more human-like with a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060
becomes more and more human-like with a
 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.290
becomes more and more human-like with a
vocabulary with vocal chords with manual

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
vocabulary with vocal chords with manual
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.870
vocabulary with vocal chords with manual
dexterity with a larger brain case and a

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880
dexterity with a larger brain case and a
 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.060
dexterity with a larger brain case and a
spine to support a larger brain case

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070
spine to support a larger brain case
 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.990
spine to support a larger brain case
that's called a human
