00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.380
PROFESSOR: OK, we're ready to
start the eleventh lecture.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.390
We're still in the middle
of sketching.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.250
And, indeed, one of the reasons
why we did not talk

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.490
about hyperbolic functions is
this that we're running just a

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.540
little bit behind.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720
And we'll catch up
a tiny bit today.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.000
And I hope all the way on
Tuesday of next week.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.640
So let me pick up where we
left off, with sketching.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.220
So this is a continuation.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.440
I want to give you one
more example of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.390
how to sketch things.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.380
And then we'll go through
it systematically.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.450
So the second example that
we did as one example

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.060
last time, is this.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.970
The function is x
+ + 1 / x + + 2.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.780
And I'm going to save you
the time right now.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.140
This is very typical of me,
especially if you're in a

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.860
hurry on an exam, I'll
just tell you what

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.920
the derivative is.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.760
So in this case, it's
1 / (x + 2)^2.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.650
Now, the reason why I'm bringing
this example up, even

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.720
though it'll turn out to be
a relatively simple one to

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.890
sketch, is that it's easy to
fall into a black hole with

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.890
this problem.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.470
So let me just show you.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.600
This is not equal to 0.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180
It's never equal to 0.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.940
So that means there are
no critical points.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.460
At this point, students, many
students who have been trained

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.710
like monkeys to do exactly
what they've been told,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.170
suddenly freeze and give up.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.970
Because there's nothing to do.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.000
So this is the one thing that
I have to train out of you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.260
You can't just give
up at this point.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.060
So what would you suggest?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.100
Can anybody get us
out of this jam?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.780
Yeah.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.810
So the suggestion was
to find the x values

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.800
where f (x) is undefined.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.850
In fact, so now that's a fairly
sophisticated way of

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.410
putting the point that I want to
make, which is that what we

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.770
want to do is go back to
our precalculus skills.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.150
And just plot points.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.900
So instead, you go back to
precalculus and you just plot

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.220
some points.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.350
It's a perfectly reasonable
thing.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.970
Now, it turns out that the most
important point to plot

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.730
is the one that's not there.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.300
Namely, the value of x = - 2.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.780
Which is just what
was suggested.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.990
Namely, we plot the
points where the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.710
function is not defined.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.220
So how do we do that?

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.200
Well, you have to think about
it for a second and I'll

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.470
introduce some new notation
when I do it.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.290
If I evaluate 2 at this place,
actually I can't do it.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.250
I have to do it from the
left and the right.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.840
So if I plug in - 2 on the
positive side, from the right,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.150
that's going to be equal to - 2
+ 1 / - 2, a little bit more

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.590
than - 2, +2.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.190
Which is - 1 divided by - now,
this denominator is - 2, a

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.730
little more than that, +2.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.200
So it's a little more than 0.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.720
And that is, well we'll fill
that in in a second.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.620
Everybody's puzzled.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.040
Yes.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.660
PROFESSOR: No, that's
the function.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.980
I'm plotting points, I'm
not differentiating.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.250
I've already differentiated
it.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.630
I've already got something
that's a little puzzling.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.250
Now I'm focusing on
the weird spot.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.590
Yes, another question.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.110
STUDENT: Wouldn't it be
a little less than 0?

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.610
PROFESSOR: Wouldn't it be
a little less than 0?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.180
OK, that's a very good point
and this is a matter of

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.310
notation here.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.690
And a matter of parentheses.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.430
So wouldn't this be a
little less than 2.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.100
Well, if the parentheses were
this way; that is, 2+ , with a

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.790
- after I did the 2+ , then
it would be less.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.830
But it's this way.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.670
OK.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.950
So the notation is, you
have a number and you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.190
take the part of it.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.550
That's the part which is a
little bit bigger than it.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.840
And so this is what I mean.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.870
And if you like, here I can put
in those parentheses too.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.270
Yeah, another question.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.190
PROFESSOR: Why doesn't the
top one have a plus?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.389
The only reason why the top
one doesn't have a plus is

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.860
that I don't need it
to evaluate this.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.410
And when I take the limit, I
can just plug in the value.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.250
Whereas here, I'm
still uncertain.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.430
Because it's going to be 0.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.740
And I want to know which
side of 0 it's on.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.190
Whether it's on the positive
side or the negative side.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.310
So this one, I could have
written here a parentheses 2+,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.410
but then it would have just
simplified to - 1.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.410
In the limit.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.100
So now, I've got a negative
number divided by a tiny

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.100
positive number.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.940
And so, somebody want to
tell me what that is?

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.750
Negative infinity.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.460
So, we just evaluated this
function from one side.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:29.190
And if you follow through the
other side, so this one here,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.140
you get something very similar,
except that this

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.120
should be -- whoops, what
did I do wrong?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.690
I meant this.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.810
I want it -2 the same base
point, but I want

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.750
to go from the left.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.780
So that's going to be -
2 + 1, same numerator.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.540
And then this - 2 on the left +
2, and that's going to come

00:06:52.540 --> 00:07:00.670
out to be - 1 / 0 -, which
is plus infinity.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.348
Or just plain infinity,
we don't have to

00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:10.520
put the plus sign.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.090
So this is the first part
of the problem.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.630
And the second piece, to get
ourselves started, you could

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.260
evaluate this function
at any point.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.340
This is just the most
interesting point, alright?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.550
This is just the most
interesting

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.270
place to evaluate it.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.130
Now, the next thing that I'd
like to do is to pay attention

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.130
to the ends.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.290
And I haven't really said
what the ends are.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.290
So the ends are just all the
way to the left and all the

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.940
way to the right.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.670
So that means x going to
plus or minus infinity.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.430
So that's the second thing I
want to pay attention to.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.450
Again, this is a little bit
like a video screen here.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.720
And we're about to discover
something that's really off

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.750
the screen, in both cases.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.070
We're taking care of what's
happening way to the left, way

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.360
to the right, here.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.820
And up above, we just took
care what happens

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.280
way up and way down.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.550
So on these ends, I need to
do some more analysis.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.760
Which is related to a
precalculus skill which is

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.310
evaluating limits.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.950
And here, the way to do it is
to divide by x the numerator

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.010
and denominator.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.360
Write it as (1 + 1
/ x)/ (1 + 2 /x).

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.250
And then you can see what
happens as x goes to plus or

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:30.980
minus infinity.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.590
It just goes to 1.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.690
So, no matter whether x is
positive or negative.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.810
When it gets huge, these two
extra numbers here go to 0.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.550
And so, this tends to 1.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.450
So if you like, you could
abbreviate this as f (+ or -

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.830
infinity) = 1.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.610
So now, I get to draw this.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.900
And we draw this using
asymptotes.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.800
So there's a level
which is y = 1.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.790
And then there's another
line to draw.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:15.190
Which is x = - 2.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.520
And now, what information
do I have so far?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.260
Well, the information that I
have so far is that when we're

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.760
coming in from the right, that's
to - 2, it plunges down

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.570
to minus infinity.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.170
So that's down like this.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.810
And I also know that it goes
up to infinity on the other

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.850
side of the asymptote.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:48.130
And over here, I know it's
going out to the level 1.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:53.410
And here it's also going
to the level 1.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.160
Now, there's an issue.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.490
I can almost finish
this graph now.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.460
I almost have enough information
to finish it.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.890
But there's one thing
which is making me

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.780
hesitate a little bit.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.600
And that is, I don't know, for
instance, over here, whether

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.230
it's going to maybe dip below
and come back up.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.930
Or not.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.140
So what does it do here?

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.040
Can anybody see?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.250
Yeah.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.220
PROFESSOR: It can't dip
below because there

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.380
are no critical points.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.540
What a precisely
correct answer.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.730
So that's exactly right.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:44.260
The point here is that because
f' is not 0, it can't double

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.020
back on itself.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.790
Because there can't be any of
these horizontal tangents.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:11:00.560
It can't double back, so
it can't backtrack.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:07.190
So sorry, if f' is not
0, f can't backtrack.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.410
And so that means that it
doesn't look like this.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.320
It just goes like this.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.690
So that's basically it.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.630
And it's practically the
end of the problem.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.500
Goes like this.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.870
Now you can decorate
your thing, right?

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.540
You may notice that maybe it
crosses here, the axes, you

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.790
can actually evaluate
these places.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.500
And so forth.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.130
We're looking right now for
qualitative behavior.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.280
In fact, you can see where
these places hit.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.660
And it's actually a little
higher up than I drew.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.140
Maybe I'll draw it accurately.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.970
As we'll see in a second.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.710
So that's what happens
to this function.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.990
Now, let's just take a look in
a little bit more detail, by

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.840
double checking.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.990
So we're just going to double
check what happens to the sign

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.280
of the derivative.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.830
And in the meantime, I'm going
to explain to you what the

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.045
derivative is and also talk
about the second derivative.

00:12:07.045 --> 00:12:12.070
So first of all, the trick for
evaluating the derivative is

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.570
an algebraic one.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.080
I mean, obviously you can do
this by the quotient rule.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:24.250
But I just point out that this
is the same thing as this.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.650
And now it has, whoops, that
should be a 2 in the

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.690
denominator.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:35.950
And so, now this has the
form 1 - (1 / x + 2).

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.600
So this makes it easy to see
what the derivative is.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.730
Because the derivative of
a constant is 0, right?

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.640
So this is, derivative,
is just going to

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.300
be, switch the sign.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.410
This is what I wrote before.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.230
And that explains it.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.940
But incidentally, it
also shows you that

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:04.890
that this is a hyperbola.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:09.620
These are just two curves
of a hyperbola.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.240
So now, let's check the sign.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.290
It's already totally obvious
to us that this is just a

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.940
double check.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.710
We didn't actually even have to
pay any attention to this.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.790
It had better be true.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.220
This is just going to check
our arithmetic.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.570
Namely, it's increasing here.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.610
It's increasing there.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.830
That's got to be true.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.620
And, sure enough, this is
positive, as you can see it's

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.930
1 over a square.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.070
So it is increasing.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.630
So we checked it.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.370
But now, there's one more thing
that I want to just have

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.720
you watch out about.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.980
So this means that
f is increasing.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.830
On the interval minus infinity
&lt; x &lt; - 2.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.700
And also from - 2 all the
way out to infinity.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.360
So I just want to warn you, you
cannot say, don't say f is

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:12.020
increasing on minus infinity
&lt; infinity, for all x.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.090
OK, this is just not true.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.700
I've written it on the board,
but it's wrong.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.660
I'd better get rid of it.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.200
There it is.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.970
Get rid of it.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.555
And the reason is, so first of
all it's totally obvious.

00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:25.390
It's going up here.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.700
But then it went zooming
back down there.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:35.860
And here this was true, but
only if x is not - 2.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.400
So there's a break.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.280
And you've got to pay attention
to the break.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:50.510
So basically, the moral here
is that if you ignore this

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.050
place, it's like ignoring
Mount Everest,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.390
or the Grand Canyon.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.930
You're ignoring the most
important feature of this

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.300
function here.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.510
If you're going to be figuring
out where things are going up

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.710
and down, which is basically all
we're doing, you'd better

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.330
pay attention to these
kinds of places.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
So don't ignore them.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.140
So that's the first remark.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.340
And now there's just a little
bit of decoration as well.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.990
Which is the role of the
second derivative.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.990
So we've written down the
first derivative here.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:33.490
The second derivative is now
- 2 / (x + 2)^3, right?

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.942
So I get that from
differentiating this formula

00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:39.490
up here for the first
derivative.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.825
And now, of course, that's also,
only works for x not

00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:47.680
equal to - 2.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.820
And now, we can see that this is
going to be negative, let's

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.650
see, where is it negative?

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:02.680
When this is a positive
quantity, so when -2 &lt; x

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.405
&lt; infinity.

00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:04.590
It's negative.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.670
And this is where this thing
is concave. Let's see.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.650
Did I say that right?

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.330
Negative, right?

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:19.180
This is concave down.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:19.930
Right.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.400
And similarly, if I look at this
expression, the numerator

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.180
is always negative but the
denominator becomes negative

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.130
as well when x &lt; -2.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.710
So this becomes positive.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.690
So this case, it was negative
over positive.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.950
In this case it was negative
divided by negative.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:46.140
So here, this is in the range
- infinity &lt; x &lt; -2.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:52.240
And here it's concave up.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.310
Now, again, this is just
consistent with what we're

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.920
already guessing.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.910
Of course we already know it in
this case if we know that

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.680
this is a hyperbola.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.310
That it's going to be concave
down to the right of the

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.270
vertical line, dotted
vertical line.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.770
And concave up to the left.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.910
So what extra piece of
information is it that

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.100
this is giving us?

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.800
Did I say this backwards?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.520
No.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.570
That's OK.

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.430
So what extra piece of
information is this giving us?

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.400
It looks like it's giving
us hardly anything.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.680
And it really is giving
us hardly anything.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.840
But it is giving us something
that's a little aesthetic.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.280
It's ruling out the possibility
of a wiggle.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.590
There isn't anything like
that in the curve.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.412
It can't shift from curving this
way to curving that way

00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:41.590
to curving this way.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.860
That doesn't happen.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:48.723
So these properties say
there's no wiggle in

00:17:48.723 --> 00:17:59.070
the graph of that.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.790
Alright.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.410
So.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:01.890
Question.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.570
STUDENT: Do we define the
increasing and decreasing base

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.630
purely on the derivative, or
the sort of more general

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:14.310
definition of picking any
two points and seeing.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.530
Because sometimes there can be
an inconsistency between the

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.300
two definitions.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:26.300
PROFESSOR: OK, so the question
is, in this course are we

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.770
going to define positive
derivative as being the same

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.360
thing as increasing.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.030
And the answer is no.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.210
We'll try to use these
terms separately.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:41.780
What's always true is that if
f' is positive, then f is

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.530
increasing.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.060
But the reverse is not
necessarily true.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.790
It could be very flat, the
derivative can be 0 and still

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.050
the function can
be increasing.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.730
OK, the derivative can
be 0 at a few places.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:59.300
For instance, like
some cubics.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:05.370
Other questions?

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.860
So that's as much as I need
to say in general.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.390
I mean, in a specific case.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.670
But I want to get you a general
scheme and I want to

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.080
go through a more complicated
example that gets all the

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.750
features of this
kind of thing.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:34.710
So let's talk about a general
strategy for sketching.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.600
So the first part of
this strategy, if

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.800
you like, let's see.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.430
I have it all plotted
out here.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.200
So I'm going to make sure I
get it exactly the way I

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.780
wanted you to see.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.440
So I have, its plotting.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.720
The plot thickens.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.040
Here we go.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.710
So plot, what is it that
you should plot first?

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.710
Before you even think about
derivatives, you should plot

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:08.250
discontinuities.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:18.490
Especially the infinite ones.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.210
That's the first thing
you should do.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:27.160
And then, you should plot
end points, for ends.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.720
For x going to plus or minus
infinity if there don't happen

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.640
to be any finite ends
to the problem.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:44.600
And the third thing you can do
is plot any easy points.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.000
This is optional.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.710
At your discretion.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.920
You might, for instance, on this
example, plot the places

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.550
where the graph crosses
the axis.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:04.540
If you want to.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.810
So that's the first part.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.190
And again, this is
all precalculus.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:17.230
So now, in the second part
we're going to solve this

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.030
equation and we're
going to plot the

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:29.360
critical points and values.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.810
In the problem which we just
discussed, there weren't any.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.640
So this part was empty.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:50.200
So the third step is to decide
whether f', sorry, whether, f'

00:21:50.200 --> 00:22:01.120
is positive or negative
on each interval.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:17.210
Between critical points,
discontinuities.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:22.560
The direction of the sign, in
this case it doesn't change.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.900
It goes up here and it
also goes up here.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.770
But it could go up here and
then come back down.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.460
So the direction can change
at every critical point.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.850
It can change at every
discontinuity.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.350
And you don't know.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:44.520
However, this particular step
has to be consistent with 1

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.230
and 2, with steps 1 and 2.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:53.205
In fact, it will never, if you
can succeed in doing steps 1

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.970
and 2, you'll never
need step 3.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:02.190
All it's doing is
double-checking.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.140
So if you made an arithmetic
mistake somewhere, you'll be

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.160
able to see it.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.870
So that's maybe the most
important thing.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.220
And it's actually the most
frustrating thing for me when

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.760
I see people working on
problems, is they start step

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.790
3, they get it wrong, and then
they start trying to draw the

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.480
graph and it doesn't work.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.620
Because it's inconsistent.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.280
And the reason is some
arithmetic error with the

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.300
derivative or something like
that or some other

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.880
misinterpretation.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.930
And then there's a total mess.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.040
If you start with these two
steps, then you're going to

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.620
know when you get to this step
that you're making mistakes.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.720
People don't generally make
as many mistakes in

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.360
the first two steps.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.220
Anyway, in fact you can skip
this step if you want.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.470
But that's at risk of not
double-checking your work.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.280
So what's the fourth step?

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.180
Well, we take a look
at whether f''

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.400
is positive or negative.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.890
And so we're deciding on things
like whether it's

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:07.640
concave up or down.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:16.670
And we have these points, f''
( x ) = 0, which are called

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:24.570
inflection points.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:31.550
And the last step is just
to combine everything.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.710
So this is this the scheme,
the general scheme.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:58.850
And let's just carry it out
in a particular case.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.225
So here's the function
that I'm going

00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:02.280
to use as an example.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.250
I'll use f ( x ) = x / ln x.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.640
And because the logarithm
- yeah, question.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:11.960
Yeah.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:18.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.350
PROFESSOR: The question
is, is this optional.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.570
So that's a good question.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.390
Is this optional.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:31.516
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:37.590
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is is this optional;

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.660
this kind of question.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:49.100
And the answer is, it's more
than just -- so, in many

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.700
instances, I'm not going
to ask you to.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.390
I strongly recommend that if I
don't ask you to do it, that

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.050
you not try.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.050
Because it's usually awful to
find the second derivative.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.290
Any time you can get away
without computing a second

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.330
derivative, you're better off.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.920
So in many, many instances.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.500
On the other hand, if I ask you
to do it it's because I

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.060
want you to have the,
work to do it.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.950
But basically, if nobody forces
you to, I would say

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:22.130
never do step 4.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.750
Other questions.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.610
Alright.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.950
So we're going to force
ourselves to do step 4,

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.810
however, in this instance.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.010
But maybe this will be
one of the few times.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.140
So here we go, just for
illustrative purposes.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.240
OK, now.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.140
So here's the function that
I want to discuss.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.010
And the range has to be x
positive, because the

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:55.500
logarithm is not defined
for negative values.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.850
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is, I'd like to

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.560
follow the scheme here.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.450
Because if I don't follow the
scheme, I'm going to get a

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.490
little mixed up.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:13.980
So the first part is to find
the singularities.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.060
That is, the places where
f is infinite.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.720
And that's when the logarithm,
the denominator, vanishes.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.630
So that's f ( 1 +),
if you like.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:32.620
So that's 1 / ln 1 +, which is
1 / 0, with a little bit of

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.280
positiveness to it.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.270
Which is infinity.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.830
And second, we do it
the other way.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.690
And not surprisingly,
this comes out

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.850
to be negative infinity.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:51.980
Now, the next thing I want
to do is the ends.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.980
So I call these the ends.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.380
And there are two of them.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:08.300
One of them is f ( 0 ) from
the right. f ( 0+).

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:21.490
So that is 0 + / ln 0 +, which
is 0 plus divided by, well, ln

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.360
0 + is actually minus
infinity.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.940
That's what happens
to the logarithm,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.170
goes to minus infinity.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.250
So this is 0 over infinity,
which is definitely 0, there's

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:37.100
no problem. about
what happens.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.910
The other side, so this is the
end, this is the first end.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.920
The range is this.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.480
And I just did the
left endpoint.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.850
And so now I have to do the
right endpoint, I have to let

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.870
x go to infinity.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.350
So if I let x go to infinity,
I'm just going to have to

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.200
think about it a little
bit by plugging in

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.690
a very large number.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.960
I'll plug in 10 ^ 10, just
to see what happens.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.410
So if I plug in 10 ^ 10
into x ln x, I get

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:11.730
10 ^ 10 / ln 10^10.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:17.590
Which is 10 ^ 10
/ 10 ( log 10).

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.520
So the denominator, this
number here, is about

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.180
2.something.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.130
2.3 or something.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.310
So this is maybe 230 in the
denominator, and this is a

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.900
number with ten 0's after it.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.530
So it's very, very large.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.300
I claim it's big.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.040
And that gives us the clue that
what's happening is that

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.540
this thing is infinite.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.766
So, in other words, our
conclusion is that f of

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:52.120
infinity is infinity.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:59.650
So what do we have so far
for our function?

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.300
We're just trying to build the
scaffolding of the function.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.270
And we're doing it by taking
the most important points.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.520
And from a mathematician's
point of view, the most

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.250
important points are the
ones which are sort

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.490
of infinitely obvious.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.190
For the ends of the problem.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.730
So that's where we're heading.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.600
We have a vertical asymptote,
which is at x = 1.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:29.150
So this gives us x = 1.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:34.270
And we have a value which
is that it's 0 here.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.850
And we also know that when we
come in from the - sorry, so

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:44.716
we come in from the left, that's
f, the one from the

00:30:44.716 --> 00:30:46.060
left, we get negative
infinity.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.550
So it's diving down.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.460
It's going down like this.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.925
And, furthermore, on the other
side we know it's climbing up.

00:30:55.925 --> 00:30:58.560
So it's going up like this.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.460
Just start a little higher.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:00.770
Right, so.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.520
So far, this is what we know.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.810
Oh, and there's one other
thing that we know.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:12.420
When we go to plus infinity,
it's going back up.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.150
So, so far we have this.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.950
Now, already it should be pretty
obvious what's going to

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.760
happen to this function.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.160
So there shouldn't be
many surprises.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.160
It's going to come
down like this.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.090
Go like this, it's going to turn
around and go back up.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.290
That's what we expect.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:33.600
So we don't know that yet,
but we're pretty sure.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.890
So at this point, we can
start looking at

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.800
the critical points.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.994
We can do our step 2 here -- we
need a little bit more room

00:31:41.994 --> 00:31:45.490
here -- and see what's happening
with this function.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.220
So I have to differentiate it.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.070
And it's, this is the
quotient rule.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.880
So remember the function
is up here, x / ln x.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.400
So I have a ln x^2 in
the denominator.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.190
And I get here the derivative of
x is 1, so we get 1 ( ln x)

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:10.560
- x ( the derivative of
ln x, which is 1 /x).

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:20.160
So all told, that's (ln
x - 1) / ln x^2.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:27.770
So here's our derivative.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:34.520
And now, if I set this equal
to 0, at least in the

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.970
numerator, the numerator
is 0 when x = e.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.490
The ln e = 1.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.290
So here's our critical point.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:51.320
And we have a critical
value, which is f(e).

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.610
And that's going
to be e / ln e.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.240
Which is e, again.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.090
Because ln e = 1.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.890
So now I can also plot
the critical point,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.110
which is down here.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.680
And there's only one of them,
and it's at (e e).

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.800
That's kind of not to scale
here, because my blackboard

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.520
isn't quite tall enough.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.360
It should be over here and
then, it's slope 1.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.140
But I dipped it down.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.300
So this is not to scale, and
indeed that's one of the

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.240
things that we're not going to
attempt to do with these

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.680
pictures, is to make
them to scale.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.560
So the scale's a little
squashed.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.710
So, so far I have this
critical point.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.180
And, in fact, I'm going
to label it with a c.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.560
Whenever I have a critical point
I'll just make sure that

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.490
I remember that that's
what it is.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.450
And since there's only one, the
rest of this picture is

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.900
now correct.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.880
That's the same mechanism that
we used for the hyperbola.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.290
Namely, we know there's only
one place where the

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:57.810
derivative is 0.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.550
So that means there no more
horizontals, so there's no

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.950
more backtracking.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.330
It has to come down to here.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:03.970
Get to there.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.060
This is the only place
it can turn around.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.170
Goes back up.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.000
It has to start here and it
has to go down to there.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.600
It can't go above 0.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.600
Do not pass go, do
not get positive.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.230
It has to head down here.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.690
So that's great.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.460
That means that this
picture is almost

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.080
completely correct now.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.520
And the rest is more
or less decoration.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.590
We're pretty much done with
the way it looks, at least

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.570
schematically.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.700
However, I am going to punish
you, because I warned you.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.140
We are going to go over here and
do this step 4 and fix up

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.280
the concavity.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.180
And we're also going to do
a little bit of that

00:34:46.180 --> 00:35:00.770
double-checking.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:06.130
So now, let's again, just,
I want to emphasize.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:10.660
We're going to do
a double-check.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.240
This is part 3.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.110
But in advance, I already have,
based on this picture I

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.000
already know what
has to be true.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:30.380
That f is decreasing on
0 to 1. f is also

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.450
decreasing on 1 to e.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:45.490
And f is increasing
on e to infinity.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.710
So, already, because we've plot
a bunch of points and we

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.470
know that there aren't any
places where the derivative

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.500
vanishes, we already know
it goes down, down, up.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.970
That's what it's got to do.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.550
Now, we'll just make sure that
we didn't make any arithmetic

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:00.720
mistakes, now.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.090
By actually computing
the derivative, or

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.650
staring at it, anyway.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:10.350
And making sure that
it's correct.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:17.600
So first of all, we just take
a look at the numerator.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:26.120
So f,' remember, was (ln
x - 1) / ln x^2,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.655
the quantity squared.

00:36:26.655 --> 00:36:28.480
So the denominator
is positive.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.650
So let's just take a look
at the three ranges.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.330
So we have 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.900
And on that range, the logarithm
is negative, so this

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.230
is negative divided by positive,
which is negative.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.220
That's decreasing,
that's good.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.160
And in fact, that also works
on the next range.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.370
1 l&lt; x &lt; e, it's negative
divided by positive.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.840
And the only reason why we
skipped 1, again, is that it's

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.432
undefined there.

00:36:58.432 --> 00:37:01.040
And there's something dramatic
happening there.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.420
And then, at the last range,
when x is bigger than e, that

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.860
means the logarithm is already
bigger than 1.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.726
So the numerator is now
positive, and the

00:37:09.726 --> 00:37:13.650
denominator's still positive,
so it's increasing.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.450
So we've just double-checked
something

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:22.910
that we already knew.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:26.940
Alright, so that's pretty
much all there is to

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.200
say about step 3.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.980
So this is checking the
positivity and negativity.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.660
And now, step 4.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.820
There is one small point
which I want to make

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.480
before we go on.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.980
Which is that sometimes, you
can't evaluate the function or

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.445
its derivative particularly
well.

00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:48.620
So sometimes you can't plot
the points very well.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.410
And if you can't plot the points
very well, then you

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.790
might have to do 3 first, to
figure out what's going on a

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.290
little bit.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.150
You might have to skip.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.400
So now we're going to go on
the second derivative.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.900
But first, I want to use an
algebraic trick to rearrange

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.820
the terms. And I want to notice
one more little point.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:16.320
Which I, as I say, this is
decoration for the graph.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.290
So I want to rewrite
the formula.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:22.320
Maybe I'll do it right
over here.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:31.440
Another way of writing this is
(1 / ln x) - (1 / (ln x)^2).

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.240
So that's another way of
writing the derivative.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.520
And that allows me to
notice something

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.830
that I missed, before.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.880
When I solved the equation ln
x - 1 - this is equal to 0

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.590
here, this equation here.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.460
I missed a possibility.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.330
I missed the possibility
that the

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:58.690
denominator could be infinity.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.180
So actually, if the
denominator's infinity, as you

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.020
can see from the other
expression there, it actually

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.000
is true that the derivative
is 0.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.710
So also when x = 0 +, the
slope is going to be 0.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.050
Let me just emphasize
that again.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.740
If you evaluate using this other
formula over here, this

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:31.540
is (1 / ln 0+) - (1
/ (ln 0+)^2).

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.950
That's 1 / - infinity
- 1 / infinity,

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.310
if you like, squared.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.630
Anyway, it's 0.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.330
So this is 0.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.410
The slope is 0 there.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.640
That is a little piece of
decoration on our graph.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.810
It's telling us, going back to
our graph here, it's telling

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.560
us this is coming in with
slope horizontal.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.530
So we're starting
out this way.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.013
That's just a little start
here to the graph.

00:40:01.013 --> 00:40:02.620
It's a horizontal slope.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.690
So there really were two places
where the slope was

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.940
horizontal.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.550
Now, with the help of this
second formula I can also

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.050
differentiate a second time.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.690
So it's a little bit easier to
do that if I differentiate 1 /

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:34.270
ln, that's -( ln x) ^ - 2 ( 1
/ x) + 2 (ln x) ^ -3 (1/x).

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:42.150
And that, if I put it over a
common denominator, is x ln

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:48.690
x^3 times, let's see here.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:55.340
I guess I'll have to
take the 2 - ln x.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.880
So I've now rewritten the
formula for the second

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.450
derivative as a ratio.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:09.610
Now, to decide the sign, you see
there are two places where

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.910
the sign flips.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:16.540
The numerator crosses when the
logarithm is 2, that's going

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.620
to be when x = e ^2.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:24.270
And the denominator flips when
x = 1, that's when the log

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.020
flips from positive
to negative.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.280
So we have a couple
of ranges here.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.580
So, first of all, we have
the range from 0 to 1.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.270
And then we have the range
from 1 to e^2.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.802
And then we have the
range from e ^2 all

00:41:45.802 --> 00:41:49.780
the way out to infinity.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:58.640
So between 0 and 1, the
numerator is, well this is a

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.870
negative number in this, so
minus a negative number is

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:04.650
positive, so the numerator
is positive.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.700
And the denominator is negative,
because the ln is

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.660
negative it's taken to
the third power.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.371
So this is a negative numbers,
so it's positive divided by a

00:42:12.371 --> 00:42:15.190
negative number, which
is less than 0.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.770
That means it's concave down.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:26.040
So this is concave down plot.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.360
And that's a good thing, because
over here this is

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.120
concave down.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.560
So there are no wiggles.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.260
It goes straight down,
like this.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:41.770
And then the other two pieces
are f'' is equal to, well it's

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.260
going to switch here.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.856
The denominator becomes
positive.

00:42:44.856 --> 00:42:48.190
So it's positive
over positive.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:56.670
So this is concave up.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.410
And that's going over here.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:02.715
But notice that it's not the
bottom where it turns around,

00:43:02.715 --> 00:43:07.740
it's somewhere else.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.930
So there's another
transition here.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.090
This is e ^2.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.090
This is e.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:20.440
So what happens at the end is,
again, the sign flips again.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.440
Because the numerator,
now, when x &gt;

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.580
e ^2, becomes negative.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.820
And this is negative divided by

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.965
positive, which is negative.

00:43:29.965 --> 00:43:35.630
And part is concave down.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.100
And so we didn't quite
draw the graph right.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.180
There's an inflection point
right here, which

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.000
I'll label with i.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.340
Makes a turn the other
way at that point.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.480
So there was a wiggle.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.210
There's the wiggle.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.710
Still going up, still
going to infinity.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.040
But kind of the slope of
the mountain, right?

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.240
It's going the other way.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:09.350
This point happens to
be (e^2, e ^2 / 2).

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.980
So that's as detailed
as we'll ever get.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.910
And indeed, the next game is
going to be avoid being, is to

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.730
avoid being this detailed.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.760
So let me introduce
the next subject.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:48.310
Which is maxima and minima.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:45:04.160
OK, now, maxima and minima,
maximum and minimum problems

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.550
can be described graphically
in the following ways.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:13.150
Suppose you have a function,
right, here it is.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.420
OK?

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:24.630
Now, find the maximum.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:30.740
And find the minimum.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.410
OK.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:38.880
So this problem is done.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:51.625
The point being, that it is easy
to find max and the min

00:45:51.625 --> 00:45:58.670
with the sketch.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.330
It's very easy.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.130
The goal, the problem, is that
the sketch is a lot of work.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:10.180
We just spent 20 minutes
sketching something.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.560
We would not like to spend all
that time every single time we

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.970
want to find a maximum
and minimum.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.950
So the goal is to do
it with, so our

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:25.170
goal is to use shortcuts.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:31.080
And, indeed, as I said earlier,
we certainly never

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.840
want to use the second
derivative if we can avoid it.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.270
And we don't want to decorate
the graph and do all of these

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.000
elaborate, subtle, things which
make the graph look

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.640
nicer and really, or
aesthetically appropriate.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.640
But are totally unnecessary
to see whether the

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:54.290
graph is up or down.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:58.180
So essentially, this whole
business is out, which is a

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.030
good thing.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.310
And, unfortunately, those early
parts are the parts that

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.170
people tend to ignore.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.150
Which are typically, often,
very important.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:22.940
So let me first tell you
the main point here.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:32.760
So the key idea.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:39.650
Key to finding maximum.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.970
So the key point is,
we only need to

00:47:41.970 --> 00:48:00.130
look at critical points.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:04.740
Well, that's actually what
it seems like to, in many

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.490
calculus classes.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.810
But that's not true.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:15.590
This is not the end
of the sentence.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:35.320
And, end points, and points
of discontinuity.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.980
So you must watch
out for those.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.780
If you look at the example that
I just drew here, which

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.450
is the one that I carried out,
you can see that there are

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:51.250
actually five extreme points
on this picture.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.750
So let's switch.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:58.050
So we'll take a look.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:04.840
There are five places where the
max or the min might be.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.050
There's this important point.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.710
This is, as I say, the
scaffolding of the function.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:13.650
There's this point, there
down at minus infinity.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:18.370
There's this, there's this,
and there's this.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:23.620
Only one out of five is
a critical point.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.030
So there's more that
you have to pay

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.450
attention to on the function.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.800
And you always have to keep the
schema, the picture of the

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.310
function, in the back
of your head.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.820
Even though this may be the most
interesting point, and

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.520
the one that you're going
to be looking at.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:41.180
So we'll do a few examples
of that next time.
