00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.670
Philosophy is a discipline committed to helping
us to live wiser and less sorrowful lives.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.430
Here are six ideas from its Western branch
that can inspire and console: ONE: ‘What

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.599
need is there to weep over parts of life?
The whole of it calls for tears.’ The Roman

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.460
philosopher Seneca used to comfort his friends
– and himself – with this darkly humourous

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.750
remark which gets to the heart of Stoicism,
the school of philosophy which Seneca helped

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.519
to found and which dominated the West for
two hundred years. We get weepy and furious,

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.330
says Stoicism, not simply because our plans
have failed, but because they have failed

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.790
and we strongly expected them not to. Therefore,
thought Seneca, the task of philosophy is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.560
to disappoint us gently before life has a
chance to do so violently. The less we expect,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.300
the less we will suffer. Through the help
of a consoling pessimism, we should strive

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.110
to turn our rage and our tears into that far
less volatile compound: sadness. Seneca was

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.020
not trying to depress us, just to spare us
the kind of hope that, when it fails, inspires

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.359
bitterness and intemperate shouting. TWO:
Peccatum Originale In the late 4th century,

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.530
as the immense Roman Empire was collapsing,
the leading philosopher of the age, St Augustine,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.979
became deeply interested in possible explanations
for the evident tragic disorder of the human

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.880
world. One central idea he developed was what
he legendarily termed Peccatum Originale:

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.299
original sin. Augustine proposed that human
nature is inherently damaged and tainted because

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.479
– in the Garden of Eden – the mother of
all people, Eve, sinned against God by eating

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.840
an apple from the Tree of Knowledge. Her guilt
was then passed down to her descendants and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.240
now all earthly human endeavours are bound
to fail because they are the work of a corrupt

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.119
and faulty human spirit. This odd idea might
not be literally true, of course. However,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.330
as a metaphor for why the world is in a mess,
it has a beguiling poetic truth, as relevant

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.330
to atheists as believers. We should not – perhaps
– expect too much from the human race, Augustine

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.360
implies. We’ve been somewhat doomed from
the outset. And that can, in certain moods,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.660
be a highly redemptive thought to keep in
mind. THREE: ‘Kings and Philosophers shit,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.980
and so do ladies’ The blunt phrase appears
in an essay by the 16th century French philosopher,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.890
Michel de Montaigne. Montaigne wasn’t being
mean. His point was kindly: he wanted us to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.300
feel closer to (and less intimidated) by people
whose overt mode of life might seem painfully

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.030
impressive and very far from our own. And
he could have added: in secret these people

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.800
also feel inadequate, fear rejection and mess
up their sex-lives. We could also update his

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.220
examples to speak of CEOs, entrepreneurs,
and the over-achieving person we went to college

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.310
with. Montaigne was attempting to free us
from underconfidence and shyness, born out

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.980
of an exaggerated sense of the differences
between ourselves and mighty others. At moments

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.710
of panic, before an important speech or a
much-anticipated date, we should run Montaigne’s

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.300
phrase through our febrile, underconfident
minds and remind ourselves that no one, however

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.220
outwardly poised, is more than a few hours
away from a poignantly modest and vulnerable

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.740
moment. FOUR: ‘All our unhappiness comes
from our inability to sit alone in our room’

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.180
This assertion, by the 17th century French
philosopher Pascal, is obviously not literally

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.040
true. But like all good philosophical aphorisms,
it pointedly exaggerates an important idea

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.400
in order to bring home a general insight.
We are tempted to leave ‘our room’ and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.490
crave excitements that too often turn out
badly; we meddle in the lives of others but

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.610
fail to help them; we seek fame and end up
being misunderstood by large numbers of people

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.650
we don’t know. ‘Sitting alone’ doesn’t
mean literally being on the bed but rather,

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.460
staying undistracted with ourselves: appreciating
small pleasures; examining the contents of

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.060
our own minds, allowing the quieter (but important)
parts of our psyche to emerge; thinking before

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.270
we act. It’s a poignant phrase because the
louder voices in our culture are constantly

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.180
speaking in the opposite direction; are always
goading us to get out more, to grow more agitated,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.319
to seek more drama and to spend less time
in thoughtful reveries, gazing out of the

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:54.430
window at the clouds passing high above. We
should, with Pascal’s encouragement, learn

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:03.939
to become better friends to ourselves. FIVE:
Sub specie aeternitatis It means, translated

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.840
from the Latin, ‘under the aspect of eternity’
– a memorable phrase from the Ethics, published

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.900
in 1677 by the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza.
For Spinoza, the task of philosophy is to

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.409
teach us to look at things, especially our
own suffering and disappointment, ‘under

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.120
the aspect of eternity,’ that is, as though
we were gazing down at the earth from very

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.450
far away or from a different star (Spinoza’s
outlook was much indebted to Galileo). From

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.389
this lofty perspective, the incidents that
trouble us no longer have to seem so shocking

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.590
or so large. What is a divorce or a sacking
when contemplated from the lunar surface?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.960
What is a rejection in love judged against
the earth’s 4.5 billion year history? Our

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.879
nature means that we’ll always be pulled
to exaggerate the here and now, but our reasoned

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.960
intelligence gives us access to a unique alternative
perspective, in which we participate in what

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.979
Spinoza called ‘eternal totality’, and
can cease railing against the status quo,

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:15.020
submitting to the flow of events with clear-eyed
serenity instead. SIX: Aus so krummem Holze,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.009
als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts
ganz Gerades gezimmert werden. It’s a slightly

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:26.639
daunting and long German phrase but a hugely
arresting and redemptive one, central to the

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:33.849
spirit of Western philosophy: ‘Out of the
crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:40.430
was ever made.’ So wrote the German eighteenth
century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who urged

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.949
us to recognise that nothing that human beings
do can ever be less than slightly wonky, because

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:52.279
we are creatures as much of passion and erroneous
instinct as of reason and noble intelligence.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:58.680
The wise accept this dark reality head on
and so do not expect perfection. When designing

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.409
governments, they do not presume that rationality
will triumph; they do everything to assume

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:09.229
that error and folly will try to have their
way – and create structures to contain them.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.409
When they marry, with comparable realism,
they never expect that one person can be everything

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:20.219
to them and then harangue a partner when they
turn out not to be. An acceptance of our crooked

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:27.259
nature isn’t dispiriting, it’s the birth
of generosity and dark good humour. Not least,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:35.340
added Kant, crooked beams can make for beautiful
floors, in the hands of a talented carpenter.
