00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.760
 Ian Lake: I remember when dinosaurs ruled the earth 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.090
 Android notifications were like this. 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.460
 Oh my God. 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660
 Luckily, I saw less dinosaurs around me. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.330
 Android notifications have improved a lot 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.270
 Permanent change of interface does not lead to 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.540
 Experience an easy twist 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.240
 Therefore, there is NotificationCompat. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.400
 It gives you a single interface across all levels of the software application 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 So you can focus on building 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.500
 Best possible notifications. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 I'm Ian Lick 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060
 And I'll show you how you can build great notifications 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.280
 With the help of NotificationCompat 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.650
 Enabling users to re-employ, whether on their phones or their hours 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.875
 Or inside their car. 

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.640
 But I anticipate things a lot. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.910
 Let's start from the beginning. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.440
 Each notification has required parts - a small icon 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.820
 Title and text. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.300
 To make a notification, use the NotificationCompat builder 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.920
 Then create and send notifications. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.040
 Done 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.330
 There is a serious mistake. 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.260
 Clicking on this notice does nothing. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 nothing! 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.690
 We need a contentintent message that indicates 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.820
 To the activity to be launched 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
 When the user presses the notice. 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.920
 But we can do more for notifications. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 Specify the color to make the notice 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950
 Known as your app 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.180
 Put a large icon, let us know now 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.885
 Notifications from those who come. 

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:15.760
 You've already received a notification 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.030
 Would like to press it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.200
 This title and text is initial. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.720
 All available on old operating rules. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.870
 But you should not stop on the initial. 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.000
 Let us do this well 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.320
 I mean very well 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680
 On Android 4.1 and the most advanced devices 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 Notifications can be expanded, which gives you 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.030
 More space to work, bypass address 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.420
 One line of text. 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 NotificationCompat gives you four designs 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.480
 You can use it to improve your notifications 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.490
 Especially when expanded 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050
 You will find BigTextStyle to see multiple lines of text, 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.610
 Like long messages, this is perfect to see 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.400
 Full message. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 InboxStyle, to see a list of single line fonts 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 And BigPictureStyle to display - 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.440
 I've guessed it - big picture when zoomed in. 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.480
 And MediaStyle to add media control buttons directly 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.470
 To your notifications. 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.770
 So, it became our room to breathe 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.370
 And give users a lot of information. 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.900
 To pull them back to your program. 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.410
 good. 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.990
 But we are busy people. 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.860
 Add works to your notifications 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.160
 Give users quick access to the most important activities 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.740
 Without spoiling their airspace 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.330
 It does not mean that I will silence the voice of Joanna's notice. 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.730
 But notifications are no longer on your mobile phone. 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 It is also on your wrist with your Android Wear device. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 Any work you've added to your notification 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.450
 Automatically reflected on Android Wear devices. 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.270
 Allowing users to take over their tasks without carrying 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.340
 Their phones up or open the program. 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.960
 But your phone's experience is reflected in Android Wear 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.940
 It has its limits 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.240
 To make things great, you can use a program 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.660
 WearableExtender of NotificationCompat. 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.150
 Here all the magic features of Wear happen. 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.765
 We talked about the reversal of activities. 

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.760
 With the WearableExtender program, you can build 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.630
 A perfect set of activities to keep up with the clock 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.040
 Includes voice response 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.030
 These are rich activities that increase interaction, even though 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.370
 The user has not opened your program. 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.780
 Another example is adding a high resolution background image 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 It is the easiest way to get a fresh experience. 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.290
 There is a lot you can for NotificationCompat 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.960
 WearableExtender granted to you 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.420
 Especially adding additional pages of data 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.290
 Notifications for additional content and capability 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.370
 To collect notifications in a single package 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.950
 What shows you all the details on the hour, 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.360
 And a telephone brief. 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.760
 Well, there are a lot of things you can do on your wrist. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.460
 What about a car connected to Android Auto? 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.970
 Here, messaging programs can use NotificationCompat 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990
 CarExtender to send a message or group of messages 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.640
 In a conversation with Android Auto, where it is 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.410
 It can be read aloud and the user responds to it 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 While focusing on leadership 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.670
 If, using NotificationCompat, 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.540
 You get a single application interface for all versions of Android 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.850
 And support for further improvements by adding 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.560
 Designs, activities and tools 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.320
 To make great notifications for Android Wear and Android Auto. 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.440
 There are many opportunities to make great notifications 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.820
 Everywhere. 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.579
 Start with NotificationCompat 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.220
 By adding a support library to your project. 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.910
 You'll need App Compat for media notifications 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.010
 Or support for the v4 version 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.970
 For all that NotificationCompat provides. 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.130
 With all the tools you need to build great notifications 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.610
 On your phone, tablet, clock or car you can only build 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 Better applications 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.270
