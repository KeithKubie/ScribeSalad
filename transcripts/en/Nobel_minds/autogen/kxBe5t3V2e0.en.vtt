are against parasites so camp a little

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:33.610
are against parasites so camp a little
 

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.290
are against parasites so camp a little
more their discoveries have led to drugs

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:37.300

that are used now to treat roundworm
 

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.110
that are used now to treat roundworm
infections and this is causing diseases

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120
infections and this is causing diseases
 

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.750
infections and this is causing diseases
like elephant kisses and river blindness

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760
like elephant kisses and river blindness
 

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.910

those two diseases are really

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:47.920
those two diseases are really
 

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.730
those two diseases are really
debilitating people have lifelong

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:50.740

they prevent disability and they prevent
the spread of infection and they also

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760
the spread of infection and they also
 

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.899
the spread of infection and they also
improve the life well-being of

what so you have to think of it as two

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.150
what so you have to think of it as two
 

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.520
what so you have to think of it as two
parts so amaura was working in Japan and

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:09.530
parts so amaura was working in Japan and
 

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.349
parts so amaura was working in Japan and
he was really interested in identifying

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359
he was really interested in identifying
 

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:16.089
he was really interested in identifying
microbial and it might microbe

00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:16.099
microbial and it might microbe
 

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:19.059
microbial and it might microbe
antibiotics so he went to soil and he

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:19.069
antibiotics so he went to soil and he
 

00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:20.890
antibiotics so he went to soil and he
had a hypothesis that he would be able

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:20.900
had a hypothesis that he would be able
 

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.539
had a hypothesis that he would be able
to collect soil samples and they would

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:22.549
to collect soil samples and they would
 

00:35:22.549 --> 00:35:24.670
to collect soil samples and they would
have bacteria that would ward off

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:24.680
have bacteria that would ward off
 

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.819
have bacteria that would ward off
infection and so he collected soil

00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:27.829
infection and so he collected soil
 

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:29.500
infection and so he collected soil
samples and cultured them in his

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.510
samples and cultured them in his
 

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.620
samples and cultured them in his
laboratory and he looked for samples

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:32.630
laboratory and he looked for samples
 

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.650
laboratory and he looked for samples
that had unusual properties and that he

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:35.660
that had unusual properties and that he
 

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.930
that had unusual properties and that he
then selected from thousands of cultures

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:37.940
then selected from thousands of cultures
 

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.750
then selected from thousands of cultures
about 50 of these samples that he sat on

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760
about 50 of these samples that he sat on
 

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:46.440
about 50 of these samples that he sat on
and kampl could take these samples and

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.450
and kampl could take these samples and
 

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.900
and kampl could take these samples and
give them to animals to mice they took

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:49.910
give them to animals to mice they took
 

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.940
give them to animals to mice they took
life alized broths

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:51.950
life alized broths
 

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.309
life alized broths
from these samples mix them in the food

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319
from these samples mix them in the food
 

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.500
from these samples mix them in the food
of mice and they could find that they

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:56.510
of mice and they could find that they
 

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.049
of mice and they could find that they
had anti-parasitic effects they could

00:35:59.049 --> 00:35:59.059
had anti-parasitic effects they could
 

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:01.960
had anti-parasitic effects they could
kill parasites in mice campo also took

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:01.970
kill parasites in mice campo also took
 

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.319
kill parasites in mice campo also took
these compounds and he tested them in

they were because they were so

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:42.980
they were because they were so
 

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.010
they were because they were so
efficacious so they were seen as a

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:45.020
efficacious so they were seen as a
 

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.460

really came to the Western world some
 

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.770
really came to the Western world some
years later but it was clear that both

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:56.780
years later but it was clear that both
 

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.630
years later but it was clear that both
of these compounds ever met in first

of these drugs we now have therapies

00:38:56.359 --> 00:38:56.369
of these drugs we now have therapies
 

00:38:56.369 --> 00:38:59.809
of these drugs we now have therapies
that kill these parasites very early in

00:38:59.809 --> 00:38:59.819
that kill these parasites very early in
 

00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:00.980
that kill these parasites very early in
their lifecycle

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:00.990
their lifecycle
 

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.559
their lifecycle
they not only kill these parasites but

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:03.569
they not only kill these parasites but
 

00:39:03.569 --> 00:39:05.660
they not only kill these parasites but
they stop these infections from

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:05.670
they stop these infections from
 

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.470
they stop these infections from
spreading so it's it's one way to kill

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480
spreading so it's it's one way to kill
 

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.020
spreading so it's it's one way to kill
the parasite another way to stop it from
