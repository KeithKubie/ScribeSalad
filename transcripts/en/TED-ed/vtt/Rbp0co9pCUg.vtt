00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:10.791
You probably don't need to be told 
how important your brain is.

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:13.174
After all, every single thing 
you experience,

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.708
your thoughts and your actions,

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:17.123
your perceptions and your memories

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:20.354
are processed here 
in your body's control center.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.935
But if this already seems like a lot
for a single organ to handle,

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:28.043
it's actually only a small 
part of what the brain does.

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:31.209
Most of its activities are ones 
you'd never be aware of,

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:33.913
unless they suddenly stopped.

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:36.144
The brain is made up 
of billions of neurons,

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:38.206
and trillions of connections.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.363
Neurons can be activated 
by specific stimuli or thoughts,

00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:44.749
but they are also often 
spontaneously active.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.262
Some fire cyclically in a set pattern.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:51.642
Others fire rapidly in short bursts 
before switching off,

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:54.011
or remain quiet for long periods

00:00:54.011 --> 00:01:00.054
until thousands of inputs from other 
neurons line up in just the right way.

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:01.223
On a large scale,

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:05.555
this results in elaborate rhythms 
of internally generated brain activity,

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.404
humming quietly in the background

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:09.188
whether we're awake, asleep,

00:01:09.188 --> 00:01:12.492
or trying not to think 
about anything at all.

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:15.038
And these spontaneously 
occurring brain functions

00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:20.128
form the foundation upon which
all other brain functions rely.

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:23.583
The most crucial of these automatically
occurring activities

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.831
are the ones that keep us alive.

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.752
For example, while you've been
paying attention to this video

00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:32.661
spontaneous activity in your brain
has been maintaining your breathing

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:38.048
at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,
making sure that you don't suffocate.

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:39.558
Without any conscious effort,

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:43.243
signals from parts of your brainstem
are sent through the spinal cord

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:45.766
to the muscles that inflate your lungs,

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:50.452
making them expand and contract,
whether or not you're paying attention.

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:54.601
The neuronal circuits underlying such 
rhythmic spontaneous activity

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.614
are called central pattern generators,

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:00.442
and control many 
simple repetitive behaviors,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:01.314
like breathing,

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.399
walking,

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.622
and swallowing.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:07.733
Ongoing neural activity also underlies
our sensory perception.

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:08.911
It may seem

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.084
that the neurons in your retina
that translate light into neural signals

00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:14.219
would remain quiet in the dark,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.259
but in fact,

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.567
the retinal ganglion cells 
that communicate with the brain

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:20.349
are always active.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.331
And the signals they send are increases 
and decreases in the rate of activity,

00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:27.329
rather than separate bursts.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.648
So at every level, our nervous system
is teeming with spontaneous activity

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:36.253
that helps it interpret and respond
to any signals it might receive.

00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:40.882
And our brain's autopilot isn't just 
limited to our basic biological functions.

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:42.524
Have you ever been on the way home,

00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:44.748
started thinking 
about what's for dinner,

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:48.378
and then realized you don't remember
walking for the past five minutes?

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:50.911
While we don't understand all the details,

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:54.663
we do know that the ongoing activity
in multiple parts of your brain

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:58.525
is somehow able to coordinate 
what is actually a complex task

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.120
involving both cognitive 
and motor functions,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.682
guiding you down the right path
and moving your legs

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:06.711
while you're getting dinner figured out.

00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:10.070
But perhaps the most interesting thing
about spontaneous brain function

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.578
is its involvement in one 
of the most mysterious

00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:16.920
and poorly understood phenomena
of our bodies: sleep.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.036
You may shut down 
and become inactive at night,

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:22.239
but your brain doesn't.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.286
While you sleep,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:28.264
ongoing spontaneous activity gradually 
becomes more and more synchronized,

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:32.623
eventually developing into large, 
rhythmic neural oscillations

00:03:32.623 --> 00:03:34.933
that envelop your brain.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.044
This transition to the more 
organized rhythms of sleep

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:42.885
starts with small clusters of neurons
tucked in the hypothalamus.

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.638
Despite their small number,

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.458
these neurons have a huge effect

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:51.097
in turning off brainstem regions
that normally keep you awake and alert,

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:53.485
letting other parts, 
like the cortex and thalamus,

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:57.231
slowly slip into their 
own default rhythms.

00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:58.741
The deeper we fall into sleep,

00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.729
the slower and more synchronized
this rhythm becomes,

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:09.303
with the deepest stages dominated by large
amplitude, low frequency delta waves.

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:12.562
But surprisingly, in the middle 
of this slow wave sleep,

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:15.564
the brain's synchronized 
spontaneous activity

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:19.129
repeatedly transitions
into the sort of varied bursts

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.417
that occur when we're wide awake.

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:24.241
This is the sleep stage
known as REM sleep,

00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:28.506
where our eyes move rapidly 
back and forth as we dream.

00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:33.463
Neuroscientists are still trying to answer
many fundamental questions about sleep,

00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:36.519
such as its role in rejuvenating
cognitive capacity,

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.358
cellular homeostasis,

00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:40.182
and strengthening memory.

00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:41.953
And more broadly, they are exploring

00:04:41.953 --> 00:04:46.688
how it is that brain can accomplish 
such important and complex tasks,

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:51.137
such as driving, or even breathing,
without our awareness.

00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:53.225
But for now, until we are better able

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:57.067
to understand the inner workings
of their spontaneous functioning,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.154
we need to give our brains credit
for being much smarter

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.276
than we ourselves are.
