Often when you're writing code for a class like the person class, you want to

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:07.993
give each person a unique ID. That might look something like this, you would

00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:12.769
have a private int ID, and each person object would have one. Now, there are a

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.532
few ways to generate a different ID for each person. One would be to create a

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:22.419
static variable. LastAssignedId and use the lastAssignedId to set each person's

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.262
ID when they are created, we would also want to increment the lastAssignedId

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:31.827
every time we used it. Try this out yourself. How would you give each person a

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:35.607
unique ID starting from 1 and going up one at a time, so the first person would

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:40.430
have ID 1, the second person would have ID 2 and so on.
