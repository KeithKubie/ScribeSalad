00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
direction yeah I think that's actually
the<00:03:24.470><c> thing</c><00:03:25.160><c> that's</c><00:03:25.310><c> the</c><00:03:25.400><c> most</c><00:03:25.609><c> untraditional</c>

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
the thing that's the most untraditional
 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
the thing that's the most untraditional
is<00:03:26.480><c> that</c><00:03:26.600><c> we</c><00:03:27.230><c> haven't</c><00:03:27.530><c> had</c><00:03:27.799><c> a</c><00:03:27.829><c> very</c><00:03:28.130><c> slick</c>

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 align:start position:0%
is that we haven't had a very slick
 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.940 align:start position:0%
is that we haven't had a very slick

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 align:start position:0%
grown organically and that we don't
 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.009 align:start position:0%
grown organically and that we don't
actually<00:03:33.859><c> go</c><00:03:34.640><c> after</c><00:03:35.060><c> business</c><00:03:35.299><c> in</c><00:03:35.810><c> a</c>

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 align:start position:0%
traditional way the matter of fact we
 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.229 align:start position:0%
traditional way the matter of fact we
have<00:03:38.630><c> never</c><00:03:38.780><c> solicited</c><00:03:39.430><c> any</c><00:03:40.430><c> of</c><00:03:40.640><c> our</c><00:03:40.760><c> accounts</c>
