 Only 3% of mammals are single-husband, meaning they live throughout their lives with one partner

 so far. 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.039
 Genetic encoding of dopamine receptors plays a key role in infidelity in men and women 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.750
 Sometimes called "happiness hormone" and excreted after fun activities such as ... 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.859
 Training, eating and orgasm, a study showed that 50% of people who carry ... 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.960
 The long allele of this gene has betrayed their partners compared with 22% of people ... 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.109
 Who carry the short allele. Long-elongated carriers also have a tendency to ... 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.690
 To be aggressive and subject to addiction behaviors such as alcoholism, perhaps the phrase ... 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 "Who once betrayed, betrayed a thousand times" may actually have a basis. 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.960
 The levels of vasopressin have a role in it also similar to the hormone oxytocin which sometimes ... 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.500
 Called "Hormone Hormone", the hormone Vasopressin can affect the trust, empathy and social cohesion 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.810
 In fact, vasopressin is injected into the reward system for multi-pair mountain field mice ... 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.140
 Increases the likelihood of becoming a single pair. People with autism have low levels of vasopressin 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.430
 Affecting their ability to understand social signals, and in 2014 a study was conducted ... 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.560
 More than 7,000 Finnish twins have shown that women who are infected have a diversity in the gene that cures ... 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.930
 Vasophosphrine receptors, further suggested that low levels of phosphosperin have the effect of ... 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.659
 On treason. 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.420
 Money may also be an important factor. Men who earn more than their peers are much more ...

 They were fathers of the house, only when they had equal earning opportunities ... 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.840
 The rates of treason in both are significantly reduced. 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.080

 Scientific research continues to exclude certain minority groups. 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.630
 In both cases, treason is clearly based on biology and heredity for some of us although we ... 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.410
 Single - parent types.
