00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.611
- [Instructor] "The
differentiable function f

00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.088
"and its derivative f prime are graphed."

00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:07.138
So, let's see.

00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:11.594
We see the graph of y is equal
to f of x here in the blue.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:15.818
And then f prime we see in
this brownish-orangish color

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:17.900
right over here.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.781
"What is an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.172
"for the fact that f is decreasing

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:28.447
"when x is greater than three?"

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:31.054
So, we can see that that
actually is indeed the case.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.511
When x is greater than three,

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.914
we see that our function
is indeed decreasing.

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:38.497
As x increases, the y value,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.429
the value of our function, decreases.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.092
So, a calculus-based justification,

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:45.985
without even looking at the choices,

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.538
well, I could look at the derivative.

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:49.288
And we're going to be decreasing

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:52.145
if the slope of the
tangent line is negative,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.297
which means that the
derivative is negative.

00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:57.465
And we can see that for
x is greater than three,

00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.731
the derivative is less than zero.

00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:00.985
So, my justification,
I haven't even looked

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:02.174
at these choices yet.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:06.453
I would say for x is greater than three,

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:10.199
f prime of x is less than a zero.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:11.488
That would be my justification,

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.416
not even looking at these choices.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.215
Now let's look at the choices.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:19.382
"f prime is decreasing when
x is greater than three."

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:21.334
Now, this isn't right.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:22.249
What we care about is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.105
whether f prime is positive or negative.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.280
If f prime is negative,
if it's less than zero,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.247
than the function itself is decreasing.

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:33.723
The slope of the tangent
line will be negative.

00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:36.037
f prime could be positive
while decreasing.

00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:39.153
For example, f prime could
be doing something like this.

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:41.750
And even though f prime
would be decreasing

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.769
in this situation, the actual value

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:46.283
of the derivative would be positive,

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:47.862
which means the function
would be increasing

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:51.305
in that scenario, so I
would rule this one out.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:55.778
"For values of x larger than
three, as x values increase,

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.005
"the values of f of x decrease."

00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:59.510
Now, that is actually true.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.736
This is actually the definition
that f is decreasing.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:06.356
As x values increase, the
values of f of x decrease.

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:09.039
But this is not a
calculus-based justification,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.980
so I am going to rule
this one out as well.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.077
"f prime is negative when
x is greater than three."

00:02:17.077 --> 00:02:19.015
Well, that's exactly what I wrote up here.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.494
If f prime is negative, then that means

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:24.101
that our slope of the tangent line

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:27.301
of our original function f is
going to be downward sloping,

00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.861
or that our function is decreasing,

00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:32.429
so this one is looking good.

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:33.702
And this one right over here says,

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:38.038
"f prime of zero is
equal to negative three,"

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.743
so they're just pointing out this point.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.431
This isn't relative to the
interval that we care about,

00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:46.345
or this isn't even relevant
when x is greater than three,

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.597
so we definitely wanna rule that one out.

00:02:48.597 --> 00:02:50.847
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:55.228
So, here we're told, "The
differentiable function g

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.055
"and its derivative g prime are graphed."

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.664
So, once again, g is in this bluish color,

00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:04.306
and then g prime, its derivative,
is in this orange color.

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:07.710
"What is an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.511
"for the fact that g has
a relative minimum point

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:13.546
"at x is equal to negative three?"

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:16.012
And we could see here, when
x is equal to negative three,

00:03:16.012 --> 00:03:19.348
it looks like g is equal to negative six,

00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:21.672
and it looks like a relative
minimum point there.

00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:23.945
So, what's the best justification?

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.292
So, once again, without
even looking at the choices,

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:29.392
I would say a good justification is

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:32.286
before we get to x equals negative three,

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:35.052
before we get to x equals negative three,

00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:38.173
our derivative, and this is a
calculus-based justification,

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:40.728
before we go to x equals negative three,

00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:43.508
our derivative is negative.

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:45.530
And after x equals negative three,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.274
our derivative is positive.

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:49.187
That would be my justification.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:53.354
Because if our derivative is
negative before that value,

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:59.153
that means that we are downward
sloping before that value.

00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:00.722
And if it's positive after that value,

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:02.809
that means we're upward
sloping after that,

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.457
which is a good justification

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:08.033
that we are at relative
minimum point right over there.

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:10.189
So, let's see, "The point
where x equals negative three

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.101
"is the lowest point on the graph of g

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.086
"in its surrounding interval."

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.557
That is true,

00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:17.594
but that's not a
calculus-based justification.

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:18.992
You wouldn't even have
to look at the derivative

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.749
to make that statement, so
let's rule that one out.

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:26.462
"g prime has a relative
maximum at zero comma three."

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:29.962
At zero comma three, it actually does not.

00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:33.279
Oh, g prime, yes,

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.261
g prime actually does
have a relative maximum

00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:39.848
at zero comma three, but
that doesn't tell us anything

00:04:39.848 --> 00:04:43.399
about whether we're at
a relative minimum point

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.566
at x equals negative three,
so I would rule that out.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:53.754
"g prime of negative
three is equal to zero."

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:56.469
So, g prime of negative
three is equal to zero,

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.484
so that tells us that the
slope of the tangent line

00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:01.221
of our function is going to
be zero right over there,

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.231
but that by itself is not enough

00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:05.398
to say that we are at
relative minimum point.

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:07.912
For example, I could be at
a point that does something

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:09.586
like this where the slope
of the tangent line is zero,

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.595
and then it keeps increasing again,

00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:14.575
or it does something like
this and it keeps decreasing.

00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:16.219
So, even though you're at a point

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.479
where the slope of your
tangent line is zero,

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.754
it doesn't mean you're at
a relative minimum point,

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.293
so I would rule that out.

00:05:23.293 --> 00:05:26.739
"g prime crosses the x-axis
from below it to above it

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:28.371
"at x equals negative three."

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:31.968
g prime crosses the x-axis
from below it to above it.

00:05:31.968 --> 00:05:33.782
Yep, and that's the argument that I made,

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:35.725
that we're going from below the x-axis,

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:37.916
so g prime goes from being
negative to positive,

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:40.617
which means the slope of the tangent lines

00:05:40.617 --> 00:05:43.006
of our points as we approach
x equals negative three go

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:46.379
from being downward
sloping to upward sloping,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:47.743
which is an indication

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:51.076
that we are at a relative minimum point.
