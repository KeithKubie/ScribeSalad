00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.450
So, now before we actually jump to the

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.410
discussion of software processes I want to ask you

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.770
a couple of preliminary questions. The first one is,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.140
what is the largest software system on which you

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.860
had worked? And you should enter here the size.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.850
And the second question I'm going to ask is how

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.070
many LOC or how many lines of code per

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.380
day you were producing when working on this system?
