00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.210
The Context Management Specification,
CMS, began at Duke University

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.000
as the Clinical Context Object Workshop,
or CCOW.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.790
It seeks to facilitate the integration
of diverse applications

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.470
at the point of use.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.200
It does this by managing issues
such as the identity of a patient

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.410
the user wants to view or
update via these applications.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.380
The identity of the user who
wants to access the applications.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.310
A moment in time around
which temporal data displays

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.150
should be centered by
the applications and

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.210
a particular patient encounter
that the user wants to review.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.770
The details are highly technical, but
you can get the general idea from this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.470
illustration where several applications
from different vendors are all centered

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.330
around the same patient, at the same
time, for the same clinician.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.190
This is an ambitious but
potentially very important effort.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.110
Since clinicians commonly complain
about the time and effort involved to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.180
use many different systems that work in
different ways to manage their patients.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.810
Before moving on,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.370
I want to mention an interesting feature
of the SMART on FHIR app platform.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.800
This is called launch parameters.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.110
These provide some of the same
services as anticipated in CMS,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.920
as providers, patients, and
other users move about among FHIR apps.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.880
As shown here, these include
the identity of the patient,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.320
the current encounter being viewed,
links to other resource instances of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.220
interest with this patient, and even the
reason why the app is being launched.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.150
Here is an example of
a JSON-formatted version

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.660
of one of the simplest FHIR resources,
the patient.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.569
It contains the basic demographic
information, such as name,

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.293
birthdate and
the provider taking care of the patient.

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:05.857
It also contains a patient ID that can
be used to unambiguously retrieve other

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:08.000
clinical information.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.508
Look a bit more carefully and

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:13.775
you'll see that this patient is
actually our old friend, Marla.
