00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 
you

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:04.780
 
 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.280
 
well there was a study done probably

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290
well there was a study done probably
 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.530
well there was a study done probably
about eight years ago that looked at the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540
about eight years ago that looked at the
 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.470
about eight years ago that looked at the
success of startups and the what the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480
success of startups and the what the
 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.420
success of startups and the what the
rate at which they had exits and and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430
rate at which they had exits and and
 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.609
rate at which they had exits and and
then another researcher Scott Shane

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619
then another researcher Scott Shane
 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.110
then another researcher Scott Shane
looked at those numbers and realized

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120
looked at those numbers and realized
 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.740
looked at those numbers and realized
that my god University startups are over

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750
that my god University startups are over
 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.840
that my god University startups are over
a hundred times more likely to go public

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850
a hundred times more likely to go public
 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.780
a hundred times more likely to go public
than a typical startup which is

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790
than a typical startup which is
 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.600
than a typical startup which is
staggering and the so you might ask why

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610
staggering and the so you might ask why
 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.660
staggering and the so you might ask why
why is that the case and I really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
why is that the case and I really
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.139
why is that the case and I really
believe that it's because so when you

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149
believe that it's because so when you
 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.220
believe that it's because so when you
when you're trying to create a

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230
when you're trying to create a
 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.180
when you're trying to create a
high-growth company and what in a good

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
high-growth company and what in a good
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.200
high-growth company and what in a good
rubric for that would be to think about

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
rubric for that would be to think about
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.729
rubric for that would be to think about
you so what would what would a venture

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739
you so what would what would a venture
 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.750
you so what would what would a venture
capitalist be willing to invest in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
capitalist be willing to invest in
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.669
capitalist be willing to invest in
because they see a big exit at a later

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679
because they see a big exit at a later
 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.860
because they see a big exit at a later
date pretty hot you know in the short

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870
date pretty hot you know in the short
 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.069
date pretty hot you know in the short
term then is something that has a real

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079
term then is something that has a real
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.500
term then is something that has a real
sustainable competitive advantage and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510
sustainable competitive advantage and
 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.250
sustainable competitive advantage and
that usually means some sort of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
that usually means some sort of
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.190
that usually means some sort of
intellectual property and some sort of a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
intellectual property and some sort of a
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.899
intellectual property and some sort of a
technology that enables something to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
technology that enables something to
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.789
technology that enables something to
scale quickly so that describes a lot of

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799
scale quickly so that describes a lot of
 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.310
scale quickly so that describes a lot of
the research that's happening in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
the research that's happening in
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
the research that's happening in
university research labs so I think that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780
university research labs so I think that
 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.870
university research labs so I think that
that's one of the reasons why university

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880
that's one of the reasons why university
 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.190
that's one of the reasons why university
startups and them really the ones that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200
startups and them really the ones that
 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.830
startups and them really the ones that
come out are the ones that that are

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840
come out are the ones that that are
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.969
come out are the ones that that are
based on some really groundbreaking

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979
based on some really groundbreaking
 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.279
based on some really groundbreaking
pioneering research and have some sort

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289
pioneering research and have some sort
 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.230
pioneering research and have some sort
of intellectual property that enables

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240
of intellectual property that enables
 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.590
of intellectual property that enables
the company to to scale some idea

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
the company to to scale some idea
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.190
the company to to scale some idea
quickly I would go back to even just

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200
quickly I would go back to even just
 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.130
quickly I would go back to even just
really basic concepts like the internet

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140
really basic concepts like the internet
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.980
really basic concepts like the internet
and biotechnology and those created

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990
and biotechnology and those created
 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.889
and biotechnology and those created
whole new industries so then no those

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899
whole new industries so then no those
 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.480
whole new industries so then no those
came from universities the internet was

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
came from universities the internet was
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.969
came from universities the internet was
first the first email exchanges between

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
first the first email exchanges between
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.039
first the first email exchanges between
UCLA and stanford and then several other

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049
UCLA and stanford and then several other
 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.219
UCLA and stanford and then several other
universities have have were working on

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
universities have have were working on
 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.410
universities have have were working on
it together and then it grew and if it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420
it together and then it grew and if it
 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.179
it together and then it grew and if it
weren't for the university is having to

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189
weren't for the university is having to
 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.960
weren't for the university is having to
communicate with each other then the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970
communicate with each other then the
 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.570
communicate with each other then the
internet would have never happened

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
internet would have never happened
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.050
internet would have never happened
probably and biotechnology was a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
probably and biotechnology was a
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.640
probably and biotechnology was a
was a whole industry that was based on

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
was a whole industry that was based on
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.830
was a whole industry that was based on
the comb Boyer patent that was licensed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
the comb Boyer patent that was licensed
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320
the comb Boyer patent that was licensed
by Stanford not exclusively too many new

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
by Stanford not exclusively too many new
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.180
by Stanford not exclusively too many new
biotech companies so in another example

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
biotech companies so in another example
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.730
biotech companies so in another example
is this is a little more obscure a lot

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
is this is a little more obscure a lot
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.720
is this is a little more obscure a lot
of people haven't heard of this but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
of people haven't heard of this but
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.330
of people haven't heard of this but
there's something called the moses

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340
there's something called the moses
 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.699
there's something called the moses
platform for creating semiconductor

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
platform for creating semiconductor
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.030
platform for creating semiconductor
chips and it's run out of the University

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
chips and it's run out of the University
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740
chips and it's run out of the University
of Southern California information

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
of Southern California information
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960
of Southern California information
Sciences Institute and any student that

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
Sciences Institute and any student that
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.600
Sciences Institute and any student that
has a chip design they want to test out

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
has a chip design they want to test out
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.920
has a chip design they want to test out
what are they going to do are they going

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
what are they going to do are they going
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.479
what are they going to do are they going
to build a three billion dollar fab in

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489
to build a three billion dollar fab in
 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699
to build a three billion dollar fab in
Asia of course they can't do that but

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
Asia of course they can't do that but
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.100
Asia of course they can't do that but
they can send it by email to or through

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
they can send it by email to or through
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.070
they can send it by email to or through
the internet to Moses and it will create

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
the internet to Moses and it will create
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.949
the internet to Moses and it will create
a wafer for them and test out their

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
a wafer for them and test out their
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.080
a wafer for them and test out their
design and so I think they've done

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
design and so I think they've done
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.449
design and so I think they've done
50,000 designs for students and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
50,000 designs for students and
 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.510
50,000 designs for students and
researchers around the world and so that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520
researchers around the world and so that
 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.060
researchers around the world and so that
those are the kind of things that enable

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070
those are the kind of things that enable
 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.510
those are the kind of things that enable
a whole industry and enable new

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
a whole industry and enable new
 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.870
a whole industry and enable new
innovations to crop up
