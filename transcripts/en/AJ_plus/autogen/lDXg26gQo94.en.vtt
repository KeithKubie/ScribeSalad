inside an animal these possibilities

make a lot of people very uncomfortable

that might be why so few scientists are

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
that might be why so few scientists are
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990
that might be why so few scientists are
able to work on this research but if

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
able to work on this research but if
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580
able to work on this research but if
there was a chance that a human animal

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
there was a chance that a human animal

chimera could save lives

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
chimera could save lives
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.920

would you be okay with the consequences
