SHAOLAN HSUEH: Thank you, Jen.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.410
OK.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.620
Thank you.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm truly excited to
be able to speak here

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.830
in the coolest
company in the world

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.380
and also my favorite
company in the world.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.390
If there is anything you want
to remember after this talk,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.610
please pay attention
to the next 20 seconds.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.650
And after that, you can relax.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.920
OK.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.760
Is that working?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.376
Oh, sorry.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.470
This is Chinese
character for "person."

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.990
It looks just like an A
without the horizontal line.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.430
This is a Chinese
character for "work."

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.120
That looks just like
a I in the alphabet.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.030
When we put "person"
and "work" together,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.003
that means "artificial,"
just like AI.

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.408
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.319
My name is ShaoLan.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.550
I'm the founder and
creator of Chineasy.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.960
Later, I'm going to share
with you a little story how

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.250
I came about with
Chineasy, and then we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.330
will spend the majority
of time to show you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.380
how the system works.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.460
And hopefully, by
the end of this talk,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.560
you can have a certain knowledge
about Chinese characters

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.220
in your mind.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.880
And when you go
to Chinatown, you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.360
will make sure that you
order the beef or lamb

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520
rather than snake.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.650
So basically, how
Chineasy came about.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160
I grew up in a
family where we never

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.340
buy arts, because we make them.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.640
My grandfather was a
professor of ceramic art.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.260
He made this museum great piece.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.750
My father is also a
professor of ceramic art.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.830
My mother is a calligrapher.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.770
Between my parents,
they made this.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.440
My 13-year-old daughter
created this piece of artwork.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.410
My 11-year-old son did
this when he was 9.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.230
So from very early
on, I realized

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.980
that I just don't have
the talents they have.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.370
I'm the black sheep
in the family.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.070
And I started to study science,
chemistry, MBA-- everything

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.860
analytical, scientific,
geeky, I did all that.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.680
And then I realized
that I struggled

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.530
between my left brain
and my right brain,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.830
and I couldn't strike a balance.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.780
So it was not until
a couple years ago

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.360
when I realized that my
British-born children were not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.210
interested in learning Chinese.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.360
And they found learning
Chinese very hard.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.860
And also, when I spoke
to couple of my friends,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.470
they shared the
same frustrations.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.610
So I thought, how
hard could that be?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.470
As a geek, I used my
computer and broke down

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.490
thousands of characters.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.830
And I prioritize
them, analyze them,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.590
try to find a pattern-- how
things can become easier

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.300
by using a simple method.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.220
And of course, after that,
I use the sugarcoating

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.060
like illustrations,
animations you can see.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.970
So before then, we
start with our kitchen.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.910
I drew the napkins and share
with friends and family.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.110
And then I started
my teaching career

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.060
as a free Chinese teacher.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.680
And TED heard about that,
so I gave a talk in 2013.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
And then in the audience, there
was a person called Bill Gross.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.140
He wrote a little
blog on LinkedIn.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.440
In two days, when
I was still at TED,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.820
I was traced by 8,000
people from LinkedIn.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.050
Is there anything
we can subscribe to?

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.810
Is there any book we can buy?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.550
Is there an app to download?

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.510
I said, no, I don't
have anything.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.700
So, oh, hold on.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.210
Please don't release my talk.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.750
Let me go home and
cook something.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.880
So TED eventually
put my talk online.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.310
Millions of people watched
it, and they share it.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.180
And then we put this
very simple website

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.350
and I did a
Kickstarter campaign.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.120
On Facebook, we teach every day.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.140
And now we have
[INAUDIBLE] million people

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.620
learning Chinese characters
every day with us.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.070
And we share our knowledge.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.410
And at the same time, we also
design the quiz and games

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.510
to make it more fun.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.550
And then as Jen just said,
we did a Kickstarter.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850
And then at the same
time, without asking,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.950
we was truly
flattered and honored

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.920
that we were recognized by
several credible and really

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.700
incredible awards.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.880
And we are truly
grateful with that.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.170
But then after all of
that, what is Chineasy?

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.600
How does it work?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.060
Now let's start.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.370
It's basically a
building block system

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.930
to allow you to understand
the characters very quickly

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.150
by deciphering it.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.770
Some people call that
as Chinese alphabet.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.942
So instead of having 26,
we have like 60 or 70.

00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:00.400
But don't be
frightened about that,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.490
because once you
recognize a few,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.770
you can start
constructing very quickly.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.430
You remember, this is a person.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.730
Two people together--
that means to follow.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.160
Three means the crowd.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.400
If the person stretch their arms
wide, this person is saying,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.300
it was this big.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.480
And then when you
add one extra stroke

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.090
on the top of [INAUDIBLE],
that means man,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.820
because in ancient
China, men had long hair.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.470
They put their hair up,
and put the pin on top.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.520
So with the extra pin on
top, that means adult man.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.920
Now you learn five.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.690
Big person means adult.
Big crowd is the public.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.160
Crowd person means people.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.080
Adult men and person
means "madam."

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.980
Why "madam"?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.490
Because an ancient China,
female were men's property.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.460
Men's person--
that means "madam."

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.240
So by adding one extra stroke,
by combining them differently,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.740
very quickly, you build a
knowledge for some very, very

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.960
basic words.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.150
Person a fish-- that
means "mermaid."

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.170
On the left, we have a woman.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.370
Two women together--
that means "argument."

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.740
Three together, that
means "adultery."

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.510
OK, you laugh here, right?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.000
But actually that's from
very sad historical fact.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.800
The shape of woman
originally was

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.160
the woman kneeing on the floor.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.330
That shows her
submission to her man.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.890
So that shows gender inequality.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.350
In ancient China, they often
have three, four generations

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.270
underneath the same roof.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.660
So mother-in-law
naturally doesn't get on

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.410
with the daughter-in-law.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.845
So inevitably, they
have argument when they

00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:46.830
are underneath the same roof.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.170
You have to think what it means
when you have three women.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.010
This is a boy.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.660
A woman and a boy
together-- that means good.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.320
Again, that goes back
to the ancient history.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.950
A woman was only good
when she had a boy.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.600
Everybody can say "ni hao."

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.540
You know that's "how are you?"
"Ni" is "you." "Hao" is "good."

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.350
"You good," that
means, "how are you?"

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.300
Now you know this word.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.170
This is good-- "hao."

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.940
This is king.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.400
A female king is the queen.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.130
The son of the
king is the prince.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.380
This is work.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.760
A working person is a worker.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.130
Person's work-- it's artificial.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.300
Put a woman in
front of work here,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.830
woman has become an adjective.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.908
So female worker.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.350
This is a mouth.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.960
It just a square.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.050
The person and the
mouth together-- that

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.980
means population.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.170
That's from the
ruler's perspective--

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:07.232
how many mouths do you need
to feed in your territory?

00:08:07.232 --> 00:08:07.815
This is water.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.981
The water coming out
from your mouth-- saliva.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.510
"Water cow" is buffalo.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.650
For Chineasy, we not
only want to show you how

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.630
to recognize symbols quickly.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.990
We will also take it
seriously as a design project.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.539
So for every single character,
we start with a simple idea.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.909
And we eventually come out
with even 20 or 30 ideas.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.010
And then we show different
people-- sometimes

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.250
my children and
sometimes my friends

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.060
and a lot of
non-native speakers,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.450
because they want to
know how we can really

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.620
create something
universal without having

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.910
cultural reference.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.890
It doesn't matter what
linguistic background you are.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.190
So we also make fun of it.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.380
We dress up this woman.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.030
This is a character for "horse."

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.050
We try different ways.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.930
How about this?

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.060
Change the colors.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.580
We eventually decided
to go for this version.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.100
And then we can have a farm.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.770
OK.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.200
Chineasy not only
address objects,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.950
things you can see with
the shape and form.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.350
How about more difficult
words, like abstract, something

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.880
like a concept or motion.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.960
We try to address that.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.710
This is a character for
"yourself." it looks

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.740
like spaghetti being bended.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.250
How do we draw that?

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.330
Any idea how you
want to draw it?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.590
AUDIENCE: Point at yourself?

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.300
SHAOLAN HSUEH: You got it.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.560
That's how we do it.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.430
Point at yourself.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.410
How about this one?

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.550
It's "how many." "How many."

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.090
It's a very common word.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.800
You see that all the time, every
day, in every single article.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.070
"How many''-- how to draw it.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.918
How about this?

00:10:12.726 --> 00:10:16.190
This is a verb--
to owe something,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.840
to owe someone
money. "Owe," to owe.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.550
How to draw it.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.405
How about that?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.370
On the left, we have "up."

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.430
On the right, we have "down."

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.900
This is a character for "west."

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.890
Direction west.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.930
How to draw it.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.700
Is there any shape and form?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.530
We decided to make
fun of the cowboy.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.620
This is a character for north.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.740
We thought about
many directions,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.800
pointed to the north.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.200
But where's north?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.020
People may say that's up.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.390
Maybe they may say that's arrow.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.156
We decided to make fun
of political leaders.

00:11:07.156 --> 00:11:09.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.910
This is the character for
"half"-- half of something.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.540
That looks pretty symmetrical.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.281
So can we draw something half?

00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:19.780
Oh, well.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.750
We tried this.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.940
Half of the apple.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.480
But people may say
that's "apple."

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.090
Half of the orange, maybe.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.610
We decided to go for this one.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.820
Half evil, half good.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.410
This is a character for "gold."

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.920
Now we are talking about
color edge, adjective.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.880
"Gold."

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.050
How should we draw "gold"?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.790
Gold bar?

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.305
Gold coins?

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.390
Gold temples?

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:45.890
Yeah.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.710
It can be anything.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.880
We decided, hey, maybe
that's a good idea,

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.530
because those people
have a lot of shiny stuff

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.652
they wear every day.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.930
We are in Google.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.800
So let's talk
about modern words.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.770
On the left, we have
a net, a physical net.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:12.110
On the right, we
have-- guess-- friend.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.480
OK, that's right.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.570
So on the left of net is
not only the physical net.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.220
That also means the internet.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.330
The net friend is
your cyber friend.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.680
Remember "woman"?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.950
When it's used in the front
of an object, it's adjective.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.810
That means female friend.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.111
And here is actually
more specific.

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:39.236
That means your girlfriend.

00:12:41.906 --> 00:12:44.950
Do you remember the
one on the left?

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.910
Up?

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.950
Up the net?

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.400
What does that mean?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.020
To get on the web, get online.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.150
Next one.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.380
OK, who want to answer this?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.840
Down net.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.015
SHAOLAN HSUEH:
That's a good one.

00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:04.320
That's a good one.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.660
That's get offline.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.360
Yeah, so up or down
is your action.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.850
So you get on, you get down.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.930
And if you put "up"
and "car"-- that's

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.430
"get in the car," "down the
car," "get off the car."

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.790
Right.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.770
You all know this word
even without me saying it.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.390
The one on top is wind.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.740
And then we have water.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.190
Wind and water-- what is that?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.930
That mean "feng shui."

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.520
That's exactly how
it's pronounced.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.710
So wind is a combination
between-- OK, feng shui

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.110
is a combination
between wind and water.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.940
Why is that?

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.820
Feng shui is
actually not starting

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.630
from something superstitious.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.050
That was actually very
practical knowledge

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.460
in ancient China emperors used.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.500
They had to decide where
to set their capital.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.320
And they had to
study the geography

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.630
and where is the best
place for defense,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.670
where is good for agriculture,
and where is good for farming?

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.840
So they have to decide all
that by using all the terrain,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.710
the weather, the climate.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.470
And they have to
decide all that.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.510
And then so feng
shui is, in fact,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.980
in ancient China, that
was architectural design.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.700
That was civil planning.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.530
And then when you go
into the micro-level.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.030
That's then become
the interior design.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.200
And then nowadays,
people may think, oh,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.270
it's just about where to put a
clock and where to put the fan.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.730
And this is all misleading.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.040
The true feng shui
in the ancient time

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.960
was actually very
practical survival skills.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.600
We also make stories.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.610
This is in the previous book.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.670
We tried to tell
"Peter and the Wolf"

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.330
story with intense [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.900
OK.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.930
Chinese is not really science.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.440
Imagine the ancient
Chinese cavemen.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.850
They saw their wife,
that you are woman,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.750
they saw the dog,
that you are dog.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.560
And they saw a rock,
that you are rock.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.280
That's how they started.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.080
So then me tell you one thing.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.770
Good news.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.940
Second thing you can remember
today-- Chinese is easy.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.610
It can't be that hard.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.570
Can you imagine
any other language

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.340
in the world has been
able to be passed down

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.730
for more than thousands
of years and been spread

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.650
across more than
billions of people

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.960
without proper technology,
without any learning app,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.220
and without any
way of transmitting

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.140
in the ancient time.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.760
And they still
learned how to use it.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.880
It can't be that hard.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.490
And the way Chineasy works is
just like, you look at the sky.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.300
There are billions of stars.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.230
In your eyes, you see this.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.910
Chinese eyes, when they look at
the same stars, they see this.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.810
So what we try to
do in Chineasy is

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.150
we try to find a
pattern to guide you.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.630
Therefore you can take
the first step forward.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.940
In this book, I think you
all have read. [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.290
guide tool.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.810
It's very different
from the previous one.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.240
It's grouped by subject.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.450
And basically I was looking
for a challenge for myself,

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.860
so I really made
myself like hell.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.350
I put so many constraints
when I created this one.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.660
Chinese is not
created by subjects.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.690
People drew any random symbol
over the thousands of years.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.850
Millions of people
participated in this movement,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.290
creating language.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.960
So how can they be
grouped by subject?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.000
They can't.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.790
But we still try to do that.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.500
In the first chapter, you will
learn numbers, from 1 to 10.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.910
And we not only show you
how to recognize them.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.270
We also show you, hey, this
number is a lucky one for what

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:50.900
reason.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.250
For example, number
four is a bad one.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.100
Why is that?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.330
Because of the pronunciation.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.180
It's the same sound as "death."

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.970
And that's why, when you
go to Hong Kong, Singapore,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.800
or many places in China, you
don't have the fourth floor.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.680
And some of them even get rid
of the entire from 40th to 49th.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.300
So they skip many floors.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.030
And that's why many places,
if you want to buy property,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.609
in case they have
a fourth floor,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.150
they always give you a discount.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.950
So once you know 1 to
10, then you can add 100.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.540
You add a few characters.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.420
Then you can read the clock
and add a few characters.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.070
You read the calendar.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.700
This is the character
for "dollar."

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.130
Then you can start
counting money.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.930
We are just talking
about chapter 1.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.330
Chapter 2, we will show
you the five elements

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.890
and how the five elements
form the cosmo view

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.740
in Chinese philosophy and
also about yin and yang

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.570
and how that affects people's
day-to-day life, even

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.060
in modern China.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:02.920
We talk about people, animals,
nature, how to describe things.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.760
And we talk about
health and well-being

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.020
and, of course, transportation
and travel is important.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.430
And then after
all that, you will

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.770
be able to read the world map.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.760
And you will be able to read
the Chinese map and the tube map

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.630
too.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.600
Not all of them,
but you get a clue.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.590
What we can promise is-- OK,
we don't promise everything.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.110
But what I can promise
is your Chinese

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.900
will be as good as my Japanese.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.960
How good is my Japanese?

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.650
I don't speak a
word of Japanese.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.720
But I have no problem
going to Japan.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.420
Because I read.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.980
I read to their newspaper, and
I read their tube station, tube

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.730
sign.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.270
And then I read the menu.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.020
I can even
communicate by writing

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.170
to say what I want to read.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:52.600
I can even talk about Japanese
literature, about Murakami.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.950
I can talk about that
with Japanese people.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.010
But I don't speak
a word of Japanese.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.300
We talk about modern life,
like a net, sports, activities.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.930
And then most importantly,
that's the must-read chapter.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.980
You need to know
what you eat when

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.790
you go to Chinese restaurants.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.530
Make sure you don't
order snake or turtles.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.600
And you know, if
you are vegetarian,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.470
if you see the grass sign, then
that's more about vegetables.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.070
OK.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.730
So the purpose here-- it's
really about reading only?

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.230
No.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.470
I think we are much more
ambitious than that.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.350
We would love to share
the beauty of this culture

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.190
and language with people outside
the native Chinese-speaking

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.410
regions.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.850
And we would love to show
you, not only the language,

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.330
the philosophy, the mentality,
because the language itself

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:48.070
is the best medium for you
to understand the culture.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.420
Lots of them are followers.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.630
They said, hey, I lived
in China for five years.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.600
And I never tried to
learn how to read.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.130
Everybody always started
from how to converse,

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.110
because it's convenient.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.010
But in fact, by
knowing the characters,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.090
you not only know the
roadsigns, not only the menus.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.750
The most important thing is you
understand their psychology.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.450
You understand their mentality.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.310
That's true understanding
of any civilization.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.520
Thank you.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.205
