00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.250
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt; Adam Kushner: Good morning.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.680
I am Adam Kushner.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.260
I am the editor of the Washington
Post Sunday Outlook section,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.750
which is our home for
ideas, essays and arguments

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.220
and personal narratives and
also thankfully our home

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.660
for our nonfiction book coverage.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.220
The Post is very, very happy
to have been a charter sponsor

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.710
of the National Book
Festival for many years.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.800
Before we get started, a couple
quick orders of business.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.360
I want to remind everybody
that you guys can donate

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.060
to help support the festival,
which is a really cool event.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.330
All the information
is in your program.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.690
And that after Sidney
Blumenthal finishes,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.940
there will be a Q and
A time permitting.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.950
In addition, he is going to be
doing a book signing downstairs

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.340
from 12 to one.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.370 position:56%
So in my decade and a half of living
in Washington, a lot has changed.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.390
But one thing that
has not changed is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.320
that this city is very much
a place of casts and sets.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.770
And sometimes these groups, the
journalists and the politicians

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.960
and the operatives and the
policy scholars and the lobbyists

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.170
and the diplomats and
the advocates --

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.560
sometimes they have
symbiotic relationships

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950
and sometimes parasitic ones.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.110
And sometimes they do
not interact at all.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.860
But rarely does somebody
pass between them.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.460
And almost never with the
facility and the adaptability

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.200
and the skill of Sid Blumenthal.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.790
Sidney starts his career
as a journalist

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.230
at the New Republic and
the Washington Post.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.030
He worked two of my
alma maters as well.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.260
And then he covered
Washington for the New Yorker,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.130
which is generally regarded
as the summit of analytic

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.740
and narrative political coverage
that post covering D.C. In his work

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.270
as a journalist before, he
was an early detection system

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.840 position:56%
for a problem we all know very well.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.980
He coined the term the
permanent campaign.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.740
Then, Sidney went into the
administration and he served

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.330
as President Clinton's
concierge for his second term,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.340
where his portfolio bestrode every
political issue in the white house.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.930
Afterward, he returned to
journalism where he worked at Salon

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.830
and also wrote books about the
Clinton and Bush administrations.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.250 position:56%
Now, Sidney has gotten into probably
his most ambitious project yet --

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.340
giving Abraham Lincoln
the Robert Caro treatment.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.350
I cannot think of an American
political figure more relevant

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.410
to contemporary debates.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.030
The first of the four volumes of
this series -- A Self Made Man --

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.530
started of course at the beginning.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.750
And I remember reading the
coverage of it when it first came

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.180
out the word magisterial
appeared frequently.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.050
We gave it a nice review also.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.810
Now, Sidney has just dropped
Wrestling With His Angel,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.130
The Second Volume, which
covers the years 1849 to 1856,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.090
which is the battle against
Stephen Douglas and the rise

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.740
of a new political
party, the Republicans.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.810
He could not have picked
a better moment for a book

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.490
about political realignment.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.360
And so now please help me invite
him up here to talk about it.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.160
Sidney Blumenthal.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:48.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.800
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal:
Great to be here.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.490
Thank you Adam for
those very kind remarks.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.460
I am honored to be
here at the Library

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.070
of Congress National Book Festival.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.830
Last night at the first
event, I had a conversation

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.860
with David McCullough, who
had just finished up next door

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.860 position:56%
and said we really need Lincoln now.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.390
And he said we need
them all [laughter].

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.010
The Library of Congress building,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.020
one of the most magnificent
buildings

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.450
in the country did not used to
be such a distinguished address.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.380
It used to be the location of a row

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.640
of boarding houses facing the
Capitol, inhabited by congressmen.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.360
And one of those was
Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.680
He lived on that site
in the fourth one in.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.730
That he was a [inaudible] Whig.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.830
That was the party of Lincoln.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.290
And he lived in a boarding
house with Whigs.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.620
But it was also known as Abolition
House because it was the center

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.610
of anti-slavery operations
in the District of Columbia.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.820
And I also want to say I am very
happy to be here speaking to those

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.280
of you who are fellow
Washingtonians.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.690
So, the Washington Post in talking

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.020
about the National Book
Festival said it is a chance

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.240
to hear people imitate Charles
Dickens and take selfies.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.080
I do not know that Dickens
took selfies [laughter].

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.490
But I will do my poor imitation of
Dickens talking about this second

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.640
of four volumes about the
political life of Abraham Lincoln.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.360
This volume I have entitled
Wrestling With His Angel.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.990
I have taken it from the
story of Jacob from the Bible.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.660
Of Jacob wrestling through a long
night with an angel or himself

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.060
and emerging at dawn as somebody
else, having resolved himself.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.760
And assuming a new identity.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.290
He takes a new name.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.890
The name he takes is Israel.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.800
And something like that
happened with Lincoln.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.620
But it happened in
his wilderness years.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:29.890
Years lasting from 1849 to 1856.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.060
And he assumed a new identity.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.150
So, let me pretend to
be Dickens for a minute.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.200
The more time I have spent
with Abraham Lincoln,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.340
the more I have come to
understand that his words

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.510
and actions were the careful result
of his intense self discipline.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.990
The silences that his law
partner, William Henry Herndon,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.990
and his friends described as
his melancholy were also a mask

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.810
for his concentration,
intellectual absorption and focus.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.460 position:56%
His depression and his other
feelings deepened his self awareness

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.780
and spurred his self education,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.990
which informed his
acute understanding

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.270
of human nature and politics.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.710
Even when his life seemed to have
been reduced to insignificance,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.100
he was scanning the horizons
and interpreting its signs.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.700
The young Lincoln in
his first formal speech

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.130
at the Springfield
Lyceum for Young Men

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:42.220
in 1838 saw importance
of a crisis to come.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.970
At what point then, he said, is the
approach of danger to be expected.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.730
I am sir, if it ever reach us,
it must bring up amongst us.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.860
It cannot come from abroad.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.820
If destruction be our lot,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.880
we must ourselves be
its author and finisher.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.030
Now, Wrestling With His Angel
describes Lincoln's dark night

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.330
of the soul.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.190
Lincoln coming to his
revelation of a house divided,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.170
from which he emerged as the
recognizable Lincoln of history.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.030
He would be that man
until his assassination.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.200
After Abraham Lincoln's one term
in the Congress and his return

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.010
to his spare law office
in Springfield,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.720
he started into distance
for long periods of time.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.500
His partner, Herndon,
recalled him breaking one

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.970
of his prolonged silences
with a cry of anguish.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.810
The political world was
dead, Herndon wrote.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.580
Things were stagnant and all
hope for progress in the line

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.720 position:56%
of freedom seemed to be crushed out.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.290
Lincoln was speculating with me
about the deadness of things.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.050
And the despair, which
arose out of it.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.130 position:56%
And deeply regretting that his human
strength and power were limited

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.230
by his nature to rouse
and stir up the world.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.500
He said gloomingly,
despairingly, sadly --

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.870
how hard, oh how hard it is to die
and leave one's country no better

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.010
than if one had never lived for it.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.580
The world is dead to hope,
deaf to its own death struggle.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.710
Made known by a universal
cry -- what is to be done?

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.130
Is anything to be done?

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.010
Who can do anything?

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.310
And how is it to be done?

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.480
Did you ever think of these things?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.720
Almost as soon as Abraham Lincoln
came back to Springfield, his wife,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.570
Mary Todd Lincoln, turned him right
around and sent him on a mission

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:56.090
to her hometown of Lexington,
Kentucky, to serve as co-counsel

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:02.230
to recover the Todd family
fortune, which was considerable.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.570
Lincoln find himself
thrust into the vortex

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.860
of his native state's politics
turned into mortal combat

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.180
between antislavery
and proslavery forces.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.950
The lawsuit and the
politics were intertwined.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.550
So bear with me and follow
these threads if you will.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:30.420
For nearly a decade Mary
Todd's father, John S. Todd,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.610
Senator Henry Clay's business
partner and political ally,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.650
had tried to rest the Todd
Estate from a man known

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:48.430
as Robert Wickliffe,
also called the old duke.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.980
He had married Polly
Todd, a Todd cousin,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.680 position:56%
who held the estate but passed away.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.510
Wickliffe was also the leader

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.800
of the virulently proslavery
movement in Kentucky.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.070
John Todd running for the State
Senate against that movement,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:15.140
though a slave holder himself,
was demonized with the worst word

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:22.010
that could ever be used against
anyone in politics -- abolitionist.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:30.140
In the middle of the campaign,
in July 1849 he died of cholera.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.830
Lincoln arrived to pursue
the family's case in October.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:39.150
Just in time to observe the
proslavery movement triumphantly

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.170
rewrite the State Constitution

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.670
to eliminate the Kentucky Law
prohibiting the slave trade

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.430
within its borders.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:53.150 position:56%
Lincoln lost the case and the Todd
family lost the estate to Wickliffe.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:58.530
At the same moment that the
political legacy of Henry Clay,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.150
Lincoln's early bow
ideal of a statements

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.920
and Mary's beloved
father were destroyed.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.050
If those events were not
sufficiently embittering,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.990
there was another factor.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:17.370
It was a profound,
but concealed factor.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.950
From memoirs, journals
and pamphlets of the time,

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.830
a mystery underlying the Todd
heirs v. Wickliffe case emerges.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.900
It was the Todd family secret.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.070
There was a living heir.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:36.900
He was Polly Todd's grandson,
the only child of her son,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.400
who had died at a relatively
young age.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.680
But this heir was not
a person under the law.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.280
He was in fact a slave.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.820
And he had been emancipated
and shipped to Liberia.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:01.590
In 1878, this former slave,
the invisible man of the story,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:09.000
and he had a name -- Alfred Francis
Russell was elected Vice President

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.300
of the Liberia.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.560
And in 1883 he became President.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:21.330
So that made him Mary Todd's second
relation to become a President.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.160 position:56%
Backing on away from Kentucky,
Lincoln spoke with John Todd Stuart,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.090
his first law partner and
early political mentor,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.340
a conservative old Whig.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.830
The time would soon come in
which we must be democrats

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.000
or abolitionists, said Stuart.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.350
And Stuart would eventually
join the democrats.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.880
When that time comes, my mind
is made up, Lincoln replied.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.300
The slavery question
cannot be compromised.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.500
Lincoln expressed to
many of his friends,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.980
his anger at the rising slave
power he had observed in Kentucky.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.270
He was livid that an antislavery
Whig lawyer he knew there,

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.880
Samuel F. Miller, had been driven
out of the state for his views.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:20.230
And President Lincoln would
appoint him to the Supreme Court.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.060
Lincoln described privately
young thoughtless

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.740
and giddy headed Kentucky
slave holders

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:33.020
with slaves trudging behind them
the most glittering ostentatious

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:39.710
and displaying property in
the world -- human property.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.870
Lincoln would get excited on the
question, said one of his friends

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.120
and believed that the
tendency of the times was

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.310
to make slavery universal.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.310
He told another friend in a
few years we will be ready

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.890
to accept the institution
in Illinois

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.540 position:56%
and the whole country will adopt it.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.960 position:56%
The Todd heir's case with its hidden
history left Lincoln smoldering

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.090
in private until he
emerged five years later.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:12.840
But the time for Lincoln to step
forward had not come, not yet.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.080
A great revolution was required

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.190
to bring Abraham Lincoln
out of the wilderness.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.060
Lincoln's orbit in
these years revolved

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.710
around the eight judicial districts
of central Illinois day after day

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.420
with Judge David Davis
and our coterie.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.740
I shall never forget the
first time I saw Mr. Lincoln,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.770
recalled Leonard Sweet, a
criminal attorney, who became one

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.890
of Lincoln's closest colleagues and
friends and would be instrumental

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.650
in his political campaigns.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:52.170
Sweet came to the town of Danville,
where Lincoln was trying cases.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.870 position:56%
This is his account -- when I called
at the hotel it was after dark

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.920
and I was told Lincoln was
upstairs in Judge Davis's room.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.190
In the region where I
had been brought up,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.210
the judge of the court was usually
a man of more or less gravity

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.820
so that he could not be approached
say with some degree of deference.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.810
I was not a little abash therefore

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:17.900 position:56%
after I had climbed the unbanistered
staircase to find myself

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.610
so near the presence and
dignity of Judge Davis,

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.160
in whose room I was told
I could find Mr. Lincoln.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.880
In response to my timid knock,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.570
two voices responded almost
simultaneously -- come in.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:40.290
Imagine my surprise when the door
opened to find two men undressed

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.080
or rather dressed for bed
engaged in a lively battle

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.980
with pillows [laughter], tossing
them at each other's heads.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.930
One a low heavyset man who leaned
against the foot of the bed

00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:00.270
and puffed like a lizard answered
to the description of Judge Davis.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.340
The other was a man
of tremendous stature.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.860
Compared to Davis, he looked
as if he were eight feet tall.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.600
He was encased in a long
indescribable garment,

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.720
yellow as saffron, which reached
to his heels and from beneath

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.770
which protruded two
of the largest feet.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.120
I had up to that time been
in the habit of [inaudible].

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.120
this immense shirt, for a
shirt it must have been,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.350
looked as if it had been literally
carved out of the original bolt

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.970
of flannel, of which it was made.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.850
And the pieces joined
together without reference

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.970
to measurement or capacity.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:43.050
The only thing that kept it
from slipping off the tall

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.130
and angular frame it covered was
the single button at the throat.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.860
And I confessed to a
succession of shutters.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.360
When I thought of what might
happen should that button

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.180
by any mischance lose its hold.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.250
I cannot describe my
sensations at this apparition

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.470
with modest announcement,
my name is Lincoln --

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.310
strode across the room to
shake my trembling hand.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.470
I will not say he reminded
me of Satan,

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:19.550
but he was certainly the ungodliest
figure I had ever seen [laughter].

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.260
Who was this Lincoln?

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.590
This Lincoln was not
an abolitionist,

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:37.000
but he was as he insisted
naturally antislavery.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.870
His deepening understanding of
slavery in its full complexity

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.340
as a moral, political and
constitutional dilemma began

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.340 position:56%
in his childhood among the primitive
baptist antislavery dissidence

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.440
in backwoods Kentucky and Indiana,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.860
whose churches his
semiliterate parents attended.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.720
As a boy, he rode down the
Mississippi River to New Orleans.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.640
He was the original Huck Finn.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:13.540
And he discovered that New Orleans
was an open air emporium of slaves

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.390
on auction, on gaudy
display and it shocked him.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.770
As a Congressman in his single
term here in Washington,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.600
he lived in a boarding
house -- Abolition House.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.940
He experienced the invasion of
slave catchers coming to seize one

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.720
of the waiters as a fugitive slave.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.760
Undoubtedly, he knew the secret
of the house where he lived.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.190
That it was a station in
the Underground Railroad.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.200
He denounced the Mexican
War as fraudulently started

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.960
and voted numerous times
against the expansion of slavery

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.240
in the new Western Territories
that had been gained in that war

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.350
with the quiet assistance
of the leading abolitionists

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.640
in the Congress he drafted
a bill for emancipation

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.760
in the District of Columbia.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.060
Something he would make good

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.580
on even before the Emancipation
Proclamation was issued.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.610
And it is why we in the District
today have Emancipation Day.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.700 position:56%
But that first bill of Lincoln's
never received even a single hearing

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.700
in the House of Representatives.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.300
And then he came home to
an obscurity that seemed

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.390
as though it would never end.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.930
At the lowest moment of
political despair and retreat

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:39.390 position:56%
in American politics, to that time,
marked by a widespread loss of faith

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.450
and democracy itself, Lincoln
emerged with his cause.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:52.320
Suddenly, in 1854 the once and
future rivals of Lincoln combined

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.300
to blow to smithereens
the cornerstone

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.350
of civil and political peace.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.300
Senator Stephen A. Douglas of
Illinois, Lincoln's eternal rival

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.720
from the beginning of
his political career,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.620
seeking a transforming
gesture that would carry him

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:14.150 position:56%
to the Democratic Presidential
nomination in the White House joined

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:21.920
with Secretary of War, the Dick
Cheney of his day, Jefferson Davis

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.940
of Mississippi, heir
to slave holding wealth

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.890
and the de facto acting
President of the United States,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:34.220
operating behind the
weakling, Franklin Pierce,

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.670
in their collaboration on
the Kansas Nebraska Act.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.330
That act repealed the
Missouri Compromise

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:49.670
that had forbidden slavery north
of the line through the country

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.630
that prohibited it in the
north except for Missouri.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.220 position:56%
But now its repeal made possible the
extension of slavery to the west.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:06.000 position:56%
It made possible the nationalization
of slavery, Lincoln's nightmare.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.300
And in a stroke the entire old
political order cracked apart.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.330
We were thunderstruck and
stunned and we reeled and fell

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.210
in utter confusion, said Lincoln,

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.940
describing the atmosphere
of the early resistance.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.520
But we rose each fighting, grasping
whatever he could reach, a sieve,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.640
a pitchfork, a chopping
ax or a butcher's cleaver.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.730
We struck in the direction
of the sound.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.810
In two brief autobiographies,
Lincoln depicted himself

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.970
in his wilderness years as
strangely content in a kind

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.030
of internal exile becoming
nearly indifferent to politics,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.470
immersed in his legal practice.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.330
As he was contemplating his
race for the Presidency,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.860
he told the Chicago Tribune

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.900
in 1854 his profession had
almost superseded the thought

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.140
of politics in his mind.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.850
When the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise aroused him,

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.280
as he had never been before.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.310
It was about this decisive juncture
in Lincoln's career that Herndon,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:15.820
his law partner, wrote
of Lincoln's ambition.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.100
That man who thinks Lincoln calmly
sat down and gathered his robes

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.400
around him, waiting for the people

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.000
to call him has a very
erroneous knowledge of Lincoln.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.170
He was always calculating
and always planning ahead.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:38.890
His ambition was a little
engine that knew no rest.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.080
Now, Lincoln clung to the hull

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.910
of the sinking Whig
party longer than some.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:48.010
But he also knew that a new
coalition against the extension

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.720
of slavery, the nationalization
of slavery must be organized.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.450
In this period of party chaos,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.220
Lincoln cast himself
into the whirlwind.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.340
He sequestered himself in the
Law Library of the State Capitol

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.620
in Springfield and drafted a speech
against the Kansas Nebraska Act.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.500 position:56%
Stepping onto the podium to speak in
the Illinois Hall of Representatives

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.560
on October 4th, 1854, he never
again left the stage of history.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.100
Lincoln, the defender of the
Declaration of Independence

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.100
and its precept all men are
created equal, invoked the blood

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.120
of the revolution, the
American Revolution.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.950
Lincoln the Shakespearian pointed
to the moral wrong of slavery.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:40.930
And alluded to his favorite
play, Macbeth and the scene

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:47.100
where Macbeth tries to
washout the spot of his guilt.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.860
Lincoln said, like the bloody
hand you may wash it and wash it

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.030
and wash it, the red
witness of guilt still sticks

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.260
and stares horribly at you.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.580
He was referring to slavery.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:04.230
Now in this chaotic period,
many movements swirled

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.450
across the landscape
for and against slavery,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:12.250
against immigrants
and against liquor.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.990 position:56%
But the nativist and temperance
movements confounded the development

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.760
of the antislavery war.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.840
Meanwhile, antislavery
democrats and antislavery Whigs

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.990
with long grudges still regarded
each other with mutual suspicion.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:33.630
Some people in the abolitionist
movement in Illinois understood,

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.480
had a political sense that
they needed a more proficient

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.110
and gifted political figure
to draw the elements together.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.670
And that brought them
to Abraham Lincoln.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.480
That brought them in fact to the
very platform where he was speaking

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.750
in the Illinois Hall
of Representatives

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.790
against the Kansas Nebraska Act.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.180
And when he finished,
this small group

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.380
of radical abolitionist asked him
to join a meeting they were holding

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.940
that night for a group they
called the Republican Party.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.440
It was a radical group.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.240
And Lincoln dodged them.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.710
He had a law case in
a distant county.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:22.650
He would not attend this radical
group -- the Republican Party.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.400
For years Lincoln turned
over in his mind the menace

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.370
of slavery to democracy.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.710
Until in 1855 he envisioned the
prospect of what was to come.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.560
I think that there is no peaceful
extinction of slavery in prospect

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.040
for us, he wrote his co-counsel
in the Todd heir's case,

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.850
George Robertson, Kentucky judge.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.110 position:56%
The signal failure of Henry Clay
and other good and great men in 1849

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.000
to affect anything in favor
of gradual emancipation

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.350
in Kentucky together with a
thousand other signs extinguishes

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.330
that hope utterly.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:03.960
Yet, another complicating factor
entered into the equation.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:10.990
Between 1845 and 1854 three
million immigrants arrived

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.290
in the United States.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.680 position:56%
The first great wave of immigration.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:21.020 position:56%
About 40 percent were poor Irish
Catholics fleeing the Potato Famine.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.170
About another 40 percent were
Germans fleeing the crushing

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:31.880
of the Liberal Democratic
Revolution in Germany of 1848.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:38.150
Conservative Protestants viewed
the Irish especially as a source

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.960
of crime corruption and poverty.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.770
Both the Irish and Germans
were beer drinkers [laughter].

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.830
A habit that aroused temperance
crusaders, who condemned them

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.980
as drunken, lazy and sinful.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:02.360
A new party arouse in this
period of party disintegration.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.370
It was a masked political party.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.570
It was an anti-immigrant party.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.510
And the party was known
as the Know-Nothing Party.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.180
It took that name because
members were told that like,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.480
that when they were asked
if they were members,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.270
they were to reply I know nothing.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.460
It sprang from a small
native [inaudible]

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.370
in New York City called the Order
of the Star Spangled Banner.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.890
Within months after
the 1852 election,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.670
it attracted an estimated
membership of more than a million.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.880
Its program had one
plank and one plank only.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.710
Only native born Protestants
would be allowed

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.640
to hold public office
in the United States.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.580
And it had a slogan -- Americans
only shall govern America.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.210
As the crisis deepened,

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:02.220
Lincoln wondered how he could be
effective fighting slavery while

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.380
maintaining his identity in
the crumbling Whig party.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.780
On August 24th, 1855 he wrote to
his long time intimate friend,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.590
Joshua Speed, with whom he had
shared a room in Springfield,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.640
but who had now moved
to Kentucky to preside

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.850
over his family's plantation.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.460
Lincoln and Speed agreed on
many things and disagreed

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.740
on other things including
on the question of slavery.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.860
But in the forefront
of Lincoln's thinking

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.000
at the time was the threat
of the Know-Nothings.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.900
I am not a Know-Nothing.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.610
That is certain, Lincoln
wrote Speed.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:41.910
How could I be?

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.320
How can anyone who abhors the
oppression of Negroes be in favor

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.150
of degrading classes
of white people?

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.010
Our progress in degeneracy
appears to me to be pretty rapid.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:00.080
As a nation, we began by declaring
that all men are created equal.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.270
We now practically read it all men
are created equal, except Negroes.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.290
When the Know-Nothings get control,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.060
it will read all men are
created equal, except negroes,

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.160
and foreigners and Catholics.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.640
When it comes to this I should
prefer emigrating to some country

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.750
where they make no pretence
of loving liberty --

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:31.080
to Russia, for instance [laughter],
where despotism can be taken pure,

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.000
and without the base
alloy of hypocrisy.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.880
Even then, Lincoln
had a way with words.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.970
State by state the new Republican
Party was being organized.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.860
And in Illinois, a group

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.280
of antislavery newspaper editors
invited Lincoln to join them

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.110
as their leader at a meeting

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.630
to organize a convention
of the new party.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.740
Lincoln was absent at the
time, recalled Herndon.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.140
And believing I knew what
his feelings and judgement

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.040
on the vital questions of the
hour were, I took the liberty

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.490
to sign his name to call.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.830
John Todd Stuart, Lincoln's
first law partner,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.780
the conservative old Whig,
rushed into the office trying

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.790
to remove Lincoln's endorsement.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.070
Stuart excitedly asked Herndon

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.310 position:56%
if Lincoln had signed the
abolitionists call in the newspaper.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.790
I answered in the negative,
adding that I had signed his name.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:38.720
To the question did Lincoln
authorize you to sign it?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.770
I returned an emphatic no.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.500
Then, exclaimed startled
and indignant Stuart,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.460
you have ruined Abraham Lincoln.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:55.480
I thought I understood Lincoln
thoroughly, Herndon said.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.620
But in order to vindicate myself
if assailed, I immediately sat

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.570
down after Stuart had rushed out
of the office and wrote Lincoln,

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.220
who was then in Tazewell
County attending court.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.980
A brief account of what he had done
and how much stir it was creating

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.800
in the ranks of his
conservative friends.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.810
If he approved or disapproved
my course,

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.590
I asked him to write or
telegraph me at once.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.510
In a brief time came his answer.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.590
Alright, go ahead.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.730
We will meet you, radicals and all.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:33.990
At that meeting on February
22nd, 1856, George Schneider,

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.840
editor of the german language
newspaper Staats-Zeitung,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.030
proposed a plank denouncing
the Know-Nothings.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.570
The nativists present
strongly opposed it.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.240
The conference threatened
to collapse.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.370
Schneider announced he would
submit his resolution to Lincoln

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.590
and abide by his decision.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.380
Gentleman, declared Lincoln,
the resolution introduced

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.410
by Mr. Schneider is nothing new.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:08.820
It is already contained in the
Declaration of Independence.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.730
And you cannot form a new
party on other principles.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.500
This declaration of Mr.
Lincoln, Schneider recalled,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.610
saved the resolution and in fact
helped to establish the new party

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.290
on the most liberal
Democratic basis.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:27.010
Lincoln's judgement made
possible the creation

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.140
of the Illinois Republican Party,
which became the instrument

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.370
that would in four years carry him

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.860
to the Republican nomination
for president.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.680
But he could not foresee
that distant future,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.690
nor could he predict the shocking
10 days that shook the world

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:51.490
that would soon polarize and
clarify the coming conflict.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:56.470
On May 19th, 1856,
Senator Charles Sumner

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:01.450
of Massachusetts delivered his
speech on the attack on democracy,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:06.900
the crime against Kansas then being
taken over by the slave power.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.560
On May 21st, two days later,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.250
an army of nearly one
thousand proslavery Missourians

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:18.860
under a red banner inscribed
Southern Rights rampaged

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.890
into the Free State town of
Lawrence, Kansas and ransacked it.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:29.430
The next day in the United States
Senate while Sumner sat writing

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:33.360
at his desk, Congressman
Preston Brooks

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.190
of South Carolina approached
him as he was sitting

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.190
and battered him relentlessly
on his head

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.640
with a gold handled
cane nearly killing him

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.390
in retribution for his speech.

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:51.200
Blood streamed across
the floor of the senate.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.380
Two days later, May 24th,
along Pottawatomie Creek

00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:01.000
in Kansas radical abolitionist
John Brown

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.490
and his followers hacked
five proslavery men to death

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.700
in the middle of the night.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:13.900
And five days later, on May
29th, Abraham Lincoln stood

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.830
on the platform of the new
party that he had founded

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.190
in Illinois, the Republican Party.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.900
Within two years of assuming his
new identity as a Republican,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.870
Lincoln sounded his
own note of destiny.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:33.720
Lincoln's language was drenched not
only Shakespeare, but also drawn

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.890
from two passages of
the King James Bible.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:44.430
From the Gospel of Mark -- if a
kingdom is divided against itself,

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.840
that kingdom cannot stand.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.940
And if a house is divided
against itself,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.960
that house will not
be able to stand.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.060
From the Gospel of Luke --

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.250
every kingdom divided
against itself is laid waste

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.570
and a divided household falls.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:08.240
On June 16th, 1858 declaring his
candidacy for the U.S. Senate

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.240
against Stephen A. Douglas,
Lincoln explained --

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.540
if we could first know where we are
and whether we are we are tending,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.620
we could better judge what
to do and how to do it.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.470
Now recall just a few years
later, he was despairing.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.000
He wondered what is to be done.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.270
He thought the political
world was dead.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.520
He had not thought
through the crisis.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.150
And now the crisis was upon him.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.900
And this is what Lincoln said --

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.270
a house divided against
itself cannot stand.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:43.560
I believe this government cannot
endure permanently half slave

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.860
and half free.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.380
I do not expect the
union to be dissolved.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.560
I do not expect the house to fall.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.840
But I do expect it will
cease to be divided.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.880
It will become all one
thing or all the other.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.930
By now, Lincoln's sense
of historical timing

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.850
and political timing
had become acute.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.490
Two weeks after his
defeat to Douglas,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.790
he wrote a friend - -
the fight must go on.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.530
The cause of civil liberty must not
be surrendered at the end of one

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.270
or even one hundred defeats.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.480
In 1860 beginning his campaign

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.590
for the Republican
Presidential nomination,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:26.730 position:56%
in his speech at the Cooper Union in
New York City, Lincoln concluded --

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.690
neither let us be slandered from
our duty by false accusations

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.790
against us, nor frightened from
it by menaces of destruction

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.730
to the government, nor
of dungeons to ourselves.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:43.990
Let us have faith that
right makes might.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:46.820
And in that faith let
us to the end dare

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:52.500
to do our duty as we understand it.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.510
Lincoln's political education
was long, but many of the moments

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.360
of Lincoln's awakening
from his period

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.890
of political slumber
were not publically known

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:03.420
until years after his death.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:10.200
At about the time he was thinking
this through, this problem of,

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.410
he in early 1855 traveling the
county court circuit staying

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:17.050
overnight in a boarding house,
his discussion with a former judge

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:21.780
and fellow lawyer, T. Lyle Dickey,
another conservative old Whig,

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.080
went on deep into the night.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.770
Judge Dickey contended that
slavery was an institution

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:31.670
which the constitution recognized
and which could not be disturbed.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:36.370 position:56%
Lincoln argued that ultimately
slavery must become extinct recalled

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.600
another Illinois lawyer
who was present.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.190
After a while, said Dickey,
we went upstairs to bed.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.230
There were two beds in our room.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.090
And I remember that Lincoln sat
up in his nightshirt on the edge

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.870
of the bed arguing
the point with me.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.760
At last, we went to sleep.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.250
Early in the morning I woke up

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.820
and there was Lincoln half
sitting up in the bed.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.820
Dickey, said Lincoln, I tell you
this nation cannot exist half slave

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.590
and half free.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:09.770
Oh Lincoln, replied Dickey,
go to sleep [laughter].

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:17.080
A little later, but in this period,
1857 a free black woman known

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.860
as Polly appeared at
the office of Lincoln

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.610
and Herndon with a tale of woe.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.780
Her young son had hired himself out
on a steamboat in the Mississippi,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.000
something like what Lincoln
had done years earlier.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.720
But when he reached New Orleans

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.160
without free papers proving he
was not a slave, he was imprisoned

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.480
and about to be sold into slavery.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.640
Lincoln appealed to the
Governor of Illinois,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.880
who informed Lincoln
he could do nothing.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.030 position:56%
Lincoln appealed to the Governor of
Louisiana, who rejected his request.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:57.280
So, Lincoln drew up a subscription
list and Herndon raised money

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.450
from Lincoln's friends
in Springfield.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.250
Lincoln drew from his account
of the Springfield Marine

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.190
and Life Insurance
Company what he had.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:11.910
And they located an
agent in New Orleans

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.310 position:56%
to purchase the young man's liberty.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.810
And soon his prison door
swung open and he was returned

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.270
to Springfield to his mother.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:26.880
Lincoln had bought a slave
in order to free him.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:32.640
It was Abraham Lincoln's
first act of emancipation.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.440
Thank you.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:50.330
[ Applause ]

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.170 position:56%
I think we have five minutes and if,

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.210
I think I can take
a couple questions

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.000
if anyone has a question
about Lincoln.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.300
Sir?

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.790
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.090
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal: Yes.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.960
&gt;&gt; I say this with humility, as you
know there are more books written

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.800
about Lincoln than anything else.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.390
What lead you to believe that
you would be able to add to this

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.820
and what you just said, what
has not been known previously

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.260
by other authors?

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.060
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal: Thank
you for that question.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:29.710 position:56%
When I fell down this rabbit hole of
Abraham Lincoln, I had no idea when

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:33.830 position:56%
or how I would emerge and I am
still down this rabbit hole writing.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:39.340
But I thought that what I had
to offer was my own experience

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:48.200
as a journalist, as somebody
who understood Washington,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.860
as somebody who grew up in
Illinois whose family is involved

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.170 position:56%
in Illinois politics and as somebody
who worked in the White House

00:41:55.170 --> 00:42:01.980
and participated in and
observed a presidency first hand.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.030
And so I thought that my
skills might be brought to bear

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:10.830
to provide some original insight
and interpretation on Lincoln.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:15.440
And I hope I have done so
in the first two volumes

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.430
and in the next two to come,

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:27.650
particularly about the house
divided, country torn apart

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:31.240
and the emergence of
Lincoln's political leadership

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:37.020
and how he dealt with that and
how he developed his argument

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:42.810 position:56%
and his words and where he took it
from because he was only one person.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:48.550
And how he managed to
develop and find the means

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:55.120
that eventually would save the
country and lead to emancipation.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:04.460
&gt;&gt; What was the Whigs Party, what
were their views on immigration?

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:10.530
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal: Well,
there were no laws on immigration

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:11.860
in the United States at the time.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.630
The question was what were
the views on immigration?

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.540
There were no laws
against immigration.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.530
People just came into the country.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.920 position:56%
But there was a lot of prejudice
against this new wave of immigration

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.250
of the Irish and the
Germans particularly.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.950
And this movement developed
against it.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:37.680
Lincoln, as I noted, abhorred
the Know-Nothing movement.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.120
But he only did so in private.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.980
And he operated behind the scenes
believing that it had to be undone

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.760
by political means through
the operation of his friends.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.980
And Lincoln did work
behind the scenes

00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:01.040
to undermine the Know-Nothing
movement, engaged in even methods

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.050
that we are familiar with
today in places like Chicago,

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.910
where he destroyed the
Know-Nothing Party entirely

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.450
without any fingerprints
using his friends.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:19.590
But he did so with the belief that
he needed to draw them and get them

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.980
to participate in this
antislavery coalition

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.370
that became the Republican Party.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.010
And until he end.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:32.560
As he told Owen Lovejoy, one of
the leading radical abolitionists

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.060
who had come to Lincoln and
wanted his leadership, he said --

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.760
you know the time had not
come yet in the mid 1850's.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.060
But eventually it did.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.400
And Lincoln had to wait
for the right time.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.030
And that is one of the
other things about Lincoln.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:53.850
He steps. He says he would take
a step depending on the timing.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.330
And some people would
criticize him for being passive

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.840
and vacillating and compromising.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.650
But he said, I never took a step
back once I took a step forward.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.390 position:56%
And in order to take a step forward,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.040
he wanted to have the greatest
possible political support

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.820
for what he was doing.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.240
And that was part of
his political genius.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.020
Just one more question.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:22.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for such a
wonderful synopsis of your story.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.330
I could have listened
to you for hours.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.630
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal: Thank you.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.930
&gt;&gt; You were so enthralling.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.230
I am sure the audience
agrees with me.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.530
It was just outstanding.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.330
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal: Thank you.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:36.460
[ Applause ]

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:41.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My question is not about Lincoln,
but it is about your perspective

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.780
on the waves of history
going forward

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.100
and back and forward and back.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:50.780
I am sure you have seen that
with your research and studies.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.480
And there are many of us today who
admire the intellect of Lincoln

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.110
and Kennedy and other
notable presidents.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.580
And we are struggling with the
events in our present condition.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:13.800
And I was wondering if you might
have a chance to put some of that

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.100
in perspective so that we
could leave this Festival

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.400
with hope [laughter] perhaps.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.700
[Applause].

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.500
&gt;&gt; Sidney Blumenthal:
Thank you for that.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.990
[ Applause ]

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.760
Let me refer to Abraham
Lincoln [laughter].

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:32.310 position:56%
In that speech at Springfield Lyceum
in 1828 called on the perpetration

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.390
of our political institutions,
in which Lincoln warns

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:40.220
of our own self destruction
from within.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:44.030
He says, there is a
flaw in our system.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.420
And this is what Lincoln says.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.050
He says, there may be a
man who emerges seeking --

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.750
and these are Lincoln's
words, not mine --

00:46:53.750 --> 00:47:03.270
celebrity and fame and distinction
beyond what is normal in politics.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:07.980
And he may seek to trample
down what exists in order

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:13.120
to achieve distinction for himself.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.210
When that happens, said Lincoln,
the people must unite together

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.800
and then Lincoln's words --

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.930
act intelligently in
order to oppose him.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.080
Now Lincoln may have had
in mind Stephen A. Douglas,

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.380
his great rival [laughter].

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:38.490
But he was warning against
the danger of [inaudible]

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:44.090
and how might upset
the American democracy.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:50.170
And Lincoln's words
echo through the ages.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.970
Thank you very much.
