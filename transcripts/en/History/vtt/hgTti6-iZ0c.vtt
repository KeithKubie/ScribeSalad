00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.790
NARRATOR: Sirsi, India.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.710
10 miles outside of the city,
in the southwestern state

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.500
of Karnataka, within
the river Shalmala

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.540
is one of the
country's most popular

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.040
pilgrimage sites, Sahasralinga.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.080
Hidden under these waters
for most of the year

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.750
lie stone sculptures
known as Shiva lingams.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.000
These sacred idols are
representations of the god

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.540
Shiva, and are
visible to thousands

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.580
of pilgrims once a year at the
festival of Maha Shivaratri.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.500
Maha Shivaratri is a festival
where Shiva is worshipped

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.330
for his great nature.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.540
Maha Shivaratri is usually
held in the end of February

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.380
or beginning of March.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.210
During that month, the water
level of the Shalmala River

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.080
drops down so that all the
Shiva lingas are exposed.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.460
LAYNE LITTLE: Shiva is
depicted as the Shiva linga,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.420
as kind of a spherical
column, the flaming

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.960
pillar that is the cosmic
axis of the universe.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.540
Every Shiva linga that's in
worship is set into a yoni.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.040
This is a special base.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.080
And it actually serves kind
of a utility of function.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.540
It's a spout that,
when you pour offerings

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.620
over the surface of the linga,
they wash over the sacred body.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.790
Images of the Shiva
linga are found

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.250
throughout Southeast Asia,
even in parts of East Asia.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.960
Sometimes images of
Shiva as the lingam

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.960
also made its way into
China and into Japan.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.290
NARRATOR: The Shiva lingam first
appeared over 2,000 years ago,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.170
and there is still debate
over what this shape was

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.830
originally meant to symbolize.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.420
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.500
that the icon may
represent an incredibly

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.170
powerful technological device.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.620
Modern Hindu
scholars have theorized

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.000
that the Shiva
linga stone actually

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.460
represents atomic energy.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.290
When we think about this idea
of what atomic energy can do,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.880
how it can be used for good
but it can be extraordinarily

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.710
destructive, this certainly
pertains to the mythology

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.040
of Shiva, who is
chaotic energy, who

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.710
is a force for incredible
good but also a force

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.880
for incredible destruction.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.290
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
this symbol of Shiva's power

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.120
actually represents
atomic energy?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.290
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.710
and suggest the proof
can be found by examining

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.290
this mysterious shape.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.210
PRAVEEN MOHAN: The cylindrical
structure of the Shiva linga

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.330
is similar or
almost identical to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.040
a modern-day nuclear reactor.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.080
And the groove that
surrounds the base

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.170
represents the structures
built to dispose

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.830
of the polluted water.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.380
In ancient times,
and even today,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.250
Hindus pour water or milk on
top of Shiva linga as a ritual.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.250
Today, we pour water over
the top of nuclear reactor

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.830
to cool it.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.330
And interestingly,
most Shiva temples

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.250
are always found near water
bodies, like rivers or lakes,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.750
just like nuclear power plants.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.460
So is it possible that Shiva
linga actually represents

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.880
an ancient nuclear power plant?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.120
WILLIAM HENRY: In the story
of Shiva and the Shiva linga,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.290
we're obviously
dealing with some kind

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.250
of a universal or cosmic power
that we didn't fully understand

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.420
until the 20th century with
the discovery of nuclear power

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.120
and nuclear fission.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.080
When J. Robert Oppenheimer,
the father of the atomic bomb,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.120
observed the first atomic
explosion at the Trinity test

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.210
site, he cited a line
from the Bhagavad Gita,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.420
"I have become death,
destroyer of worlds."

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.620
That's the title of Shiva.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.790
Perhaps we should listen
and look at these stories

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.830
from a new perspective.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.500
What is the description about?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.960
Could it be that Shiva
was some type of energy?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.790
We are approaching the beginning
of a new future for mankind,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.960
so in a sense, it's
the end of an era

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.670
and the turning of a new page.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.420
The extraterrestrials
will come back,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.250
and it will be the most amazing
chapter in human history.
