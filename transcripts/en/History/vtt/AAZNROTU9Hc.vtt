NARRATOR: In 1830,
Mexico banned immigration

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.960
from the United States.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960
Why?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.330
Well, one reason-- slavery.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.670
But for the whole
picture, we have to look

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.040
to the history of Texas.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.500
Before Texas was a US
state and its own nation,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
it was part of Mexico's northern
state of Coahuila y Tejas.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.250
But the region was sparsely
populated and vulnerable

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.040
to Native American tribes
seeking to reclaim the land.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.750
So in the early 1820s, Mexico
opened its Northern Territory

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.500
to some American immigrants with
the idea that the Americans--

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.830
[gunshots]
[horses galloping]

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.920
--would protect the
region from falling

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.830
under Native American control.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.880
To entice American
settlers, the government

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.000
offered cheap land grants.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.580
In 1823, Stephen
F. Austin became

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.380
the first to receive
a grant and the right

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.380
to settle 300 families.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.000
Others soon followed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080
In exchange, the settlers
agreed to speak Spanish, convert

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.500
to Catholicism, become
Mexican citizens,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.920
and abstain from keeping slaves.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.170
But the Americans weren't
so good at holding

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080
up their end of the bargain.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.420
With little oversight from
the Mexican government,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.620
most remained Protestant,
spoke English, and didn't

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.960
give a hoot about Mexican law.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.580
With the cotton
industry booming,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.620
cheap farmland in
Tejas attracted

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.460
droves of cotton farmers.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.420
And cotton farms meant slaves.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.080
By 1829, Mexico realized
it had a real problem.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.790
[crowd of people talking]

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.120
The American population in Tejas
had swelled to nearly 20,000,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.460
making it practically
impossible for the government

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.210
to enforce the law.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.880
Mexico rightly feared it would
lose Tejas to the Americans.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.120
So on April 6, 1830, in a bid
to maintain control and keep

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.250
slavery out of its
country, Mexico

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.170
passed a law intended to
curb the flood of immigration

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.960
from the United States to Tejas.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.920
It didn't work.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.750
The Americans kept coming.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.170
And the law further strained
Mexico's delicate relationship

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.500
with the settlers.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.420
Then, to make matters
worse, in 1835,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080
Mexican President Antonio
Lopez de Santa Anna

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.920
repealed the 1824
Mexican constitution.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.580
He moved to centralize
Mexican politics,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.670
stripping Tejas and the other
Mexican states of their right

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.000
to self-govern.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.670
And all hell broke loose.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.290
The settlers saw this
attack on their rights

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.920
as the final straw.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.420
Their only option-- rebellion.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.960
[gunshots]

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.250
But Santa Anna was prepared
to put any dissent down,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.670
and violently.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.790
In early 1836, he
marched his troops north.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.330
Remember the Alamo?

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.380
On February 23, 1836,
Santa Anna launched

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.500
a 13-day siege on the
settlers' Catholic mission

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.710
turned fortress.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.710
When he finally
penetrated the walls,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.960
he slaughtered nearly
every person inside, ending

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.040
the battle but not the war.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.670
The settlers called
in reinforcements

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.000
from the States, promising
land and free passage.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
One month later,
General Sam Houston

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.460
launched a surprise
attack at San Jacinto,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.040
capturing Santa Anna and
forcing him to sign away

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500
Mexican ownership of Texas.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.880
[cheering]

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.290
The newly independent
Texans were psyched.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.000
As an independent
entity, they would

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.920
be free to join
the United States,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.830
where slavery was legal.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.420
But oh, the irony--

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.920
slavery, which had greatly
influenced their bid

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.000
for independence, now
practically extinguished any

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.250
chances they had for statehood.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.420
Because back in the
US, Congress was

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.250
grappling with the
spread of slavery

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.080
as their nation
expanded westward.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.500
Annexation of Texas would
bring in another slave state.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.380
As Congress debated how
to maintain the balance,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.250
Texas remained in
a state of limbo.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.710
For nearly 10 years,
Texas struggled

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.540
as an independent
nation, suffering

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.250
from economic instability and
border disputes with Mexico.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.330
Finally, in 1845, Texas
was admitted to the Union,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.040
but it was short-lived.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.290
15 years later, Texas
would secede from the US

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.210
as the country headed
towards a civil war--

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.750
[gunshots]
--over the issue of slavery.
