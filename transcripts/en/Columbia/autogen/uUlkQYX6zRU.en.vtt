okay it's not really a series for you I

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
okay it's not really a series for you I
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.420
okay it's not really a series for you I
mean it would be nice to pretend that we

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
mean it would be nice to pretend that we
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.940
mean it would be nice to pretend that we
have enough energy to to create anything

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
have enough energy to to create anything
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.470
have enough energy to to create anything
as dangers of the black hole pick a

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
as dangers of the black hole pick a
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.520
as dangers of the black hole pick a
knee-jerk but the energy way do you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
knee-jerk but the energy way do you
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.430
knee-jerk but the energy way do you
never had a moment to consider no

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
never had a moment to consider no
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840
never had a moment to consider no
there's actually an argument which

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
there's actually an argument which
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429
there's actually an argument which
probably isn't so simple for people

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
probably isn't so simple for people
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.840
probably isn't so simple for people
understand but the so we we produce a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
understand but the so we we produce a
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.189
understand but the so we we produce a
certain amount of energy we know exactly

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
certain amount of energy we know exactly
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470
certain amount of energy we know exactly
what that energy is but we have high

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
what that energy is but we have high
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.439
what that energy is but we have high
energy particles coming from outer space

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
energy particles coming from outer space
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.930
energy particles coming from outer space
at hitter at all the time and their way

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
at hitter at all the time and their way
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.049
at hitter at all the time and their way
higher in energy so if a certain energy

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
higher in energy so if a certain energy
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.630
higher in energy so if a certain energy
range could produce a black hole then

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
range could produce a black hole then
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069
range could produce a black hole then
these particles from outer space would

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
these particles from outer space would
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.750
these particles from outer space would
have produced tons of them in there and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
have produced tons of them in there and
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400
have produced tons of them in there and
what I've eaten s already so we'd all be

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
what I've eaten s already so we'd all be
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010
what I've eaten s already so we'd all be
dead already it sets up I know it sounds

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
dead already it sets up I know it sounds
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.580
dead already it sets up I know it sounds
like a it's not that easy you know it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
like a it's not that easy you know it
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920
like a it's not that easy you know it
doesn't you know you have to think about

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
doesn't you know you have to think about
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299
doesn't you know you have to think about
the difference between two things

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
the difference between two things
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400
the difference between two things
colliding a car crash in which you hit

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
colliding a car crash in which you hit
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.650
colliding a car crash in which you hit
it head-on versus one where once at rest

things coming from space would have

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
things coming from space would have
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740

absolutely destroyed her just no

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
absolutely destroyed her just no
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509

question about so we're not anywhere

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
question about so we're not anywhere
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.120
question about so we're not anywhere
close we're safe from that point it'd be

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
close we're safe from that point it'd be
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.920
close we're safe from that point it'd be
different I mean there was an accident

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
different I mean there was an accident
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.010
different I mean there was an accident
in which the thing blew up in the fall

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
in which the thing blew up in the fall
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.800
in which the thing blew up in the fall
of 2008 and it took a year and a half to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
of 2008 and it took a year and a half to
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140
of 2008 and it took a year and a half to
fix it this was a technical problem in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
fix it this was a technical problem in
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810
fix it this was a technical problem in
that a magnet developed a short and then

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
that a magnet developed a short and then
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240
that a magnet developed a short and then
some helium leaked and it was a violent

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
some helium leaked and it was a violent
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.450
some helium leaked and it was a violent
explosion in the tunnel and so so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
explosion in the tunnel and so so
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190
explosion in the tunnel and so so
accidents happen even in these big

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
accidents happen even in these big
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780
accidents happen even in these big
projects but not at the level of beating

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
projects but not at the level of beating
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.210
projects but not at the level of beating
her they're funny things to worry about

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
her they're funny things to worry about
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.780
her they're funny things to worry about
like nuclear weapons but this is not not

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
like nuclear weapons but this is not not
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.000
like nuclear weapons but this is not not
