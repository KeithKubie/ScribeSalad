00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
&gt;&gt; My name is Nancy Lubin. I'm the ceo of
dosomething.org. So I have a suggestion for

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.660
President Obama, or any world leader that
wants to engage in the Middle East peace process.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.391
I think that we should ban clothing from the
Mid-East. Imagine this: If everyone in the

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:22.250
Middle East, all the Palestinians, all the
Jews, everyone,was naked. There'd be no more

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.260
suicide bombs because you wouldn't be able
to hide any of those things in your clothing,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.960
and there would be a much bigger sense of
humility because people would walk around

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.520
and be like "ooh that looks like me, ooh,
ooh looks kind of small. So that's my solution

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.390
for Middle East peace.
