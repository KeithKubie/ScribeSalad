[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.140
SPEAKER: Flutter is
a portable UI tool

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.850
kit for building beautiful
native applications

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.200
for mobile, web, and desktop
from a single codebase.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.330
Here at Google, we've been busy
with Flutter over the last year

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.000
and want to show you what
we've been working on.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170
We shipped several updates,
including our 1.0 Stable

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.650
Release, and added features
and enhancements many of you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.860
have asked for.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.880
For example, we added support
for integrating Flutter

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.820
into existing
Android or iOS apps,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.920
making it easier to get
started with Flutter,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.450
even if you already have
an app in the store.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.370
Also, we have put a lot of
investment into our add-ins

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
for Visual Studio Code
and Android Studio

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.770
and created a new suite
of web-based tooling

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.190
for debugging and inspecting
Flutter applications.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.910
We've continued to invest in iOS
with an extensive and growing

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.000
library of widgets and classes
that make it easier than ever

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.270
to build pixel-perfect iOS apps.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.830
Beyond the core
framework itself,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.320
we have been building out
the supporting ecosystem,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.930
publishing new packages
for Google Maps,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.760
Firebase ML Vision, in-app
purchases, and WebViews.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.890
Dart is the programming
language for Flutter

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.680
because it is optimized
for client development.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.170
With hot reload
powered by the Dart-vm,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.530
developers can iteratively
make changes and instantly see

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.450
results in their app.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.970
Also, Dart compiles
to native machine

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.380
code for mobile and desktop, as
well as JavaScript for the web.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.240
We've continued
to invest in ways

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.300
to make Dart a great language
for Flutter development.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.180
For example, as
part of Flutter 1.5,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.220
we added new language
features, including

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.710
support for conditional UI.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.990
We have also focused
on making compiled code

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.440
even faster, leading
to a 15% performance

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.840
increase in many cases.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.610
Now that Flutter has shipped
several releases for mobile,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.150
we're setting our sights
wider to other devices

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.380
and application types, including
the web, Chromebooks, Windows,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.710
Mac, and embedded form factors.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.960
Flutter is an open
source product,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.880
so the community
is a major source

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780
of feedback, documentation,
and code contributions.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.940
We've had major
community contributions

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.970
towards areas such as
desktop support and state

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.930
management, which makes
Flutter better for everyone.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.850
This past year,
we've seen developers

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.070
all over the world
creating apps with Flutter

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.340
that are being used by
hundreds of millions of users.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.790
And LinkedIn data says Flutter
is the fastest growing skill

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.950
among software engineers.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.780
Within Google, we
are using Flutter

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.990
in a wide variety of
products, from Google Ads

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.110
to smart displays like
the Google Home Hub.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.780
Now is the perfect time
to start developing

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.310
your apps with Flutter.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.310
Try it out at flutter.dev,
where you will also

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.970
find codelabs, documentation,
and a guide to getting started.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.969
We can't wait to
see what you build.
