00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.250
 You may have heard the saying: "The early bird was like a worm before others," but for 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.890
 Human, do the early have benefits on their old peers? Do you sleep early? 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.040
 More intelligent or successful than others in this struggle over sleep time? 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.820
 The surprising fact is that we do not have much to say about sleep preferences, as 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.860
 It's like being genetically engineered. It is likely that if you are an evening, 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.150
 Inherited from your ancestors who were also slow. From an evolutionary perspective, 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.270
 It is understandable; acquisition of people at different sleeping times can group 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.390
 To obtain full protection the length of the skill and the night. Instead of everyone sleeping 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.780
 At the same time, some people by their very nature remain vigilant late, as others tend to wake up early in order to be aware of the risks 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.739
 Or predators while others sleep. 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.040
 However, as most of the activities of modern societies occur between 9 am and 5 pm, it is clear 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.450
 That the Messians are in a loss. Researchers put the term 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.850
 "Social disorder" to explain sleep deprivation to take into account 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.200
 milieu. For the evacuees, this disorder is felt by them 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.120
 They live in a different time zone every day. Sleep deprivation affects the role of the brain 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 It is not surprising that studies prove that students are college students 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 Their scores are lower than their peers. Early people also have positive social characteristics 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.150
 Such as positive and proactive, and are less likely to be depressed or addicted 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.350
 Nicotine, alcohol and food. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.650
 We can see these properties physically on the brain - especially white matter 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.390
 Which help connect neurons. The subjects have less white matter 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.780
 This results in lower neurotransmitter pathways to the happiness hormones such as sertonin and dopamine 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.890
 To navigate. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 Not all things are bad for the losers. In fact, they tend to be more innovative than others, 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 They have high mental abilities, and are known as psychics. 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.210
 What detracts from the white matter, they make up for cortisol. Humon tension this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.909
 The body can face risks, which helps to take risks, which studies see 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.030
 That it could turn into opportunities for financial gain. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.509
 In addition, although the morning is active after awakening, 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.990
 Quickly, they do not make it difficult for Uo to turn against their poor peers. Both parties are doing the same 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.689
 Effectiveness in speed tests after waking up an hour, but after 10 hours, 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.849
 The evenings perform much better. 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.069
 Your inner watch is regulated by many proteins that are made up of genes in your DNA. 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.419
 Studies have shown that any slight change in nuclear conductivity, prior to the so-called gene 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:23.579
 In the first cycle, it may change the time you wake up by an hour. 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.840
 Surprisingly, scientists have found that there is a correlation between these genes and the time of your death. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.599
 Early people are more likely to die around 11am, 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.439
 The evenings are before 6 pm. 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.400
 What about teenagers? It is true that most of them are absent because of 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.359
 Hormonal changes during puberty, but all this change fades over time to suit your genes 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.559
 Until you reach puberty. 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.669
 When there is some health of the saying that the early bird withers the worm, the night owls are not 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.319
 Late in life, they are only late in time! 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.809
 Do not forget to watch ASAPthought where you can participate 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.909
