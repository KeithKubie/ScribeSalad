00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:03.670
You accomplished a lot in this first lesson. Starting with nothing more

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.870
than Android Studio and hope, you've created your first project. Built and

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.390
deployed it to virtual and actual devices, and

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.910
even created a simple list-based UI that's populated using an adapter.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.480
You also learned a little about what makes mobile and Android, in particular,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.690
a different environment to develop for the desktop, web, and server. But we've

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.090
only just gotten started. The app we've got so far is using static mock data.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
So join us in lesson two to learn how to hook it up to real weather data.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.070
But before that, take a moment to cleanse your palate with

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.020
a brief interlude exploring the history and evolution of the Android ecosystem.
