The lovely Nia hidden,

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.990

give me a microphone here.
I got to pass this through because it was,

5
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.650
the wires are all cross to,
oh,
I got the wires crossed.

6
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.310
The wires are crossed.
We're sitting here.
Is that better?
Yup.

7
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:30.820
Me and the lovely Nia we have on.
The reason he is here is I hit,

8
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.310
we have a huge announcement to make that as of this morning.
Yeah,

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.950
me and I die.
Yes.

10
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:42.310
Became two people right?
That yes.
Had corn,

11
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.490
beef hash for breakfast.
Absolutely.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.500
We are so proud and we're so happy and we just want to thank everybody for your

13
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:55.240
support,
your support over the last few months and for your thoughts during this

14
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:59.050
difficult time maybe isn't here yet.
So I've been,

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.050
yeah,

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.250
<v 1>I become like a Sitcom Dad.</v>

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.390
Just fucking hanging out at the house where my big fucking socks.

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.350
Bill's got big fuzzy socks on.
Yeah.
That's one new thing.
That's right.

19
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.283
You got to Colton?

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.600
<v 0>Yeah,
because I get hot.</v>

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.930
Yeah we have hardwood floors and he is fucking walking around more pregnant than

22
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.730
anybody I've ever got DMC.

23
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.210
So it's like she could be standing in Antartica being like,

24
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.260
can we put on the AC now I'm over here fucking chilly willy.

25
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.690
So I got on my uh,
cell pregnant.

26
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.190
I'm just like a human tea kettle.
I am short and stout.

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.970
You all baby,
you're all paying me.
You look good to me.
Um,
yeah.

28
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.370
<v 1>Thank you.
Anyways,
uh,</v>

29
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
so we're sitting out here on a rainy fucking Sunday.

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.180
It's been raining cats and dogs out here.
And uh,
did he say rainy Sunday?

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.740
Did I say Sunday?
I don't know.
It feels like a Sunday.
It's a fucking Thursday.

32
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:56.540
Whatever.
Pouring outside.
You know what pissed me off yesterday on the news,

33
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.600
some fucking idiot.
Like they announced out here in California,

34
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:02.990
they said the drought is over.
Does cause it rains?

35
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.930
Well now because it rained so much that this flooding,
but like yeah,

36
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.170
this shit's gonna stop and then this,

37
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.460
this is going to have to last us for like four years.
Cause you know,

38
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:14.540
the next feet like,

39
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.110
well how much does it have to rain for it to no longer be a drought?

40
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.190
That's my question.

41
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.780
Well I think just the mere fact that it's raining mean that there's no,
no,
no,

42
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.000
the water levels in all the reservoirs.

43
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.510
I believe I'm just would guests that this they have to get to a certain level

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.800
because when I did my bus tour,

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.070
burning my own hole in the fucking California ozone,
sure.
When,
uh,

46
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.620
we went by all these big reservoirs that were for,
uh,
you know,

47
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.770
drinking water or just even people just ride boats around or whatever.

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.730
Like you could see the waterline.
I mean it was like to like,
you know,

49
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:47.780
a brownstone in New York,

50
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.510
picture like two or three of those stacked on top of each other that low and it

51
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.770
looks like it was a half mile across to me was fucking ridiculous.
Yeah,
it was,

52
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.680
it was terrifying to be honest with you.
So evidently it's gotten up to an level,

53
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.440
so now everyone's going to start taking fucking long showers.

54
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.020
You know what I mean?
Just kills me out here.

55
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.070
Every time when it starts to fucking rain and you wash all,

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.330
you watch all that water going down the La River,

57
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.970
that goes all the way down to Marina del Rey,
I believe in.

58
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.560
Then it just goes out into the ocean.
It's like,

59
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.360
why don't you capture that somehow and save it all that runoff.

60
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.510
Yeah.
I mean I think environmentalist would like that to happen.

61
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.730
It's a very complicated
lost.

62
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.750
Kids couldn't have books in schools anymore.
If we captured it.
The raid one,

63
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.000
we did that,
then we'd have to cut this and I dunno.
It sounds like,

64
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.790
it seems like it's complicated.
Maybe it's not.
I don't know.
Yeah,
you have.

65
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.750
You have no energy today.
I can hear it in my voice.

66
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.500
You have like rainy day energy.
I have rainy day in pregnant as fuck energy.

67
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.310
Rainy Day in pregnant.
Oh,
brings me down.
Well,

68
00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:59.500
why don't you just fucking have the kid just fucking,
you know.
Oh,
I wish I could.

69
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.430
I wish I could have it right now.
Yeah.
You know what?

70
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:08.140
You know what's funny is I've been like joking about this on stage is the level

71
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:12.910
that people have been trying to,
uh,
every day I get a text,

72
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.720
it'll say,
did the kid come yet?
And I'll say,
no,
I mean the followup Texas,

73
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.430
are you nervous?
It's like,
well,
I wasn't,
I was sitting here relaxed.

74
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.710
Like they just get you on edge.
And I'm just like,

75
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.560
it's been this great process where I'm just like,
wow man,

76
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.970
I always listened to people.

77
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.870
I need to stop doing that because it doesn't help you if they just think I was

78
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.720
joking on stage like they were getting you like,

79
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.150
you know when you get a dog all excited,
like you want to go say,

80
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.740
how do you want to go into that?
Like that's what they're doing to your like,

81
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.980
is the baby here?
Are you nervous?
You excited and uh,

82
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.070
am again and you're freaking out like three or four attacks a day for like the

83
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:52.170
past three days.
It's like,
no,
Amy's not here.
Yeah.

84
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.880
You sound like you drank some of it.
What's that?
What's that?
Drank.

85
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.260
You sound like your lien.

86
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.110
Is that what the kids are doing nowadays with the fucking cough syrup and their

87
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.790
Irish spring that they take a cheese grater and they fucking Irish spring.

88
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.060
That's one of my favorite things to dirty sprite.
That's where future calls it.

89
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.120
I like when you go on least for these fucking people on the Internet and they

90
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.180
show you how to make it,
cause I was sitting,
it was a comedian,

91
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.670
I got to know what's going on.
Oh,
did you look online to see how it's man?
Yeah,

92
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.470
it's literally spray it and like Cody and like prescription and then take like a

93
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.950
car.
Someone put up a jolly rancher or some shit in there.

94
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:27.460
But like if you just look at the ingredients on the back of the fucking thing.

95
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.840
Yeah,
yeah.
Like uh,
I gotta hand it to this generation.
All these generations.

96
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:36.810
Every time you think like,
you know,
wow.
Like,
like I was saying,

97
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.030
my generation there was crack babies and I'm just like,
okay,
that's it.

98
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.410
That's the end.
That's as fucked up as you as you're going to see.

99
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.070
Like human beings do things like,
like as a parent,

100
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.710
I wouldn't be able to be shocked like you're doing what right.

101
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.870
Then came meth heads,
which literally looked like walking dead people.

102
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.660
They're not zombies,
but they're not real people anymore.
They have like fucking,

103
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.170
they like when I would do gigs out in the Midwest,
you know,

104
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.350
Iowa and in further west into those states,
you know,

105
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.060
celebrities go to buy a log cabin and buy a fucking pretend they own a grizzly

106
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.020
bear outfit.
Right?

107
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.230
You go out there and they had like this before and after pictures of people on

108
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.950
meth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I was just like,
Holy Shit.
That made,

109
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.180
that blew my fucking mind.
And now looking at these guys,
I mean,

110
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.560
I guess this isn't as bad as math,

111
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:29.060
but just watching beings will always find a way to get high though new creative

112
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:32.420
ways to get high.
That's just kinda how it goes.
Don't you think?

113
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.990
But I'm going to sound like an old man here.
What,

114
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:37.400
what was wrong with what the fuck we did?
You can just drink a couple of beers.

115
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.760
I mean,
what's that?
That fucking drink that they're drinking.

116
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:43.610
That's like shit homeless people do or like,

117
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.510
like full on alcoholics and people will not fucking give you like money for

118
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.690
booze anymore and you just don't have it that that's what they used to do.

119
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.490
They go and they start drinking nyquil.
Yeah,

120
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.960
cause prescription and any of that stuff is really like,
I dunno,

121
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.690
I've never drank that kind of stuff before,

122
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.730
but it's supposed to mimic the feel of opioids.
I thought opioids,

123
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.750
opioids,
opiates,
you mean?
Oh No opioid.
Is that correct?

124
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.880
I think that's some bump on your ass.
No,
that's a hemorrhoid.

125
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.640
I thought opiates,
so that's opiates.
Opiates and hemorrhoids is also a word.

126
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.493
It is,

127
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.700
I think is that when you take like the Qtip lace with the Shit and you put it in

128
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:29.730
your ass.
I don't know why you are assessed with the ass.
No,

129
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.310
no.
There was a thing that these kids were doing.
They were soaking something.

130
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.670
I swear to God,
I swear to God,
I went down a rabbit hole.
How these kids get high.

131
00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:39.970
There was this fucking thing they were doing.

132
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.890
They were taking something acute dip or something and there was soaking it in

133
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.850
this shit that got you high and then they'd stick it in their ass because

134
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.400
there's a thin membrane there.
I believe it.
Yeah.

135
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:54.050
Like how people blow coke up each others ass and stuff.
No.
Yeah,

136
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.170
that's a thing that is not a thing.
I know.
You know what?

137
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.770
I'll go with the fucking Q tip up the ass.
No,
it totally as a thing.

138
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.840
Hang on a sec.
That is not a fucking thing.

139
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.560
The old coke in the ass.
It's just,
yeah,
just picture what that looks like.

140
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:12.770
What are you,

161
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:42.720
well then I got to look mine up.
Well,
I've got to read the article here.

162
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.820
All right.
This is what you need.
Some sort of fucking a kitchen knife.
Wait,
wait.

163
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.640
Let's not tell people how to do it.
Yeah.
Oh Man.
I can say,
okay,
this isn't real.

164
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
Nia.

165
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.360
When the Internet was suddenly a buzz with rumors that getting a friend to blow

166
00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.820
coke up your ass with the straw was worth the trouble.

167
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.510
I had to see if I'd been doing it all wrong.
After all,

168
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:07.170
blow doesn't come with instructions.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

169
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:10.980
Get to the fucking point.
All right.
I don't know.
There's not gonna be a video.

170
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:15.640
This is a,
okay.
Okay.
Uh,

171
00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:17.860
I know it's funny.
I said hoping the conversation would cover,

172
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:20.500
but I just wanted to understand the possible health effects on a more

173
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:21.820
fundamental low.
Okay.

174
00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:26.290
So he called somebody physician's viewpoint in a very nice woman named Kate

175
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:30.640
spoke to me.
I asked her about it and she fell silent.
He said,
I know.
It's funny.

176
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:34.270
I said,
I was hoping.
She says,
it's more sad actually.
He said,
Oh yeah,

177
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.460
that's the word I should have used.
Said.
Overall.

178
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.000
Kate was extremely helpful and promised to contact all the gastro,
uh,

179
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.910
set mineralogist still the Internet had spoken.
I had to try it.

180
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.320
Not that,
that the de this guy.
Okay,
I'm going just go with the pictures now.

181
00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:52.330
He's got the spoon.
He sticks it in a vile.

182
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.930
All right.
In the end,

183
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:59.650
my high was no more significant than when I opt for the more orthodox approach.

184
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:02.860
All right,
so people are doing it because it was the other thing.

185
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.680
The thing I was talking about,
rave,

186
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:08.560

<v 2>Yeah.</v>

Not really and not what people are thinking.

194
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.080
How to smuggle in gear to a concert.

195
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.420
Jesus Christ shaking her ass at a rave party.

Come off of this topic.
This is getting weird.</v>

198
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.420
Let me just get weird.
We're not doing it.

199
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.720
We're just researching towns in the San Diego.

200
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.133
<v 2>Sure.</v>

201
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.120
<v 1>I'm moving up to Los Angeles.
Oh,
is I saw something online about that.
Yeah.</v>

202
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.840
They finally,
they're returning home where they belong.

203
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.890
They were the Los Angeles chargers for one season.
The first year.
The AFL,

204
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.390
they're back where they started here.

205
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:09.760
They come round again.
Hey,
where did nick go?

206
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.150
It's almost like she's having a contraction.
Um,

207
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.080
dude,
you've got to ask yourself as a San Diego charger fan,

208
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.030
after all the fucking heartache and everything,

209
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.780
he just went through and now they're going to fucking walk out on you.
You know,

210
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.140
you've got to be asking yourself like,
what,
what was that off?

211
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.010
What was that all for?
You know?
Right.

212
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.100
I actually am back as much as they hated as much as they hated the fucking,

213
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.750
the Patriots and Tom Brady and I had a horrible fan experience when I went down

214
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.080
and I were patriots hats,
not real.
And I'm realizing how much they hated us.
Um,

215
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.840
I just don't,
I just,

216
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.110
I actually felt bad for them as fence because it wasn't that they lost,

217
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.140
it's the way they lost.
They did the old Boston red sox thing.

218
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:57.090
What we used to do before we started winning all the championships was,
uh,

219
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.240
we couldn't just have the decency to just suck like the cubs all those years,

220
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.540
you know,
the cubs just sucked.
They had like two errors to Eric Games,

221
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.600
one of the early eighties and then they had the fucking one where they blamed

222
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.900
that,
that fucking a little nerd,
you know,

223
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.060
rather than the other six people that stood up around them.

224
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.310
Also trying to catch the ball.
They had to,
to heartbreakers.
That was it.

225
00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:17.770
Other than that,
it was a big keg party.

226
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.860
Everybody standing there with their shirts off.
They all live in Wrigleyville.

227
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.820
They get money that they're not sympathetic people.
You know what I mean?
Um,

228
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.870
but charge offense,
you know what I mean?
They just like,

229
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.770
they had that fucking old ass God damn stadium.
They wrote it out.

230
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.060
They were down there.

231
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.270
They came close in like 95 got their fucking asses kicked was at 95 and 94 when

232
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:43.720
Steve Young got the monkey take it off his back.
Wasn't that what it was near?

233
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.430
Oh yeah.

234
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.610
Steve Young who claimed the Patriots should have all of their championships

235
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:52.990
taken away because of spy gate.
One of the dumbest things I ever heard.
It's like,

236
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.140
yeah,
that's Great Steve.
It's a brand new rule.
It was illegal for one game.

237
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.230
So when it wasn't illegal because we were doing it back then,

238
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.920
then they should get charged for it when the rest of the league was also doing

239
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.990
it.
Alright.
Whatever.
So welcome to La.
We went from no football teams to tune in.

240
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.860
Now.
How does that make you feel?
Are you excited?

241
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.840
No.
Yes,
no.
I'll say no.
I don't care.
I'm kind of um,

242
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.540
you know,
need to tap out in different,
you'd done now I'm okay.

243
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.030
You're okay.
You don't look like you're okay.
You don't look like you're okay.

244
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.253
I can make it.

245
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.920
It's a good distraction.
All right.
For sure.

246
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:39.610
For all the guys out there and for the ladies who never been pregnant,

247
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:42.510
what does that feel like at this point?
If you guys are one on one?

248
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm so fucking relaxed.
She's had so many of these goddamn things.

249
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:49.510
It's like somebody crying wolf.
Yeah.
Crying Wolf.
Yeah.
Now these are,
you know,

250
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:51.320
you should do to freak me out.
Yeah.
When I'm not there,

251
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:55.760
just throw a glass of water on the floor and just be like,
oh,
just watch me.

252
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.010
<v 4>Someone had suggested that I do that to you on Twitter,
but I don't,</v>

253
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.700
I'm not original.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Um,

254
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.800
yeah,
no.
These are called Braxton Hicks contractions.

255
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.090
They are getting you ready for actual real contractions and I have been having

256
00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:15.860
them more and more frequently.
Yes.

257
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.330
Answered the question as I'm getting closer to answer what questions?

258
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.070
Like what does it feel like?
Oh,

259
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.570
it feels like an extreme tightening in your abdomen.

260
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.530
<v 1>I'll relate it to a pain you've had before.</v>

261
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.490
Get slugged in the shoulder and that's never happened to be having your big

262
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:34.120
brother grabbed you by one of your ankles and drag you back down the stairs.

263
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.530
<v 4>What happened to me?
Uh,</v>

264
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.350
this is the only way I can relate to it's launched in the ear.
It's like,

265
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.970
it's like someone is in your stomach,

266
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.300
stretching it out as tight as it can go and then it slowly goes back to normal

267
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.640
<v 1>running into the living room cause you missed the big play.</v>

268
00:15:50.641 --> 00:15:55.200
Looking at the TV and running full speed into the coffee table.
Stomach first.

269
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.380
Sure.
Stomach first.
Okay.
There we go.
I did that.
Yes,

270
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.970
I did that on Monday when I watch,

271
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.980
when I watched the Alabama Clemson game.
Now I know near as much.

272
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.840
You don't like football.

273
00:16:09.841 --> 00:16:12.480
I know you heard me screaming when Clemson scored that last.

274
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.030
<v 4>You were definitely screaming</v>

275
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.800
<v 1>I would be the worst announcer ever.
You know,</v>

276
00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:23.550
like the great answers have to be like,
do you believe in miracles?
Yes.

277
00:16:23.551 --> 00:16:26.880
Or like he did it.
He did it fluidly.
Did it?
They have like something,

278
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:28.770
you know the shot heard round the world.

279
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.640
One of the fuck it was the giants win the pennant.
The job I just went like,
yeah,

280
00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:34.200
you were going crazy there.
Yeah,

281
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.420
I saw it as like one of the Crimson,

282
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.240
call me d d.
Um,

283
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.240
I actually,
when I was watching that fucking that game I was uh,

284
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.050
I was actually happy for either team winning cause my,
my,

285
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.960
my hatred of Alabama is completely phony.

286
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.740
I'm not from down south.
You know,

287
00:17:01.741 --> 00:17:05.640
I just picked Lsu because I thought that last miles was a guy who I thought he

288
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:09.400
was crazy eating grass and shit,
you know,
going forward on fucking field goals,

289
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.920
having the field goal kick of run down the fucking street and slippers scoring

290
00:17:13.921 --> 00:17:16.430
touchdowns.
I was like,
Hey,
I'll fucking go with these guys.
You know?

291
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.740
So it just became fun to root against them.
But it was also,

292
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.040
I'm a big fan of history,
Nia and a,

293
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.220
he would've tied Paul Bear Bryant if he won another championship.

294
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.280
And I'm also lie head was saying that Alabama is overrated because the SCC was

295
00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:33.540
weak and then out.

296
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:38.541
So then I was kind of rooting for Alabama to beat a team that just fucking beat

297
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:42.930
the shit out of the Ohio state buckeyes 31 to nothing.
Um,

298
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.730
I was kind of hoping for that.

299
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.460
But then also you've got to get a root for Clemson.
They're the underdog,
right?

300
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.680
Phenomenal.
This is how much of a Cleveland Guy,
okay.

301
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.080
Jason La had is,
well,
I love Jason.
Okay.

302
00:17:55.081 --> 00:18:00.081
But he has the disease of being a Cleveland Sports Fan when fucking,

303
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:01.770
uh,

304
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.790
Clemson went up because what happened was Clemson scored and it looked like they

305
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.600
were gonna win the game.

306
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.170
And then Alabama went right down the field and gave him the old right there,

307
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:10.531
Fred.

308
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:15.510
And then Clemson came back when it looked like there was really no time left and

309
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.950
then they scored and then they want,
right.

310
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.320
So when Clemson went up and it looked like Alabama wasn't going to have enough

311
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:23.154
time to score,

312
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.530
Jason Texted me about their head coach saying he'll find a way to fuck this up.

313
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.800
And I just wrote back,
Jesus Christ,
Jason,
can you just believe?

314
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.910
And then sure enough,

315
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.240
Alabama goes down and scores a touchdown and then Jason writes to me,

316
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.990
you Clemson,
you lose some almost trying to look like you win some,

317
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.430
you lose some or something like that.

318
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.930
And then Clemson goes down against all of his fucking negative vibes.

319
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.830
They go ahead,
they scored the winning touchdown or you know what he says to me,

320
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.240
he goes out,
they should have won it last year.
She didn't want to last year two,

321
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.830
they finally win a championship.
That's what he says.
Um,
I don't know.

322
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.330
Classic Cleveland Guy.
Anyways.
Yeah.
Uh,

323
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.910
we're going to go see a double feature today,
Huh?
Yes.
You taking me to a,

324
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.200
what am I going to go?
See?

325
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.530
<v 4>We're going to go see mood having a number one.
Yes.
All right.</v>

326
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.390
That's the five one.
One rule.
So that's two within five minutes.
I know,

327
00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:24.380
but this isn't a real contraction.
This is the lady who never had a baby.

328
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.440
So you guys do at the end of this fucking thing about all sitting here to baby

329
00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:29.210
crying like,
man,
what the fuck?

330
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.120
Because I know this is,
they say,
you know,

331
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.180
you know when the contraction is real and it's like you got to know when to hold

332
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:44.780
them.
I don't think I'd be able to
hang out and hold a microphone.

333
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.130
<v 1>The have a kid.
Yeah,
no.
When the podcast,</v>

334
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.860
you nailed [inaudible] Joe babies sitting on.

335
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.010
So there'll be times

336
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.850
when a Braxton Hicks is done.

337
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.233
<v 4>Right?
Exactly.</v>

338
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.480
We're going to go see moonlight and they weren't going to see hidden figures.

339
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.420
And this is all dependent.
I mean,
hopefully,
yes,

340
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:10.280
I won't be mowed light on it and figures my water won't be breaking during any

341
00:20:10.281 --> 00:20:13.900
of these.
I'll just this make bill woke day.
Ah,

342
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.080
it's just starting

343
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.560
<v 1>trimester guy.
So I got to just agree with everything that she fucking said.</v>

344
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:20.580
So I got to go see that.

345
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.970
And then I gotta go see hidden figures where you know they're going to do a

346
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:27.840
total overcorrection of fucking history and they're gonna have a bunch of guys

347
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:28.910
running around.
Like,
why don't wait,

348
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.770
<v 4>what am I supposed to be a really good movie?
And I'm excited to see it.
I know.</v>

349
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.320
And it's,
it's keyword based on a true story.
Carson in it.

350
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.850
<v 1>Kevin fucking</v>

351
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.080
<v 4>[inaudible] and my garage and pneumonia who I love so much.</v>

352
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.050
Remember when went to see her concert we saw before she was famous,
famous,

353
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:52.010
famous.
We saw when she was just famous.
That's right.

354
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.440
She's jumped around on the saddle shoes when she was opening for somebody.

355
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.680
Not know she closed.
No,
she opened for Jamie Lidell at the Avalon.

356
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.270
Don't you remember?
I had seen her in a magazine and I was like,
who is this?

357
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:06.490
And I listened to some of her music and I'm like,
that's cool.

358
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.030
And then the week of our wedding,

359
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.170
she was playing at the House of Blues and I went to go see her a couple of days

360
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:17.650
before our wedding and it was awesome.
And one with my maid of honor.

361
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.680
We took a picture together and we ended up hanging out with her.

362
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.980
And what did afterwards what?
What did you have to eat afterwards?
What?

363
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.930
What do you say?

364
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.250
<v 1>You're just getting into a lot of detail here.
Oh,
well,
excuse me.</v>

365
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.130
Sorry,
I'm,
I got cabin fever.
Knew I said yesterday,
but we watch it.
We watched,

366
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.030
I sat in the fucking laid in bed with you.
Yeah.

367
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.080
And we watched all those fucking game shows.

368
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:45.150
<v 0>Yeah.
We,
we watch jeopardy.
Wait for everyone.
Oh,</v>

369
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.000
first we watched the news.
We've turned into a real old couple.

370
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.740
We watched the news and then we will Trump yelling at that guy and CNN and then

371
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:57.790
we watch jeopardy news.
You're fake news.
I won't answer that.
Let her talk.

372
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:01.990
Don't be rude.
Don't be rude.
Jeopardy.
And then we watched a wheel of fortune.

373
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.170
<v 1>Fortunate got boring.
They got rid of all their fucking,</v>

374
00:22:09.171 --> 00:22:13.160
they used to have the worst fucking prizes you had to pick from.
Right?

375
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.023
In the end they'd be,

376
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.560
it was always like for $600 I'll take the brass bed frame

377
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.900
for five 60 I'll take the grandfather clock.
So like old people,
Shit.

378
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.510
300 bucks.
I'll take the estate jewelry.
Oh my God.
Damn father clocks.
I'll take,

379
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.210
put the rest on a gift certificate.

380
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:37.690
<v 0>How many people went bankrupt?</v>

381
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.010
<v 1>Every other fucking spent.
Yeah,
that nerdy black kid.</v>

382
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.550
Every time you would get ahead,
every time Calvin will get ahead

383
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.970
<v 0>and he didn't win in the,
Anna was so sad.
I mean he won,</v>

384
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:52.770
but then he didn't get the final puzzle.

385
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.250
<v 1>And I think all the Calvin,
we're winners that day.
Alright patch.</v>

386
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.280
Say Jack is 70 years old.

387
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:05.330
Alex Tribec is 76 Alex Tribeca is under contract for another two years.
This is,

388
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.140
this was why my fucking add reacts when I watched the game show.

389
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.770
Cause after a while I can't watch those people excitedly yelling out letters.

390
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.020
Really see a say.
There is two C's.

391
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.930
You want to solve the puzzle or continue spinning?
I'm going to get tineas pain.

392
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.553
<v 2>Three 50.</v>

393
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.720
<v 1>Is there an l?
Ooh,
I'm sorry.</v>

394
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:35.300
There's no l Calvin spin the wheel.

395
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.210

396
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:47.030
<v 0>Fucking drove me insane.
And I can't even,
I never know what it says.</v>

397
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:50.230
You can have everything but the vowels of pseudo care,

398
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.210
kitchen,
titty.
I could never understand.
I never know what the fuck it is.

399
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.920
You're really good at sports.
Jeopardy.
We watch some sports jeopardy this week.

400
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.920
We've been watching a lot of game shows.
That's true.
Yup.
Oh my God.

401
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.700
Before sports jeopardy.
Yeah.
The shit that doesn't matter in life.

402
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.440
I know everything about,
um,

403
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.570
<v 1>speaking of which,
how about those Celtics?
Huh?</v>

404
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.710
Sally had a tough one against the fucking raptors are the huskies.

405
00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:21.090
Whatever the fuck they were doing.
Every he's doing,

406
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.810
they throw back fucking jerseys.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

407
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:28.170
I don't know one person's name on the Toronto Raptors,

408
00:24:28.171 --> 00:24:32.190
but I do know DeRozen now.
Holy Shit.
That guy just,
he hit her.

409
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.420
<v 0>I thought he kept saying the Rosa and of course I just kept thinking of Joe,
Joe,</v>

410
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.450
Joe Rosen killed him.
He killed us on the raptors.

411
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.050
There's the Photoshop right there.
I want to see Joe Rosa.

412
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:46.640
<v 1>We have to,</v>

413
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.730
you can find a fucking picture of him where he kind of looks confident.

414
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.060
Um,
you know,

415
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.080
<v 0>Joey put up,</v>

416
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.810
<v 1>put them in with that Toronto huskies fucking throwback,</v>

417
00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.670
that guy two rows and killed this man.

418
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.240
Finally when he scored like his 41st point,

419
00:25:03.241 --> 00:25:06.330
I think he turned around and looked at our bench or at the crowd and it was,

420
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.470
I didn't even make me upset.
It's just like,
yeah,
dude,
the,
you couldn't,

421
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:13.820
you couldn't cover the guy.
We had a,
we fucking had a,
Toronto was

422
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.060
<v 0>exactly,
we thought they were reflecting off the hook,</v>

423
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.690
<v 1>but that's a,
um,
that's,
that's,
you know,
that's where we're at.
We,</v>

424
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:26.180
we finally fucking beat everybody else except for the people we're going to run

425
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:28.340
into in the late rounds of the playoffs.
So,
uh,

426
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.420
it's looking like the Celtics game went around or maybe too,
who knows?

427
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:36.710
Depending on,
uh,
but you know,
that was to become the second seat in the east,

428
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:40.310
which would have been sweet.
Right?
Cause this number two play 70.

429
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.030
You know this,
did you just fall asleep?
No,
no,
no,
no bad.
No,
no,
no.

430
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.460
I feel you want to listen to me read out loud.
Bruins got the predators.

431
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.970
We beat the blues the other day.
They gonna put me to sleep.
Oh yeah.

432
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.923
<v 0>What,</v>

433
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.270
<v 1>what about when I'm watching your fucking you stupid reality show set.
Huh?</v>

434
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.270
I actually enjoy them.
Right?
I'm not fucking angry anymore.
India.
I try.

435
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:03.430
I'm trying to keep the anger going.

436
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.140
I don't have it anymore fucking meditating every day.

437
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:09.230
You know what's funny though is me being less angry is like freaking you out.

438
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.950
<v 0>It's not freaking me out.</v>

439
00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:15.190
I literally gave you props all yesterday when we after the doctor's appointment

440
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.680
and we sat there and we had a nice brunch and I told you how proud of

441
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.330
used to it used to unnerve me a little bit when you were calm because I just

442
00:26:30.331 --> 00:26:34.560
thought,
what is wrong with you?
I was plotting,
doing something to you.

443
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.453
Oh my God.

444
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.910
Our old friends here in Indochino Indo Chino is one of the largest to measure

445
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:50.250
<v 1>men's wear brands and nothing says I'm happy in my relationship.</v>

446
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.570
Like getting some men's wear.

447
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.740
Get a high quality suit made to your exact measurements.
That's the fucking Shit,

448
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:57.360
man.
When he got a job where you got to wear a suit,

449
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:00.090
you come home like Hugh Beaumont,
the beginning of leave it to beaver.

450
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.660
Bespoke means for a perfect fit.
Uh,

451
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:06.510
what's a spoke bespoke?
What does bespoke,

452
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.720
isn't that a suit that's made exact just for you like all of Conor Mcgregor's

453
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:16.050
suits.
All right guys.
Get some nice suits.
He Dell.

454
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.220
I'll tell you that guy at the only thing nicer than the way knock.

455
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.890
She has the fucking suits he wears.
All right.

456
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:23.520
You will dress like Conor Mcgregor one day.
I'm gonna make it happen.
Yeah,

457
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:25.740
and then you'll see exactly how many pounds I need to lose.

458
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.090
The thing about Conor Mcgregor's,
he's in fucking fucking championship shape.

459
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.520
Okay?
I'm at pull,
Lucas shape,
sweatpants and a hoodie.
All right?

460
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.700
You get to,
you get to customize your suit just the way you want it.

461
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.450
Here's how it works.
Visit a showroom,
our shop

462
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.140
<v 0>online at [inaudible] dot com</v>

463
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.300
<v 1>pick from hundreds of fabrics.</v>

464
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:51.010
Choose your cust customization from lapels to pleats to jacket linings and Mora.

465
00:27:51.011 --> 00:27:54.100
That's pretty cool.
You can make a fucking really loud suit or something classy.

466
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.030
Submit your body measurements.
Place you are.
Don't do that.

467
00:27:58.031 --> 00:28:01.090
Don't submit your fucking measurements over the over the Internet.

468
00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:03.850
Don't ever do it.
Do you think online banking is bad?

469
00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:05.920
You submit your body measurements over the Internet.

470
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.180
The fucking Illuminati starts making a robot to your exact specifications and

471
00:28:10.181 --> 00:28:13.600
all of a sudden,
you know,
everybody notices that you're acting weird.

472
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.610
You know you're kind of you,
but you're not you.

473
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.210
That's because the robot's showed up one day and you were like,
hey me,

474
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.850
what are you doing here?
And then it gives you all right there front of you,

475
00:28:21.851 --> 00:28:25.860
fucking,
you know,
chokes you out with your tie that you got from Indo Chad.

476
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.610
All right.
Submit your body measurements,

477
00:28:27.611 --> 00:28:32.050
place your order and wait for it to arrive.
And just four weeks this week,

478
00:28:32.051 --> 00:28:33.130

It's like China with an o.
It's like outstaying would say China.

486
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.650
I went to Chad.
Um,

487
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:10.180
incredible deal for a suit that will fit you better than anything off the rack.

488
00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:15.010
Ever could.
Alright.

00:29:15.011 --> 00:29:19.090
blue ball apron,
blue apron.
You know,
not all ingredients are created equal.

490
00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.530
No Jesus.
Who wrote this?

491
00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:24.130
That fucking guy Trump just appointed to a attorney general.

492
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.340
<v 0>You know,
not all ingredients are created equal.
Some of them are.</v>

493
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.200
God locks better.
You know,
they're just smarter.
You know that got better hair.

494
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:40.330
Oh they,
they,
they sunburn a little bit more my,
maybe they can't pants.
Okay,

495
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:41.164
I'll give you,

496
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.680
<v 1>maybe they're better do with Oh,
set shot through the jump shot.
All right.</v>

497
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:51.670
Fresh high quality ingredients make a real difference.
So important to know.

498
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.200
So it's important to know where your food comes from.

499
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.220
Talk about your personal experience with Blue Apron.
Oh Jesus.
You know,

500
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:59.950
I always wore white aprons.
Then I put on a blue one and you know,

501
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:04.120
I felt I felt a little cooler affordable for less than $10 per person,
per meal.

502
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.990
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with proportion degrees to make

503

delicious home cooked meals.
I have to tell you this guys,

504
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:11.950
if you want to fucking lose weight,
if you're working out,

505
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.860
the biggest goddamn thing,
especially become old like me,

506
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.490
is what the fuck you put into your body.
So one of the big pains in the ass,

507
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.410
it's going to the God damn grocery store.

508
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.530
Wouldn't it be wonderful if somebody just brought the shit that you fucking door

509
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:26.140
all measured out and you can just throw it together after you work out?

510
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.670
Wouldn't that be fucking perfect?
Wash the pounds,
go away.
Suddenly,
you know,

511
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.760
all of a sudden it's like you're going around the world looking over.

512
00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:36.430
All of a sudden you can finally see the head of your Dick again.
You know,

513
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.700
Oh my God,
you're like Christopher Columbus,
okay.

514
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.080
And you and you and your junk is the fucking West indies.

All right,
lift everybody.

522
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.890
L Y,
F,
T.
Lifed.
You know about Lyft,
right?

523
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.740
This is like when you're in eighth grade,
somebody brings up something,

524
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.520
you know something about sex.
You know what that means,
right?
You're like,
yeah.

525
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.880
What does it mean?
Um,

526
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.290
it's the APP that gets you arrived in minutes on demand 24,

527
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:35.050
seven for less than the cost of a cap.

528
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.970
Please include all of the following points during your read.
Of course,
I will.
Um,

529
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.490
oh,
you're back.
I'm back.

530
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.420
I was worried you went and just had a baby and see the bathroom.

531
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.500
If you try and lift,
you know what I mean?
With Lyft,

532
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:52.930
you just download the APP requested driver and they show up in three and a half

533
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.610
minutes on average
fucking sweating,
all coked up.

534
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.780
That's really fast.
Every driver delivers every,

535
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.890
every Lyft drivers fully vetted through their 10 point safety standard.
Yeah.

536
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.240
Unlike those other cuts,

537
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.590
once you got ahead and fucking hands and feet in a foot to step on the gas
pedal,

538
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.030
you got a job over there including criminal and DMV background checks.
You know,

539
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.200
you'll get around quickly and safety lift drivers are rated after every ride.

540
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.730
So only the best stick around.

541
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:25.420
You don't have to worry about getting into a filthy car with some creepy dude

542
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.730
like they do over there.
Um,
I kids say the name of them,

543
00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:34.590
but it rhymes with boober.
Justin boober
girl,

544
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.900
you know you're the one for me.

545
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:41.810
[inaudible] let's boy band shit right there with Lyft,
you can tip in the APP,

546
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.970
which obviously leads to happier drivers.

547
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.700
Nine out of 10 Lyft riders get a perfect five star rating.

548
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.690
That's because most people are too mean to give a 10 unlike rich like rex reed,

549
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:55.190
right?
No,
there too mean to not give a tip.
Sorry.

550
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.250
Some sort of Gong show shit just fell into my head.
Bigger isn't always better.

551
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:00.440
People lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

552
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:02.780
but it's the fastest growing in the highest rated one.

553
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.720
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift,

554
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.340
you got an easy way to avoid drunk driving.
You never have to bum a ride.

555
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.920

and relying on Lyft to get around.

558
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.720

Sorry.
And you know what?
I don't blame them.

559
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.360
Well,

570
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.310
How come they don't have the,

571
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:10.670

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:15.820
can you believe that I had an idea.
You,

573
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.200
Um,
I want to buy like a 1948

574
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.330
like Cadillac limousine.
Okay.
I have the whole,

575
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.440
just whenever that fucking have the interior looked nice,
however,

576
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:33.450
the outside of the car,
whatever.
Okay.
Then you get the powertrain,

577
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.680
the Sh air shocks.
I'll let shit,
gas monkey the whole fucking thing up.
Right.

578
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.670
And then I get a fucking,
I get a driver,
right?

579
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.270
So I never have to deal with la traffic again.
I just jump in the back.

580
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.080
I got a little fucking bar,
I've got a little humidors,

581
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.380
some cigars and then I got a little Wifi so I can get hammered,

582
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.230
smoke a cigar to some business calls.

583
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.530
And then anytime the as right around the city all day.
No,

584
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.600
anytime I want to go out cause out here,

585
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.790
the big thing with La is this no place to park.

586
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:05.420
Like you pull into a strip mall that has like 10 fucking businesses and they

587
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:09.560
have like,
you know 15 parking spots right.
And they tell the employees,

588
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:10.281
not the park there,

589
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.650
but you know they're going to park there and there's never any place to park.

590
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.640
Sure.
If this guy just pulled up lap way parkway it and I just got out,

591
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.830
then he fucking drove away.

592
00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:21.980
How much you think it would cost to have to have a driver?

593
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.640
Does the driver on calls?
They have a fucking driver.

594
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.690
Like I mean it just sits down the street like a creep.

595
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:34.580
Read the fucking newspaper.
I think there's a lot of holes in this fucking thing.

596
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:37.860
A few hundred bucks a day for sure.
Bullshit.

597
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:40.590
Nobody's going to sit here for fucking 24 hours for 200 bucks.
Yeah,

598
00:35:40.591 --> 00:35:43.740
they wouldn't.
Car Ass.
Yeah.
The other word,

599
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.970
you can definitely hire a private driver that's just on call for you.
You say,

600
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.000
Hey,
can you get here at 10 or whatever.
I got to go here,

601
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:53.190
here and here and just hang out until I need you again.

602
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.940
If you pay somebody enough,
they'll do it.
Why wouldn't I?
You know what?
He's,

603
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:57.930
I like driving too much,

604
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.140
but there's those times like whenever you go into a fucking game and all that,

605
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:06.120
I'm basically describing having my own lift,
you know?
Yeah.
Cause I don't like to,

606
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.490
cause now it's just one person who knows where I live.

607
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.450
Where are those other people?

608
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.510
They know where everybody knows where you fucking live and then they fucking

609
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:16.910
track you.
Yeah.
It's like Justin,
Uber Does Uber.

610
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.570
Those guys do that all the fucking time.
They start tracking you.

611
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.111
Then they listened,

612
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:24.930
they hack into your phone and they start listening to you eat corn,

613
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:29.160
beef hash looking at your rave drugs.

614
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.070
Ass Search.
Yeah.
Watching somebody take a straw,

615
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.010
blow cocaine up your ass as you're going like,
hey,
you know,

616
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:38.400
I don't feel any higher than us.
I guess it was really no reason to do that.

617
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.310
Let's just do it.
There are nasal passages like we did before.
Yeah.

618
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.590
That's like some jackass would've dug back in the day and they would all be

619
00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:48.750
laughing their fucking asses off.
That was the part of the movies.

620
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:49.950
I could never sure they've done it.

621
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.340
I could never like those parts of the movie where there was,

622
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.230
there was always those parts where they would just do something.

623
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.640
It's like a pubic hair sandwich or put that little toy car up his ass.

624
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.030
Do you think Steve?
Oh,
never had coke blown up his ass.
I mean,

625
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:06.210
I'm sure if that was this thing for like two weeks now.

626
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.540
I don't think he did that.
He's a very conventional person.
Okay.
The man,

627
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:13.260
when he steps away from the camera,
he's very conservative.
Right.

628
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.450
I've done stand up with them a couple times.
You fucking great guy said that.

629
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.530
You said he's like a really nice person.
Yeah.

630
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.750
With an incredible fucking like sense of humor.
Right.
Really,
really funny.

631
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:28.410
Fucking guy.
Um,
all right.

659
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.320
What did you think about that Nia?
Did you think it was historically accurate?

660
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.690
Was it something that data Dubay said

661
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.110
there was something that I wasn't surprised that she said
she's been a,

662
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:15.220
you know this,
she does this.
I wasn't mad in it.

663
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.530
I didn't,
I mean,
I don't think I took offense to deal.
Yeah,
I wasn't mad.

664
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:23.620
Aside from the usual thing of like,
oh good.

665
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.800
Someone who pretends to be somebody else is going to tell us how the world needs

666
00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:30.280
to be run.
All right.
You thought it was a little,
what's your favorite,

667
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.180
what's your new word that you learned?
Oh,
sanctimonious.

668
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:37.000
He thought it was a little sanctimonious.
I really don't know what that means.

669
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.260
Little holier than now.

670
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.550
I just stood there was always just cringe worthy moments when everyone from,
uh,

671
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.750
Margaret Moore who,
whatever his fucking name is,
Michael Moore,

672
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.350
Margaret [inaudible] and Meryl Streep and all these people.

673
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.970
You've got to be like guys,
you know,

674
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:57.710
we're living in a really dangerous time right now.

675
00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.990
I just really think it's really important for us all to hold each other and your

676
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.990
love ones a little bit closer.
Just that it's filler.

677
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:10.790
It's fucking filler.
It's just filler.
I just don't,
I don't,
I don't,

678
00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:14.690
I don't fucking buy it.
And then in the end you fucking attack bread and circus,

679
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.300
you know,
football and MMA.
Yeah.

680
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.170
Like we're all a bunch of movies and I like MMA.
Yeah.
How come?

681
00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:25.610
They have to be separate?
But,
um,
the majority of her message I thought,

682
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.160
I mean it is an art form,
Huh?

683
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.410
Defending yourself as an art form from debating Marshall are the way to that

684
00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:38.000
spinning kick the Oregon can do.
Um,
yeah.
Well,

685
00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.500
like I said,
this is,
this is,
you know,
Meryl and are there actors like her?

686
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:45.840
They have a platform and they feel passionate about it and so they speak on it

687
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.930
yet you give me one instance,
anything wrong with that?

688
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.020
Give me one fucking cause and I'll give you this speech right now off the top of

689
00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:54.950
my head with every fucking cliche and I would be called brave.

690
00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:58.270
If anybody gave a fuck about me,
could give me a topic.
Well,

691
00:40:58.271 --> 00:41:01.700
what do you care about?
No,
you,
that's not the point.

692
00:41:01.701 --> 00:41:03.710
The point is giving me something.
I don't even know anything about it.

693
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:07.370
I could still give the speech,
oh,
I'm saving the whales.

694
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.260
You know,
when you look at the earth from space,

695
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.600
which so few of us get the chance to do,

696
00:41:14.601 --> 00:41:17.510
like I did in this movie when I pretended to be an astronaut,

697
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.800
most of it is water.
And the biggest thing in the water are whales.

698
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.970
And like us,
they also communicate.

699
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.080
And just because we don't understand them,
let me finish.

700
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.670
Just because we don't understand

701
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.670
<v 0>them does not mean that they are not saying something and they do not deserve a</v>

702
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:43.490
voice that needs to be heard.

703
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.760
<v 1>And despite the current administration,</v>

704
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.990
<v 0>I,
Bobby,
continue fighting for these whales.</v>

705
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.490
<v 1>Thank you.
Sorry,
I kind of petered out,
but you don't want to be nice.</v>

706
00:42:00.491 --> 00:42:01.570
Still fucking did it.

707
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.680
I still did it and then maybe the next day it was so brave.

708
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.670
I loved his calm Bourbon.
You know,
he was glowing.

709
00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.880
He thanked his wife,
he thanked the whales,

710
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.630
he took a shiny thing and then he fucking,
you know,
I dunno.

711
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.670
Took a fucking stretch SUV Bernan low lead fucking gas into the fucking sunset,

712
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:28.060
right?
Yeah.
I just don't,
I don't,
I don't give a flying fuck.

713
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.920
I don't need a fucking lecture from an actor on what's going on.

714
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.410
<v 0>I didn't feel like a lecture.</v>

715
00:42:34.411 --> 00:42:37.440
It just felt like she was passionately talking about something that she felt

716
00:42:37.441 --> 00:42:38.100
strongly about.

717
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.540
<v 1>Then you know what if Hillary Clinton got in,</v>

718
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.230
who fucking blew the bankers in 2008 do you think she would have given a speech

719
00:42:43.231 --> 00:42:46.680
about that?
No.
How many people that they've crushed?

720
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.950
How many people are upside down in a fucking house right now?
No.

721
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.073
You wouldn't have given speeches.

722
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.540
Of course she wouldn't have wiped because she wears a blue bra and fucking Trump

723
00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:58.860
was fucking red underwear.
It's fucking stupid.
It's like,

724
00:42:58.861 --> 00:43:01.770
listen to the Yankees and red sox fans.
I don't know.
I'll be on it,

725
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.080
but this has been this podcast

726
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:09.280
<v 0>and I want you guys to know I don't feel that I'm any different than you.</v>

727
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.860
<v 1>I'm walking around right now.
I've got special.
Okay.</v>

728
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

729
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.190
<v 0>I'm just a person that decided to listen to themselves and I feel that that's</v>

730
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:25.220
what everybody needs to do and let's not put for teaching in the educational

731
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:25.910
system.

732
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.840
Do you not have something that you feel strongly about that you wouldn't maybe

733
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:31.820
use your platform to discuss?

734
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.000
<v 1>There's a bunch of Shit I feel strongly about,</v>

735
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:39.210
but I don't feel like I'm the fucking be all end all in my opinion.

736
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.550
<v 0>What did you do?
You don't have to be the be all end all,</v>

737
00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:45.840
but you have a podcast that you do twice a flight,
the flight gate,

738
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.460
so fucking passionate about that.

739
00:43:47.461 --> 00:43:52.461
So you have two times a week where you have a guaranteed audience of thousands

740
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.730
upon thousands of people listening to you something.

741
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:58.110
If I started going Meryl Streep Finish Times a fucking week,

742
00:43:58.111 --> 00:44:02.100
I would have no podcasts podcasting,
but no one would be,
listen,
let me finish.

743
00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.690
You're being rude and being rude.

744
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.243
<v 1>Fake News,
Fake News,</v>

745
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.970
<v 0>and you had a chance to talk about like,
Hey,</v>

746
00:44:10.971 --> 00:44:12.890
this is the thing that I really feel strongly about.

747
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:16.220
I feel like people should know.
I want to share.
You don't.

748
00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:17.780
You don't think that you should do that?

749
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:25.280
<v 1>No.
Oh,
okay.
Well there you go.
How dumb are people?</v>

750
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:27.920
They don't know what's important.
People know what's important.

751
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:29.690
People are not dumb.
I've traveled around people.

752
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:33.390
I guess I don't walk around people like,
Oh my God,
Bill,
talk slower.

753
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.940
I can't get my head around.
Your phone's.
Not that.

754
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.640
It's not about like patronizing people.
It's like,
Hey,

755
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.760
here's this thing that came up recently.
This is how I feel about it.

756
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:45.340
I feel strongly about it and here's why.
Maybe you feel this way too.

757
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.010
Maybe you didn't know about this issue.

758
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.320
Maybe this will maybe help you open up a little bit more about it.
Hey,

759
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:53.010
that's a great delivery.
Somebody ought to try that sometime.

760
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.600
Are you making fun of me?
No.
Meryl Streep was not delivering it that way,

761
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.520
right?
Well,
she was wagging her fucking finger.
She wasn't wagging.

762
00:45:02.521 --> 00:45:05.550
She was getting a lifetime achievement award and she got up there and

763
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:14.730
[inaudible].
What will you win for you in this year?
Nothing.
I like,

764
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.570
why is she gonna like they've given her every fucking trophy out there.

765
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.330
They've got to get another one.
Yeah,
she's Meryl Streep.
Listen,

766
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.230
she gets all the awards,
you know?
Okay,
okay.
Let me,

767
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.200
I'm not saying she should get the fucking awards,
but why can't you?

768
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:34.290
But why does it bother you so much that she gets up there and she talks about

769
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:36.330
what she's passionate about?
It doesn't bother me so much.

770
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.200
I'm just choosing to make fun of it.
Oh,
that's all.
Okay.

771
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:43.820
I find it just cringeworthy when I,
I don't fucking want to listen to,
uh,

772
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.690
you know,
Georgia Kennedy talked to me about the fucking ozone layer,
you know,

773
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:51.840
he just passed away.
You know what I mean?
Charles Bronson for your fucking,
well,

774
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:56.070
the thing is you're not being on award shows period.
I think they're silly.
Right.

775
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.080
And then the speed,
I understand why you have to do it.

776
00:45:58.081 --> 00:46:02.160
I think a lot of people that go to them go to them because you have to,

777
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.280
right.
Cause you have to,
cause what it is is you go in there like,
uh,
you know,

778
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.940
you got to support the project that you're in.

779
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:13.100
Like if that's the family gets fucking nominated for something,
I would go yeah,

780
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.980
when I go up there fucking stand up there or a deck of day with the area.

781
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.220
But I mean you gotta do it.
Yeah.
You have to do it cause that's,

782
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:24.000
that's part of the thing that you signed up for.
Uh,
it's,
you know,
if,

783
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.480
if it wins Shit,
the writing staff,

784
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.030
they make more money because then they get to be like,
oh wait,
you know,

785
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:33.120
I wrote on an Emmy Award winning show.
What are the fucking an SB,

786
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:37.140
whatever the fuck you get.
Right.
You have to play the fucking game.
Yes.

787
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.730
So just go up there.
It say thank you.
I appreciate it.

788
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.960
Take your shiny thing and take a fucking walk like this.

789
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.360
The thing I don't like Trump.
Okay.

790
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.500
I don't like the fucking shit he's doing.
I don't like the people he's picket,

791
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.620
but I don't need Meryl Streep's like once I sit there like,
oh wait a minute.

792
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.600
It's not like,
oh,
thank you Meryl Streep.

793
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:04.410
Thank you for squeegeeing my fucking third eye.
I know,

794
00:47:04.411 --> 00:47:05.760
I think it's say,
uh,

795
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.060
I think it's one of those things where you're famous too fucking long and you

796
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:12.360
just start thinking that was like everything that you're doing is a little more

797
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:15.750
important that it is.
You know what I mean?
I have to be honest with India,

798
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.960
like before I got into this business,
no one ever like,

799
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.940
I'm trying to think like a,
at least using that technique,

800
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.780
no one ever influenced me.
Like I like,
um,

801
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.130
there's people that influenced me like,
oh,

802
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:33.400
I want to listen to more of that music or uh,
oh wow,
there's,

803
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:37.420
there's a part of the world like that.
I'd like to see that.
But like,
you know,

804
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.001
I actually,

805
00:47:39.001 --> 00:47:42.130
I don't see how like somebody make it like a fucking three minutes speech is

806
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:44.770
going to have more of an impact than someone that you live your day to day with

807
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.810
or your parents [inaudible] you know,

808
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.580
that's like that gate that doctor Phil Shit.

809
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:51.070
Like when they solves problems and like to,
while we watch that shit.

810
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.880
<v 0>Oh right.
We watch doctor Phil too,
dude living in the truck.
Oh.</v>

811
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.690
And we have watched like judge Judy,
we had a whole like stay at home mom day.

812
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.860
<v 1>This dude,</v>

813
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.540
this dude was living in a truck with his kid and at night he was in during the

814
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.660
night,
he was in a shelter and they drove around in the truck and it was just,

815
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.850
<v 0>and it wouldn't scale with this two year old.</v>

816
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.180
I'm getting him like Gatorade and sodas and stuff,
and he goes,
you know what?

817
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.440
Sometimes the kid doesn't eat,

818
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.930
<v 1>but you know,
I always try to make sure,
you know,
I,</v>

819
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.800
I feed him when I can make sure he's got plenty of sugar and caffeine.
He said,

820
00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:20.890
yeah,

821
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.490
<v 0>yeah,
you did that.
That like,
that was a fuck.
Like,
that was good.
He doesn't get,</v>

822
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.940
he doesn't get them like bottles of water.
He gets some Gatorade and Coca Cola.

823
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.490
This is how much that kid look fine now.
And they never showed us say no.

824
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.350
That was the music thing.
It,
that was the music.
Oh,

825
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:39.610
he looked like a feral animal roaming around and we said he literally a cute

826
00:48:39.611 --> 00:48:42.940
little kid.
Yeah,
he did.
But he also looked like a little,
I don't know.

827
00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.700
<v 1>Kids are dirty,
not market.
I'm going to tell you something right now.</v>

828
00:48:46.701 --> 00:48:49.490
That kid's going to be able to figure out shit more than most of these Goddamn

829
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.540
millennials,
you know that sat there with their clean fucking fingernails.
Lice,

830
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:57.680
free heads in their fucking laptops.
Plates.
We heads.

831
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.050
All right,
I got to get on with my day here.
Um,
all right,
that's it.

832
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:07.870
<v 0>That's a podcast to the movie.
Let's all go to the lobby.</v>

833
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.760
Let's all go to the lobby.
Let's all go to the lobby and the gate.

834
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:15.730
What we did on the elliptical.
Alright,
go fuck yourselves.
Have a nice weekend.

835
00:49:15.731 --> 00:49:16.840
You can't tell.
Talk to you on Monday.

836
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.123
<v 6>Okay.</v>

837
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.980
[inaudible] the chin.
Awesome.

838
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.200
Eventually fading into

839
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.853
these

840
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.493
touch.
You

841
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.340
go to
Toc.

842
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:26.930
Stay Vama listing both for the thing carries every,

843
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.290
I invest in

844
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.070
that firm.

845
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.600
<v 7>The
Monday morning podcast,</v>

846
00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.460
and this is something I have to start off.

847
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:55.030
I gotta start right out of the gate talking about,
because someone had,

848
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.400
someone was bitching at me that they liked my page,
but they couldn't,

849
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.670
they couldn't shut off my podcast so they could watch the other videos.

850
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.660
If you are new to my page and you're listening to this podcast and you're

851
00:51:09.661 --> 00:51:12.600
already bored with it,
all you gotta do is just scroll down.

852
00:51:12.601 --> 00:51:16.020
It's right in the right hand side and there's a little x.
See this,
click on it.

853
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.150
You'll burn half a calorie donuts and then you can do whatever else you want to

854
00:51:21.151 --> 00:51:25.590
do on the site.
All right?
Okay,

855
00:51:25.591 --> 00:51:30.570
Bruce,
can you figure that out?
Um,

856
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:34.530
anyways,
what's going on?
How are you?
How was your week?

857
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.540
Do you have a nice week everybody?

858
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.070
I actually had a great fucking week.
I'll show you.
When people do that,

859
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.400
they ask you about something and they don't really give a fuck.

860
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.590
They just setting it up so they can talk about it.

861
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.570
It's like I knew I had an awesome week.

862
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.020
So rather than just coming out and being braggadocious,

863
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.100
if that's even a fucking word,
and just saying I had an awesome week,

864
00:51:56.101 --> 00:52:00.510
I had to actually act like I was a considerate human being and remotely gave a

865
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:04.800
fuck about what your week was like.
I had an awesome week.

866
00:52:04.801 --> 00:52:05.970
This is what I want to get to.

867
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.910
You don't want to and people do that and then you start to talk about your week

868
00:52:08.911 --> 00:52:11.430
and then they start doing that.
Nod that,
wrap it up.

869
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:14.840
That really hyper quick fucking chipmunk nod like Eh,

870
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.820
maybe a little circular motion with the left hand lane.

871
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:22.830
Let's get to the point so I can get on and just download all my shit on the your

872
00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:26.820
spirit.
All right.
Wow.
What an intro.

873
00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:28.740
That's not going to make me want to listen to this.
Anyways,

874
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.300
this is basically my awesome week.
I went to the Improv in Tampa,

875
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.853
Florida.

876
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.020
I have to say that just in case there's a city in Ohio also named Tampa cause I

877
00:52:40.021 --> 00:52:43.650
know they have Miami,
Ohio.
Just fucking hilarious.

878
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.630
Goddamn frozen state.
I live in West Palm Beach,
Florida.

879
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.280
No Ohio sit outside of Dayton.
Um,

880
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.050
yeah,
so I was,

881
00:52:55.170 --> 00:53:00.170
I cannot begin to tell you guys how much dread I was looking at my first two

882
00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:04.650
gigs of this year,
Tampa,
Florida and Houston,
Texas.

883
00:53:04.651 --> 00:53:09.300
Both cities I was looking at with dread.

884
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:12.900
I'm still looking at Houston with dread.
Why you ask?

885
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.660
Is it because you don't like Tampa bill?

886
00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:20.490
It is you got something against the oil makers in Houston?
No,

887
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.360
it's because the last time I went to both those towns combined,

888
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:29.240
I think one people came up to came out to see me,
you know,
and I'm to,

889
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:33.200
I'm not going to lie to you guys,
I'm an older fellow at this point and,
uh,

890
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.480
going on the road can be hard sometimes and if you don't believe me,

891
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.390
just talk to that Filipino who's singing for journey.

892
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:43.020
He's already bitching fucking little pussy.

893
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.630
You believe that guy fucking guy's singing karaoke in a third world country and

894
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:53.430
now he's playing the Goddamn fucking La Forum and he's complaining about how

895
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:58.260
lonely the road is
because he's been out there for fucking six weeks.

896
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.990
Jesus Christ.
You know,

897
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.820
I can't tell if that guy is just a whiny little cunt or fee or fees of fucking

898
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:09.360
maybe just knows who he is and he can actually step outside of this gun.

899
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:13.890
You know,
dude,
I really just wanted to fucking sing karaoke and uh,
you know,

900
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:18.330
singing with you guys was awesome and I'm over it because I know it really makes

901
00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:18.781
me happy.

902
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:23.781
My friends and my family and making little Bok Choy as I squat in my hut or

903
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.910
whatever the fuck it is that they do over there at typical American.

904
00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.060
But I don't know where you're from.
You know,

905
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.320
I think you squatting in a hut eaten Bok Choy.
I don't even know.

906
00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.820
Bought [inaudible] and I've had it.
I think it's Korean.
Is that Kimchi?

907
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.880
Um,
we'll have a fuck that guy.
You know what I mean?

908
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:45.570
Why can't he just be honest and just be like,
you know what?
Um,

909
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.220
I thought I liked journeys music when I was singing it once every other Tuesday

910
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:51.810
and um,

911
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:56.700
King Fung Woo's bar and grill in fucking the Philippines.

912
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.710
But uh,
you know,
singing it every night.
It's kind of fucking boring.

913
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.570
And I'm out here with a bunch of fucking geezers.
We're trying to recapture it.

914
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:08.220
Some other shit.
And one of them,

915
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.850
the guy on the keyboards are still wearing this tight pants and it's just

916
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:13.200
something I don't like seeing,

917
00:55:13.201 --> 00:55:17.760
but I don't have enough say in the band being as I'm a fucking contest winner.

918
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.850
Jesus Christ.
Can you imagine the awkwardness on the road?

919
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.390
Like this fucking guy that can,
cause,
you know,

920
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.620
they actually went through all the bullshit that band.
Okay.

921
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:33.300
They ate fucking spaghetti every God damn week,
whatever the fuck they did,

922
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.510
they lived in a van and they fuck in down by the river and they fucking made it.

923
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.290
You know,

924
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:44.610
they made it and then they got no big fight with Steve Perry because he thought

925
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:49.590
he could go on his own making oh,
Sherry and some other forgettable sappy shit.

926
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:54.120
And uh,
you know,
lawsuits all that behind the music shit.

927
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.870
And now they're back on tour again and they just fucking plucked this guy,

928
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.860
you know,
up out of a tsunami.
And now he's playing the,

929
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.130
and I just don't understand how,
how do you fucking bond?

930
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:11.010
You know what I mean?
That'd be like me.
Last time I played quarterback,

931
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:16.430
I think was just fucking some pickup game in eighth grade and all of a sudden

932
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.820
I'm fucking,
you know,
I show up in week,
week 15

933
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.750
for the Baltimore Ravens that are not,
you know what though?
You made the point,

934
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.270
why don't you get back to you a great week.
Hey,

935
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:31.160
why don't I own up to the fact that I told you guys last week that my,

936
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:36.100
the Carolina Panthers were my dark horse and I believed in Jake the loan and

937
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:37.330
what happens like jinxed him?

938
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.310
You heard of the sports illustrated jinx as a new genx and town and you fucking

939
00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:46.750
listening to it.
So my apologies to everybody in Carolina.
Um,

940
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.340
in my mind I'm going to Carolina.
All right,

941
00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:54.760
let me get back to my awesome week 20 ways.
Yeah.
Last time I went to Tampa,

942
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:59.590
nobody fucking showed up.
And uh,
and it was really disheartening because,

943
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:00.820
uh,

944
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.790
I think at that point my HBO special was out and that type of thing and that's

945
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:07.570
when it really just hit me how fucking hard this business is.

946
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.280
And I was really like,
wow,
man,
what the fuck do I have to do?

947
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.810
So I went to Tampa and what happened?

948
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:21.310
I showed up and a bunch of fucking people showed up and they will great crowds

949
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:25.600
and I got like,
you know,
a couple,
two or three partial standing ovations.

950
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:28.080
I was killing it.
I was having a great time after my nuts.

951
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.360
Nice month of rest and relaxation.

952
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:36.550
A bunch of fan as bitches came out to the club baby.
Um,

953
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.320
not a lot of good looking brothers down there and uh,

954
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.540
and I'd probably drank too much fucking two or three nights

955
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.600
was a good time.
Went on.

956
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:51.370
That Guy Kyle had show if anybody from that show was listening,
um,

957
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.520
tell him I said thank you.
So fucking great show.

958
00:57:54.521 --> 00:57:56.920
I'm going to listen to how cool this is,
how great the whole week was.

959
00:57:56.921 --> 00:57:59.860
I went in to cow head show right off the bat.

960
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.110
That guy's totally cool right off the bat.

961
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.560
He knows how to give a great interview.
I don't have to do material,

962
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:08.920
which is vitamin,
everything's flowing.
And then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

963
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.530
a guy,
one of my buddies from high school,

964
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:16.030
when I had season tickets to the patriots in 1989 when they sucked and we used

965
00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:20.080
to all pile in the back of his landscaping truck with the half keg of fucking

966
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:24.580
beer and a bag of chips.
He fucking calls up,

967
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:26.980
find out he's living down there.
Next thing you know,

968
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:31.780
we're on the radio together talking about Shit we did 20 years ago and if that

969
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:35.920
wasn't cool enough to and an electronic drum kit there and they came out of the

970
00:58:35.921 --> 00:58:39.490
radio break playing the immigrant song and I was on the drums playing fight.

971
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:41.590
This let's fucking having this total geek moment.

972
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:44.620
And then I went down to the club and it was fucking,
you know,

973
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.820
I'm not going to say it's packed,
but I got into the upper deck,
you know,

974
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.410
just picture a uh,

975
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:57.070
just picture and Atlanta Braves game when they finally make it to the fucking,

976
00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:01.090
the,
the NLCS.
That's how full the club.

977
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.550
It's about three quarters full.
Fuck you guys.
I was happy with that.

978
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.020
I thought there was,
I mean nobody down there.

979
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:10.870
So I want to thank everybody down there.
So Houston,

980
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.330
you've got to come through for me.
Okay.

981
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.590
Want to go up and I play that Improv that's underneath that overpass and that

982
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:20.200
strip mall where evidently there's a lot of violence.

983
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.760
Who the fuck did the research on that one
anyways?

984
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.380
I have.
So like when you walk into that one,
how it looks like scuff faces,
lobby.

985
00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:36.500
It's just a fucking,
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

986
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.200
why am I shitting on a club then?
I'm going to,
no,
it's a great time.

987
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:42.280
It's a great part of town.
And,
uh,
all I know is I got,

988
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.190
I finally got my new wow together and I'm really happy and it's,
it's really,

989
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:49.270
it's,
it's a if things are going good,
so just fucking come out all right.

990
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:52.160
For the love of God.
But either way,
even if it sucks,

991
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:55.940
I'm going to south park guitars,
so I'll still have a good time,
man.

992
00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:59.360
I'm going to go skating at your fucking mall because I'm,

993
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.910
let's say like,
right.

994
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:04.610
So let's get into the podcast here.

995
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:07.430
So I have hiked what I have coming up.

996
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:11.330
I'm going to be at the Improv in Houston and a,

997
01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.390
these are the dates,
uh,

998
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.200
22nd 23rd and 24th.
Go to Improv too.

999
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:22.970
Dot Com for all information.
And I'll be selling my brand new DVD.

1000
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:26.870
I'll be standing there like a fucking jackass in the end cause I have no pride.

1001
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:32.710
Um,
actually I decided something,
um,
that,
you know,
cause there's,

1002
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:33.890
there's a lot of guys who like,
you know,

1003
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:37.370
once they get past a certain level they don't want to stand there selling

1004
01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:40.790
merchandise at the end of this show.
Um,

1005
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:44.570
cause you feel like an idiot sometimes.
And um,

1006
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:48.790
I got to admit I don't,
I actually liked kind of meeting people at shows.

1007
01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:53.810
Lungs are not drunk morons slapping me too hard in the back and spitting on me

1008
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.540
inadvertently.
I don't mind that shit,

1009
01:00:56.541 --> 01:01:00.230
but this is something that I'm not doing anymore or at least I want to say I'm

1010
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:02.570
not going to,
um,
who's kidding,

1011
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:05.780
who I'm going to do it because there's nothing worse than bringing DVDs home and

1012
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:08.870
your luggage,
you fucking bag weighs like 80 pounds.

1013
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:13.871
But like I hate when I work at club where I have two shows and however the crowd

1014
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:16.694
walks in,

1015
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.230
there's not enough room to have the next crowd stand there and have the other

1016
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.513
cloud walk out.

1017
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:27.230
So they send the first crowd out the side door and if you want to sell your

1018
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:30.560
merge,
you're literally standing outside the club.

1019
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.570
And I cannot begin to tell you how much of a fucking Moron

1020
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.070
I see it in people's eyes too.
When they see me,
like I was doing,

1021
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:45.071
like I was standing outside the Improv in Tampa and they have like,

1022
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.330
it's one of those,
you know,
as deals,
they've got like a sports bar,

1023
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.220
a movie theater.
It's all like this one little,

1024
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:56.330
they can take an outdoor mall and I'm literally standing there and people are

1025
01:01:56.331 --> 01:01:59.930
going,
excuse me,
excuse me,
people who don't give a fuck about the show,

1026
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.790
who have no idea who I am and an audience members who like give a shit,

1027
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:09.791
who I am really see where I am in this business in that moment is some plumber

1028
01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:12.830
just goes,
hey,
uh,
a pasty,

1029
01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:17.690
why don't you get the fuck out of their way so I can go see a,
well,

1030
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:22.020
you know,
oh my God,
what Benjamin,
this is going to be a disjointed podcast.

1031
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.120
I don't give a fuck,
right?
I'm on some new diet.

1032
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.050
I fucking just had eight egg whites.

1033
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.370
I'm never doing that again man.
It's just fucking brutal.

1034
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.270
I saw that movie Benjamin Buttons.
Bill.
Can you stick with the subject?
Yeah.

1035
01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:38.071
So that's what I'm saying.

1036
01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:42.510
I don't want to fucking stand outside of club and do that shit anymore.
Okay.

1037
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:45.360
I'll stand in the club and there's a table,
you know,

1038
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.270
I leave and make the change.
I don't give a shit,

1039
01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:49.800
but I think I'm going to draw the line at,

1040
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:54.801
I'm not going to stand outside of venue dealing with the elements and people on

1041
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:59.610
their way to a fucking Applebee's as I try to Hawk my merchandise because,
uh,

1042
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:04.050
I gotta admit I felt,
I felt,
uh,
they'll pretty a pretty pathetic,

1043
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.550
pretty fucking pathetic.
So,
um,
anyways,
let's,
let's get on.

1044
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:12.930
Let's get on with the podcast here and remind me to talk about led Zeppelin

1045
01:03:12.931 --> 01:03:16.290
later.
I Dunno,
how are you going to do that?
So I might as well talk about it now.

1046
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.320
I'm pretty devastated because I fucking loved that group and I had heard rumors

1047
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.180
and I kinda knew they had a couple of blues songs that they reworked in air

1048
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:32.181
quotes and they didn't quite give people credit for it.

1049
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:33.360
And,
uh,

1050
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:37.470
evidently it goes way beyond that and there's some stuff on youtube.

1051
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:41.310
I'm always looking at led Zepplin shit cause I'm a huge John Bonam fan and

1052
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:44.970
somehow I stumbled across this thing cause I guess the Youtube Guy was just on

1053
01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:49.710
Howard stern so there was a lot of shit on them or bought them stealing

1054
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:53.940
material.
And uh,
all I can say is wow,

1055
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.650
it went beyond a couple of songs.
It went into,

1056
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.240
I mean every song but two songs and their first album,

1057
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.250
half the songs on their second album,

1058
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:10.490
they're even trying to say that they ripped off the intro to stairway to heaven.

1059
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:15.510
They had like an opening act on tour with them.
I just,
I dunno,

1060
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.210
I don't know how to process it.
And not only that,
I just brought my,

1061
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:23.450
bought my nephew the fucking box set the entire digitally remixed remastered box

1062
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.210
set of led Zepplin for Christmas.
You know,

1063
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:33.030
thinking I'm the cool uncle and I just gave him a,
uh,

1064
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:38.250
a box of stolen shit that's just fucking brutal.

1065
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:44.070
Check out that Jeff Beck album truth.
I just downloaded it.
How many more times?

1066
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:47.490
He literally takes a section straight up from the guy,

1067
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.360
but you know,
I think that's on those other guys.
They should've just fun.

1068
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:53.100
You know,
you know what it is.
You can't do anything.

1069
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.660
It's nothing you can do about it.

1070
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:57.810
They fucking steel and they get credit and they get taken into the hall of fame

1071
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.440
is fucking brutal.
All right.
That was a bummer.
All right.

1072
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:04.260
Did I just say a bummer but actually kind of work cause I was talking about

1073
01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:07.800
music from the 60s that was a bummer man.
What a drag.

1074
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.440
Um,
all right.
Anyways,

1075
01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:15.030
so last week I got up on my soapbox a little bit or my Ottoman,

1076
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.500
if you want to get technical.
And

1077
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.470
I was talking about last week how I'm sick of going into these places of

1078
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:26.980
business and with this new technology,

1079
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:32.180
they're firing fellow Americans and they're making me do the,

1080
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:37.480
the fired employee's job.
And to me that is not progress.
All right?

1081
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:42.340
That is a adding another person out there who's going to be competing for me for

1082
01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:45.100
a job while I do their fucking job for free.

1083
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.770
So I asked people what they thought about that shit.

1084
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.970
You know what I'm talking to specifically about going into a grocery store and

1085
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:55.270
they want me to check myself out.
Okay.

1086
01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:58.570
As if I'm somehow going to do it faster than a cashier.

1087
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.930
That seems to be the illusion here that that makes it faster.

1088
01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:03.431
You know what I mean?

1089
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:07.780
Somebody who actually works there and does it 9,000 times a day so they can only

1090
01:06:07.781 --> 01:06:11.530
have to look at the fucking keyboard.
Goddamn Stevie wonder,

1091
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:13.060
fucking blowing through it,
you know?

1092
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.450
And somehow I'm going to be quicker than that,
you know?
So anyways,

1093
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:21.220
I asked people what they thought about it and uh,
I got interesting.

1094
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.120
I got to,
you know,

1095
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:26.140
basically I took two of them that kind of summed up everybody's shit.

1096
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.910
And then I switched up some of the guitar parts and I called it stairway to

1097
01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:34.120
heaven.
No,
wait a minute.
All right.
Um,
somebody said,
I agree with you.

1098
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:39.190
New Technologies often make certain jobs obsolete,
but they also create new ones.

1099
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.113
And this case.

1100
01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.810
I don't think there are enough low level jobs out there to start getting rid of

1101
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:48.650
cashiers.
Um,
yeah,
I definitely agree with you.
I,

1102
01:06:48.651 --> 01:06:52.930
I don't feel like
they're making you,

1103
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.720
you're walking into the grocery stores,
the customer,

1104
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.650
they're making you be a cashier for free and everyone's sitting there going,
oh,

1105
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:01.760
it's quicker.
This is what this guy is,

1106
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.060
this guy saying this guy's trying to go bill.

1107
01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:06.370
As far as the self checkout line and grocery store,

1108
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.980
I can't agree with your take on the situation.

1109
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.220
Any place I have seen with self checkout lines still have regular lines as well.

1110
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.450
Can you believe that point?

1111
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.280
Any place I've seen with self checkout lines still have the regular lines as

1112
01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:22.114
well.

1113
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:26.590
Obviously they're just not overnight going to get rid of everybody.

1114
01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.820
They're teaching you how to be a cashier for free and once we all get it down,

1115
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:37.420
eventually they're going to get rid of everybody the same way they're doing it

1116
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:42.070
with like those toes,
those easy tasks,
things that you know,

1117
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.310
never.
There was only one easy pass line.
Now it's down.

1118
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.340
There's only one toll booth line.
And sometimes you get off the exit.

1119
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:51.760
There's no toll booth.
You just bet I have the fucking right amount of change.

1120
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:53.410
You know?

1121
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.470
I guess that does make it easier but also let them know where the fuck are you

1122
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.860
are.
Which annoys the shit on me but I wasn't bitching about that dude.

1123
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.360
The only reason why 10 out of 10 lines are not automated is because it's a new

1124
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:08.230
technology and that's why they have the douche standing there teaching you how

1125
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:09.064
to fucking use.

1126
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:14.200
They teaching you how to be a cashier so they can fire other cashiers and then

1127
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:17.930
they don't have to pay and you as the customer who used to just come up with

1128
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:20.810
your food and stand there and rubbed your fucking balls looking around.

1129
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.840
I mean don't you understand the arrogance of that?
Hey,

1130
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:26.000
why don't you come into my store,
pick up what you want.

1131
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:30.650
You figure out what the fuck you all me pay me stick you stick it in the bag and

1132
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:31.970
then get the fuck out of my store.

1133
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:37.460
You'll find a problem with that.
Anyways,
this guy continues to say,

1134
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.640
I don't think anyone is losing any jobs or that grocery stores are going to turn

1135
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:47.240
into self serving only venues.
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to stand in La.

1136
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:51.050
I'm not going to stand in line behind the soccer mom who's buying enough

1137
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.790
groceries to last the entire winter.
Meanwhile,
all I got is a box of cereal,

1138
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.840
cereal and milk,

1139
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.090
and now I have to tell myself I'm doing a good thing for the workforce by Resu

1140
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.990
refusing to serve myself and the self checkout line.
Not In this lifetime.

1141
01:09:05.991 --> 01:09:10.100
My fine feathered friend,
he really thought he made a great point there.

1142
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.820
What do you know what?
I think you're a retard.
What do you think about that?

1143
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.100
Who stands in line in front of behind somebody who's got enough fucking

1144
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:22.340
groceries for the winter when all you have is a box of cereal and milk?

1145
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:25.880
Have you ever heard the express checkout eight items or less?

1146
01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:31.160
Have you never noticed that?
I don't.
You know what,

1147
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.850
that,
that uh,
that is fucking pissed.
That whole thing just piss me off.

1148
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:36.100
You know what get is great dude.
Yeah.

1149
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.950
Stand in line and go do a job you didn't have to do before and do it for free

1150
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:43.130
and put somebody outside of work and tell yourself that it's fucking quicker.

1151
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:46.880
The same way they're doing that on TV where they got that commercial and they

1152
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.380
try to mind fuck you into thinking that using your ATM card is quicker than

1153
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:54.590
using cash.
You know?

1154
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:58.100
Come on man,
you should fucking head.
You know what they're doing?

1155
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:01.490
They're phasing out cash,
so now there's no more under the table.

1156
01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:05.630
Bullshit out there and you're going to get taxed even fucking more,

1157
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:11.050
and they'll know where you are at all fucking times.
That's what they're doing.

1158
01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.290
All right.
Debit cards are not quicker than cash,

1159
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.970
and I love the commercial that they have.

1160
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:18.560
I don't know if they're still running it,

1161
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.910
but they literally used homophobia to try to convince you.

1162
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.620
You know,
they,
they,
they put into that part of your brain,
Hey,

1163
01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:31.070
I'm not sucking Dick.
I'm going to use the fucking debit card.

1164
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.510
They basically had this commercial,

1165
01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:35.810
they had a bunch of people buying a Steelers jerseys.

1166
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.890
I remember they're all buying football jerseys and they'd go in through the line

1167
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.150
and everybody's using a debit card and that plane,
that bugs bunny music,
Dun,

1168
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:46.580
Dun Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh.

1169
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.470
And everything's going great and it's,

1170
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.400
and people are swiping at once and they just grabbing the bag and the whole

1171
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:55.700
transaction takes literally two seconds.
Okay.

1172
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.560
Which has not been my experience ever.

1173
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.070
The Guy fucking tries to put the password and it doesn't fucking work.

1174
01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:04.550
They swipe it three times in.
The cashier finally spins the thing around,

1175
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:09.110
tries to do it themselves.
It's a big fucking pain in the ass.
So anyways,

1176
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.800
after all these guys cruise through,
then this,
you know,
buying football,

1177
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:18.530
this fucking guy comes up to buy tennis balls with a pink sweater tied around

1178
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.360
his neck and he's piece paying cash.
And the second he takes out the cash,

1179
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.231
you know that,

1180
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:28.340
that music just comes to a dead halt and everybody's staring at him.

1181
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:34.200
Get it.
You know,
football men,
tennis,

1182
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.890
pink sweater,
Fag.
I just fucking unreal.
I don't know.
You know,

1183
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.940
fuck this shit.
I'm just going to go live in the fucking mountains.

1184
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:43.290
I'm tired of trying to convince people.

1185
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.410
I had this stupid girl in the front row as explaining the whole fucking thing to

1186
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.244
her and she's like,

1187
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.060
still told me that the thing that she was going to use the automated checkout at

1188
01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:55.410
the cashier at the,
at the grocery store,
cause I go,
why?
She goes Congress cluck.

1189
01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.270
How?
How has it,
how has it quicker,
you know,

1190
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:01.890
you could teach me how to change your fucking tire.

1191
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.410
I'm not going to do a quick and then I'm fucking mechanic or change my oil or

1192
01:12:06.411 --> 01:12:09.660
what I don't fucking that,
whatever,
whatever,
whatever.

1193
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:13.970
Standing those fucking lines.
You've fucking drones.
Oh,

1194
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:16.410
see all childish.
I get when people have a different opinion.

1195
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.920
This is why can't sustain a relationship.
Okay,
let's get,

1196
01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.990
let's get to the question.
You know,
it really is,

1197
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I'm just fucking annoyed that I found out that one of the groups that I loved

1198
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:32.060
has stolen all this goddamn music
I to do it.

1199
01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.940
It just,
you know,
it's funny about led Zepplin too,
is they always had that,

1200
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.670
that cheesy shit where they would just like trying to say that they all sold

1201
01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:39.780
their soul to the devil.

1202
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:43.200
Everybody sold their soul to the devil except for John Paul Jones.

1203
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:48.180
And that's why all the,
that horrific shit happened.
Like John Bonam died.

1204
01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:53.040
Robert Plant got in the car accident and his kid died mysteriously and,
uh,

1205
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.490
Jimmy page,
I don't know.
He fucking,

1206
01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.150
his eyes got all squinty.
I Dunno what the fuck what am to Jimmy page?

1207
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.570
He didn't lose a finger.
That was a guy from black sabbath.

1208
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.430
Bam did Jimmy page.
He had a castle.
I don't know if somebody,

1209
01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.760
I'm gonna Jimmy page some.
I haven't bad to everybody,
but you know,

1210
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:14.280
the reason it wasn't because they sold the soul,

1211
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.860
it was calmer for stealing all those fucking songs

1212
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:23.970
then inducted into the hall of fame.
All right.
Whatever.
Okay.

1213
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:27.150
Anyways,
you know what?
I should've been more mature about that.

1214
01:13:27.151 --> 01:13:29.670
Some people don't fucking agree with me on those,
uh,

1215
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:35.850
those automated lines.
I just,
I know I can me,
it's clear as fucking day.

1216
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:37.980
It's clear as fucking day.

1217
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.930
You know I'm not a hundred percent against you like it when I go to the airport.

1218
01:13:42.931 --> 01:13:44.940
Sometimes that automated shit is quicker.

1219
01:13:44.941 --> 01:13:47.910
Like when you go to check yourself in for a flight,
that's definitely,

1220
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.830
definitely fucking quicker.

1221
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.090
But when I get on the plane and they started telling me I need to fold up my

1222
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:57.810
blanket to help expedite the cleaning of the cabin,
go fuck yourself.

1223
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:01.890
All right.
That's for the cleaning crew.
I'm sorry they fired the cleaning crew.

1224
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:05.670
I'm not doing that fucking job.
I did my job.
I got on the plane.

1225
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.820
I said a prayer on takeoff and landing that we wouldn't crash.

1226
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:12.550
I didn't try to open the emergency door or charge the cockpit.
I'm done.

1227
01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:16.480
You know I'm not taking out a fucking lip brush and a crumb bar and cleaning up

1228
01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:20.830
my fucking area.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I don't work for the airline.

1229
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.430
And we go,
Hey,
and I'm getting a new laptop this week,

1230
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:27.460
so this is the last time you're going to hear that fucking annoying clicking

1231
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:30.970
sound.
I'm trying to do it smoother.
All right,

1232
01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:33.340
let's get to the podcast questions for the weekend.
I got to tell you guys,

1233
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:36.430
this is going to be a short podcast this week because,
uh,

1234
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.540
I have a ton of shit to do.
Um,

1235
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.220
why can't I just be nicer?
Um,
I appreciate you guys all listening to my podcast,

1236
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:49.150
but I got through.
I have to go back into there.
The 700 club guy,
you know,

1237
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:53.380
put your hands on your laptop screen.
Let's say praying for cheese.
Um,
no,

1238
01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:56.350
I appreciate all you guys listening and all that type of stuff and uh,

1239
01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.920
it can be blown through it.
Why can't you have a sensitive moment,
Bill?

1240
01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:04.750
Why can't you open up?
Okay.
Take a deep breath.
Let it out.

1241
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.610
I appreciate the fact that all you guys listen to my podcasts,

1242
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:13.660
but a,
I have a lot of,
um,
things that I have to get done today.

1243
01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:17.230
I can't fucking do it.
I got a lot of shit to do.
All right,
question number one.

1244
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:21.820
Uh,
Bill,
you often talk on the cast of how people shouldn't work.

1245
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:24.550
Certain jobs that help the man

1246
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.150
fucked in.
Fuck the common folk.

1247
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:32.830
One of my jobs I currently work cause I'm broke is essentially telemarketing.

1248
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.290
And I go home from it feeling dirty.

1249
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:38.490
But who's fault is it really mine or the dopes?

1250
01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:43.510
I'm fucking and where exactly do draw the line of what jobs to not work

1251
01:15:43.511 --> 01:15:48.490
according to your personal standards.
All right.
Uh,
telemarketing.

1252
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:52.840
I mean,
that's not making me do a job.

1253
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:57.940
So I mean,
as,
as annoying as it is.
You can,
you can sign yourself up for that.

1254
01:15:57.941 --> 01:16:02.050
Don't call list on the Internet if you guys want to look that up.

1255
01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:06.790
I did that and nobody ever fucking calls me.
And uh,
um,
but I mean,

1256
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.000
I don't know what you'd telemarketing.
You say you go home feeling dirty.

1257
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:13.780
I'd have to know what it is that you do because you're like,

1258
01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:18.490
I feel really guilty,
but who's fault is it?
Mine or the dopes?

1259
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.470
I'm fucking so obviously,

1260
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.550
whatever you're selling them is bullshit and you know,
it's bullshit,

1261
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.250
but you're telling them that it's,
it's great shit.
So,
uh,

1262
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.930
who's fault is that?
A,
that's yours.
I'm going to say that's yours.

1263
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:39.850
You know,
you know,
do you know what's yours?

1264
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:43.930
You go home feeling dirty.
Yeah.
Obviously doing some shit you don't want to do.

1265
01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:46.390
But I understand any port in a storm,

1266
01:16:46.391 --> 01:16:50.740
I don't know if he's selling people sham wows like morons like me and I buy the

1267
01:16:50.741 --> 01:16:53.320
fucking things,
you know,
you're not really hurting.

1268
01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:55.750
I don't know what the fuck I'd have to know what you're selling.
You know,

1269
01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:59.410
if it's selling those fucking mortgages that screwed over this economy,

1270
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.860
then you should feel dirty.
But uh,
I dunno,
I don't fucking know.

1271
01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.291
I'm trying to think.

1272
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:09.080
You know something I used to tell the market so I can't judge you.

1273
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:10.930
I used to sell newspapers,

1274
01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:14.390
subscriptions over the phone and you know,

1275
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:16.610
when you're just doing that sort of cold calling,

1276
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:19.790
the only weapon you have is to lie your ass off.

1277
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:24.320
And the only way I got through it was trying to make the guy next to me laugh.

1278
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.080
I used to go by Bill Macdonald and uh,

1279
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.300
the other guy,
what the fuck did he get?

1280
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.490
One of the guys I worked with actually went by the name Keith Crowder,

1281
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:38.840
who was the name of one of the guys who actually played on the Boston Bruins and

1282
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:39.950
we were in Boston.

1283
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:46.040
He used to call people up,
hey,
how you doing?

1284
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:49.580
This is Keith crowd or calm from the Boston globe.
And people would just,

1285
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:53.120
every once in a while so it'd be like,
oh yeah,
Keith Crowder.
They'd be like,

1286
01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:53.954
Oh yeah,

1287
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.160
you play for the Bruins and [inaudible] view the guy that's my cousin.

1288
01:17:58.161 --> 01:18:02.090
Or he would just say that,
oh yeah,
I get that all the time.
You know what I mean?

1289
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:06.380
Like if your name was actually Barry Manilow or some shit,
um,

1290
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:09.680
I don't know,
Dude.
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

1291
01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:11.640
I would just try to get out of that fucking job.
But dude,

1292
01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.300
if he can't get out of that job,
I mean,
w what do you,
what are you going to do?

1293
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.710
And all depends on what you're doing,
dude.
50 if it's,

1294
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:22.840
if it's stealing from old ladies and taken that their life savings and uh,

1295
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:24.230
you know,

1296
01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:27.380
I had a buddy of mine was doing something like that and he ended up in jail.

1297
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:31.790
So you better watch out whatever you're doing.
Um,
you know what?

1298
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:36.090
I'm really feeling like I'm fucking getting preachy and righteous here.
Um,
you,

1299
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:39.830
I a,
I don't know shit.
Just know that I don't read,
you know,

1300
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.770
even all that shit I just said about led Zeppelin,
actually,
you know what,

1301
01:18:42.771 --> 01:18:46.610
that wasn't just youtube shit I watched on youtube and this kid had the music to

1302
01:18:46.611 --> 01:18:49.850
back it up.
So,
but anything else is a,

1303
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:53.780
that comes in on our mouse mostly is bullshit.
All right,
question number two.
Uh,

1304
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:58.160
Bill,
is there any way to get links to the individual podcast?
I try to subscribe,

1305
01:18:58.161 --> 01:18:59.300
but I don't think it worked.

1306
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.390
I'm not really as retarded as a computer makes me look.

1307
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:05.030
I could not identify with you more.

1308
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.440
That's exactly what happens to me every time I tried to watch or listen to

1309
01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:13.130
anything on the,
on the computer and I have no idea.
I don't know how to help you.

1310
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:19.290
I really don't.
Um,
I'm like,
I dunno.
I'm like,

1311
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:23.570
what the fuck is that,
that that holiday in commercial,
you know,

1312
01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:25.610
now I don't know.
I don't know computers,

1313
01:19:25.611 --> 01:19:28.610
but I stayed at a Holiday Inn last night and Holiday Inn express or whatever the

1314
01:19:28.611 --> 01:19:31.160
fuck it is.
That's how I am.
You know,
I'm on the computer,

1315
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.650
I know how to put up a podcast,

1316
01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:36.040
but I don't know how to do any of that other stuff.
So anyways,

1317
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:40.100
listening has this information and what's the email or to certainly I read it

1318
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:43.790
next week and I'll pass it off as my own.
Just like Jimmy page.

1319
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.010
Squinty eye contact.
All right.
Question number three,
Bill.

1320
01:19:49.011 --> 01:19:53.360
You must get a ton of podcasts,
questions and overrated,
underrated stuff.

1321
01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.900
How do you decide which ones to use in your podcasts?
Um,

1322
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.830
I basically any anytime somebody,
if it's a repeat question,

1323
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.020
um,
like I,
I try to ignore those,

1324
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.370
but once every six I will answer the question,

1325
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:12.360
how did you get involved in stand up?
But,
um,
and then just,
yeah,

1326
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.201
they're good questions.

1327
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:15.690
I feel like I can go off on them and they have funny than that.

1328
01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:18.900
That's basically how I do it.
But if it's a slow week,

1329
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:21.930
I'll read every goddamn one of them cause I don't get a ton of them.

1330
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:25.950
I get like a dozen or so,
so a,
so if you have a question,
are you thinking like,

1331
01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.970
Oh man,
he's saying that really need in chances are,
I will read it.

1332
01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.030
You got an 80% chance.
How about that?
80% chance.

1333
01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:37.530
And that's based on not even mathematically studying it on any level.
All right,

1334
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:42.090
question number four,
Bill.
Have you ever seen two guys start comparing scars?

1335
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:46.830
Are these two guys just a bunch of tools of what?
Usually by the end,

1336
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.600
one or the other has pulled up his shirt and pulled down his pants.

1337
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:56.740
What a bunch of fags.
I got to admit,
I've never seen that.
Uh,

1338
01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:00.810
do you hang out in a pirate bar?
I have no idea.

1339
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:07.170
That would be weird.
I,
yeah,
that's kind of awkward.

1340
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:13.110
Uh,
reminds me of a,
that,
that,
that scene in jaws where they just sit around a,

1341
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:17.700
yeah.
This right here.
Fucking
electric eels at me.

1342
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:21.750
Oh yeah.
This a sting ray stuck me in the nuts,
whatever.

1343
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:26.880
Now I've never seen that,
but I'm,
I the way the picture you painted,

1344
01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:31.260
I'd have to agree with your assessment.
You've got to say something like,

1345
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:35.420
why don't you two fucking hacked up pussies?
Pull up your pants please.

1346
01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.810
For the love of good.
Anyways,

1347
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.460
you know what I resent seeing?

1348
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:46.461
I resent seeing a middle aged man who has a smooth chest and that cause they

1349
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:52.251
shaved it just the hair never came in and they got those fucking five daddy long

1350
01:21:53.221 --> 01:21:57.780
legs hanging off a one nipple and they don't work out and it's just all just,

1351
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:01.470
it looks like a,
it looks like a melted snowman.

1352
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.620
Ah,
that's why I don't,
I'm not a Jew.
I'm not a member of a gym.
All right,
Bill,

1353
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:13.230
have you and Jim Norton never compared to appendix scars?
Uh,
no.

1354
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.240
No I haven't.
No.
I,

1355
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:18.420
this is a whole new fucking world that I don't want to get involved in.

1356
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:22.560
This is some sort of,
do they have scar porn?

1357
01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:26.700
This is really making me uncomfortable.
Um,
Bill,
besides your appendix scar,

1358
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:29.940
what is your best scar and how did it happen?
All right,
they can answer this one.

1359
01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:34.590
I have one right above my left eyebrow that you can only see when,

1360
01:22:34.591 --> 01:22:36.180
if I'm imitating the rock.

1361
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:41.990
And how I got it was my older brother threw me off the porch head first and I

1362
01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:47.760
landed like a lawn dart into a flagstone.
This is basically,

1363
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.960
it is basically the story.
We had a,
you have a,
you know those,
those,

1364
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:56.370
those porch swings that they have back in the day where,
uh,
if you,
if you came,

1365
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.210
if you,
according back in the day you'd come and they,

1366
01:23:01.211 --> 01:23:03.510
they wouldn't let you go anywhere.
So you'd said,
I don't know,

1367
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:07.450
on a spring and I was on a swing.
It's like basically a love seat,

1368
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:11.680
but it's a swing and he'd sit out there and sing like lighter rose or something.

1369
01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:13.450
Lot of rose.
I'm home again.

1370
01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.200
Rosie barbershop quartet would show up like in the music man.
Yeah,

1371
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.220
we had one of those.

1372
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.260
So somehow my brother pissed me off and he was swinging like a fucking maniac on

1373
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:27.010
that thing.
So I grabbed,
I think it was a rake.

1374
01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.700
I don't know that it's not important what the business end of it was because

1375
01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:33.910
it's really,
this story is about the handle of whatever I grabbed.

1376
01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:37.270
So it's a brome,
it's a rake.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

1377
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.570
And as when he got up to the top,

1378
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.770
I stood underneath him like I was in 300 you know,

1379
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.260
and I just held that stick up and I fucking caught him right in his stomach.

1380
01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:54.070
And I held them for probably like half a second.

1381
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.490
And then I dropped the broom handle,
whatever.

1382
01:23:57.491 --> 01:24:02.491
And I turned around and I went to run off of the porch and he had the momentum

1383
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:06.970
of the swing coming down.
So he immediately was like right behind me.

1384
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.160
Like you have a watch,
the roadrunner and the coyote,

1385
01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.820
when coyote chases the road runner road around,

1386
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.650
it goes flying by him and he's at a dead stop.

1387
01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:18.700
And somehow he catches all the way up to them,
except for the last three feet.

1388
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:21.400
That's what the fuck my brother did.
But he had the aid of a swing.

1389
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.800
So I'm right at the top step of the porch and he just sort of pushed me in the

1390
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:30.040
middle of my back little Claude Lemieux action.
Right?

1391
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.850
And that's when I just went fucking airborne.
And,
uh,

1392
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:37.540
I don't know if I ever told you this guys the size of my huge head right now.

1393
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.450
I had this head when I was,
it was the same size when I was born,

1394
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:45.250
so I was probably 11 years old.
So let's,
you know,
for the sake of the story,

1395
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:46.810
I'm fucking top heavy,
right?

1396
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.840
So I immediately start going down like a fucking javelin and it happened so

1397
01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:56.800
fast.
I couldn't get my hands out knee if I could.

1398
01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:01.980
I would've broke both my wrists trying to stop terminal velocity of my skull and

1399
01:25:02.261 --> 01:25:07.090
I just fucking went head first into this flagstone and uh,
had a nice gash.

1400
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:10.450
Actually took out a little chunk of my skull,
a little sliver of it,

1401
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:14.140
of my Frankenstein brow.
And,
uh,

1402
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:20.560
I just remember getting up and I went back up to the top of the porch and I was

1403
01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:24.910
leaning over the banister cause I didn't want to start bleeding in the house

1404
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:27.970
cause I knew my dad was gonna Freak out cause he already had to stitch me up.

1405
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.840
My Dad's a dentist,
so,
uh,
it's Kinda cool.
Anytime you got stitches,
you,

1406
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.520
you didn't have to go to the hospital.
He just fucking,
it was like,
oh,

1407
01:25:37.521 --> 01:25:39.750
like in between periods they just saw you up on the bench.

1408
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:42.640
He just do it right there and we,
you know,
it's funny,

1409
01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:44.920
we always ended up having to get stitches on his day off.

1410
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.030
Pull pass did used to work like three weeks in a row we get one day off and then

1411
01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:52.600
one of us would fall out of a tree or accidentally in air quotes,

1412
01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:57.220
throw a fucking rockets.
You know,
I did that one.
And uh,

1413
01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.770
we always use the same excuse.

1414
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.890
I was running through the woods and I tripped and he'd be like,

1415
01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.750
Oh for Christ's sake,
I don't need this shit

1416
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:10.670
any fucking Uda.
He just lays down on the sofa,

1417
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:12.621
you know,

1418
01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:16.670
numbers up and he'd start stitching this up and we'd be going out and he'd be

1419
01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:20.240
like,
come on,
stop it.
Stop it.
That doesn't hurt that bad.

1420
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:25.700
And uh,
yeah,
then you'd have a fucking scarf.
There you go.
That's my uh,

1421
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:30.650
do I have any other ones?
I got bit in the face by my own dog.

1422
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.630
That was a good one.
Where this little West Highland terrier and uh,

1423
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:39.890
we just kept fucking with them.
Um,
I dunno why.

1424
01:26:39.891 --> 01:26:41.920
I can't even remember why at this point.
I'm still fucking longer.

1425
01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.030
We basically turned them into an attack dog.

1426
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.690
We started off just rough housing with him and then he would bite.

1427
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:48.561
It's a little too hard.

1428
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:52.630
And then we moved on to a garden gloves and we started playing what be called

1429
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.910
the glove game and we've just keep pushing them in the face and then he figured

1430
01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.760
out how to bite.
So then we moved on to,

1431
01:26:58.761 --> 01:27:03.380
I think like hockey sticks and we,
you know,
wasn't hit them really hard.

1432
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.213
We just sorta like,

1433
01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:06.290
actually you don't need trying to dig out the puck in the corner.

1434
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:10.820
We kind of do that shit.
And He'd start biting at it.
And I remember when he,

1435
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:14.510
when he would bite down on it and he finally learned to start shaking it going

1436
01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:16.160
like,
oh,
doing that shit.

1437
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:20.390
We thought it was the funniest shit ever,

1438
01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.640
you know?
And we were all like,
ages two to 10,
you know,

1439
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:29.290
this is back in the day too,
when,
you know,
there was no Oprah Winfrey,

1440
01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:32.360
so people didn't know that you shouldn't leave fucking five kids under the age

1441
01:27:32.361 --> 01:27:37.190
of 10 at home with a dog and electricity,
you know?
And uh,

1442
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.400
so yeah.
So we just turned this down into a fucking attack though.

1443
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:41.030
Can we do clearly taught him how to bite.

1444
01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:45.140
And we all thought it was hilarious until he started doing it to us.
And,
uh,

1445
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.340
so one day my brother is sitting on the couch and he's eating a sandwich and my

1446
01:27:49.341 --> 01:27:53.030
dog sitting there setting up begging,
you know,
little shit,
little terrier.

1447
01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:57.800
So I start crawling up next to him just going,
hey,
I'm going to get to food.

1448
01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.940
I'm going to get their food.
He's sitting there on her.

1449
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:03.350
He keeps looking over at me and I just kept creeping up going,

1450
01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:04.520
I'm going to get the food.

1451
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:07.160
And then he started doing like that half a fucking smile,

1452
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:10.670
show me his fangs and we're laughing,
laughing.

1453
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.550
That's always do just drive him fucking the same way we do to my little brother,

1454
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:17.970
just piss him off.
It was just fun to watch somebody lose this shit.
And uh,

1455
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:21.680
the dog was no exception.
And then I don't know what happened.

1456
01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:26.390
I took it too far and he just lunged over to bite me.
And I was,

1457
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:29.960
my face was at his face,
his level,

1458
01:28:29.961 --> 01:28:33.890
and he just grabbed me on the same side,
same side.

1459
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:35.300
When my brother threw me off the porch,

1460
01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.860
he fucking sunk in just below my eye into my cheek.

1461
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:44.570
And then one of his lower canines was actually inside my mouth and he had my

1462
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:48.020
entire fucking left cheek.
And he went

1463
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:55.550
and he knew he fucked up too because he's bit me on the leg and he didn't give a

1464
01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:57.530
fuck.
But when he did down when he was like,
oh shit,

1465
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:01.830
that's easily a 10 minute misconduct if not in fucking game suspension.

1466
01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:07.050
Um,
yeah.
And that was a,
that was a,
that was a rough walk into the bathroom.

1467
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.420
I remember that.
Oh,
I get hurt.
It kind of felt like a,
I was just like,
ah,

1468
01:29:11.421 --> 01:29:14.650
I was worried I was going to be deformed.
So that was the thing.

1469
01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:16.320
Like I was going to look in the mirror.
I was like,
oh my God,

1470
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:17.154
am I gonna look like a,

1471
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.360
like somebody just got bit in the face by a fucking terrier and somehow I did.

1472
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:25.950
He kind of,
they were like puncture wounds.
I still see him,
man.

1473
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:28.350
I'm looking in the mirror right now.
It kind of faded away,

1474
01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.280
but that the one on my upper lip,
I don't fucking know.

1475
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.220
But then I had to go to my dad's office and he was already working on other

1476
01:29:35.221 --> 01:29:39.540
people,
so he was pissed and it was also embarrassing the next day when I went to

1477
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.710
school,
you know,

1478
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:44.940
face is all bruised up and I had stitches he face and I was like,
God,

1479
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:49.890
I got bit by a dog who's dog?
Oh my dog.
And like,
did you get rid of it?

1480
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.620
No.
Why not?

1481
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:57.420
Because my family is fucked in the head.
What do you think?

1482
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.710
You know,
do I sound supposed to do that shit?
It's supposed to,
you know,

1483
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:05.820
chase frisbees and be skipping along with you as you walked back from catching

1484
01:30:05.821 --> 01:30:09.270
catfish.
Right.
And that's supposed to bite you in the fucking face,
but you know,

1485
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.590
I deserved it.
So there you go.
There's my scar stories for the week.

1486
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.490
Um,
I didn't get a chance to get to underrated overrated this week.

1487
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.950
I'll just add to them next week we'll have a giant,

1488
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:24.060
we'll have a bonus section of underrated overrated because there was some really

1489
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:27.660
good ones this week.
And,
uh,
and that is it.
Um,

1490
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.410
what do I got?
What he got a hyper real quick.
Oh,
please.
Uh,

1491
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.680
please come see me at the Improv in Houston,
Texas.
Um,

1492
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:40.770
go to Improv,
the number two.com or you can click on the link.

1493
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.650
Went on my homepage and a Boston.

1494
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:48.870
I got my big trip back to Boston in February 6th and I'm not trying to be a

1495
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:53.790
cheeseball here,
but tickets are fucking this selling like hotcakes

1496
01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:59.610
and such a ridiculous fucking statement that's selling like hotcakes really.

1497
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:03.640
Who came up with that?
You know,
you know what?
I'm never gonna I'm gonna,

1498
01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.430
I'm really gonna try to explore that comedically,

1499
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:10.110
because that is just such a hacky,
like want to be Jerry Seinfeld fucking bit,

1500
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.940
you know,
some of my card.
Keurig's well,
what's the deal again?

1501
01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.950
We're very crude and
um,

1502
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.000
I like I said,
I wasn't going to do that and then I just did it.

1503
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:23.010
What do you think about that?
You know,

1504
01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.180
so right now you guys should just be shutting up the podcast because I've

1505
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:30.420
obviously establish the fact that,
that I'm not a man of my word.

1506
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:32.910
You know,
I worked with this comedian,

1507
01:31:32.911 --> 01:31:37.050
Ryan Dalton this weekend and I was going to do something.
I really fucked it up.

1508
01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.180
I was meaning to try to get some girl to show her tips at the end of this show.

1509
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.470
And we were trying to come up with a way to do it.
You know,

1510
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:50.130
I was going to do it in a silly way.
Like,
come on man,
the economy's bad,
you know,

1511
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:53.430
just,
just do it for America.
Just make it silly.
And you know,

1512
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.110
that'd be one girl will be willing to do it.

1513
01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.550
And then we try and thinking about like reverse psychology,
like a,
you know,

1514
01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:03.140
I had to,
you know,
keep it going for Ryan,
isn't he?

1515
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:06.370
If these need a great comedian,
I'll tell you,
but he's really bashful off stage.

1516
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:08.040
The other night,
this girl was shown attached to the,

1517
01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:10.240
he just turned all beat red is one of the funniest,
you know,

1518
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:15.230
try to fucking make it look like he's not a little fucking creep,
you know,

1519
01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:20.800
you,
the reality was was I wanted to see some titties and I was using him as an

1520
01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:25.510
excuse

if I miss a joke,

you know that one sticks with you.
