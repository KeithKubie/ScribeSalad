00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:03.196
&gt;&gt;In the last video, we
talked a little bit about

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.531
compounding interest, and
our example was interest

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:09.608
that compounds annually, not continuously,

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.107
like we would see in a lot of banks,

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:13.716
but I really just wanted
to let you understand that

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:14.969
although the idea is simple,

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.936
every year, you get 10% of the money

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:18.393
that you started off with that year,

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.969
and it's called compounding
because the next year,

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.252
you get money not just
on your initial deposit,

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:27.011
but you also get money or
interest on the interest

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.080
from previous years.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.049
That's why it's called
compounding interest.

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:31.690
Although that idea is pretty simple,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.019
we saw that the math
can get a little tricky.

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.676
If you have a reasonable calculator,

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.563
you can solve for some of these things,

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:39.740
if you know how to do it,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.514
but it's nearly impossible
to actually do it

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.245
in your head.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:44.716
For example,

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:45.615
at the end of the last video,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.988
we said, "Hey, if I have
$100 and if I'm compounding

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:51.018
"at 10% a year," that's
where this 1 comes from,

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.883
"how long does it take for
me to double my money?"

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:55.708
and end up with this equation.

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.023
To solve that equation,

00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:00.929
most calculators don't
have a log (base 1.1),

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.698
and I have shown this in other videos.

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:03.690
This, you could also say

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.205
x = log (base 10) 2 / log (base 1.1) 2.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.721
This is another way to
calculate log (base 1.1) 2.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:15.342
I say this ...

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:16.457
Sorry.

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:20.003
This should be log (base 10) 1.1.

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.964
I say this because most calculators have

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:23.595
a log (base 10) function,

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:25.001
and this and this are equivalent,

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.071
and I have proven it in other videos.

00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:28.461
In order to say, "How long does it take

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:30.689
"to double my money at 10% a year?"

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.432
you'd have to put that in your calculator,

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:34.111
and let's try it out.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:35.872
Let's try it out right here.

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:38.054
We're going to have 2,

00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:40.031
and we're going to take
the logarithm of that.

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.374
It's 0.3 divided by ...

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:44.176
divided by ...

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:46.584
... I'll open parenthesis
here just to be careful ...

00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:50.536
... divided by 1.1 and
the logarithm of that,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:53.066
and we close the parentheses,

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:59.054
is equal to 7.27 years,
so roughly 7.3 years.

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:03.005
This is roughly equal to 7.3 years.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:03.843
As we saw in the last video,

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:06.683
this not necessarily trivial to set up,

00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:08.843
but even if you understand the math here,

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:11.226
it's not easy to do this in your head.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:13.370
It's literally almost impossible
to do it in your head.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.994
What I will show you is a rule

00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:18.008
to approximate this question.

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:21.772
How long does it take for
you to double your money?

00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:23.407
That rule,

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:26.683
this is called the Rule of 72.

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:30.023
Sometimes it's the Rule
of 70 or the Rule of 69,

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:33.559
but Rule of 72 tends to
be the most typical one,

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.144
especially when you're
talking about compounding

00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:37.660
over set periods of time,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.094
maybe not continuous compounding.

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:39.902
Continuous compounding,

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:42.354
you'll get closer to 69 or 70,

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:44.664
but I'll show you what I mean in a second.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.025
To answer that same question,

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:51.957
let's say I have 10% compounding annually,

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:57.009
compounding, compounding annually,

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.687
10% interest compounding annually,

00:02:59.687 --> 00:03:02.711
using the Rule of 72, I
say how long does it take

00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.335
for me to double my money?

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.436
I literally take 72.

00:03:06.713 --> 00:03:07.997
I take 72.

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:09.327
That's why it's called the Rule of 72.

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:11.354
I divide it by the percentage.

00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:13.330
The percentage is 10.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.279
Its decimal position is 0.1,

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.013
but it's 10 per 100 percentage.

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:23.044
So 72 / 10, and I get 7.2.

00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:26.009
It was annual, so 7.2 years.

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.091
If this was 10% compounding monthly,

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.954
it would be 7.2 months.

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:34.024
I got 7.2 years, which
is pretty darn close

00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:37.542
to what we got by doing
all of that fancy math.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:38.426
Similarly,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.057
let's say that I am compounding ...

00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:41.643
Let's do another problem.

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:46.002
Let's say I'm compounding 6.

00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:48.989
Let's say 6% compounding annually,

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.618
compounding annually, so like that.

00:03:56.618 --> 00:03:59.013
Well, using the Rule of 72,

00:03:59.013 --> 00:04:07.100
I just take 72 / 6, and I
get 6 goes into 72 12 times,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.288
so it will take 12 years
for me to double my money

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:13.226
if I am getting 6% on my money

00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:15.037
compounding annually.

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:16.013
Let's see if that works out.

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:19.027
We learned last time the
other way to solve this

00:04:19.027 --> 00:04:21.255
would literally be we would say x.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:25.981
The answer to this should be close to log,

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:30.709
log base anything really
of 2 divided by ...

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.690
This is where we get the
doubling our money from.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.662
The 2 means 2x our money,

00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:38.573
divided by log base
whatever this is, 10 of,

00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:42.648
in this case, instead of
1.1, it's going to be 1.06.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.671
You can already see it's a
little bit more difficult.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.060
Get our calculator out.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:57.665
We have 2, log of that
divided by 1.06, log of that,

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:03.083
is equal to 11.89, so about 11.9.

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:04.693
When you do all the fancy math,

00:05:04.693 --> 00:05:06.975
we got 11.9.

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:07.951
Once again, you see,

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.071
this is a pretty good approximation,

00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:14.175
and this math, this math
is much, much, much simpler

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:15.672
than this math.

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:17.982
I think most of us can
do this in our heads.

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:20.667
This is actually a good
way to impress people.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.685
Just to get a better sense of how good

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:24.648
this number 72 is,

00:05:24.648 --> 00:05:27.964
what I did is I plotted on a spreadsheet.

00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:31.035
I said, OK, here is the
different interest rates.

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:34.017
This is the actual time
it would take to double.

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:37.304
I'm actually using this formula right here

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.989
to figure out the actual,
the precise amount of time

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:41.657
it will take to double.

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.461
Let's say this is in years,

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:45.513
if we're compounding annually,

00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:46.653
so if you get 1%,

00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:48.631
it will take you 70 years
to double your money.

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:51.651
At 25%, it will only take
you a little over three years

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.689
to double your money.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.719
This is the actual, this is the correct,

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.654
this is the correct,

00:05:57.654 --> 00:06:00.655
and I'll do this in blue,

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:04.655
this is the correct number right here.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:08.670
This is actual right there.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.067
That right there is the actual.

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:14.021
I plotted it here too.

00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:15.659
If you look at the blue line,

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.989
that's the actual.

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:18.673
I didn't plot all of them.

00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:21.607
I think I started at maybe 4%.

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.030
If you look at 4%,

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.025
it takes you 17.6 years
to double your money.

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:29.990
So 4%, it takes 17.6 years
to double your money.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.007
That's that dot right there on the blue.

00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:34.356
At 5%, it takes you,

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:38.986
at 5%, it takes you 14
years to double your money.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:40.347
This is also giving you an appreciation

00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:42.655
that every percentage really does matter

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:44.677
when you're talking about
compounding interest.

00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:45.991
When it takes 2%,

00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:48.030
it takes you 35 years
to double your money.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.444
1% takes you 70 years,

00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:51.960
so you double your money twice as fast.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.647
It really is really important,

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:54.716
especially if you're thinking about

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.559
doubling your money, or
even tripling your money,

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:57.674
for that matter.

00:06:57.674 --> 00:06:59.633
Now, in red,

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:01.685
in red over here,

00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:04.694
I said what does the Rule of 72 predict?

00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:05.670
This is what the Rule ...

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.009
So if you just take 72
and divide it by 1%,

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.016
you get 72.

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:12.653
If you take 72 / 4, you get 18.

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:16.654
Rule of 72 says it will take you 18 years

00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:19.090
to double your money
at a 4% interest rate,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.050
when the actual answer is 17.7 years,

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.011
so it's pretty close.

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:27.227
That's what's in red right there.

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:29.687
That's what's in red right there.

00:07:29.687 --> 00:07:31.287
You can see, so I have plotted it here,

00:07:31.287 --> 00:07:33.280
the curves are pretty close.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.680
For low interest rates,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.703
for low interest rates,

00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:39.981
so that's these interest rates over here,

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.715
the Rule of 72,

00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:43.974
the Rule of 72 slightly,

00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:46.289
slightly overestimates
how long it will take

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:47.716
to double your money.

00:07:47.716 --> 00:07:49.000
As you get to higher interest rates,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.998
it slightly underestimates
how long it will take you

00:07:51.998 --> 00:07:53.668
to double your money.

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:54.998
Just if you had to think about,

00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:57.690
"Gee, is 72 really the best number?"

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.604
this is what I did.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.691
If you just take the interest
rate and you multiply it

00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:03.962
by the actual doubling time,

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.705
and here, you get a bunch of numbers.

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.720
For low interest rates, 69 works good.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.994
For very high interest
rates, 78 works good.

00:08:09.994 --> 00:08:11.001
But if you look at this,

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.045
72 looks like a pretty good approximation.

00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:16.971
You can see it took us
pretty well all the way from

00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:19.989
when I graphed here,
4% all the way to 25%,

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:22.395
which is most of the
interest rates most of us

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:25.653
are going to deal with
for most of our lives.

00:08:25.653 --> 00:08:26.999
Hopefully, you found that useful.

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:28.963
It's a very easy way
to figure out how fast

00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:30.000
it's going to take you
to double your money.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.980
Let's do one more just for fun.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.703
I have a, I don't know, a 4 ...

00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:37.309
well, I already did that.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:42.996
Let's say I have a 9% annual compounding.

00:08:42.996 --> 00:08:44.433
How long does it take me for me

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.028
to double my money?

00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:52.006
Well, 72 / 9 = 8 years.

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:55.485
It will take me 8 years
to double my money.

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:57.685
The actual answer, if this is using ...

00:08:57.685 --> 00:09:00.011
This is the approximate
answer using the Rule of 72

00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:04.971
The actual answer, 9% is 8.04 years.

00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:06.843
Once again, in our
head, we were able to do

00:09:06.843 --> 00:09:09.707
a very, very, very good approximation.
