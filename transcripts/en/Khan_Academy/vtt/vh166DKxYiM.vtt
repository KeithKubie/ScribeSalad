00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.480
- [Voiceover] What I hope to do in this video

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.210
is give ourselves an appreciation

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.150
for the sodium-potassium pump,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.860
and as the name implies, it pumps

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.800
sodium and potassium, but it does it

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.450
in different directions.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.570
So this little depiction right over here,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.835
this is my drawing, my rendition

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.170
of the sodium-potassium pump,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620
it's a trans-membrane, I guess you could say

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.035
protein complex right over here.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.790
And in this resting state,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.550
it is open to the inside of the cell

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.450
and it has an affinity for sodium ions.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.830
And so the sodium ions,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.350
you see three sodium ions

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.400
depicted here in blue.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
They're going to bind to the pump.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.530
And once they bind to it,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.820
then it's going to want to be

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.960
phosphorylated by an ATP,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.820
and we see that right over here.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.950
This is ATP,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.630
adenosine triphosphate.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.260
And when it gets phosphorylated,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.781
it's a release of energy

00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.330
and it allows the confirmation

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.530
of the actual protein to change.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.020
So the new confirmation of the protein,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.420
it's now going to open up

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.120
to the outside, close off to the inside,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.700
and now it's no longer going to

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.260
have an affinity for sodium ions,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.350
but an affinity for potassium ions,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.450
and this is fascinating,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.730
that release of energy, change of confirmation,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.120
that these proteins really are

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.500
these molecular machines,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560
these fascinating molecular machines.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.900
But once that happens,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.422
this change of confirmation,

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:19.360
the sodium ions are going to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.460
be released outside of the cell.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.050
And then you're going to have potassium ions

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.190
that are going to bind from the outside.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.806
And then once that happens,

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.060
the change in confirmation,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.690
we're going to have a,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.900
it's going to get dephosphorylated

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.050
and then you're going to go back

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.660
to your original confirmation,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.689
your original confirmation right over here.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.390
Where you no longer have an affinity

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.060
for potassium ions,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.435
they're going to be released,

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.000
and then you're going to be

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.076
back in the original phase.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.150
So this is fascinating.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.450
By using ATP, by using energy,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.020
this is active transport,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.384
it takes energy to do this.

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:51.020
Let me write this down.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.750
This is active,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.690
this is active transport

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.420
that we are talking about

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.520
right over here.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.820
We're able to pump,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.237
using an ATP, we're able to pump

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.700
three sodium ions out,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.330
three sodium ions out,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.620
so let me write that down.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.692
Three sodium ions out.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.530
And in the process, we pump

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.520
two potassium ions in.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760
So we pump two

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.420
potassium ions in.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.360
Now you might say, okay,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.020
the outside, since these both have positive charge,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.590
but I have three sodium going out,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.150
two potassium going in.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.500
That must make the outside

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.850
more positive than the inside,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.361
and that actually is true.

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.620
But that by itself isn't fully responsible.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.000
It's actually only partially responsible

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.370
for the electric potential difference

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.920
between the inside of the membrane

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.496
and the outside of the membrane.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.290
What really sets that up is that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.432
you actually have channel proteins

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:49.220
that allow potassium ions

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.300
to move down, to diffuse down

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.730
their concentration gradient.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.130
So let's think about what happens

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.300
before I even talk about

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300
these channel proteins right over here.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.250
Because of the sodium-potassium pump,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.790
what is sodium's concentration gradient?

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.412
Well, it has a higher concentration

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:05.760
on the outside,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.220
it has a higher concentration on the outside

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.970
and it has a lower concentration

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.260
on the inside.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.566
This is sodium's concentration gradient.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.160
What is potassium's concentration gradient?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.930
Well, potassium is getting pumped in

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.200
from the outside into the cell.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.290
So potassium has the opposite concentration gradient.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.060
It has a high concentration inside

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
and it has a low concentration outside.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.880
Now if we let potassium go through,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.503
we've talked in previous videos

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.670
about ions just not being that,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.266
that just the general membrane,

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.256
if it's not facilitated in some way,

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:45.156
isn't that permeable to things like ions,

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:46.600
like sodium and potassium ions.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.259
But if you have channel proteins

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.386
right over here that let the potassium

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:53.326
get out, what's going to happen?

00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:55.266
Well, you might have one of two answers.

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:55.966
You might say, oh, well, look.

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.426
Hey, you know, things diffuse down

00:03:58.426 --> 00:03:59.836
their concentration gradient,

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:00.956
you have a higher probability since you have

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.196
more potassium here than up here,

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.526
higher probability of them

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.426
going in the right direction on this side

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.926
and moving from this side to that side

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:10.266
than you have them going from that side to that side.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.056
And so you would have a net outflow of potassium.

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.466
And some of you might say, well, okay,

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:16.896
that makes sense if you only care

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:19.075
about the concentration gradient.

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.086
But what happens if we look at the charge?

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.730
Because we're saying that the inside of the cell

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.766
is going to be less positive

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:28.896
and the outside of the cell

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.376
is going to be more positive

00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:31.119
because it has more,

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.156
that we have the net ion change,

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:37.556
so it's gonna be more positive out here.

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:39.786
So positive ions, they don't like,

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.616
you want to move away from charges

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:42.826
that are the same as you.

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:44.856
You want to move to the places

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:46.526
that are a more negative,

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.666
so you'd say, well, these potassium ions

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.086
are positively charged,

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:51.216
why would they wanna go from

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:54.886
a less positive place to a more positive place?

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:57.026
And if you are saying either one of these things,

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:58.576
talking about the concentration gradient

00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:00.986
or talking about the electric potential difference,

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:03.946
you are actually going to be right in both cases.

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.086
These are going to be balancing forces.

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:07.226
The concentration gradient

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.286
is going to allow some of

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:10.826
these potassium ions to pour out,

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.579
but the concentrations of potassium ions

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.442
aren't going to fully equalize

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:19.688
because of the electric potential difference,

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:22.136
because, hey, it's more positive out here,

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.323
it's less positive here.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:23.986
When they're moving out,

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.236
they're going against what

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:26.566
their charge wants to do.

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:28.416
They're going with the concentration gradient,

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.666
but at some point, that is going to balance out.

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.396
And by going through this process,

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:36.576
by pumping sodium out

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:37.796
and with that larger ratio

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.616
than what you're pumping potassium in,

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:40.716
and then you're further allowing

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:42.766
more positive charge to go out.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:44.146
You're establishing what's called

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.786
the resting membrane potential for a cell.

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:48.486
And this is super important for all cells,

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.986
but especially neuron cells

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.856
or neural cells or neurons.

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:53.446
And those are gonna spend

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:54.790
two-thirds of their energy

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.866
just to establish or to keep

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.436
their resting membrane potential.

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.986
And as we'll see in the videos on neurons,

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:02.086
that's because they keep leveraging that potential

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:04.696
to send signals down the neuron.

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:06.346
But the resting membrane potential,

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:08.116
it's less positive here and more positive there.

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:11.436
If you measure this relative to,

00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:12.826
let me make that a little bit neater,

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:15.286
relative to this right over here,

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:19.026
this difference is, depending on

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.236
what estimates you look at,

00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:24.386
approximately negative 70 millivolts.

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:26.996
I've seen estimates negative 60, negative 80.

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:30.266
Negative 70 millivolts.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.003
And this is key for neurons,

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:34.273
but it's key for all cells.

00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:35.593
Now the sodium-potassium pump

00:06:35.593 --> 00:06:37.853
isn't just about establishing

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:39.823
the resting membrane potential.

00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:41.953
Having this higher sodium concentration

00:06:41.953 --> 00:06:44.793
on the outside can also be used later on

00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:47.223
for other forms of active transport.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.113
When they move down their gradient,

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:50.223
you can do things like

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.443
co-transport glucose molecules.

00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:54.453
So these biological systems

00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:55.733
are far more complicated than

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:58.563
I often give credit for in these videos,

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.433
but I want to give you a full appreciation for this.

00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.993
And just so you know how big of a deal

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.493
the sodium-potassium pump was,

00:07:03.493 --> 00:07:05.193
it was discovered in the 1950s,

00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:08.773
but the 1997 Nobel Prize was awarded

00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:12.053
for the discovery of

00:07:12.053 --> 00:07:14.793
the sodium-potassium pump

00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:16.333
