SCOTT CARPENTER: Well, it's
my great privilege honor

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.150
to introduce you to
Srdja Popovic, who's

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.780
a very old friend.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.140
We're both not as
young as we once were.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.540
None of us are, I guess.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.420
But back in the day,
Srdja was working

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.730
on this small problem
in his country,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.980
Serbia, where the country
was dominated by a guy

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.950
by the name of Milosevic,
who you may have heard of,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.890
who was waging war
all around him,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.440
was suppressing and
repressing and oppressing

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.100
the people, his own people.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190
And there was very little
in the way of anyone

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.930
to stand up to him.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.910
And Srdja and a few
others very bravely

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.230
figured out a way to
use humor, and to use

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.900
the sense of being
everywhere all at once,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.800
to change completely
the perception

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.560
of the society of having
no room to maneuver,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.310
to making it seem almost
inevitable that Milosevic

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.690
would go.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.364
And it was just
amazing to watch.

00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:09.780
And I was living and working
in Central and Eastern Europe

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.840
at the time, where people
like Milosevic and Tudjman

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.570
and Meciar and a number
of these fun individuals

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.059
were wreaking their havoc on
Central and Eastern Europe.

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:24.850
And we've come a long
way in many respects,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.880
and in some respects still
have a long way to go.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.080
But in any case, Srdja
was one of the founders

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.540
of this movement.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.070
And the movement
was called Otpor!

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.940
And "otpor" means "resistance."

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.004
And its symbol
was a raised fist.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.670
I'm sure he'll tell
you more about this,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.570
but one of the things,
when I was working

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.060
with him and some of his
friends back in the day,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.570
it's so creative.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.500
And so I'm really
looking forward to you

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.730
being able to hear from
him some of these ideas

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.770
that he has to share based
on a long experience.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.290
Because after Milosevic
fell, he went into parliament

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.020
for a little bit and
decided at the end of day

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.389
that his skill set
and his passion really

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.270
lay in sharing the tactics and
techniques that he had learned

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.080
while he was
underground in Serbia,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.040
and how to perhaps share those
tactics-- nonviolent tactics

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.290
and techniques, by
the way, nonviolent--

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.710
with the rest of the world.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.130
So he and some friends of
his put together something

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.870
called CANVAS, the Center
for Applied Nonviolent Action

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.980
Strategies.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.540
So he's going to talk a
little bit about this.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.240
My own recollection--
a couple things

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660
I just wanted to
share from that time

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.630
was the idea of small stickers.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.395
This is one of the things that--
it was like thumb size, maybe

00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:55.340
even smaller, that
had the Otpor!

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.050
symbol on them.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.790
And what you would do
with these is you'd

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.550
pass them out to lots of people.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.340
And they would
put them anywhere.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.540
So you'd be on a bus holding
onto the bus, the rail,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.620
and you'd just put
your sticker there.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.210
And all of a sudden, all
over the city in Belgrade,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.592
there were these stickers
everywhere for Otpor!

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:17.550
How did they get there?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.900
And the regime would go crazy.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.420
And I think it was the first
time the tactic was used

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.750
that has advanced
all over the place,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.320
is they had these little
stamps where they would stamp

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.880
the currency with the Otpor!

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.022
sticker And it would circulate.

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.480
And the government would try
to take it out of circulation.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.470
But it would be
too late, and there

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.630
was nothing they could do.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.950
And Otpor! was
everywhere, until Otpor!

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.690
finally was everywhere.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.240
There were 70,000 supporters.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.690
People came out in the streets.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.497
And Milosevic fell
without a shot.

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:49.080
And that was what
was most miraculous.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.040
So I'm going to turn
it over to Srdja

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.630
to talk to you a little bit
about his personal story,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.210
and then about the book,
how the book came about.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.960
And then I'm going to
ask a few questions.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.265
And I'm going to invite
you to participate as well

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:02.265
and ask a few questions.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:04.740
So over to you,
Srdja-- welcome again.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.340
SRDJA POPOVIC: It's great to
see an old friend in a new suit.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.130
Congratulations for
working with Google Ideas.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.550
I'm very familiar with
the work of Google Ideas.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.100
I'm so proud to know people
like Jared Cohen or Dan

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.450
Keyserling, who is hiding
here in the front rank.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.560
I'm so happy to be
with you guys and meet

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.875
some of your colleagues
on events like Zeitgeist.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:30.810
And I'm very, very enthusiastic
about the fact that you're

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.650
putting at least the
part of your resources

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.550
into making the world more
better and a more open place.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.780
Now, a little bit
about this story

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.660
and this little yellow thing,
which sits in your chairs--

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.160
I'll start by story of me.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.900
And this is not a book about me.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.220
I would never write one.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.810
I would never even read one.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.380
It would be the boring one.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.470
But it's a story of a rock kid.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.730
I started as a bass guitar
player in a Serbian rock band.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.300
And I was thinking
that activism is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.720
for geeks and people who are
fighting for animal rights

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.680
and stuff like that.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.450
But being thrown
into the war land

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.000
and understanding that the
only way to do something

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.510
is to change, and specifically
being thrown into this

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.300
through the very, very
interesting student movement,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.380
which has its
cultural components,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.330
subcultural component,
rock and roll

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.020
component, designing
component, arty component,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.160
catchy component, funny
component, in component,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.620
cool component-- I
ended up in a society

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.730
where you can't date
in Serbia if you're not

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.070
a part of a student movement.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.550
Now it really
shifts your reality

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.440
into something which is
completely different.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.435
And one of the things the
book will tell you about--

00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:47.810
and you'll read
it on the subway.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.870
It's a really really,
really easy read.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.020
And it was made for
the people who are not

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.480
experts, who are not
activists per say,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.700
but do understand the story.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.650
How many of you have seen
"The Lord of the Rings"?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.430
Oh yes.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.600
SCOTT CARPENTER:
You're at Google, man.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
SRDJA POPOVIC: You
remember hobbits.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.350
And one of the funny
things about it

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.170
is that these creatures--
little, hairy, super thrilled

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.410
about eating and smoking pot and
living in their little holes.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.040
And they're not really
designed for change.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.770
They're not wearing
the shiny armor.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.800
They're not wizards.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.720
But they are the ones who get
to the part in the history

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.940
to perform the change.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.140
And this is the book
of little hobbits.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.274
And whether you look at Egypt,
my friend Mohammed Adel,

00:06:32.274 --> 00:06:33.940
you want to look at
Martin Luther King--

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.630
the guy was a village priest.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.060
Harvey Milk-- camera shop owner.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.901
Who are these people, wizards?

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:40.400
Knights?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.740
No, hobbits.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.370
And wherever you
look at the world,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.650
it is the small hobbits
shaking and shaping.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.330
So when I say, the
story of me, this

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.550
is the story of the
very, very common

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.220
and ordinary
people, some of them

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.300
who live in your neighborhood
who made a dramatic change.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.020
And whenever you look, you'll
find a really, really cool

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.640
example.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.210
This is not only about Serbia.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.330
This is about the
fantastic people

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.490
who shake the Israeli state
around the idea of the cottage

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.330
cheese.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.980
This is the story of the people
who put up the toy protest

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.700
in February, 2011 in
Siberia, making Putin

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.830
look completely ridiculous.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.870
This is the story of very, very
many people, people like you

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.220
and me, who came out
to this understanding

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.790
that they should
change the world.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.400
Now, the second part of the
book is the story of us.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.090
Now, how a big part
of your history book

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.170
is related to wars-- have
you ever thought about it?

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.710
You take your history book.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.720
How much of it is war?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.850
How many movies have you
watched about Vietnam?

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.170
One stupid proxy completely
unimportant war in history,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.320
but you've probably seen like
five, six, seven, 10 DVDs.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.504
How many cool movies about
Martin Luther King, one?

00:07:55.504 --> 00:07:56.920
How many good
movies about Gandhi?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.685
One.

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:59.930
One cool about Harvey Milk.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.390
When you look at your nonviolent
struggle DVD collection,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.390
it's probably 3 inches.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.270
And why so?

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.610
Because if you look in
the world we're living at,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.020
the things which were
driving the big wars of past

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.605
in terms of the First
World War, Second World

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.375
War-- who is remembering the
Second World War ideologies?

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.680
Would we really go out
and kill each other

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.990
because we are
communists or not?

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.325
This really doesn't matter.

00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:28.970
But when you look
in a world where

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.250
the President of the United
States is a black person,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.990
you can see the
consequence of something

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.179
starting by Martin Luther King.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.130
When you look in a world where
even the Republican candidate

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.270
will stand for gay
marriage, probably,

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.250
on the next American elections,
you're looking at the world

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.370
where little hobbit Harvey
Milk was successful.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.390
So you're living in a world
shaped by nonviolent struggle.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.210
But in a bizarre way,
you know far more

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.550
about the heroes of the past.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.620
Look at the monuments in
New York or Washington, DC.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.600
They're all tall
armed men on horses.

00:09:04.154 --> 00:09:05.570
And then you find
a little Gandhi.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.470
There is one Gandhi
monument here in New York.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.910
And how many of
you do know where

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.610
the Gandhi is in New York?

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.710
Ah, tiny, tiny.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.780
You need to practice.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.946
SCOTT CARPENTER: OK, Google.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.365
SRDJA POPOVIC: So this
is the story of us,

00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:23.370
is that we are living in
a world where we really

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.130
need to learn more about how
important the social change is

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.580
and how we can boost it.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.040
And now we are looking
at the story of now.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.576
And we are looking at the world
where you turn the news on,

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:37.650
you see the Hong Kong, and
the Egypt, and this, and that.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.170
It's like wherever
you look on a TV,

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.840
you have a super excited
TV anchor who says,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.200
oh, this spontaneous
demonstration just occurs.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.590
There are two types of protest
movements of this world.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.840
They're either
spontaneous or successful.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.030
So if you want to
make them successful,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.100
you need to look at the vision
and strategy and tactics

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.330
and build unity and build
from small victories.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.020
And I think the
reason why we made

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.560
this book is that this
knowledge is out there.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.500
And we really wanted to
put it in a cool form

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.340
for the common
people to understand

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.100
that what shapes this world
is A, coming from hobbits.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.430
B, this is something you
can and should do at home.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.720
Not all of you have
Milosevic at home.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.570
But you may have
a bully neighbor.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.540
You may have a very
bad school district.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.880
You may have a dog's
poop on the street

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.080
depending on the part
of town you're living.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.010
You may have a very, very
corrupt public official

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.000
who is the reason why your
public transportation sucks,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.470
or whatsoever.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.950
And this is not limited to
democracies or autocracies.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.790
This is like everywhere.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.300
And if we understand that there
is a set of tools we can apply,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.480
and if we join our
forces-- we are

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.410
working on making this available
as short animated videos.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.990
We would like to work more
with the Googles of this world

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.020
to make this available
to more people,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.870
with Wikimedia of this world.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.240
We are teaching this
thing in Harvard and NYU.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.340
We will have an
online course, which

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.610
is going to become available
for the people across the world,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.540
how to build this movement.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.350
Because what I think is
that next century will be

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.760
the century of knowledge race.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.160
It's not the arms race anymore.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.580
It doesn't really
matter who has tanks.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.810
Nobody will dare to use tanks.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.670
Or if they use tanks,
they will end up

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.950
like US and Iraq, or Putin
in [INAUDIBLE], like stocked.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.380
It's not going to perform
the real social change.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.130
And I think at the
end of the day--

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.102
and the last chapter of the
book is called It Has to be You.

00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:41.850
So we need to understand that
this is our little role to take

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.290
a little injustice, fight it.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.560
And yes, however we
are looking as hobbits,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.240
and we're lazy and
hairy and laid back,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.340
it is our part to change our
little parts of the world.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.260
And to end up quoting
Tolkien once again,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.850
the grand lesson of
this book is that, yes,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.890
even the smallest
creature can change

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.515
the destiny of the world.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.140
And throughout the
history, it has been

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.744
like that many, many times.

00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:09.160
SCOTT CARPENTER:
Thank you, Srdja.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.940
That's really powerful.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.730
Where I wanted to dig in is
to actually go back in time

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:22.820
first to October, 2000 when
the campaign kind of came

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.390
to its victorious end.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.270
And it really did happen
with very little violence.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.860
Why do you think it didn't
involve much violence?

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.520
SRDJA POPOVIC: Because people
were trained to be nonviolent.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.810
And I think one of the
things we need to understand

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.540
is that A, violence looks sexy.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.430
And the person with the
gun is the favorite person

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.992
of your DVD collection.

00:12:50.992 --> 00:12:52.892
OK, it's always "Die
Hard" and "Die Hard

00:12:52.892 --> 00:12:55.662
with a Vengeance"
and "Die Hard 7,"

00:12:55.662 --> 00:12:56.870
if it's not "The Terminator."

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.244
But this is, the
guy with the gun

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:00.430
comes in and solves the problem.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.080
You look at the
nonviolent struggle,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.710
and you actually understand
that it's more effective.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.745
And a scientific study shows
that in the last century,

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.740
there were 323
different campaigns.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.670
And nonviolent campaigns
were twice more effective.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.060
And this is not just
the better moral choice.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.620
It's about, you look at this
and say, if I want to succeed,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.700
I will use the most
effective weapon.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.540
And when you look at
the Serbian campaign,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.350
or you look at any campaign
throughout the world,

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.300
nonviolent discipline is
one of the three principles

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.000
of success, together
with unity and planning.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.820
How do you get there?

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.360
It is the great question.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.360
And it is skill.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.600
You can teach people this skill.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.915
A, you can preach it, whether
as a religion or ideology

00:13:43.915 --> 00:13:46.330
or a cool/noncool factor.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.750
Because in Serbia and wars
with all of this past,

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.292
these violent guys
were not super sexy.

00:13:53.292 --> 00:13:54.750
It was actually
the nonviolent guys

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.170
who were looking
more like the cool.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.700
And then the second one,
you train your troops

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.010
to be nonviolent You sit
when you see the police.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.710
You make the live chain between
you and the police force,

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.150
so you make sure that there
won't be one drunk idiot who

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.810
throws rocks.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.810
And by the way, you look
at it from the position

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.450
of tomorrow's
newspaper, and you can

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.950
have 10,000 people in the
peaceful march singing,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.550
and you have three drunk
idiots start throwing Molotovs.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.190
And guess who's on the cover
page of "The New York Times"?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.590
These three guys always.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.607
You can count that the media
would be super violent thirsty,

00:14:27.607 --> 00:14:29.440
and that they will send
only the message you

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.010
don't want them to send.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.070
So last but not of
least importance,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.330
you don't want to align
with the groups who

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.870
are potentially violent.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.860
And this is also
one of the tricks.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.010
And if you performed the
large scale demonstrations,

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.430
there will be black
blocks of this world

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.020
ready to come in and start
throwing stones and breaking

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.710
windows.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.790
They love this.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.110
They live for this.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.510
Soccer fans in Serbia, they just
are looking at the opportunity

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.150
to attack the police.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.310
And it's like that everywhere.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.390
But it's your duty to
cooperate with the police

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.300
force in this case.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.710
So it took us 10
years to evolve.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.880
When we see the police
force ready to beat us,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.470
like in '91, '92, we would howl.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.684
Normally we would
do, av, av, av, av,

00:15:13.684 --> 00:15:16.100
which is telling the police
people that they are no better

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.170
than the dogs.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.960
But then we evolved
into the position

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.150
where we're giving them
the flowers and the cakes,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.670
and the beautiful girls
would be in the front ranks.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.180
And this is the beauty
of nonviolent struggle,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.590
is to understand that if
you want to change things,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.430
you need to pull, not push.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.960
And this pull versus push
thing is the great evolution

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.167
which brings you to the
successful nonviolent struggle.

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:39.750
SCOTT CARPENTER: Well, I want
to get into technology in a bit,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.374
but a couple more
questions about this.

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:48.110
I think that as we see the pain
and dislocation and violence

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.920
in Syria, where the
movement started

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.200
as a peaceful
nonviolent movement

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.300
and continued, even after some
fighting began to break out,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.170
what do you think of
that whole situation?

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.560
Was it possible to
maintain nonviolent tactics

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.450
in the face of that
kind of violence?

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.220
SRDJA POPOVIC: There
is a whole chapter

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.200
where we are discussing
this with a Syrian group

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.530
in the book.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.170
And actually, that
was the moment

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.200
when they were getting
people from what became

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.050
later the Free Syrian Army.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.190
And they were super
inspired with this idea.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.680
Oh, we need to make the hub
for the people in uniform

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.970
so they protect us if
somebody shoots on us.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.050
Of course, it was
possible to fight Assad

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.981
by nonviolent means.

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:45.480
And when you look
at the first seven

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.060
months of Syrian
uprising, you can

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.420
look at the great numbers,
relatively nonviolent

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.330
demonstrations,
a lot of victims.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.330
But number of victims on
the side of the protesters

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.570
actually grew when
they took arms.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.040
And this is the rule.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.840
So when you're
looking at this, you

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.470
can look at this from the
point of strategy first

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.680
and say, OK, I'm looking at
this guy, and his name is Assad,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.200
and he sits on 100,000
strong military.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.520
And can I imagine the
alternative to this guy,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.849
and he's going to be Mike Tyson.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.190
How many of you are familiar
with the name Mike Tyson?

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.099
OK, my question is, if you need
to win over the Mike Tyson,

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.912
is the boxing ring the place
that you're going to pick?

00:17:27.912 --> 00:17:29.180
No.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.170
He's going to eat your ears.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.410
He's going to eat your
head in 15 minutes.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.760
And of course you would
like to challenge him

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.120
on a game of Scrabble,
a game of chess,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.530
and this is where you
have a certain advantage.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.170
So avoiding the strong
points of your opponent

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.670
and looking at his weak
points is a military doctrine

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.830
of Sun Tzu, which is
like 3,000 years old.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.512
So when you're
looking at the Assad,

00:17:54.512 --> 00:17:56.720
the last place of the world
you want to challenge him

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.761
is the field of military.

00:17:57.761 --> 00:17:59.900
The guy has a superior military.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.350
You look at his wallet.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.350
He's broke.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.020
You want to really
challenge Assad,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.342
you will look at the
tactics of "noncooperation."

00:18:07.342 --> 00:18:09.175
You look at a successful
example in the past

00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:12.720
where you have a nonviolent
struggle against the apartheid

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.050
regime in South Africa.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.060
And then the genial
people came in

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.980
and said, let's make
the sphere of the nation

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.800
and start throwing bombs.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.600
And then of course
Mandela got to jail,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.734
and they got stuck
for like 15 years.

00:18:23.734 --> 00:18:25.400
And then the last
stage of the struggle,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.250
they say, OK, this
is the situation.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.690
We have an internationally
isolated regime,

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.930
which needs to fund a very,
very expensive oppression.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.804
How the hell are they
filling the budget?

00:18:34.804 --> 00:18:36.220
And they're looking
at the budget,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.940
and they understand
that it is actually

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.800
the majority of the black people
of South Africa are buying

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.660
goods from few South
African companies who

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.740
are paying taxes, which is
effectively funding military.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.330
So by buying this and
by buying that, they're

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.660
funding the oppression.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.460
They say, OK, we won't buy.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.480
That's how we are going
to solve this problem.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.510
And [INAUDIBLE]
regime in South Africa

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.312
was economically collapsed.

00:19:00.312 --> 00:19:01.645
It was not militarily collapsed.

00:19:01.645 --> 00:19:04.800
It was still one of
the healthiest military

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.925
on the African continent.

00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:07.760
But it was
economically collapsed.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.030
So the case in this
type of situation

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.650
is that you're looking
at the vulnerabilities

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.650
of your opponent.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.250
The real problem with Syrians
was also very, very different.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.760
And I think that's one of the
grand lessons of Arab Spring.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.160
I think the real
problem was they really

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.030
were inspired to go in arms
to what happened in Libya.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.520
So now we have a
nonviolent uprising

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.924
in Libya, which turned into
the military uprising, which

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.715
ended up with foreign
military intervention

00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:40.165
with Gaddafi killed and
raped on the street.

00:19:40.165 --> 00:19:41.790
And then the Syrians
took it from there

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.040
and said, OK, we would like
to see Assad raped and killed

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.080
on the street.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.770
But guess what?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.630
Look at Libya now.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.251
Would you like this
scenario to have at home?

00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:52.750
No.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.560
Only 4% of military uprising
end up in stable democracy.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.810
This is not because I'm
preaching nonviolence

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.900
and I'm having a little tattoo
of Gandhi on my left hand.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.895
This is because a lot
of people participate

00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:08.880
in nonviolent
struggle, as opposed

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.044
to the small group of
people participating

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:11.960
in a violent struggle.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.560
And it's also the
kids phenomenon.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.090
If you teach kids that the only
way to change the government

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.760
is to kill the
president, what do you

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.984
think the kid will do next time?

00:20:20.984 --> 00:20:22.400
They'll try to
kill the president.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.420
If you teach people that widely
popular nonviolent movement

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.740
which mobilizes the people
throughout the election

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.480
is the way to change government,
like we did in Serbia,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.480
how do you think we're
changing governments now?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.184
On elections.

00:20:34.184 --> 00:20:36.350
Why do you think they're
not stealing the elections?

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.330
Because they know that
there is a price tag.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.096
So this is a learning curve.

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:44.850
SCOTT CARPENTER: Let me ask
you another question that's

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.220
in the news these days.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.230
And that is the evolution of
Putin's strategy in Ukraine.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.652
And I know a lot of Central
Europeans and Baltic states

00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:56.860
are really nervous about
the approach they're taking.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.480
Because it's so subtle and so
not so subtle at the same time.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.910
How to respond in
nonviolent ways there?

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.410
And kind of related
is, I know that you're

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.130
friends with a lot of
folks in Pussy Riot

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.690
and some of the other
Russian activists.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.730
But that space has
shrunk so, so much.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.130
And these two
things are related.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.110
Putin and other regimes
have really learned

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.950
a lot over the last
10 years or so.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.790
And they're applying
their own tactics.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.330
So how do we respond?

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.330
SRDJA POPOVIC: Well, it's
a multilayer question.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.370
First, I think the Ukrainian
crisis matters, and not

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.790
only because it was in
media, but because it's

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.750
a very important breaking point
of power balance in Central

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.970
and Eastern Europe.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.610
And it also made
Putin very nervous.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.410
Because I think the reason
why he's doing what he's doing

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.370
is that he's looking
at the Maidan, which

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.730
is the central square
in Kiev, Ukraine,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.850
and he's imagining a
similar situation in Moscow.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.330
And I think that grows
him growingly nervous.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.270
When you look at
these struggles,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.100
you could also see
a learning curve.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.860
And one of the books that
tells a great story about this

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.789
is written by my very, very
good friend Will Dobson.

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:13.580
It's called The Dictator's
Learning Curve."

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.580
And he explains
how dictators find

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.830
a way to prevent these
nonviolent revolutions

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.520
before they occur.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.280
So they will squeeze
the media space.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.760
They will sensor the internet.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.770
They will make the ban on some
people gathering together.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.080
And it's kind of
the learning race.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.540
And wherever you speak
with the clever guys--

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.550
and we are proud to have people
from Human Rights Foundation

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.990
here in the audience who
are making this great,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.100
big Oslo Freedom
Forum once a year.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.140
And you sit with
these top dissidents,

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.860
and you keep hearing stories.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.320
And part of the story is
how the people overcome

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.930
these types of obstacles.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.600
And I think one of
the ways to deal

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.340
with it is looking at
the non-political space.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.900
And I think when you look at
the very closed societies,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.560
Korean society, what is
becoming really closed society

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.010
in Russia, it is actually
the non-political space.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.350
And state does not
deliver topics.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.150
Because you look at
these countries-- and you

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.750
could look, for
example, at Russia.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.320
There are like two great
examples in the book.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.390
One, people were protesting
against the election

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.440
fraud in Moscow and
in St. Petersburg.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.950
And because the
cameras were there,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.650
people were allowed to protest.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.608
But of course, they
couldn't follow the protest

00:23:23.608 --> 00:23:25.870
in a little place
like Barnaul, Siberia.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.980
So people came to this.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.796
This is a 3,000 people place.

00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:32.310
This is like Grinnell in Iowa,
like some really, really small

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.930
village.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.330
And there is a square,
which is like this size.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.650
And then the people will
build the little LEGO city

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.310
from the toys of their kids.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.620
And they will come out
with the little LEGO toys.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.810
And they will organize
a toy protest.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.550
So the toys would run around
with transparents and stuff

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.195
like that.

00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:49.820
And of course everybody
would be there.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.820
People will tape it.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.680
They will post it on YouTube.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.257
And a friend of mine made
a documentary about this.

00:23:56.257 --> 00:23:57.715
And you can see
that day one, there

00:23:57.715 --> 00:23:59.070
were even police taping it.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.690
So it's like everybody
was having fun.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.810
And then of course
it went viral.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.900
And then somebody
was really uproared

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.474
about this in the Kremlin.

00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:10.390
And they say, no, no,
we need to prevent this.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.520
So next day when the
Russian activists

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.390
file the request for
the demonstrations,

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.530
they got a written
response from the police

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.760
that the demonstration of 100
LEGO soldiers, 25 toy cars,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.740
are banned.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.400
Because the toys are
not citizens of Russia.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.440
And only citizens of
Russia can protest.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.210
And that was the official
paper from the police.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.550
So now you look how the
creativity and a little bit

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.240
of bravery and the
really cool idea

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.310
can challenge the man who
spends so much money in posing

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.010
shirtless, wrestling tigers,
saving dolphins from drowning,

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.310
and [INAUDIBLE] for us.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.390
And he's afraid of toys.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.420
And it's like, you can look
at how the creativity always

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.500
finds a way.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.440
So there's another Russian town.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.500
It's really cool.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.890
And there was a bunch of artists
who were looking at the city.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.380
And because of
course the city is

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.240
full of the bumps, these
big holes in which you

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.290
hit your car whenever
you drive, they kind of

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.560
painted the faces of the
city officials around this.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.100
So there'll be a mayor with a
big hole instead of his mouth,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.860
or the governor with a big
hole instead of his mouth.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.540
And of course what
happens in reality

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.860
is that you drive the
car, you hit the bump,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.210
and of course you
curse-- what else?

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.510
And whom do you curse?

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.390
And the really
interesting response

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.510
from the Russian
officials was that they

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:39.820
tried to repaint the faces
rather than fill the holes.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.560
So this phenomenon--
the book, of course,

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.740
there's a chapter called
Laugh Your Way to Freedom.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.770
The idea is that there's so
many examples where people

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.620
are super creative operating
on a high-risk environment,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.030
and using existing
political space,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.590
and especially using
humor and creativity.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.010
Because humor is a very powerful
weapon against the politicians

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.340
generally, not necessarily
authoritarians.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.870
I have a sense that
the people in power

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.680
spend too much time watching
their faces in the newspaper

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.390
and on the TV and on
billboards and start

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.840
thinking about themself
as about this image

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.130
rather than about
their real selves.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.510
And they become very vulnerable
to this type of activism,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.490
which we of course
baptized the laughtivism.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.770
Because this is what you do.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.900
So there are creative ways.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.670
There are small
acts of resistance.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.765
There are activities which
are called dispersive tactics.

00:26:33.765 --> 00:26:36.535
The Putins of this world will
be very effective in preventing

00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:39.060
you going to the square.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.790
So you don't go to square.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.060
You go somewhere where
they don't expect you.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.570
So there are ways you can do it.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.909
There are like 200 different
things people can do.

00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:48.450
And people were
doing it in the past.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.490
Several minutes ago,
I spoke with Dan

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.840
for this little podcast.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.040
And one of the things we said
was where technology can help.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.550
And one of the great things
that technology does,

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.749
it helps the group
learn horizontally.

00:27:06.749 --> 00:27:08.040
So now you don't need a mentor.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.660
You don't need a trainer.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.020
You don't need a
Harvard online course.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.460
You look at how Venezuelans
can make a small viral video.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.787
You make the one in Ukraine.

00:27:17.787 --> 00:27:19.370
Now, the Taiwanese
take it from there.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.610
They see it on the YouTube.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.210
They record one themselves.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.020
So enabling people to learn
horizontally from each other

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.040
is I think the biggest
achievement technology can

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.470
bring to this world.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.620
And it's a great task of
organizations like Google Ideas

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.310
to make this space as open
as possible, and as available

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.056
for the people as possible.

00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:42.180
SCOTT CARPENTER: Fantastic.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.080
Well, we have about
15 minutes left.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.460
So if there are questions
that you all want to ask,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.770
we have microphones on
the left and right hand

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.110
side of the stage.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.530
And I'd ask that you ask
the question from there,

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.365
because this whole
thing is being recorded,

00:27:56.365 --> 00:27:57.740
so that we can
hear the question.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.779
SRDJA POPOVIC: So
you all go to jail.

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:01.820
SCOTT CARPENTER: Yeah, we
know who's saying what.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.450
SRDJA POPOVIC: Big
Brother is watching.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.930
SCOTT CARPENTER: So if you'd
make your way to the mics--

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.637
if not, I will continue
the conversation.

00:28:11.637 --> 00:28:13.220
I think a couple
people are coming up.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.820
Srdja, back in the
day, the technology--

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.680
SRDJA POPOVIC: That sounds like
we are about 250 years old.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.190
SCOTT CARPENTER: Yeah,
it does, doesn't it?

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:32.257
But in 2000, the internet in
Serbia wasn't terribly strong.

00:28:32.257 --> 00:28:33.340
SRDJA POPOVIC: Inter-what?

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.740
SCOTT CARPENTER: Yeah, right.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.731
So radio-- what was the
big technology of the day,

00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:41.480
just very quickly?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.570
And then we have questions.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.528
SRDJA POPOVIC: Texting.

00:28:43.528 --> 00:28:48.350
We would go in the kiosk and buy
this little prepaid phone card.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.770
And then you'll
go on the computer

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.210
and send 10,000 messages.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:54.650
This is the day of the election.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:55.608
Milosevic is finishing.

00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:57.500
Go out to vote, and
send this to everybody.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.740
And we thought this was
the technology breakthrough

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.410
of the 21st century.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.740
But it is always the
technology you have

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.720
available that you need to use.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.270
And however technology can
be seductive and beautiful,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.370
you need to understand that
making a website in English

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.410
wouldn't really mobilize the
grannies in rural Zimbabwe.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.440
So it's really understanding
that technology

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.050
is a messenger for you
rather than the essence.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.900
And there were cases in the
past where young South African

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.510
kids were trained to run
from village to village

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.240
and sing revolution.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.880
Because this is how
they use their history.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.860
They have an oral history.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.720
This is not something
written in the books

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.270
or in Vietnamese DVDs.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.530
This is the oral history.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.570
So you use the technology
you have at your disposal.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.830
Some of this can be
very cool and sexy.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.740
But don't get too
obsessed with technology.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.820
Technology itself won't
solve the problems.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.240
Only technology
put in a good use

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.001
is going to help and solve
the problem, I think.

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:04.000
SCOTT CARPENTER: Please.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.690
The talk is very interesting.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.420
I have a question around the
Occupy Wall Street movement.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.140
And I think that was
an interesting example

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.292
of nonviolent activism.

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:16.500
But I didn't think it was
anywhere near as successful

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.245
as some people
hoped it would be.

00:30:18.245 --> 00:30:20.120
And I'm wondering what
lessons we could learn

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.070
from that movement, and how they
could then be applied perhaps

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.540
in the future.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.430
SRDJA POPOVIC: That's a topic
we discussed over and over,

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.330
and the favorite topic of my
co-writer of this book, who

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.027
hides somewhere
in the third rank.

00:30:33.027 --> 00:30:33.860
Matt, where are you?

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.830
Say hi to everybody.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.340
And we discussed
this over and over.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.470
And we said, OK,
that was a thrilling

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.570
demonstration of necessity
for social change in America.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:49.365
It was hitting the right
topic of inequality.

00:30:49.365 --> 00:30:53.080
It was very nice in
mobilizing the people.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.810
But the part of this book
is very critical about it.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.590
Because the moment I
sat with these people--

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.670
and I had the
opportunity to meet them

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.242
at the peak of their numbers.

00:31:02.242 --> 00:31:03.700
Because I was here
teaching at NYU.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.350
And they appear on
Todd Gitlin's class.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.390
And he's a professor
here at Columbia.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.710
And he says, I want you
to meet some cool people.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.340
They can make change.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.790
And it took me three
hours speaking with them

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.250
to extract the answer
to the question,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.160
if you are the king for the day,
if you are the Harry Potter,

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.680
and you can touch
America, how will it

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.850
be different from today?

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.175
And then they start telling
me about the evil banks

00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:32.490
and evil this and evil that.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.940
And I say, no, no,
that's not the question.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.180
The question is, if you
are the king for the day.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.980
And every successful
nonviolent struggle

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.970
starts with-- the second
chapter in the book

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.210
is called Think
Big, Start Small.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.740
What is the big picture?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.260
Where are you going?

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.070
What is your vision of tomorrow?

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.030
What do you want to achieve?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.420
And then how are you
going to achieve this?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.160
If you can't give me the answer
to this question in 30 seconds,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.810
why in the world
would I follow you?

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.970
So I think they were
tremendously enthusiastic.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.070
I think the space for
this moment is here.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.410
You will see more
pro-equality movements

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.090
in this country in
the next 10 years.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.980
I can put $100 on this bet.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.480
I don't know how
they will be named.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.960
But one of the problems is they
need to know what they want.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.030
Second and very important
part of the story

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.450
is branding the movement.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:29.930
If only these guys branded
themself 99%, then I can join.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.090
Because I have a wife.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.170
I have small kids.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:37.810
I'm too busy doing other stuff
to just sit in Zuccotti Park.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.910
And I think limiting yourself to
a tactic is one of the mistakes

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.125
that movements make,
which of course you

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:46.110
are going to understand,
because you'll read

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.836
this book on your way home.

00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:50.880
So you will understand exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.030
And next time you have
an inequality problem,

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.490
you will be far better
equipped than the boys

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.264
and girls of Occupy.

00:32:59.264 --> 00:33:01.180
SCOTT CARPENTER: One of
the interesting things

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.055
that we probably don't
have time to get into,

00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:05.560
and I want to get to the
next question, but Otpor!

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.750
as a movement, once
it became successful,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.450
the leadership went
through a big debate about,

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.820
do we become a political party?

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.850
And it was a fascinating
conversation.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.865
Because their mission
had been achieved.

00:33:17.865 --> 00:33:20.490
So I'm going to leave
that aside for a second,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.739
but your question, please.

00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:23.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for this talk.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.946
It's really inspiring.

00:33:23.946 --> 00:33:26.070
Hearing the actual facts
about why nonviolence

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.111
is more effective than
violence is really, really

00:33:28.111 --> 00:33:29.682
useful and fascinating.

00:33:29.682 --> 00:33:30.390
I had a question.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:31.490
It's the opposite of
the last question,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.104
I think, which was, for
somewhere like North Korea,

00:33:34.104 --> 00:33:35.770
where dissent is so
quashed, where there

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.990
are no real means that
people can congregate and get

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.070
together, how would you create
some sort of social change

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.335
somewhere like that?

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.960
SRDJA POPOVIC: Of
course there's always

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.009
this theory that this
will never work here,

00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:48.550
because the regime
is too oppressive.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.930
I had a great conversation
with some exiled North Koreans

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.110
recently.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.610
And these are clever forks.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.310
And they understand the things.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.880
And you can look at
the mobilization slash

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.290
provocation tactics
which are recently

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.380
executed by some North
Korean exile guys.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.010
You can look at the brave friend
of mine, Thor Halvorssen, who

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.330
is crazy enough to
use balloons and send

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.580
some content across the border,
which I appreciate very much.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.010
And you can look at
the long term problem.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.260
And I think the long term
problem-- how many of you

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.050
are familiar with the book
or movie called "1984"?

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.280
OK, this is George Orwell.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.908
This is my little bible.

00:34:28.908 --> 00:34:30.699
And one of the things
this movie tells you,

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.120
that the totalitarian
regime tend

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.580
to cut horizontal relationships
between the people,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.270
within the families,
within the community.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.139
So only look up to
the great leader,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.880
or whoever represents
the great leader.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.159
I think the trick
in North Korea,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.489
and places like
North Korea, would be

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.659
to start building small things.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:55.560
If you can organize a movement
in the neighborhood which

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.010
deals with the
question of garbage,

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.590
or whatever is mismanaged--
and there's probably

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.770
like 157 things
which are mismanaged

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.700
in the state of North Korea.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.140
And you can become
successful on building

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.192
on non-political issues.

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.650
One of the things,
tomorrow, or day

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.160
after tomorrow,
the "Politico" will

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.460
run an excerpt of this book.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.620
And they were fascinated with
the story about Harvey Milk.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.330
And that was not a story
about the brave gay man

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.950
who stood up for gay rights.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.930
That's a story about the brave
gay man who was stupid enough

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.850
to lose the election
three times putting

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.790
the topic of his sexuality.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.290
And then he understood that
the thing he should build about

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.370
is a dog's poop.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.690
And it is him
effectively persuading

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.030
people of San Francisco that
whether gay or straight,

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.010
he's the person who is going to
solve the problem of the dog's

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.750
poop.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.180
And this is how he got elected.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.120
And this is exactly
the grand lesson

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.100
of the situation in
places like North Korea.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.250
You pick the topic.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.050
You become successful
around solving this topic.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.589
It's not a political topic.

00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:02.630
Because if you try building
on a political topic,

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.620
you will end up in a
concentration camp.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.800
So this is a stupid way to go.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.770
The cool way to go is to look
at the small things you can do,

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.430
build this horizontal
relationship.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.510
Once you are
becoming successful,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.090
you're building kind of
the level of the success.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.720
More people will join.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.730
Plus you're filling the space
which is completely empty.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.620
The trademark of corrupted
authoritarian regime

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.700
is bad management.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.080
Traffic doesn't function.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.040
Streets are full of the holes.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.120
Nobody gets paid.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.090
I mean, you name
it, you have it.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.490
And you're looking
at these places

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.920
because you can't
protest politically.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.570
Plus because it matters to
the people so much more.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.319
When you talk to the people
from places like North Korea,

00:36:46.319 --> 00:36:47.860
they're far more
concerned about what

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.440
they're going to eat than about
the human rights or whatsoever.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.090
And I think one of
the tricks that you

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.390
will learn through
reading this book is

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.160
that the first
step in organizing

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.885
any nonviolent movement is
go and listen to the people.

00:37:01.885 --> 00:37:04.010
And this is how you
distinguish why the people will

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.140
join the struggle.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.000
And this is when you understand
that your mobilization

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.660
force lies in a dog's
poops of this world

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.600
rather than the big idea of
the free media and democracy

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.410
and stuff like that,
which we in the West--

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.760
and I include
Serbia in the West--

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.580
tend to selfishly thing
that we know what they need.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.820
But we want to go
and listen to what

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.340
they need rather than that,
and help them build around

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.185
what they need.

00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:31.870
At the end of the
day, if they develop

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.070
these horizontal relationships,
they will gain power.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.300
And once they understand
that they are powerful,

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.370
then the regime will
be in deep trouble.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.424
SCOTT CARPENTER: From
your lips to God's ears.

00:37:43.424 --> 00:37:45.340
All right, so why don't
we take these last two

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.050
questions together,
so you, and then you,

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.570
and then you can answer them
both, or not answer them

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.420
at all, whatever you choose.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.245
SRDJA POPOVIC: Hi.

00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:54.995
I also found this talk
really fascinating.

00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:57.328
And I'm looking forward to
getting sucked into your book

00:37:57.328 --> 00:37:59.640
on the subway in the mornings.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.500
So my question is
about in 2013, there

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.896
was a big email leak,
the Stratfor emails,

00:38:04.896 --> 00:38:06.270
which strongly
suggested that you

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.980
had a very close relationship
with a company that

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.670
has reputation for being a
very dodgy corporate security

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.240
agency.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.530
I'm wondering if you could
elaborate on your relationship

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.860
with Stratfor and how
you think that relates

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.430
to grassroots social democracy.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.290
Thanks.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.010
SCOTT CARPENTER:
All right, and--

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:29.100
SRDJA POPOVIC: And I'm going to
try to put two questions there.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.850
I'm going to be cheeky.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.090
First one, you mentioned
technology and horizontal

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.680
sharing and so forth.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.300
Given that governments and
dictators and intelligence

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.580
agencies are basically
not only catching up,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.920
but are the leaders
now in the technology,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.280
do you think that's going
to hurt future revolutions?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.890
And the second one may
be a bit closer to home.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.830
It seems that in the
former Yugoslavia,

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.850
there's more popularity
now for the parties

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.490
than were in power in the '90s.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.790
What's your view on
that and how that's

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.560
going to impact the next
five to 10 years there?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.340
SRDJA POPOVIC: OK, so let's
start with the domestic issues.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.440
It's a normal process that
within the two or three

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.480
electoral cycles, the
old guys get elected.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.140
What I'm really thrilled
about is that in my country,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.220
these people became
electable only

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.320
when they embraced
the very values we

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.860
were fighting for in 2000.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.170
So you look at
Otpor! as a movement,

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:33.870
and you say, this movement was
about peace with neighbors,

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.830
being a part of
the European Union,

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:41.890
and, of course, the very idea
of democratic freedom of press,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.200
freedom of assembly,
freedom for elections.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.525
It was when the parties
who are now in power

00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:50.990
embraced these values that
they became electable.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.710
And I think one of the
things which distinguishes

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.630
successful revolutions
from successful turnovers

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.630
not followed with
successful transitions

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.290
is on what you focus.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.490
And if you're focusing like
in Egypt on replacing Mubarak,

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.380
then you maybe end up
with Sisi, who is either

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.690
same or worse as Mubarak.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.030
Whereas if we were building a
struggle on the values in terms

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.850
of, this is what we stand
for, it is very likely

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.590
that these values will
prevail on the society whoever

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.710
sits on the top of the pyramid.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.430
On the topic of
Stratfor and leaks,

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.700
I've done one presentation
with these guys, which

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.640
looks very much like
this, though the venue was

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.870
a little bit less fancy.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.090
And I have a friend
working there.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:41.730
And I think the big idea of
evil secret services being

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:45.360
around anything is exactly
the public narrative

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.890
we want to kill with this book.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.050
And I think the very obsession
with conspiracy theories

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.890
and the fact that
everybody believes

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.760
that there is this super
successful secret service who

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.060
are pulling the
strings everywhere

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.990
and understand the
stuff, they often

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.840
can't find their own nose.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.250
So in my experience, I would
speak with about everybody.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.240
I will give a
presentation to CIA.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.190
I will give a
presentation to KGB.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.040
I would give the
presentation to FSB.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.040
And I'll give the
presentation to Google.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.130
If there is one single
person in the audience

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.560
I can persuade in an
organization like Stratfor

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.390
or CIA that it is the people
who make the change, not

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.410
the military, that it is the
people you should invest into,

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:39.414
not elites, and the only way
to do the durable change is

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:41.330
actually to work with
the people on the ground

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.954
and appreciate the
people on the ground

00:41:42.954 --> 00:41:46.880
and empower the people on the
ground, I would rather do that.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.310
So that's my point of view.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.330
I will speak to the
very devil in order

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:56.080
to persuade the devil that
things should be changed.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.050
And last but not of
least importance--

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.990
to this question of technology.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.140
And I spent 20 minutes
speaking with Dan

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.270
about this in the podcast.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.870
I will try to be fast.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.240
Modern technology is super
effective in some kind

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.230
of stuff.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.050
And there's this super
cool guy call Clay Shirky.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.590
And you should watch his talk
called "Here Comes Everybody."

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.900
He's very, very enthusiastic
about how the technology can

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.586
bring about the mobilization.

00:42:21.586 --> 00:42:23.210
And we had a great
discussion about it.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.555
And I think technology does
three things very well.

00:42:26.555 --> 00:42:30.380
It makes thing faster,
cheaper, more safe.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.440
B, it puts a huge
price tag on violence

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.490
over the demonstrators.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:38.167
Because even in a low-tech
society like Bahrain,

00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:39.250
you see the demonstration.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.070
There's like 50 people taping.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.870
So it would be very difficult
to hide any kind of attempt

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.460
to do something nasty.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.100
And last but not of least
importance in my case,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.040
it enables you to learn.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.245
So where this is the horizontal
learning, online learning,

00:42:56.245 --> 00:43:00.250
this enables activists to
connect on the learning point.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.120
Also, technology comes
with a big price.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.440
First, we get too obsessed.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.420
In the technological world,
as my co-writer Matt Miller

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.680
would say, everything is
about the shares and clicks.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.070
So if you have a really
cool viral video where

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.104
you're mocking your dictator,
and you get 5 million clicks,

00:43:16.104 --> 00:43:17.770
then you really think
that you're really

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.480
on the top of the pyramid.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.990
And that brings you to
the Kony 2012 campaign,

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.590
which was probably the most
successful public awareness

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.785
raising online campaign ever.

00:43:27.785 --> 00:43:30.130
But Kony, where is Kony?

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.060
He's in Uganda with
his soldiers army.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.520
OK, so when you're
looking at the effects,

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.280
effects should be made
in the real world,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.690
rather than being too
obsessed with the effects

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.355
in the virtual world.

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:43.855
We call this
phenomenon clicktivism.

00:43:43.855 --> 00:43:46.910
And it often says, you know,
I clicked on this page.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.860
I save one polar bear every
day like over my coffee.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.770
But the one which
I really, really

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.430
consider dangerous, and
dangerous misunderstanding,

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.010
I think, is the phenomenon
we call occupyism.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.860
It has nothing to do with the
social values of Occupy Wall

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.520
Street.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.010
It has to do with the
very, very stupid intention

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:12.240
of the movements to copy/paste
the most dangerous, most

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.065
demanding, and very,
very risky tactics

00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:17.780
of occupying symbolic
public space.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.770
We could see this in Hong Kong.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.680
We want to protest,
we must occupy.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.180
Why the hell we must occupy?

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.160
There's so many other
things we can do.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.010
We can whistle.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:27.190
We can hit pots and pans.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.240
We can wear symbols.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.860
We can organize parties.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.507
We can vote.

00:44:30.507 --> 00:44:31.340
We can do petitions.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.360
There's around 200
different things

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.300
we can do instead of putting
all of our parts into one place

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.160
and waiting for police to come.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.730
Plus, if we repeat this every
day, we become predictable.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.630
Plus, if we repeat
this every day,

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.920
where will the people go
to the toilet on day seven?

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.660
How is this square going
to look on day nine?

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.780
How the people will get
thrilled once the rain starts.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.484
What about the rugby game?

00:44:57.484 --> 00:44:58.650
People don't think about it.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.580
They get too thrilled.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.770
But I think it's a seduction
of the new media, which

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:08.860
enables you to gather
your number too fast.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.420
It's like one thing if you
can assemble numbers quickly.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.800
But if you assemble these
numbers before you're ready,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.080
it's also a very,
very big threat,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.430
not only because there will
be five drunk idiots who

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.500
will start throwing
Molotovs and destroy

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.250
your beautiful demonstration,
but because occupation

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.900
is such a risky and
demanding tactic.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.730
And you want this tactic not
before you're ready, only

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:32.480
at the end game.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.230
Then you do the
concentration tactics.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.940
SCOTT CARPENTER:
Well, please join me

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.935
in thanking Srdja
for his talk today.

00:45:39.935 --> 00:45:40.998
We really appreciate it.

00:45:40.998 --> 00:45:44.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.940
I also would like
Srdja's co-author

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:52.680
to stand up, and also for
the folks from Oslo Freedom

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.930
Forum who are here.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.730
If you're here, please stand up.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.074
We'd love to congratulate you.

00:45:58.074 --> 00:45:59.740
SRDJA POPOVIC:
[BLOWS KISS] We love you.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.115
SCOTT CARPENTER:
Yeah, fantastic.

00:46:01.115 --> 00:46:02.284
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:02.284 --> 00:46:06.640
All right, again,
Srdja is somebody

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.604
who we've known for
a long time and has

00:46:08.604 --> 00:46:10.770
been really helpful in
helping us think through some

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.250
of the challenges
that we face, and what

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.360
we can do with our technology
and our skills, abilities,

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.630
to help in this cat and mouse
game that people like Srdja

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:22.450
face.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.220
So again, we're up
on the 15th floor.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.440
Come find us some time.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.106
All right, thanks
again, everybody.

00:46:28.106 --> 00:46:28.606
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:28.606 --> 00:46:30.034
SRDJA POPOVIC: Thank you.

00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:30.867
Thank you so much.

00:46:30.867 --> 00:46:32.200
SCOTT CARPENTER: Thank you, man.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.050
It was fun.
