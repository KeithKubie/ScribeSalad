We've been working with parabolas quite a bit. So let's play with some cubic

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.599
functions for a minute. There are two right here. We have the graphs of f of x

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.400
equals x cubed, this green curve, and g of x equals 3x cubed, this red curve.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.580
Now what I'd like you to do is write the equation of a function whose graph

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.790
will lie between these two graphs. And we'll still intersect the origin. We're

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.600
going to call this graph h of x. Let me show you an example of what h of x

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.440
might look like since there are a number of different equations that it could

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.270
be. So h of x might look something like this purple line. Think about how we

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.739
need to stretch or shrink f of x to make it lookmore like h of x.
