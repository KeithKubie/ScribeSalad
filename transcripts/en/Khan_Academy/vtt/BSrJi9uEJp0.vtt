00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:02.806
- [Voiceover] Let's say y is equal to

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:06.223
the natural log of x to the xth power,

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:10.029
and what we wanna do, we wanna find

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.401
the derivative of y with respect to x.

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.777
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:17.332
and see if you can do it.

00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:18.744
So, when you first try to tackle this,

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:20.225
this is a little bit daunting.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:22.866
We know how to take the
derivative of constants

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.184
to some x power, but how
do we take a derivative

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:28.689
of some time of a function, in this case,

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.356
a natural log, to the xth power?

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:33.785
And the answer here is to use some of

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:36.264
our logarithmic properties,
and then we're going to do

00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:38.767
a little bit of implicit differentiation.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.866
So the first thing that we wanna do,

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.319
actually, let me rewrite this
with a little bit of space,

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:47.486
so, this was a natural
log of x to the xth power.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.796
So the first thing, I
wanna get rid of this x

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:55.925
as an exponential, and I wanna be able

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:57.954
to apply the product rule somehow.

00:00:57.954 --> 00:00:59.777
The way we're gonna do that is by taking

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:02.393
the natural log of both sides.

00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:04.613
So take the natural log of both sides,

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:06.405
and you might say, well,
why is that helpful?

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.367
Well, if I'm taking the natural log

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.697
of something to an exponent,
well, this is the same thing,

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.089
actually, let me write this down

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:15.313
as a property that you
may or may not remember

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:16.942
from your logarithmic properties,

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.167
so if I have, I could write log,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:20.778
or I'll just write natural log,

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:25.349
of, if I have natural
log of a to the b power,

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.299
this is the same thing as b
times the natural log of a.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.676
It's just a standard logarithmic property.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.038
And so, by taking the
natural log of both sides,

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.861
this exponent can now become out front

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.052
and scale the natural log function.

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:44.219
So this exponent now, we
can bring that out front,

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.589
and let's just rewrite everything.

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:50.089
So we get the natural log of y

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:56.757
is equal to, so then let
me put that in parentheses,

00:01:56.757 --> 00:01:58.581
so it's the natural log of y,

00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.581
is equal to x, that x is in blue,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.317
x times the natural log times
the natural log, of, sorry,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.710
x times the natural log
of the natural log of x.

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:23.136
The natural log of the natural log of x.

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:26.027
So, there you have it.

00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:27.551
By just taking the
natural log of both sides

00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:29.318
and using this logarithmic property,

00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:31.908
we were able to get that.

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:33.256
Now you're saying, well, gee,

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:37.347
how is this actually
going to be useful for us?

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:38.968
Well now, we can implicitly take

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.683
the derivative of both sides of this.

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:44.445
And actually, let me scoot this over

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.751
to the right a little
bit, just so that we can,

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:50.084
I have space for my derivative operator.

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:54.781
So there you go, scooted that over.

00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.090
And so now, let's take the derivative

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.908
with respect to x of both sides.

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:02.584
So let me, so I'm gonna
take the derivative

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:06.133
with respect to x of the left-hand side

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.383
and of the right-hand side,

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:12.447
and of the right-hand side.

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:15.571
Now, on the left-hand
side, this is going to be,

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:17.563
essentially, an application
of the chain rule.

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:18.877
When you learn implicit differentiation,

00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:20.599
it's really just application
of the chain rule.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.244
It's the derivative of
the outside function

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.948
with respect to to the inside function,

00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:26.290
so the natural log of y with respect to y,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.465
the derivative of that is
just going to be one over y,

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:33.298
one over y times the derivative of

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:37.943
the inside function with respect to x.

00:03:37.943 --> 00:03:39.276
So dy dx, dy dx.

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:46.227
That is going to be equal to,

00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:49.277
well this is going to get
interesting a little bit.

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:54.037
Actually, let me do some stuff
on the side a little bit.

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:56.543
Let me just, the first
thing we wanna do here

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:58.396
is just apply the product rule.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.036
So it's the derivative
of the first expression,

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:04.684
so it's just going to
be 1 times the second,

00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:06.074
I guess you'd say, function,

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:10.093
so times the natural log
of the natural log of x,

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:12.932
natural log of x, and then

00:04:12.932 --> 00:04:15.599
plus the first function, just x,

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.361
times the derivative
of the second function.

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.856
Times the derivative
of the second function.

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.786
What's the derivative of the natural log

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.515
of the natural log of x?

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:31.060
Let's do that separately.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.057
So if I have, if I'm trying
to take the derivative,

00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:38.474
with respect to to x, of the natural log,

00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:44.307
the natural log of the natural log of x,

00:04:44.307 --> 00:04:46.661
of the natural log of x,

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.995
well, here, again, I can
apply the chain rule.

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:50.906
The derivative of that magenta function

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:52.897
with respect to the inside function,

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:57.228
that is going to be one
over the natural log of x,

00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:59.956
and then times the derivative
of the inside function

00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:03.696
with respect to x, so times one over x.

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:07.863
So this is equal to one
over x natural log of x.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.624
So the derivative of this
second function right over here

00:05:13.624 --> 00:05:16.574
is one over x natural log of x,

00:05:16.574 --> 00:05:19.157
one over x natural log of x.

00:05:21.393 --> 00:05:24.429
Let's see, that x and that x cancels out,

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:28.596
and so we are left with, we
are left with one over y,

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.794
and I'll just write all of
this in this blue color,

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:36.044
so one over y times the derivative of y

00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:39.604
with respect to x, is equal to,

00:05:40.493 --> 00:05:44.304
see this is just the natural
log of the natural log of x,

00:05:44.304 --> 00:05:47.637
the natural log of the natural log of x,

00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:52.508
plus one over the natural log of x,

00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:55.008
one over the natural log of x.

00:05:57.827 --> 00:05:58.908
And now, to solve for the derivative,

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:02.797
we can multiply both sides
by y, so let's do that.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:06.133
So we're gonna multiply that side by y,

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:10.389
and we're gonna multiply
this side times y,

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.622
and what are we going to get?

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.256
Well, on the left-hand side,
that's why we multiplied by y,

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:18.786
we just have the derivative
y with respect to x,

00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.743
derivative of y with respect to x,

00:06:21.743 --> 00:06:24.826
is equal to, well, y is our original,

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:31.756
is all this, is our
original thing that we had.

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:33.366
Y was equal to the natural log,

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:35.170
let me rewrite it over here.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.337
Y was equal to the natural
log of x to the xth power.

00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:43.728
So this is, we're essentially
multiplying both sides

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:47.645
times the natural log
of x to the xth power.

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:53.885
So this gonna get a little
bit, a little bit messy here.

00:06:55.462 --> 00:06:59.103
So we could just write it
the way I wrote it just now,

00:06:59.103 --> 00:07:01.380
without it being distributed,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.770
actually, let me just leave it like that.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.612
So it's going to be, and so we deserve

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.606
a drum roll right now, 'cause
this is quite involved,

00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:09.856
the natural log of the natural log of x

00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:14.271
plus one over the natural log of x,

00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:20.504
all of that times the natural
log of x to the xth power.

00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:25.217
So that was quite involved.

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:27.739
And if someone said well,
what is the derivative of y

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.540
when x is equal to e?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.026
So if someone says what is this equal to

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:33.781
when x is equal to e, well,
we could evaluate this

00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:34.849
when x is equal to e.

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.797
This would be the, and I
just made that up just now,

00:07:38.797 --> 00:07:40.405
so if like the original
question wasn't just

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:42.745
what is dy dx, if they said

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:45.912
what is dy dx when x is equal to e.

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:51.388
If that was the original question,

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.410
then we could evaluate it.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.020
So where we just replace
all these with e's,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.853
so it'd be an e there,
an e there, an e there,

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:04.762
and an e there, and I
just picked the value e

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:06.183
'cause it's easy to evaluate.

00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:08.184
So that natural log of e is 1,

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:10.790
natural log of 1 e to
the zeroth power is 1,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.458
so all of that just becomes 0.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.625
The natural log of e is 1,

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.424
so this whole expression right over here

00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:20.342
becomes zero plus one over one,

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:22.242
so this becomes one, and then

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:26.409
the natural log of e is,
the natural log of e is one,

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:29.759
and you're gonna have
one to the eth power,

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.175
well you could raise one to any power,

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:33.572
and you're just get one.

00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:36.497
So it's one times one is equal to one.

00:08:36.497 --> 00:08:37.368
So I just thought it would be fun

00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:39.722
to try to evaluate that at a value

00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:42.139
that would be somewhat clean.
