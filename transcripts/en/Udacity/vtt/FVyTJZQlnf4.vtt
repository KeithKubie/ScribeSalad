00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to do now is look at some of the different kinds of testing that exist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and so what this really is is a very, very brief survey.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's not intended to be exhaustive, and it's not intended 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to give you an orthogonal set of kinds of testing because 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there's going to be a bunch of overlap between these different categories.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What kind of testing you often hear about is white box testing,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and what white box testing refers to is the fact that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the tester is using detailed knowledge about the internals of the system

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in order to construct better test cases.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And in the next unit we're going to really look at white box testing in quite a bit of detail.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The complement to white box testing is black box testing,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and black box testing refers to the fact that we're not using 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
detailed knowledge of the system's internals.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're rather testing the system based on what we know about how 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it's supposed to respond to our test cases.
