00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.929
Jack Kirby was one of the principle minds
and artists behind some of the best known

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.500
comic characters in history, including, among
many others, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.280
X-Men, and Captain America.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.170
Few people realise, though, that like his
most patriotic creation, Kirby spent a good

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.020
portion of WW2 fighting the Nazis as well,
though never managing to duplicate Captain

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.560
America’s feat of punching Hitler in the
face.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.360
Kirby was drafted into the army in June of
1943, just as his comic career was starting

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.239
to gain some serious traction, and was initially
assigned to be trained as a mechanic.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.890
However, according to Kirby’s son, Neal,
his father had absolutely no affinity for

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.989
the finer points of mechanics and spent as
much of his training as possible lying below

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.639
a truck and occasionally smacking it with
a wrench so that it sounded like he was doing

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:55.639
something.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.100
In a rare set of interviews given by Kirby
in the early 1990s, he revealed that one of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.440
the most surprising things about basic training,
other than the difficulty of the training

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.310
itself in those days, was the culture shock
of meeting so many people from so many different

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.590
backgrounds he previously knew little about.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.941
“There were very limited communications:
A telephone was very hard to come by, not

00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:17.941
like today.

00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:22.420
To own an automobile you had to be semi-rich,
and nobody ever took a cab; those were taken

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.740
by rich people too.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740
And airplanes?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.159
We all took trains back then and you only
went on a train when you really had to go

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.509
someplace.”

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.850
One anecdote Kirby remembered fondly was the
time he introduced himself to a Texan as a

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.479
Brooklyn native and the Texan asked him “What’s
a Brooklyn?”

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.820
Likewise, Kirby also expressed shock at hearing
a southern accent for the first time, formerly

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.159
believing that the accent was simply a product
of Hollywood that must have been exaggerated

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.159
in some way.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.240
He stated, “In that particular way, I think
the war did a lot for uniting America; it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.470
was a galvanizing experience.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.860
It united the states because it forced people
to work and live in close quarters with each

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.079
other; it forced us to meet each other on
common terms…”

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.759
jack-kirby3After his basic training, Kirby
was shipped off to what was then known as

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.700
Burma (Myanmar today) where he was given training
in how to become an anti-aircraft gunner.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.170
Training for this included a live fire exercise
in which a gunner crew was asked to shoot

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.140
at banners and flags hung several hundred
feet behind a friendly tow plane.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.520
It’s noted that Kirby’s anti-aircraft
crew were so bad at this that they shot down

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.750
their own friendly pilot, causing him to have
to bail out.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.850
Unsurprisingly, Kirby was soon reallocated
to an infantry division in Eastern Europe

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.980
where he joined the 11th Infantry Regiment.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.820
During his time with the 11th Infantry, Kirby
and his fellow soldiers were subjected to

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.930
no less than 36 separate assaults from the
German army while trying to hold a small section

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.420
of wood bordering the Moselle River in the
North of France.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.220
One notable assault attempt included a large
tank that smashed through the regiment’s

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.810
defensive line, only to be stopped by an unnamed
soldier managing to shoot through the driver’s

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.840
viewing slit, killing him instantly and potentially
saving the life of Kirby who was only feet

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.550
away from its treads in a foxhole.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.850
During another firefight, Kirby got an odd,
seemingly crazy order from another soldier.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.510
He later recounted the story,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.540
“Once during a fight some guy crawled up
to me from the back and he grabbed my feet.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.830
I almost shot his head off.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.020
He said to me, ‘Pick out five men and go
see Marlene Dietrich.’…

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.400
I was at the end of this rock wall and chunks
of it were flying around from 88 shells, the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.900
earth around me was going up in big clots,
all the rest was being pounded by machine

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.980
guns, and I was laying there talking to this
big jerk…

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.650
This guy said, ‘If you don’t want the
detail then I’ll get another guy.’

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.010
I said, ‘All right, all right.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.400
I’ll take the detail.’

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.260
I still didn’t believe this guy, but I picked
out five other guys—they thought I was crazy

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.150
too—and they came along with me.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.530
We crawled about 100 yards and walked another
400 where there was a truck waiting and other

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.730
GIs were getting on.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.840
So these other guys and me got on this truck
and they took us about 7 miles down the road

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
away from the action.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.260
And sure enough, there she was, Marlene Dietrich,
along with Bing Crosby, Martha Raye, and some

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.260
other actors.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.350
They put on a show for us; comedy, Vaudeville
acts, singing, dancing—all that in this

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.350
hell on Earth.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.340
I couldn’t believe it, the guys with me
couldn’t believe it—our jaws must have

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.450
dropped and hit the ground.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.900
After a while I wasn’t even thinking about
the friggin’ war.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.370
At one time Marlene Dietrich came out in GI
underwear and it was crazy as all hell.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.030
Meanwhile the Germans had deepened their defense
and some of the fire reached this little theatre

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.030
they had set up.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.630
A shell hit not far away, I felt the concussion,
and we all expected to be called back to the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.500
action, but the show went on.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.540
Bombs fell closer and gunfire got clearer,
and all the while these actors kept the show

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.570
going as if nothing else mattered.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.250
It was a real morale booster for us.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.440
It upped my respect for these performers immensely;
for all performers everywhere—they were

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.030
really what they said they were, real troupers.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.680
There they were right up near the line; I
mean, how far is 7 miles?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.180
They took the risk almost as much as the soldiers
did.”

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.710
Kirby’s position while serving with the
regiment was that of a scout, regarded as

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.440
one of the most dangerous jobs a soldier could
have.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.711
His basic duties involved sneaking ahead into
unknown territory and drawing maps for the

00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.000
allies to use.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.430
Kirby would later recall of all this, “If
somebody wanted to kill you, they made you

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.430
a Scout.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.430
So, I was a Scout.”

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.710
So how did he get the unenviable gig?

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.750
According to Kirby, he became a Scout shortly
after a Lieutenant learned his last name and

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.010
asked if he was the Jack Kirby.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.060
Kirby enthusiastically responded “Yes sir.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.310
I drew Captain America,” believing that
the Lieutenant probably just wanted his portrait

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.780
drawn or something.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.100
Instead, the Lieutenant, now knowing about
Kirby’s artistic abilities, made him a Scout,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.870
telling him “You go into these towns that
we don’t have and see if there is anybody

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.870
there.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.600
Draw maps and pictures of what you see and
come back and tell us if you find anything.”

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.510
During one scouting mission, Kirby recalled
that he was started by a rustling noise only

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.090
to find it was just a dog.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.080
It was a great big hound that was badly injured;
it was cut and burned all over…

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.970
It stopped in front of me and just stared.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.860
It didn’t growl or whimper, it just looked
at me with these deep accusing eyes; it was

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.080
the most human expression I have ever seen
on an animal.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.670
It was like he was saying, “You, you did
this to me!”

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.290
Oh, I felt so guilty.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.790
I felt just terrible and so hurt, because
to me it was like an accusation by a dumb

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.780
creature that didn’t care why I was there
or anything about the Germans.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.270
All he knew was that I was there and he was
hurting; that’s all this animal knew.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.350
All this was happening around him and even
though I had nothing to do with it, I’m

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.350
still the cause.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.270
I didn’t have the courage to look this beast
in the eyes any longer.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.000
I lowered my rifle and it limped past me out
of the wreckage and onto the road.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.480
He kept giving me these dirty looks, terrible
dirty looks.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.150
I think I stood there for several more minutes
before I continued my sweep.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.070
On another occasion, he got into a fire fight
with a German soldier who’d made fun of

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.070
his mother.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.580
Most Americans have an image of war—especially
that war—that it was a carefully planned

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.090
event; groups of men—groups of professional
fighting men—going up against other professional

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.950
soldiers, moving in columns, aiming their
rifles, all under the orders of their commanding

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.950
officers.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.389
Well, let me say that guys are guys no matter
what the circumstances may be and different

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.669
rules apply.

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.440
We called each other names all the time; we
were cursing each other in English, German,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.910
French, Hebrew; I had quite a large vocabulary
by the time I got back—I could cuss somebody

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.820
out in four different languages.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.060
Sometimes a shot was never fired but we’d
still be yelling at each other to ‘go to

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.760
hell’ or ‘go sh*t on yourself’; but
you never said anything about somebody’s

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.230
mother, not unless you wanted somebody to
take a potshot at you.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.810
And that’s exactly what he did,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.910
I entered a street and somebody from a window
started calling me all kinds of names in German,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.910
and he was laughing.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.090
“I’m going to kill you,” he said.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.270
“I’m going to shoot you right in the face.”

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.850
I stepped back against the wall and pulled
back the bolt on my machine gun.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.700
I was ready to wait this guy out, but then
he said something about my mother.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.280
I forget what, but it gets me pissed—I mean
really pissed—so I stood back and began

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.630
spraying where this voice has been calling.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.650
Then he started spraying me and soon the whole
street is riddled with bullets.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.500
I guess there was more than one guy because
I could hear them running through the buildings.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.740
We all ran like hell, but I never saw these
guys.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.290
I think I hit two of them, but I didn’t
stick around to count.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.790
I ran like crazy, the whole place was filled
up with flying stuff.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.540
There’s also a persistent rumor that Kirby
ambushed three Nazis and killed them all with

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.620
a knife, but Kirby himself never confirmed
this story in any of the interviews he gave

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.960
about his time in the war, nor could we find
any well documented evidence to support the

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.340
rumor, so the veracity of the tale is somewhat
questionable.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.070
jack-kirby2Kirby’s military service came
to an end when he got frostbite on both of

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.720
his feet during an unforgiving European winter.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.110
“Don’t think I just got nippity-ippity
frozen—they were frozen.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.600
It took them a year to even get back some
of the original color.”

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.010
After spending this year recovering and barely
avoiding having his feet amputated, Kirby

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.010
was sent home.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.250
Funny enough, Kirby missed the transport ship
meant to take him home in a mere three day

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.130
journey because he got a cold.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.769
As a result, he had to return to the states
in a lumbering hospital tug boat.

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:47.110
To add insult to injury, he noted that he
mostly starved on the nine day trip back,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.540
suffering from intense sea-sickness that made
it almost impossible to keep any food down.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.019
Though he didn’t complain, “many men lost
limbs, some lost part of their faces.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:59.569
I saw guys with half a face; one you could
look inside part of his head.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:03.119
And I saw a lot of guys who were scarred deeply
in other ways.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.100
Listen, I was doing all right compared to
most of the other guys.”

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.809
He went on to say, “There is nothing that
you would call romantic about war.

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.439
Sure, in the movies and on television they
paint a great picture of the fellowship that

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:14.439
it creates.

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:19.129
I’ve seen war bring lots of people together,
but I can tell you that the cost is extremely

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:22.680
high: Not just in terms of lives, but in the
human spirit.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.180
I think that we are diminished by war; our
character as a race is somehow reduced by

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.149
each war that we allow to happen.

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:33.410
Hitler had to be destroyed, there was no choice
and I was glad to do my duty—but if there

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.209
were another way to bring him down I would
have preferred it.”

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.689
After returning to the states, Kirby picked
up his career where it had left off and went

00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:43.130
on to become one of the most prolific comic
creators in history.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.980
As famed comic book artist Gil Kane noted
of Kirby,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.670
Jack was the single most influential figure
in the turnaround in Marvel’s fortunes from

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.999
the time he rejoined the company … It wasn’t
merely that Jack conceived most of the characters

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:58.100
that are being done, but … Jack’s point
of view and philosophy of drawing became the

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.500
governing philosophy of the entire publishing
company and, beyond the publishing company,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.759
of the entire field … [Marvel took] Jack
and use[d] him as a primer.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:10.450
They would get artists … and they taught
them the ABCs, which amounted to learning

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.729
Jack Kirby.

00:10:11.729 --> 00:10:16.040
… Jack was like the Holy Scripture and they
simply had to follow him without deviation.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.999
That’s what was told to me … It was how
they taught everyone to reconcile all those

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:27.730
opposing attitudes to one single master point
of view.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:35.819
Kirby was born Jacob Kurtzberg before changing
his name to Jack Kirby, which he reportedly

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:41.860
chose because it reminded him of Jimmy Cagney,
an actor he was fond of.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.249
There’s also a rumor that Kirby changed
his name because his original name sounded

00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:52.189
“too Jewish”, but Kirby himself has always
denied this.

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:56.699
In 1979, Jack Kirby teamed up with the CIA
and the make-up artist from Planet of the

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:59.920
Apes as part of something now known as “The
Canadian Caper”.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.930
In a nutshell, Kirby was asked to create a
bunch of concept art for a non-existent sci-fi

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.100
movie called Argo which was used as cover
to rescue some hostages.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.949
This story was later adapted into the Oscar
winning, albeit wildly inaccurate, film starring

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:41.539
Ben Affleck.
