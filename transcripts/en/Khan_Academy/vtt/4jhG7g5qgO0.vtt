00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.370
Simplify 4a squared b
and this whole quantity

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.487
is being raised to
the third power.

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.070
Now here, we'll just
use the property.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.080
If we have the
product of things--

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.500
so let's say I have a times
b-- and I'm raising that

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.850
to some power n,
this is just going

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.376
to be equal to a to
the n times b to the n.

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:22.190
And to realize why
that happens, let's

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.930
just try it out with
a simple example.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.194
If I have a times b
to the third power,

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:32.610
what is that going
to be equal to?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.840
That is going to be
equal to a times b--

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.580
that to the first power--
then times a times b--

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.760
that's to the second
power-- times a times b--

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.060
that's to the third power.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.610
That's exactly what--
we're literally

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.240
taking this expression and
multiplying by itself three

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.350
times.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.740
Now, we can just swap
these around because

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.840
of the commutative and
the associative properties

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.399
of multiplication.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.940
So if we just swap
these around, just

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.980
change the order that
we're multiplying,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.820
we can rewrite this as a
times a times a times b times

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.430
b times b.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.630
We have three a's
here, three b's.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530
And so this over here is
going to be a to the third,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.010
and this right
over here is going

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.800
to be equal to b to third.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.950
So we have a to the third
times b to the third.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.720
So it worked, and
so hopefully that

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.980
gives you a sense of
why this property holds.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.600
Now, let's apply it
to the actual problem.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.750
So we have 4a squared
b to the third power.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.550
That means that each of these
components in the product

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.420
are going to be raised
to the third power.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.890
So that means it equals
4 to the third power

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.240
times a squared to
the third power times

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.516
b to the third power.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:41.390
Let me color code it.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.120
This third power
here in magenta,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.510
that's this third
power over here.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.990
I'm just raising-- instead
of taking the product first

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.910
and then raising that
to the third power,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.020
I can take each of the
terms in the product, each

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.940
of the numbers in the
product, and raise those

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.490
to the third power first
and then take the product.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.620
So that's what we're doing.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.911
And let's try to simplify this.

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:05.720
So what is 4 to the third power?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.039
4 to the first is 4,
4 to the second is 16,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.979
and then we want to
multiply 16 times 4.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.200
So 4 to the third power, which
is 4 times 4 times 4, is 64.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.030
And then we have
a squared, and we

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.680
are raising that
to the third power.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380
Well, we know from
the product property

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.850
of exponents, that's going to
be a to the 2 times 3 power,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.890
or a to the sixth power.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.840
So this is a to the sixth power.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130
We got 6 from 2 times 3.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.905
And then finally, we just
have the b to the third power.

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:39.800
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.655
We just have the b
to the third power,

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.250
and we'll just
write it over here.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.510
So we simplify this
expression to 64 a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.469
to the sixth b to
the third power.
