00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.330
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good evening.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.540
I'm Karen Lloyd, as director
of the Veterans History Project

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.460
and as a retired army aviator,
and I'm also the widow, sibling

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.670
and child of veterans, I am
so pleased to welcome you,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.160
especially the veterans,
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.430
The Library makes a special
effort this week in particular

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.310
to honor and recognize
veterans and their families

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.800
and explore the ways military
men and women have connected

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.710
to home and family during and
after service from World War I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.530
through the current conflicts.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.860
We are proud to collaborate
with our colleagues

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.460
in the publishing office in the
Kluge Center to offer a series

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.050
of events titled "Coming
Home: Veterans Day

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.590
at the Library of Congress".

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.490
Out where the book
sales are occurring,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.970
you will find a handy card.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.870
Handy card, with all
this week's programs,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.180
I ask you to consider coming
back for the ones on Saturday.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120
Many of which align
with our exhibit

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.010
"Echoes of the Great War".

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.180
This exhibit examines the
upheaval of the World War

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.530
as Americans confronted it,
both at home and abroad.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.200
Located in the Jefferson
Building,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.010
it is compellingly
rendered offering glimpses

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.650
of the human condition,
transcendent of time and place,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.770
in part through over
30 collections

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.500
from the Veterans
History Project.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.910
Also, please take a copy of the
Library's magazine which focus

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.260
in part on the Veterans History
Project and our collections.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.050
The Veterans History
Project provides inspiration

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.350
and instruction to foster
nationwide volunteer effort

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.990
for individuals to reach out
to the veterans in their lives

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.930
and communities and
listen, really listen,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.240
and then donate those
oral histories

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.390
in first person narratives of
their veterans from World War I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.220
through the current conflicts.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.170
Veterans like Mr. Reston who
graciously donated his interview

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.830
to VHP this afternoon.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.730
And who my esteemed
colleague Betsy Clark--

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.810
Becky Clark will share
more about shortly.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.110
Becky?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.370
&gt;&gt; Becky Clark: Thank you Karen.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.960
Before we get started, I
just want to let you know

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.790
that we're recording this
for further distribution

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.400
on the Library's website
so if you do have a device

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.240
that makes noise and can
take a moment of silence,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.620
so we certainly would
appreciate it.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.450
My name is Becky
Brasington Clark.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870
I'm director of the Library
of Congress Publishing Office

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.860
and I'm delighted
to be here tonight.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.850
I want to thank the
Veterans History Project

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.030
and the John W. Kluge Center
for hosting this book talk

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.870
with James Reston, Jr., author
of "A Rift in the Earth: Art,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.810
Memory and the Fight for
Vietnam War Memorial."

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.100
Jim conducted a great
deal of his research

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.870
for this book during his
term as a Kluge fellow.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170
He came to the publishing
office at the suggestion

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.510
of Kluge's own, Mary Lou Reker
who's in the audience tonight,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.020
who encouraged Jim to ask
us if we might work with him

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.980
to develop his manuscript.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.800
Managing Editor Peggy
Wagner, also in the audience,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.480
shared my opinion that
his proposal looked wildly

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.810
promising, and Jim spent the
next few months in our office

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.970
as Senior Editor Susan Rayburn,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.570
Editorial Assistant Hannah
Freece, both in the audience,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.140
and Photo Researcher Athena
Angelos, worked with him

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.460
to sculpt the work that has
subsequently earned endorsements

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.640
from Ken Burns, John Kerry,
John McCain, James Fallows

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.150
and Bobbie Ann Mason,
not a bad lineup.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.650
So the other day, I was puzzling
over how best to introduce Jim,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.770
when a college friend
posted on Facebook a photo

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.640
from "The Fall of 1980".

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.340
There I am, wearing dark
glasses and a funny hat engaged

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.950
in some silly doo wop
dance with my buddies

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.800
in the hall of our dorm.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.070
We are coffee guzzling
super nerds,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.680
probably taking a
late night break

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.410
from the books to
blow off steam.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.180
I can't tell you for certain

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.200
because I have absolutely
no memory of this event.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.770
It undoubtedly happened
because there's a picture of it,

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.320
but it hasn't been part
of my history before now

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.550
because it hadn't-- had
had no place in my memory.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.640
There I was and there it
is, a sliver of my own past,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.130
commemorated in a photo unseen
by me over the ensuing 37 years.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.160
As it turns out, the
competition to design a memorial

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.980
to the Vietnam War opened about
a month after that dorky photo

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.420
of me was taken and
as you'll discover

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.140
in Jim's wonderful new book,
the history of that competition

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.270
and the resulting art
wars over the selection

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.560
of Maya Lin's design have
also been hidden from view

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.170
for the past three decades.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.280
Today, we know the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial is simply the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.900
wall, not just a structure
but a deeply moving experience

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.890
that attracts three
million visitors annually.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.000
Many, if not most
of those visitors,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.250
are unaware of the
roiling controversy

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.320
that accompanied the
selection of Maya Lin's design

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.010
and the fact that
a vigorous campaign

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.250
to stop it almost succeeded.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.850
"A Rift in the Earth" uncovers
that history and recounts it

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.780
in a vivid narrative that
reflects the difficulty

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.130
of honoring those who fought
and died in an unconventional

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.500
and deeply unpopular war.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.530
In the process, Jim Reston
forces us to confront some

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.280
of the unreliable and
very human dynamics

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.270
that shape our perceptions of
reality and history, memory,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.490
perspective, opinion and taste,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.160
the book's greatest
revelation may be

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.340
that the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial is the result

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.040
of a difficult compromise
a forced marriage

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.770
of two very different
artistic visions.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.270
"A Rift in the Earth"
underscores this compromise

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.350
as an impulse not of
resignation but of generosity.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.210
Two very different pieces of
art share one public space,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.740
reminding us so many years later
of the importance of making room

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.620
for opinions, we neither
understand nor trust.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.270
James Reston, Jr. was an
assistant to Secretary

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.620
of the Interior Stewart Udall
before serving in the US Army

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.350
in the Vietnam era
from 1965 to 1968.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.830
He is the bestselling
author of 17 books including

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.440
"The Conviction of Richard
Nixon: The Untold Story

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.780
of the Frost/Nixon Interviews"

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.140
which helped inspire
the 2008 film,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.420
Frost/Nixon in which
Jim had a walk-on role.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.400
He's also written three
plays and numerous articles

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.230
in "The New Yorker",
"Vanity Fair"

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.440
and "The New York
Times" magazine.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.390
He won the Prix Italia and
the Dupont-Columbus Award

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.560
for his NPR radio
documentary, "Father Cares:

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.680
The Last of Jonestown".

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.510
It is a deep pleasure
to introduce Jim Reston.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:18.800
[ Applause ]

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.040
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: So who
said you can't come home again?

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.560
[Laughter] This is
an inside joke

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.900
between two North
Carolinians here.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.540
So, this book is totally
a product of the Library

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.860
of Congress and how
did it come to be.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.300
Well, two-- more
than two years ago,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.100
I had the idea of
a dual biography.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.030
I had done dual biographies
before, Pete Rose

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.620
and Bart Giamatti, Su,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.880
and Richard the Lionheart
and Saladin.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.170
So the form of two competing
figures interested me a lot

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.050
and I thought perhaps
this might work.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.950
Beyond that, the whole
matter of reconciliation

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.860
after divisive war is something
that is deep in my thinking

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.410
over the last 40 years or so.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.590
My first book was a novel

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.910
that very much was a
Vietnam generation novel

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.070
with all the angst
that that can have.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.900
My first nonfiction book was a
tale of the return of a deserter

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.970
from Paris to become
moral test on the morality

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.690
or immorality of
the Vietnam War.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.840
And then in 1985, there was
"Sherman's March and Vietnam",

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.810
which focused on the
historical parallel

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.200
between the post civil war
era and the post Vietnam era.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.760
So, reconciliation is an
enduring passion of mine,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.590
but would anybody be
interested in this old tale

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.120
of a memorial in Washington?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.020
My agent was profoundly
disinterested in the whole thing

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.980
but then several things
happened along the way.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:31.880
First, it was that I came to a
lecture here on Martin Luther.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.330
That was the subject of
my book before this one

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.170
and there encountered
Mary Lou Reker.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:43.290
And I told her what was on
my mind and bless her heart,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.730
she said, well, why don't
you come to the Kluge Center

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.530
as a visiting fellow
and work on it here.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.130
That was a fabulous invitation.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.430
Because as I started to look
into the treasures that are here

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.500
in the Library of Congress,
the 80 or more boxes

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.950
of original primary
material for--

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:17.620
from the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund, 1421 submissions

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.250
for this incredible commission.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:28.480
The historical record was so
deep and it had to be ferreted

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.840
out in the various divisions
at the Library of Congress

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.210
and newspaper divisions
and motion picture,

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.930
the recorded sound, the
prints and photographs.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:49.860
So, this was an absolute gift,
not only of a place to write

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:55.180
but also with these
primary sources right there

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.340
at your fingertips.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.350
And then I heard that there was
going to be a documentary come

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.020
out about the Vietnam War.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.740
I actually encounter the
adviser at Dartmouth College,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.660
who was an adviser to Ken Burns.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.000
And he asserted that the
Ken Burns' documentary

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.500
on the Vietnam War would
exceed the reputation

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.040
of Ken Burns' Civil War series.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.040
So I asked a critical
question, well,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.920
when is this documentary
series going to come out.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.870
And he said, well, it
would be two years.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.380
And I thought ah-hah,
that's about the time

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.770
that it takes me
to write a book.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.340
And so I'm happy to
report to you that "A Rift

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.230
in the Earth" was published the
day before the first segment

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.630
of the Ken Burns
documentary series.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.480
That's not so easy to accomplish

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.470
as an author, I want
you to know.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.800
So, there were these
nine months or so time

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.760
in the wonderful space of the
Kluge Center with Mary Lou

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.830
and the other really, very,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.240
very interesting
scholars all around me.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.860
It was perfect working place.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.920
And I ended up with a manuscript

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.660
that needed a little
bit of work.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:33.480
And that's how Becky Clark
came into the picture,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.260
absolutely embracing
this notion.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.070
But beyond that,
offering me more

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.550
of these wonderful resources
at the Library of Congress

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:54.600
and absolutely brilliant editor
by the name of Su Rayburn.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.730
A ferocious, ferocious
fact checker and researcher

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.300
by the name of Hanna Freece,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.710
a very professional photo
researcher and of course we had

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:14.680
to call down from the 1421
submissions to listening

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.910
down to a gallery
of photographs.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:26.440
So, it took a village and that's
how the manuscript was then

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.010
readied for submission
to New York.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.180
And it was certainly a
new experience for our--

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.780
my very fine editor in New York
to receive a manuscript that was

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.210
so perfect, you know,

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:47.300
that needed very little
editing on his part.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.750
So, that worked very
well indeed.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:02.010
Now, we are going through this
most extraordinary experience

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.980
with this Ken Burns series,
this national reconsideration

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.110
of the Vietnam War, the
first American defeat

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:19.510
in its national history
portrayed in such graphic detail

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.460
that it is my view that
that war will never again

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.050
so graphically chronicled,
the horror, the loss,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.920
the resistance to the war.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.260
And I have done little
bit of talking about this

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.600
around the country and when
there are people under 40

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.910
in the audience who
hopefully watched a little bit

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:50.960
of the Ken Burns thing, it
seems to me they must think

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.390
that the America
that's portrayed

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.420
in that series is
something on Mars or Pluto

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.720
or something like that.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.940
It is just so far
from the experience

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.820
that the current younger
generation has had.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.800
Well, I've been strongly arguing

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.890
that there's not one
Vietnam War, but two.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:23.190
The first began in
1959 and ended in 1975.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:29.900
The second Vietnam War began
in 1979 and is going on still,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.460
because we're still
fighting over the issues

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.520
that the Vietnam War raises,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.150
who is to blame, who
is to blame more?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.540
Was it a dishonorable
enterprise?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.330
Was it immoral or
was it a noble cause?

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:52.490
Was it a dismal mistake or
was it a fine upstanding fight

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.790
for a beleaguered small nation

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.170
that was being attacked
from elsewhere?

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:06.450
These questions are carrying
on as we speak and will--

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:12.320
I think the resonance of the
Ken Burns serious and the books

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.030
about Vietnam that
are published now,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.910
will continue this very
interesting debate that's going

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.990
on about what the Vietnam
experience amounted to.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.800
My preoccupation
is my generation.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.090
And the choices that that
generation faced to serve

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:45.140
or to avoid service, to flee
to Canada, to avoid it legally

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.740
or in a suspect sort of
way, to get out of it.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.790
So, for all of us, all of us

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.800
who face those choices,
it's personal.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.120
It's personal.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.750
Every one of that
generation has a story.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:11.690
It includes the women
obviously and so,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:19.110
many of us faced moral dilemmas
in that war and in that era.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:24.720
My personal decision had
involved three years of service

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.910
in army intelligence,
but I would have to say

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.550
of my very distinguished
class at the University

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:39.890
of North Carolina, I know of
none who went into the military.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:47.890
All of them virtually avoided
and now in their older age,

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.030
I experience not
infrequently a kind

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.500
of quiet guilt amongst those
who avoided it as if, you know,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.830
this was the war
of our generation

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.040
and I was not a participant.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:16.070
The statistics are revealing
26 million men were eligible,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:26.130
15.4 that is the majority of
those eligible, were deferred,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.490
exempted, disqualified
or avoided it

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.580
in some way or another.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:39.400
Two million were deployed to
Vietnam, 58,000 died as we know,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.400
but what we don't
talk about as much is

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.340
that 300,000 were wounded.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.740
There were something
like five million gallons

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.330
of Agent Orange dioxin
dumped on that landscape

00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:02.760
and 245,000 men have applied for
disability from Agent Orange.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.790
Eight million tons of ordinance
were dropped on Vietnam,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.280
many of that, of those
bombs remain unexploded

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.030
and 8,000 Vietnamese
have died from unexploded

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.630
or from unexploded
ordinance that exploded

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.530
for them including a
number of children,

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.070
two million Vietnamese died.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:33.680
There are no statistics on
how many of those who were

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.980
in Vietnam suffer from
psychological difficulties.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.480
There were 50,000 exiles
to Canada and Sweden.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.980
This is the cost of war
for that generation.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.450
So the question that
that generation asks

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:03.060
or either quietly or when they
are confronted, what did you do?

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.940
What are you proud of?

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.490
What are you sorry for?

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:13.300
What stirs you or
makes you angry?

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.900
What do you admire and
what do you deplore?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.360
So, for the women, who
do they sympathize with,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.920
the fighting men or
the resistor or what?

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:38.370
So, this was your generation's
war, did you participate?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.990
So I operated on both
sides of this thing.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:46.970
I had those three years
in the army by chance.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.730
I was not deployed to
Vietnam, but I happened to run

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.450
into a letter that was an
exchange between myself

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.140
and the recruiter for army
intelligence back in 1965

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.860
who said, yes, we'll be glad
to have you in the program

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.960
that you want and then take--
send you to language school

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.220
but it'd probably be Vietnamese.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.800
It turned out by
chance to be Japanese.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.950
So that's just with
the luck of the draw.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.610
But those three years gave
me an enduring sympathy

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.630
for the soldier,
for the fighting men

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.400
in harms way no matter
what the war is.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.580
I then became very
deeply involved

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.960
in the whole amnesty movement
for-- it's the Vietnam exiles.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.800
Could they come home?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.060
Under what circumstances
could they come home?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.360
Would they have to admit

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.660
that they did something
wrong to come home?

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.740
That was the nature of
the original pardons

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.630
by Jimmy Carter, was a
pardon and it is at the base

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.460
of the concept of pardon that
you have done something wrong

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.540
for which you must be pardoned.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.420
That's why the term amnesty
was so important to those

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:19.490
who were trying to
get the exiles home.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.880
So, over two years ago,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:29.650
I happened on to this remarkable
story that brought these issues

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.640
into play in a very fresh
and different way I thought.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.310
It was a drama over
a work of art.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.240
And I had never written
about art before.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.830
It had and has a
fascinating set of characters.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:53.390
It involves profound
questions about patriotism,

00:22:53.390 --> 00:23:00.290
particularly patriotism when
the enterprise is deeply flawed,

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:07.400
possibly immoral, definitely
started under false pretenses,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.630
what is the nature of patriotism
under those circumstances?

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:18.210
It had really rather wonderful
issues of artistic integrity

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.550
when someone wins a
competition, will that work

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.400
of art be changed in anyway?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.360
Would it be changed
involuntarily?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.430
So there was this intersection
of art and memory and politics

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.250
that I felt was really
pretty wonderful.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:45.680
So there were two emotional
roots for this book.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:51.410
One was that I was quite
friendly with Frederick Hart,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.620
who was a sculptor
of the three statues

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:02.010
that eventually were placed
in the Vietnam Memorial.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.520
He was a brilliant artist.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.520
And I spent a lot
of time with him

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.600
in the 1990s before
he passed away talking

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.940
about these controversies

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.300
that he had been right
at the center of.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.660
The other emotional root
was that I have a friend

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.580
that I served with who is
on the wall and was killed

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:35.280
in the Tet Offensive
in January of 1968.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.680
So those were the
emotional roots of the thing

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.430
that really got me going.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:49.770
Now, where is the page that
I want to read from here?

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:56.690
So, out of this competition that
was very, very professional,

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:03.910
there was this astonishing
winner, Asian-American,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:10.890
21 years old, knew absolutely
nothing about the Vietnam War.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:16.830
Indeed, her basic design that
she presented to her class

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.000
at Yale University was
profoundly political

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.750
and it was an absolute
taboo for the applicants

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:34.820
to this competition that the
submission say anything for

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.640
or against the Vietnam
War itself.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.840
Her drawing, which you
can see down in Princeton,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.040
photographs the original panel

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:53.580
that she presented was
really rather elementary

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.410
and almost high school-ish.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.580
It was just this
little black chevron

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.790
in a wash of oriental blue.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.430
But more important than that
in a way is that it was meant

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:16.090
to below ground, of black
granite with no American flag,

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.420
no inscription about
service and duty and courage,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.390
much less about valor
and heroism.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:32.150
And it was a wonderful
revelation to me as a writer

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.580
that what really won her the
competition was not her high

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:43.380
school-ish drawing at all, but
her description of her vision.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.810
And it went like this so,

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.300
"Walking through this park-like
area, the memorial appears

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.320
as a rift in the earth, a long,
polished, black stone wall,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.060
emerging from and
receding into the earth.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.770
Approaching the memorial, the
ground slopes gently downward

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.190
and the low walls
emerging on either side,

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.290
growing out of the
earth, extend and converge

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.170
at a point below and ahead.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.000
Walking into this grassy
site contained by the walls

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.240
of the memorial we
can barely make

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.110
out the carved names upon
the memorial's walls.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.830
These names, seemingly infinite
in number, convey the sense

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.160
of overwhelming numbers,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.040
while unifying these
individuals into a whole."

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:41.300
That won her the
commission, not her design.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:50.700
Now, there was a terrific
blowback to this design

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.890
that happened sub
rosa instantaneously

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.370
but did not really emerge for
another three or four months.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:12.690
It was spearheaded by a very,
very confident, indeed, eloquent

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.680
and tough group of veterans

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.170
who absolutely despised
the memorial design.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:27.730
The leader was Jim Webb,
later senator from Virginia

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.780
and briefly presidential
candidate,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:37.010
along with Ross Perot,
about as tough an adversary

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.020
as one could find in America.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.980
And they set out to
scuttle and undermine this.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.080
They asserted that black
was the color of shame

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.720
and that it was below ground,
and that it had no inscription

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.530
about courage and
duty and honor.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.840
There was no American flag.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.040
And so what they wanted was to
kill it and to have another,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:15.760
a competition all together
that would be judged

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:23.090
by Vietnam veterans solely
that would be above ground

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.460
of white granite, would
have an American flag,

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.520
would have an inscription
about honor,

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.790
with only Vietnam
veterans as the judges.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:45.040
Well, this was a ferocious,
vicious four-year art war,

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:54.280
intense and racist and
disgusting in many ways.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.540
And in the midst of it
all was this 21-year-old,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:04.210
then 22-year-old young
Asian-American woman,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:11.840
who was just as tough as
Ross Perot or Jim Webb,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.860
and her story is
really quite remarkable.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.730
So here it was, the
design had been chosen

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.160
in the most professional way.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:30.420
Now, there was this blow back
from these very confident

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:36.670
and eloquent veterans who
started to ply the corridors

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:42.820
of Congress to get Congress
people against this who went

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.050
to the secretary of the
interior that had his--

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.390
had the purview over the
mall where this was supposed

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:58.670
to be built, and the opposition
was absolutely ferocious.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:07.870
Bills were put in Congress to
insist upon a new competition,

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:12.200
all of this got fought
out in little agency

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.990
of the federal government called
the US Commission on Fine Arts.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:24.310
Well, ultimately,
there was a compromise.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:31.640
It emerged out of a
congressional meeting

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.960
with Senator John Warner
of Virginia presiding.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:44.180
And in the narrative of that
meeting, probably orchestrated,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.510
somewhere four hours into
the discussion or something,

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:52.930
a general stood up and said,
well, why don't we have a statue

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.570
that would go-- a
statue of a soldier

00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:03.530
that would be imposed
upon the Maya Lin wall?

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:11.330
Well, to begin with, that
was an absolute violation

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.090
of the artistic integrity

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:18.620
of the Maya Lin design,
that was fairly one.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:25.460
And there preceded this really
quite interesting debate

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:31.620
between the artistic side
and the veterans and Maya Lin

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.580
and some of these characters.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:40.780
Well, ultimately, a statue
was agreed to and my friend,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.340
Frederic Hart, was
asked to do it.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.980
But the question was, what
should the statues look like?

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:55.220
What the general who proposed
this wanted was something

00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:02.520
like exists in Fort Benning
in Georgia, which is a leader

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.050
of a combat group going up a
hill, follow me, follow me,

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.770
and the artistic group

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:21.640
and indeed the one's behind the
statue itself were horrified

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.940
at this notion.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.760
How awful would that
be to have some sort

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.280
of glorified soldier
imposed upon the 40--

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.250
58,000 names of the dead.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.760
Well, Frederick Hart was
under considerable pressure

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:44.570
to do exactly that thing, to
design artistically a sculpture

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:50.840
that would present and
idealized form of the soldier.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.250
But he rejected that
to his great credit.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:01.870
He rejected the notion that his
statue should have the feeling

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:09.380
of glory or valor or gallantry
and instead, what he was looking

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:19.050
for in the affect of the statues
was youth and camaraderie

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.850
and confusion and awe.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:31.050
Aand some people believe the
way in which he was deferential

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:44.720
to the Maya Lin design was what
saved the memorial to be built.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.890
And here's what he wrote in
a way, his language was just

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:59.630
as eloquent as Maya Lin's had
been in her original vision.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:05.910
So Hart said about his statues,
"The gesture and expression

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.280
of the figures are directed to
the wall affecting an interplay

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.260
between the image and metaphor.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.050
The tension between the two
elements creates a resonance

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.280
that echoes from
one to the other.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.440
I see the wall as a kind of
ocean, a sea of sacrifice

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.070
that is overwhelming and
nearly incomprehensible

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.450
in its sweep of names.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:36.110
I place these figures upon
the shore of that sea,

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.880
gazing upon it, standing
vigil before it,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.790
reflecting the human face
of it, the human heart."

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.340
Well, I think that was a great
blessing to the whole project

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.930
and it then went forward.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:36:02.560
Well, the great magic of that
memorial to me is not only

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.870
that it's just most successful
war memorial in history.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:13.720
Really five million
are going a year,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.310
it has influenced
all the building

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.150
of war memorials
since that time.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.300
When I was in Vietnam
in December,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:32.560
I was taken to a cemetery
for North Vietnamese dead

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.830
and how is it portrayed?

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.630
Black granite with the names

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:43.190
of the fallen, the
individual names.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:50.030
But there's been an
evolution of this memorial.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.670
It is dynamic.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.150
It moves, it changes.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:03.110
It began as a veterans memorial
and veterans insist that you use

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:07.910
that term, it's a
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:15.000
But it has transcended a
veterans memorial and it has

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.450
in my view transcended
the war in Vietnam itself.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:28.450
It is a place for all of
the generation of Vietnam,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:32.950
the soldiers, the combat
soldiers, those who resisted,

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.050
those who were exiled.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.920
So it embraces that
whole experience.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.890
It is a Vietnam War Memorial.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.990
So it is a place not
just for warriors

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.320
but as much for pacifist.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.100
It has transcended the
specific war itself

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.410
and has become a
memorial about all wars.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.460
It has become a place
of contemplation

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.190
for all wars almost
spiritual in feel,

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.990
a place of reflection
on the cost of war.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.290
That's extraordinary.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:23.290
Now, we mentioned
reconciliation, some,

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:29.870
perhaps my involvement in the
amnesty movement had a dollop

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.290
of atonement in it for
having served in the war

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.950
that I didn't believe
in, in the end.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.050
When I was in Vietnam in
December, I encountered a marine

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.680
who is spending his life
teaching a high school

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.290
in Dong Ha, is that atonement?

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:57.070
There is this incredible fellow,
Chuck Searcy, who was trained

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.210
as I was in army intelligence
who's spent the last 20 years

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:06.150
of his life living in Vietnam
and searching or in heading

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:12.580
to search for unexploded
ordinance, is that atonement?

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:26.000
So, this was a time of
conflict of great dissension

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.980
within the rest of
almost everybody

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:35.870
who was of age at that time.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:47.420
I end the book, perhaps this
is a personal reconciliation

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.720
within me.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.740
I'm not sure.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.310
I am sitting at a teahouse
beside the Hoan Kiem Lake

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.860
in the Old Quarter of Hanoi.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.990
At last, the week
long rain has stopped

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.430
and the full moon is
rising through the mist.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.440
I've waited for Dr.
Nguyen [inaudible],

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.750
Professor of English, a former
government minister of education

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:18.970
and a veteran of the battles
around Hue and for Bao Ninh,

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.550
Ninh is Vietnam's most
famous writer and the author

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.850
of an astonishing,

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:28.420
phantasmagoric novel
called "The Sorrow of War".

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.400
When it was published
in England in 1993,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.510
The Independent hailed the book
as a masterpiece saying it,

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.390
"Vaults over all the
American fiction that came

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.830
out of the Vietnam War to take
its place alongside the greatest

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.900
war novel of the century."

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:54.300
Eric [inaudible], classic, "All
Quiet on the Western Front."

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:07.310
So, hold on, Dr. Cong Hong
arrived alone apologizing

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:10.790
that he'd been unable to
reach his friend Bao Ninh

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.010
who had apparently
dropped out of sight

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.700
and had thrown away
his cellphone.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.270
He had had enough
of the taunting

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.450
of other Vietnamese
writers who are jealous

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:25.570
of his international fame and
of the Vietnamese government

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.550
that had banned his
book for 10 years

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:33.750
and was now denying him
its highest literary prize.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.620
I was only mildly disappointed,

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.350
I had heard that despite
his literary mastery,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.990
Bao Ninh in person was
shy and incommunicative.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:47.410
Dr. Hong, white haired
with an oval brown face,

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.410
a general affect and thoughtful
manner had earned a PhD

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:57.140
in Australia and his fluency
was a great relief to me.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.540
I told him I had seen the
shrines, the tunnels of Vinh Moc

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:08.210
and Cu Chi, the museums in
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:12.200
the heroic statue
of Thich Quang Duc,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.490
the Tiger Cages of
Con Son prison.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:20.500
If collective fury existed,
it seemed to be more directed

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.950
against the Chinese and the
French than the Americans.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.280
Among the people as
far as I could tell,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.050
there was no gloating about
victory over the United States.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.350
Why was it?

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.520
I asked eventually, that there's

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.710
so little triumphalism
in Vietnam.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.800
For an answer to
that he replied,

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.110
you have to go deep
into history.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.230
For a thousand years, the
Chinese invaded Vietnam,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.290
coming every 30 to 50 years
to plunder the country

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.250
and make it a vessel state.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.980
Then the French came for 100
years with their arrogant quest

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.590
to civilize the country through
their brutal colonialism.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.070
And after they left in 1954,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.740
there was only a brief
respite before you came

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.630
to impose your American brand
of freedom and democracy.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.630
You stayed only 15 years.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.900
But why? I persisted,
after all the bombing,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.240
several million deaths,
the poisoning of the land,

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.730
was there no more
anger and resentment?

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:28.680
Because, he replied, we fought
the war differently than you.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.670
You measured success by how
many soldiers you killed

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.440
and how many weapons you seized.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.840
We lost every battle.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.150
Whenever 30 of us
went out on an ambush,

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.920
we were lucky if 15 returned.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.430
Bbut it was never our
intention to defeat you.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:50.500
Indeed, 1968, the year when your
friend was killed was the worst

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.280
year for us.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.450
There were no more soldiers
left and the government had

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.300
to scrape the barrel to find
more men like me, students

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:06.750
and women, but we fought only
to make the Americans go away.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.990
Why don't I see images
of valiant,

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.610
heroic fighters everywhere?

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:16.550
I asked. Because, he answered,
we do not glorify soldiers.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.730
We remember the suffering
of the women

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.290
for their husbands
and their sons.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.690
You will find no rambos here.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.660
We only go to war when
we can't avoid it.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.200
Our patriotism is like
a lump of charcoal.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.940
When it is left alone, it
is dormant and harmless.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.010
If you light it,
it burns very hot.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.000
It can start a big
fire and spread rapidly

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.340
until it consumes
a whole forest.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.650
But when it is over,
it is over and we focus

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.870
on peace and rebuilding.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.190
He looked out on the lake.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.660
This lake is called
Hoan Kiem, he said

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.330
and a legend is associated
with it,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.520
the Legend of the
Returned Sword.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.550
In 1428, a fisherman came here

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.550
and from the depths
a tortoise emerged

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.800
and handed him a magical
golden sword from heaven.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:19.260
On his simple wooden handle
was written, to save a nation.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.320
The fisherman became
a great man,

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.650
an emperor to defend
Vietnam against the invasion

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.490
of Ming Dynasty of China.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.570
After many years, this king
prevailed against Chinese.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:36.920
After his victory, he returned
here to this lake, magical sword

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.360
in hand and a giant
golden tortoise surfaced

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.820
from the depths and
snatched it away restoring it

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.450
to its divine owners
and leaving the king

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.110
with only its wooden handle.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:52.720
The war was over.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.770
The sword was now useless.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:00.140
We are proud of this
legend, Dr. Hong said.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.700
Its message is deep in our
culture and our character.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:10.290
I thanked him for his time and
we parted with a warm handshake

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.280
and I watched him
fearlessly navigate

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.850
across the busy thoroughfare
through the swarm of motorbikes

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:23.670
without a backward glance.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.550
Thank you.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:28.510
[Applause] Thank you very much.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:32.930
[ Applause ]

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.820
All right.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.810
Anybody want to ask
me a question?

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:41.880
If not-- yes ma'am?

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:50.850
&gt;&gt; Did you have a chance to
meet Maya Lin for your research?

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.770
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.:
That's an interesting story.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:47:01.500
I have preliminary interchanges
with her by email and it seems

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.520
that that was going
to do to be fine.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.310
I actually made a mistake
and went to the wrong place

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.310
when she was lecturing
here in Washington

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:14.060
where we were supposed to sort
of begin our relationship.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:19.750
But as I got more deeply into
this thing and also talked

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:23.340
to people who knew her
very well, it became very,

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:28.350
very clear that even
now, 35 years later,

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:33.320
the whole experience of building
this wall, despite the fact

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:38.140
that it secured her
international fame is a very,

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.920
very unpleasant memory for her.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.790
And I-- what I wanted to do
from the literary standpoint was

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.590
to put the reader
into that fight

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:55.940
in the early '80s and late '70s.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.000
And I made the decision
that really--

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.450
I didn't think that
I wanted to pursue

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.720
that relationship with her.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:09.120
To begin with, it would
be a 35 or 40-year memory

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.000
and that's always for the
historian a difficulty.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.710
Bbut beyond that, I-- in
this deep research here

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:19.610
in this wonderful place,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.840
I realize that the
historical record was so rich

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.560
that I really could put them
into reader in those years,

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.650
'79 and to '84 without her.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:38.140
So we had a few deflective
emails along the way.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.510
She said very clearly,

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.380
she didn't really want
to talk about this.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:51.890
So the answer is no,
I've never met her.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.500
Yes ma'am.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.800
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.100
&gt;&gt; James Reston,
Jr.: You go ahead.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.780
&gt;&gt; My question is, there
are many Vietnam veterans

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:04.930
who will share that they didn't
understand why were they were

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:09.230
there and I do not feel--
I feel badly for them.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:15.890
Sorry. And from your research
and study and your involvement,

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:20.110
did you feel that our
administration and politicians

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.860
at that time adequately
informed the public

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.850
as to why we were there?

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.190
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Absolutely
not in couldn't be more clear

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:38.720
from the Ken Burns documentary
about that very thing

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:43.460
about how much was kept
from the American people

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:51.080
as this thing proceeded
most especially how confused

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.390
and bewildered they were about
how this could be brought

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:58.670
to some sort of a successful
conclusion at the same time

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:02.030
that they were asking tens and
tens of thousands of young men

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:08.030
to go and fight for these
totally forgettable hills all

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:12.260
over that country and then
abandoning them and so forth.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:17.360
So, there is a very complicated,
I think, psychology of those

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:25.840
who have-- who were involved in
the toughest stuff in Vietnam.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.200
We've had some wonderful
literature that has come

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:37.020
out about it, but it's all
fraught with this confusion

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:43.220
about why am I here or why
would-- what am I fighting for?

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.770
I was at a conference at
the Wilson Center here

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:55.270
with Ken Burns about three
weeks ago and at one point,

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:59.200
this subject came up and
Burns said, you know,

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:07.490
in the Civil War, a soldier
fought for God, for country,

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:17.830
for region, for town, for
village, for wife, for children.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:23.320
In Vietnam War, they
fought for one another.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.540
And a general there, General
McCaffrey, talked about going

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.830
out to talk to his men
before they went into combat

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:37.160
and this question would come up,
why-- what are you fighting for?

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.190
What are we fighting for?

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:43.540
And McCaffrey said in
this Wilson Center thing,

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.480
you're fighting-- said to
his troops, you're fighting

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.990
for the guy on your right
and the guy on your left.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:57.550
And I thought, what a
low star is that anyway

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:04.830
to ask a whole generation
to risk their lives for.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:10.990
So, this is an immensely
complicated era

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.880
of American history, but it goes

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.280
down from the macrocosm
to the microcosm.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:22.200
So, yeah, that would
be my answer.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.310
&gt;&gt; I actually have
three questions.

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.200
The first one is about
the timeframe, it was--

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.350
it's always been my
understanding though

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.290
that by the time we got
congressional approval

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:37.760
to global wall and the
dedication in 1982,

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.290
it was only two years
but you said it was four?

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.590
&gt;&gt; James Reston,
Jr.: I was talking

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.310
about the entire art war, as
it's kind-- come to be called.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.690
It'd really begins with
this remarkable character,

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.820
Jan Scruggs back
in 1977 with his--

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:57.620
with several op-ed
pieces that he did '77,

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:05.310
'78 and then devoted his
life to this passion.

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:11.770
And then in '79, Jimmy
Carter invites Congress

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.120
to make this possible.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:22.550
And then in 1980, he-- it
gets congressional approval.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:31.100
So, the competitions comes
in the beginning of 1981,

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:36.530
and the dedications immemorial
is in November of 1982,

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:42.270
but then it is two more years
before Frederick Hart's statues

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:48.530
are in-- are added
to the whole thing.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:53.290
So that's why I was using
that '79 to '84 timeframe.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:57.380
&gt;&gt; I see. And in the
discussions involving the--

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.980
with many things were said
about the wall during those days

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.780
and one of them was that it
was a black gash of shame.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.080
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Right.

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.990
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you
ever met General Price in any

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:10.840
of your adventures
with this group?

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.320
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.:
No I didn't meet,

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:18.280
but General Price is an
African-American general.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.850
And there is a critical
moment in this very debate

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:28.700
in the Senator Warner
meeting about trying to come

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.350
to some sort of compromise
that will save this memorial,

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:35.730
in which the opponents
of Maya Lin keep talking

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:43.440
about this black gash of shame
and Price had enough of it.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.530
And he stood up and he said,
anybody who talks any more

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:52.130
about the color black being
associated with shame,

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:53.430
you come and talk to me.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.720
&gt;&gt; That's right and he's
big [inaudible] booming--

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.020
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Well,

00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.110
I wish that I had
heard it personally,

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:07.710
but it's a very dramatic
moment in that whole discussion

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.640
and he's at least
from the literature,

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.160
a very, very impressive man.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, he still is, yeah.

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:14.890
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Yes.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:19.340
&gt;&gt; And my third question
is, in your reference to how

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:23.910
to Vietnam veterans have dealt
with the aftermath of the war,

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.710
and what they're doing, whether
it's changing the schools

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.730
in Vietnam or whatever course
they have chosen to move on,

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:33.060
you're overwriting, themes
seem to be one of atonement

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.690
and I would question that.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:41.380
I don't know that I think
that's the main emotion

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.820
that Vietnam veterans.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.850
I don't think a lot of Vietnam
veterans feel we have anything

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.840
to atone for.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.140
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Yes.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.580
Well I get it, you're absolutely
right and that's a very--

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.330
point, very well taken.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.500
Well, I-- the way I should
have expressed that idea is

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:03.700
that there is a range of
emotions and of course,

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:09.070
there is a great number of
Vietnam veterans who are proud

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:16.000
of their service and had
no cons about anything.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.400
This generation got
sliced and diced.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.710
It got put into segments.

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.560
There-- You know, there were the
ones who fought in the combat

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.860
and then there were the ones

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.180
that were there,
but not in combat.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.990
And then there were
those in those ships,

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.580
and then there were people like
me back home that never went

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.590
to Vietnam and then and
there were the resistors

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:42.440
and then there the
exiles and so forth.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.530
But even within the group of
Vietnam veterans themselves

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.120
that were in the tough stuff,

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:54.480
there is a great
range of emotion.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.130
And atonement is one
of then, one of them.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:01.600
It is not the dominant one.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.490
It is something that I
have experienced personally

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:12.010
with a number of people, but I
would certainly not represent

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.730
and I absolutely agree with you

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.190
that this is the
dominant emotion.

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:21.840
&gt;&gt; And along the same
lines, I want to be clear

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.820
about what you said about
during the McCaffrey's comment--

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.120
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Right.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.320
&gt;&gt; -- about they
fought for each other.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.710
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Right.

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.600
&gt;&gt; And your comment was
that that was a sad--

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.900
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.:
Yes, by comparison

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:41.070
to the Civil War story,
I mean, that, you know--

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:44.530
what do young men go to war for?

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:46.870
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.740
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.:
And if it's only a sort

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.560
of a macho experience and, you
know, you're in tough stuff

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.190
and you're just trying to
survive, well every war has

00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:00.850
that including the Civil
War, that you're fighting

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:05.590
for you bodies, as well as all
these other things but it's

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:11.690
as if the Vietnam War is
devoid of those, of you know,

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:16.500
if you will more
noble sentiments.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:24.630
Now and for everybody, now and
for everybody but of, you know,

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:32.150
of noble cause, a just war,
a just cause and it's only

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:34.730
about what's happening
in the battlefield,

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.050
there's something missing
there, that's my point.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:42.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I think,
General McCaffrey's reason

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:48.300
for that statement was because
it was such a difficult conflict

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.960
on so many levels but
when you're on the field,

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.750
when you're on the situation
where it's life and death,

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:59.160
it does come down to it's
you and your bodies, you--

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.290
all they're trying
to do is survive.

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.590
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: I get it.

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:03.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.390
&gt;&gt; James Reston,
Jr.: I do get it

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:10.610
and that's absolutely
true, this for in all wars.

00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:14.420
But we're talking here
about a unique experience

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:20.570
in American History, 13-year
war is that America lost,

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:26.130
that is a defeat and we
are still trying to grapple

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:29.890
with how that happened.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:35.730
And for those who did
participate anything much less,

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:40.000
who participated in the
toughest stuff of all,

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.620
there are some pretty profound
questions that come out of that.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:51.080
&gt;&gt; Sir? Maya Lin made a
brilliant statement in,

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:58.980
I want to say the mid-'80s when
she spoke at The Wall and she--

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:04.220
I think she said maybe, eight
sentences in her presentation

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.380
at The Wall and the most
poignant one was I built this

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.860
wall for you and she didn't
really have anything more to say

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.200
about it [inaudible]
that I leave it to you.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.710
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Right,
well who's the audience?

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:21.010
Whom the question is?

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.310
Who's the "you"?

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:25.880
And it is my point that
the you is now far expanded

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.000
from what the original
or original concept was,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.150
that she was hired by veterans

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:36.420
and it was a veterans
memorial to begin with.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:43.460
But now, if you go to the wall,
you see these young fathers

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:48.010
and mothers with their small
children that are in their 30s

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:52.060
or something like that,
they're not Vietnam veterans

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.480
so what are they thinking about?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.170
They're certainly not thinking
about [inaudible] or any

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:04.020
of that, they are there to
soak up the spiritual feeling

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:10.010
that everybody seems
to experience about war

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.460
in general and the cost of war.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.630
And Maya Lin says that
very thing in some

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:18.830
of her statements along the way,

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.210
that that's what
The Wall was about.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.610
Was it about the cost of war?

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:29.010
Yes, you had something
you want to--

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:34.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Two questions, first of
all, [inaudible] any controversy

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.590
about who was included
on The Wall?

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:39.890
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: Yes.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.190
There is some-- there's
a little--

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.510
there's a few who little
anecdotes about that sort

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:48.080
of thing I happened to run into
someone out in my neighborhood

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:55.290
in Bethesda who was involved
with a family that lost someone

01:01:55.290 --> 01:02:04.020
in 1958 who was there as
a CIA person and he was--

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:12.110
so he was killed and it
took a congressional action

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.210
to get his name on to that wall.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:19.590
So in that sense, the scope
of the war was widened

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:22.440
from '59 back to '58 or--

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.820
but certainly before
'59 so there's that.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.900
Then there's a whole category of
missing in action some of whom

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.980
who have been identified
and some were identified

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.660
after the engraving took place.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:43.010
So they've been added
since, right.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.510
Do you have something
else in your mind?

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:57.090
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:02.880
Yes, well, I would invite you
all, I expect you've all been.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.160
I would invite you
to go multiple times

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:13.170
and this particular question
to look at who's there

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:19.350
and it's not just a
gnarly veteran who is--

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:23.160
got all his medals and
his fatigues on who was

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.390
in the Vietnam War
itself, not at all.

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:31.110
I mean, it is the general
population and a great deal

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:35.710
of young people and
the whole thing.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.500
So that's the transformation
of the memorial

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.060
into this magical,
spiritual space.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.360
Yes?

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:51.100
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] in your work,
there was any sort of indication

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:10.150
about not just Maya Lin's
but everyone who was involved

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:14.330
in an evolution from a
stationary to physical construct

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:17.140
of the actual memorial to what
they call the traveling wall

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.080
and any interplay iny
our work around that?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.380
&gt;&gt; James Reston, Jr.: I was--

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.680
I gave a talk at a
Literary Festival in North--

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.620
Western North Carolina about
a month ago and that wall,

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:32.690
that moving wall was coming a
month later to the little town

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:35.800
of Burnsville, North
Carolina above Ashville.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.150
So I know about that
whole thing.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:40.360
I think Su Rayburn here wanted
me to pay more attention to that

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.780
and I sort of avoided
the whole thing.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.190
But that-- Then other just
amazing about the reverberations

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:51.670
of this one piece of art though.

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.350
