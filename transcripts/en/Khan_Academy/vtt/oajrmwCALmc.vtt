00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.941
- [Voiceover] Represent the following data

00:00:01.941 --> 00:00:05.041
using a box-and-whiskers plot.

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.588
Once again, exclude the median
when computing the quartiles.

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:10.041
And they gave us a bunch of data points,

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.071
and it says, if it helps, you
might drag the numbers around,

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.281
which I will do, because
that will be useful.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.324
And they say the order isn't checked,

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.021
and that's because I'm doing
this on Khan Academy exercises.

00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:19.284
Up here in the top right,
where you can't see,

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:20.905
there's actually a check answer.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:22.961
So I encourage you to use
the exercises yourself,

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.941
but let's just use this as an example.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.921
So the first thing, if I'm
going to do a box-and-whiskers,

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.301
I'm going to order these numbers.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.265
So let me order these numbers
from least to greatest.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:31.802
So let's see.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:36.682
There's a one here, and
we've got some twos.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.439
We've got some twos here and some threes,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:44.809
some threes, some four--

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.060
I have one four and fives.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:48.515
I have a six.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.743
I have a seven.

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:52.062
I have a couple of
eights, and I have a 10.

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:52.842
So there you go.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.602
I have ordered these numbers
from least to greatest,

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:58.872
and now, well just like that,
I can plot the whiskers,

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:00.077
because I see the range.

00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:01.786
My lowest number is one.

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:03.422
So my lowest number is one.

00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:04.811
My largest number is 10.

00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:08.162
So the whiskers help
me visualize the range.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.930
Now let me think about the
median of my data set is.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.462
So my median here is
going to be, let's see.

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:18.282
I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:22.742
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 numbers.

00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:24.577
Since I have an even number of numbers,

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:27.134
the middle two numbers are
going to help define my median,

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:28.522
because there's no one middle number.

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.902
I might say this number
right over here, this four,

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:33.982
but notice, there's one, two, three, four,

00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:35.718
five, six, seven above it,

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:39.702
and there's only one, two,
three, four, five, six below it.

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:40.849
Same thing would have
been true for this five.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:42.080
So this four and five,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.582
the middle is actually
in between these two.

00:01:44.582 --> 00:01:46.502
So when you have an even
number of numbers like this,

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:49.782
you take the middle two numbers,
this four and this five,

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:51.702
and you take the mean of the two.

00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:55.002
So the mean of four and five
is going to be four-and-a-half.

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.562
So that's going to be the
median of our entire data set,

00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:01.563
four-and-a-half, four-and-a-half.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.002
And now, I want to figure out the median

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.202
of the bottom half of numbers
and the top half of numbers.

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:08.782
And here they say exclude the median.

00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:10.002
Of course I'm going to exclude the median.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.357
It's not even included in
our data points right here,

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:15.702
because our median is 4.5.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.868
So now let's take this
bottom half of numbers.

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:20.742
Let's take this bottom half
of numbers right over here

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:22.182
and find the middle.

00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:24.182
So this is the bottom seven numbers.

00:02:24.182 --> 00:02:26.142
And so the median of those is going to be

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:28.098
the one which has three on either side,

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:30.958
so it's going to be this
two right over here.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.822
So that right over there is kind of

00:02:33.822 --> 00:02:35.978
the left boundary of our box,

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:37.543
and then for the right boundary,

00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:40.022
we need to figure out the middle
of our top half of numbers.

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:42.482
Remember, four and five
were our middle two numbers.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:45.182
Our median is right in
between at four-and-a-half.

00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:47.322
So our top half of numbers
starts at this five

00:02:47.322 --> 00:02:48.382
and goes to this 10.

00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:49.242
Seven numbers.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:51.408
The middle one's going to
have three on both sides.

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:53.762
The seven has three to the left,

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:54.942
remember of the top half,

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.922
and three to the right.

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:58.268
And so the seven is,

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:00.485
I guess you could say the
right side of our box.

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:01.091
And we're done.

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.442
We've constructed our
box-and-whiskers plot,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:06.488
which helps us visualize the entire range

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.760
but also you could say the middle,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.942
roughly the middle half of our numbers.
