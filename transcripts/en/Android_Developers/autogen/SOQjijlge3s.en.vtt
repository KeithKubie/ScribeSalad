realizing until later that something is
 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.569
realizing until later that something is
wrong so we're not going to do this and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579
wrong so we're not going to do this and
 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.090
wrong so we're not going to do this and
instead we're going to call gpg manager

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
instead we're going to call gpg manager
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.309
instead we're going to call gpg manager
shared instance sign out and this method

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319
shared instance sign out and this method
 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.949
shared instance sign out and this method
will do a number of things one the gpg

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
will do a number of things one the gpg
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199
will do a number of things one the gpg
manager will talk to GPP sign-in shared

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209
manager will talk to GPP sign-in shared
 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.629
manager will talk to GPP sign-in shared
instance and call sign out on that in

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639
instance and call sign out on that in
 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.220
instance and call sign out on that in
addition it will clear out any cache

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230
addition it will clear out any cache
 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.170
addition it will clear out any cache
data that it's stored on behalf of the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180
data that it's stored on behalf of the
 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.330
data that it's stored on behalf of the
user and perform some additional cleanup

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
user and perform some additional cleanup
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.309
user and perform some additional cleanup
tasks so this is really the right way to

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319
tasks so this is really the right way to
 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.559

off screen or my sign out buttons off
 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.790
off screen or my sign out buttons off
screen and that's because i forgot to go

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800
screen and that's because i forgot to go
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:58.160

back in here and adjust my auto sizing

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
back in here and adjust my auto sizing
 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.640
back in here and adjust my auto sizing
to make sure that it is anchored to the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
to make sure that it is anchored to the
 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.040
to make sure that it is anchored to the
bottom instead of the top sorry about

that and yes I suppose I should really
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.660
that and yes I suppose I should really
be starting to use auto layout and

can see in our NS log and now I'm going

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
can see in our NS log and now I'm going
 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.350
can see in our NS log and now I'm going
to sign out and actually nothing happens

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
to sign out and actually nothing happens
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960
to sign out and actually nothing happens
but I am actually signed out because if

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
but I am actually signed out because if
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.990
but I am actually signed out because if
I sign in again it will take me back to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000
I sign in again it will take me back to
 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.710

the OAuth 2 point 0 permission screen
 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.180
the OAuth 2 point 0 permission screen
because I have signed out the services

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190

going to double check and confirm rather

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260
going to double check and confirm rather
 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.050
going to double check and confirm rather
than sign you and silently which is the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060
than sign you and silently which is the
 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.790
than sign you and silently which is the
right behavior so I'm going to go back

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
right behavior so I'm going to go back
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.870
right behavior so I'm going to go back
and click accept going to go back in and

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880
and click accept going to go back in and
 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.500
and click accept going to go back in and
it looks like I'm signed in again so

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510
it looks like I'm signed in again so
 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.080
it looks like I'm signed in again so
this is nice however your typical user

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090
this is nice however your typical user
 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.300
this is nice however your typical user
is not going to be able to look at their

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310
is not going to be able to look at their
 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.950
is not going to be able to look at their
console log to figure out whether

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960
console log to figure out whether
 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.409
console log to figure out whether
they're signed in or signed out so let's

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419
they're signed in or signed out so let's
 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.690
they're signed in or signed out so let's
add one more refinement which is hiding

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700
add one more refinement which is hiding
 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.490
add one more refinement which is hiding
or showing the appropriate buttons based

or showing the appropriate buttons based
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.440
or showing the appropriate buttons based
on your signed in status so I'm going to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450
on your signed in status so I'm going to
 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.629
on your signed in status so I'm going to
stop this and we're going to go into my

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639
stop this and we're going to go into my
 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.469
stop this and we're going to go into my
intro view controller m file and let's

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479
intro view controller m file and let's
 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.050
intro view controller m file and let's
create another method I'm going to put

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
create another method I'm going to put
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:30.670
create another method I'm going to put
it up here called refresh interface

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680

we can also get this information by

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350
we can also get this information by
 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.070
we can also get this information by
asking the gpg manager and the way you

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080
asking the gpg manager and the way you
 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.960
asking the gpg manager and the way you
do this is we create a little bull

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970
do this is we create a little bull
 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.450
do this is we create a little bull

this is a good way to find out if the
 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.240
this is a good way to find out if the
user is signed in and then we can simply

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250
user is signed in and then we can simply
 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.960
user is signed in and then we can simply
hide or show buttons based on this so

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970
hide or show buttons based on this so
 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.150
hide or show buttons based on this so
we're going to call our self that

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160
we're going to call our self that
 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.030
we're going to call our self that
sign-in button will hide this if the

don't need to tell them that if they're
 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.670
don't need to tell them that if they're
already signed in so if signed in self

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680
already signed in so if signed in self
 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.110
