LAURENCE MORONEY: If
you've watched any Ruby

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.060
videos on YouTube,
you've probably

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.070
seen Aja Hammerly at work.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.820
Today, she's joining me to geek
out over various hot beverages

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.010
or just find somewhere
that serves tea.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
So Aja, every time
I go onto YouTube

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.110
and I'm looking for
something Ruby, you're there.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.157
How much Ruby stuff do you do?

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:28.490
AJA HAMMERLY: Oh, I did a lot
before I started a Google.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.735
It was my community.

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:34.220
I've been doing
Rails Dev since 2007.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.270
And I started speaking.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.320
Because there was
an event in Seattle.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.695
And they're like,
hey, this thing

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:39.480
you've been doing in
our weekly meetup,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.300
are you willing to
talk about it on stage?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.980
And I'm like, I'm
not good enough.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.490
And they're like, sure you are.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.230
Just come do it.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.814
And I realized I
really like speaking.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.605
LAURENCE MORONEY: You're
really good at it.

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:50.060
AJA HAMMERLY: Thank you.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.420
And I love the Ruby community.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.544
I love the language.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:53.960
I love the fact
that it's supposed

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.457
to make programmers happy.

00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:56.540
LAURENCE MORONEY: Does it?

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.810
AJA HAMMERLY: It makes me happy.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.290
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well that's good.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.590
That's a good start, right?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.510
AJA HAMMERLY: Some
of the folks I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.650
know who do Python think
it makes them angry.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.126
But different strokes
for different folks.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.750
But actually at
Google, I've been doing

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.130
a lot of stuff that isn't Ruby.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.076
I've been focusing
on some DevOp stuff.

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:11.450
And now, I'm doing
a lot of stuff

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.742
around language communities.

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:15.200
Because one of the things I
learned from the Ruby community

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.283
is that every community,
every language community,

00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:19.550
has different values, different
things that they think

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.480
are important.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.980
What's important
to a Java developer

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.021
is not going to be what's
important to a Rubyist,

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.355
is not going to be what's
important to a Node developer.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:28.687
And we're trying to figure
out how we can make our cloud

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.590
products and our
cloud libraries feel

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.810
good to all of these
different communities

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.120
and meet these communities
where they're at.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.835
And it's fun, it's challenging.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:41.210
But we need people who actually
know our communities well

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.140
to be able to do that.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.990
So the fact that I'm still
in the Ruby community

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.020
is important.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: So how
do you go about doing that,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.870
like working with
different communities?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.160
AJA HAMMERLY: So in
the Ruby community,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.470
one of the things
that's really important

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.280
is that we need to
be newbie friendly.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.681
There's a lot of folks who
learned Ruby at code bootcamps.

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.680
And they haven't been
programming for very long.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.179
So we need to make sure that
our documentation is top notch,

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.680
that our APIs makes sense.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.110
In the Node community,
we need to make sure

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.445
that we install via the tools
that they know how to use

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:10.070
and that we meet them
where they're at.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.320
So we need to have good
support for WebSockets.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.420
We need to have good
support for concurrency.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.027
So there's a lot of cool stuff
without going on in Node.

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:19.610
Python community,
we need to make sure

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.800
that we have libraries for the
scientific computing folks,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.133
in addition to all the web
stuff that happens in Python.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.740
Python is well-adopted in
lots of different places.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.857
And so it's just making
sure that we bring folks

00:02:29.857 --> 00:02:31.690
into Google, who know
those communities, who

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.860
are part of those communities.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.750
Externally, it seems
like all I do is Ruby.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.980
Internally, I do so much more.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.235
But I love my Ruby community.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:42.730
You will drag my Ruby
community away from me

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.249
with me kicking and screaming.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.040
They are my people.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.085
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, we
don't want to do that.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.360
AJA HAMMERLY: They're my people.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.230
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So now, do you still

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.064
go to a lot of Ruby
events and talk at them?

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:52.354
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, I try to
get to four or five a year

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:53.270
at least.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.930
I try to make sure I make it
to the big ones, a RailsConf

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.440
in the US and
RubyConf in the US.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.140
I went to RubyKaigi in
Japan, which is the big Ruby

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.640
conference in Japan last year.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.582
And it was amazing
and intimidating,

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:06.290
being in the place
where the language was

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.690
created with a lot of the
core contributors on stage.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.630
And I'm just like,
I don't belong here.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.370
And they're thinking
about where Ruby's

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.510
going to be in five years.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.860
And I'm just like,
this is not something

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.401
that I get to think
about very often.

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:18.620
It's so cool.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.620
And I like going to the events.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.204
Since I've been part of the
community since 2007ish,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.120
I like the fact that,
when I go to the events,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.244
I get to do some mentoring.

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:30.170
At RailsConf, I got
to have a person who

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.930
was new to the community
was my mentee for the week.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.624
And I suggested talks
to her and told her,

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:37.040
based on her
interests, what stuff

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.250
I thought would be relevant.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.560
And she asked me questions.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.522
And it was great.

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:41.480
And I love giving back.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.250
Because there was so many
people who did that for me

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.570
when I joined the community.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.960
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And it's always

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.950
good to be able to
get back in that way.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.580
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
now, you're in Google.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.590
You're working as a
Cloud Developer Advocate.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.500
What does Ruby
look like in cloud?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.110
AJA HAMMERLY: So when I
started, we had some stuff.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.605
But I've been with Google
now for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:59.270
And cloud has just exploded,
especially Google Cloud

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.370
has just exploded in that time.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.750
We now have App Engine Support.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.150
So you can run an
App Engine with Rails

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.130
and Sinatra, our two
big web frameworks.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.940
And it mostly just
works out of the box,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.310
which I'm really happy about.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.410
Because that's what
the community wants.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.960
We have libraries for
cloud machine learning.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.519
Some of those are in beta.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.779
We've got libraries for
cloud logging, [? starring ?]

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.630
Stackdriver Logging.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.320
And that's GA now at this point.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.970
And the cool thing is that I'm
seeing that I go to events.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.719
And people are like,
yeah, I saw your talk

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.080
a year ago or two years ago.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.134
And we tried it out.

00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:32.050
And we really like it.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.633
And I'm like, awesome,
can you tell me

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.029
what you don't like so
we can fix that next?

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.820
Because my big thing
is I want to make sure

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.490
that my community is
delighted, and happy,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.730
and they're being
well-served by Google Cloud

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.020
and by cloud in general.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.660
Because I've been the one
who's had to rack the servers.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.770
I have the bloody knuckle.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.479
I had the bloody
knuckles to show for it.

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.561
I don't ever want anyone
to have to do that again,

00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:54.590
unless it is the right
choice for their company.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.290
I don't want it to be buy
your servers off eBay,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.870
and rack them up in some cheap
[INAUDIBLE] as the default.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.828
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hands
up if you've done that.

00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:03.890
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, it
was unfun when I did it.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.480
It was unfun carrying a pager.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.729
And I'm really glad that,
for a lot of these folks who

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.655
are working at startups, they're
able to have someone else,

00:05:11.655 --> 00:05:14.030
have Google do their SRE, have
someone else do their SRE,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.814
so that they can focus
on building cool stuff

00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:18.230
and not focus on
the how do I make

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.100
sure it stays running parts.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.970
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So your journey,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.740
you were very much in
the Ruby community.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.906
And then, you joined Google.

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:27.860
And what was the difference?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.550
How does it feel to be
part of such a big company,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.680
but still working on
something like Ruby?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.510
What is it like to just join
Google and do this stuff?

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.080
AJA HAMMERLY: So before Google,
I had basically every job

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.540
pretty much that you can
have in web development.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.890
I was a tester.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.810
I was a position that
seems to only exist

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.040
in Washington state, a software
development engineer in tests.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: In one
particular company, too.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.990
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, I was
a developer at a startup.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.480
I was a tester at a startup.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.815
I was a release
manager at a startup.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.920
I carried the pager there, too,
because, you know, started.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.230
I worked in consulting for
a while doing a combination

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.550
of DevOps and development.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.030
And a friend of mine worked
on the cloud team, Julia.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.620
And she's like,
hey, we're hiring.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.140
And I'm like, I don't
think I'm qualified.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.670
She goes, throw a resume
in, you're qualified.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.460
And I'm like, I don't think so.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.870
And she convinced me.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.270
And I'm like, well,
OK, if I interview,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.245
will I get free lunch?

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:22.870
She goes, yeah.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.810
So I'm like, OK, I will
do it for the free lunch.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I
met you at that lunch.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.076
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, you did.

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:28.520
And it was delicious.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.820
And it ended up working out.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.130
And I was super freaked out.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.463
And I'm like, well, I can go
to this giant company, work

00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:36.170
on a small team,
which my preference is

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.770
small team at big company.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.715
Because you get the camaraderie,
and the teamwork, and the

00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:42.890
we're all in it together
of a small company.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.540
But you have all the
benefits of a big company.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.020
And I got to still
say my message.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.680
I got to still to meet
with my Ruby community.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.430
I didn't have to give
up my Ruby community

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.607
for some of the languages that
Google is more well known for.

00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:57.190
And I also had to
do other cool stuff.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.565
And I get to be
surrounded by all

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:01.290
of these really smart people.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.020
And I've worked at
a lot of places.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.160
But this is the place
where I feel most at home.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.190
I'm surrounded by all
of these giant dorks,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.577
giant nerds, people with all
these really cool habits.

00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:14.160
I was talking to one
of my coworkers--

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
the nicest thing anybody

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.950
ever called me, thank you.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.380
AJA HAMMERLY: I was talking to
one of my coworkers on Friday.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.963
He goes, its just one of those
Google things that you're like,

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:23.660
wait, you write a lot of
code, and you're really

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.370
well known in this community?

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.300
Oh, and you're a concert level
concerto violinist on the side?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.210
Of course you are,
because it's Google.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.890
And so having all
these people who

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.300
are just super into awesome
stuff is so much fun.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.970
And everyone just kind of
accepts me for who I am.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.990
And I love it.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's one of
the most beautiful things we're

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.175
doing here is being
accepted for who you are.

00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:47.810
For me, when I first joined,
it was the imposter syndrome,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.310
like do I really fit here?

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.262
I mean, when's the other
shoe going to drop?

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.970
But then, once you
realize and you fit in

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.910
that everybody has their own
quirks, everybody's different.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.502
And that's part of what
really brings people together.

00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:00.710
And I think it helps us to
then work with developers.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.540
Because then, we understand
other people's differences,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.840
too.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.214
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, at the
end of the day, most of my job

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:07.790
is translating Googler into
developer and developer

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.410
back into Googler.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.000
Because the bottom
line is that this

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.130
is a really big company, with
some really unique problems,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.600
and some really neat
ways that Google

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.641
has chosen to solve those
problems, many of which

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.740
we've written papers about.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.540
But the vast majority
of the communities

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.880
that I reach, small
startups, medium

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.000
sized companies, companies that
have five different languages

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.020
inhouse, because that seems
to be more and more the case.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.601
They don't have the
problems we have.

00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:32.809
They have different problems.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.360
They have different priorities.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.140
And making sure that,
in cloud, we're me

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.840
we're reaching them with a
message that makes sense,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.140
we're helping them out, we're
helping them build cool stuff.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.070
At the end of the day,
when people are like,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.486
what does a developer
advocate do?

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:48.260
And I'm like, I help people
build cool stuff, I hope.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.527
It's been fun and hard.

00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:51.110
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So one of the things

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.120
that you mentioned earlier
that stuck in my mind

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.680
was, when you were
talking about communities,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.055
one of the things
communities are

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:57.770
good at is,
particularly in Ruby,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.820
that people have learned
Ruby in a bootcamp.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.670
And to get that
support for people

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.190
who are beginning their
journey as a developer,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.650
not just in Ruby but, of
course, in other languages, what

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.220
do you offer from your
team on cloud for,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.050
if I'm a new
developer and I want

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.630
to get started in building
awesome cloud apps with Ruby?

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.849
How would I get going?

00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:18.140
AJA HAMMERLY: So if you're
going to build awesome cloud

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.700
apps with Ruby,
you're probably going

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.000
to be using Rails, or Sinatra,
or something else that's

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.560
based on our underlying web
support, which is called Rack.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.990
And the best thing you can
do is go try out App Engine.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.384
And the place you go for that
is Cloud.Google.com/Ruby.

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:33.800
And if you're in
another language,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.800
Cloud.Google.com/
your language here.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.850
It will get you to the
Getting Started stuff.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.080
In Ruby specifically, one
of the best things we offer

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.840
is App Engine for Rubyists.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.550
It lets you spin up a server.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.250
It will autoscale,
if you turn that on.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.410
And really, all
you need to do is

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.525
create an account on our website
and go GCloud App Deploy.

00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:59.012
And the little script says, it
looks like you're running Ruby.

00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:00.470
And that is the
last thing it says.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Is there a
little Clippy that says that?

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.490
AJA HAMMERLY: It's
the last thing it

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.890
says that sounds like Clippy.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.630
And then, you say, yes.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.630
And all the defaults work
with the standard ways

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.490
that people run Rails apps.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.960
You can just say
yes at that point.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.543
And your thing will be running
in the cloud within 10 minutes.

00:10:14.543 --> 00:10:16.502
It's fantastic and amazing.

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.710
And I've been using it for
some of the nonprofit work

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.050
I do as side projects.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.720
Because it's so much
easier than having

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.620
to provision a compute
instance and make sure

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.120
that I have the latest versions
of all this stuff installed.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.420
And we tested our App Engine
with the top 1,000 libraries,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.250
Gems, that people run with Ruby.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.840
And all of them install cleanly.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.850
So if you're using
it, it probably

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.020
just works out of the box.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.936
And that is lovely.

00:10:40.936 --> 00:10:42.560
Because if you want
an attachment thing

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.610
and you need
ImageMagick, you don't

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.110
want to have to think
about which C libraries

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.193
you want for ImageMagick,
especially if you're new

00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:49.400
and you're not even sure
what C library extensions,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.899
and apt-get, and all that are.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.940
You just want it to work.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.730
Because you want to get about
building your cool thing.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.660
AJA HAMMERLY: Because that's
always the thing that,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.397
when you want to start learning
particularly a new language,

00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.730
you really don't want to deal
with all the dependencies.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.380
And you don't want to deal
with like the infrastructure

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:03.980
and that kind of things.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.188
It's like, I just want to
write, print "Hello world,"

00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:08.056
and get it to work in the cloud.

00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:10.802
And so all of that is done, if
you're doing it on App Engine.

00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:13.010
AJA HAMMERLY: Yeah, if you're
doing it on App Engine,

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.410
that is all done.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.620
I the Node.js.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.990
Because I'm trying to get
back up to speed on Node.js.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.231
I did Node.js before
Google professionally,

00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:21.980
and then haven't touched
it for two years.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.592
And that community has
gone so far, so fast.

00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:27.800
I'm trying to get back up
to speed on Node right now.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.299
And I don't want
to have to remember

00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:30.620
how to provision a node server.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.240
Eventually, I will remember.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.790
But right now, I just want to
verify that I still know Node.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.790
I'm doing one of my
projects on App Engine, too,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.617
just to make sure that I
still remember how to do it.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.200
And I'm like, yeah,
I want to remember

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.158
how to make cool stuff.

00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:45.860
I don't want to remember the
provisioning bit right now.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.390
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And people worry

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.220
about things like App
Engine, that they're

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.637
going to be locked in.

00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:52.220
And the nice thing
about the way we've

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.950
done with App Engine
Flexible for Ruby and Node

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.485
is that there's a
Docker Container.

00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:59.110
The Docker File is
available on GitHub.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.818
So you know exactly
what we're installing

00:12:00.818 --> 00:12:02.672
and exactly how
we're running it.

00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:04.880
And so if you decide that
you're done with App Engine

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.005
and you want to move to
something else, it's there.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:08.963
You can just pick it up
and move it to Compute.

00:12:08.963 --> 00:12:11.000
You can pick it up and
move it to Kubernetes.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.940
And I like that.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.520
Because it gives people
a lot of flexibility,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.270
which is the other thing that
my community really wants.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.340
So they want to be
able to move, if that

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.750
is the right choice for them.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.710
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So you've clearly

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.210
worn a lot of hats
in your career.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.585
And you've worked very closely
with a lot of communities.

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.370
If somebody is just getting
out and getting started now,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.260
what advice would you give them?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.850
AJA HAMMERLY: Play.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.510
One of the biggest things that
made my career go well and gave

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.340
me a lot of opportunities
was I started

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.960
going to the
Seattle Ruby Brigade

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.250
meetup on a weekly basis.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.949
We have one of the
core Rails contributors

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:46.490
and a lot of people
in Seattle who've

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.590
written libraries
that are core to Ruby.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.587
That meetup is the longest
lived Ruby meetup in the world.

00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:52.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, wow.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.200
Even outside of Japan,
where it was invented?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.700
AJA HAMMERLY: Even
outside of Japan.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.580
I think we're at 15 years now,
something crazy like that.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.830
And every week, I showed up.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.600
And I just wrote some code.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.110
Most of it was throw away.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.377
In fact, the vast
majority of it was awful.

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:07.960
And sometimes, I
would be like, here's

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.240
this Python script I found.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.880
Let me try to port it to Ruby.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.630
Or I wonder if I can use a web
scraper to do this cool thing

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.430
that I've been thinking about.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.080
And I would get
feedback from some

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.429
of the folks in the community.

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:20.970
I'd see someone
working on something.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.860
I'd be like, what's that?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.484
Can I try that?

00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:24.710
And they'd point me in
the right direction.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.816
And writing that code,
getting that feedback,

00:13:26.816 --> 00:13:28.190
and just playing,
and having fun,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.580
and remembering that this is
why we do this kept me going.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.880
And that's how my first
speaking opportunity showed up.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.710
And that's how some of the
open source stuff I have done

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.240
happened.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.520
And I get to meet a
lot of cool folks.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.700
And it made it easier to
get this job in developer

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.240
relations.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.980
Because I'm relating
with developers.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.250
And I still do
almost every Tuesday.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.790
And we occasionally have talks.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.600
I spoke at every meeting for the
first year we had talks again.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.100
And I have spoke last month.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.600
And it was the first
time in a year.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.780
And I was very happy that
I hadn't spoke every month.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.590
But it's fun.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.670
Like last week, I was there
writing a Battleship program.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.390
Because for some
reason, I've decided

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.620
I'm going to write
Battleship this month.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.464
LAURENCE MORONEY: E6,
Miss, that Battleship?

00:14:09.464 --> 00:14:11.255
AJA HAMMERLY: Yes,
exactly that Battleship.

00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:12.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK,
you sunk my Carrier.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.305
AJA HAMMERLY: Yes, exactly.

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:14.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Oh, interesting.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.170
AJA HAMMERLY: And
I'm going to do it

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.336
as a multi-language project.

00:14:16.336 --> 00:14:18.900
I'm going to write clients in
a bunch of different languages.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.730
And it's fun.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.980
And if it's not fun,
you're not going to do it.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.500
And if you're not doing it,
you're not going to get better.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.950
So play, have fun, that's
the big piece of advice

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.760
I have for folks.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
I think the biggest skill

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.193
you can have is the ability
to spend time and the desire

00:14:33.193 --> 00:14:34.585
to spend time on these things.

00:14:34.585 --> 00:14:35.270
So cool.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.990
Well, thank you so much, Aja.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.110
This has been a blast.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.680
I've had a lot of fun.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.960
And so thank you so much.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.060
And to learn more about
what Aja is working

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.364
on, Cloud.Google.com/Ruby,
right?

00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:47.780
AJA HAMMERLY: Yes,
that's correct.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Cloud.Google.com/Ruby

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.850
or Cloud.Google.com/ insert
your language of choice,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.640
so that you can get started with
your language and your language

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.830
of choice and the cloud.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.745
And I hope to see the
kind of cool stuff

00:14:58.745 --> 00:14:59.870
that you're going to build.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.790
So thanks again, Aja.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.790
AJA HAMMERLY: Thank you.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.440
