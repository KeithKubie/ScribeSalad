00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.386
Here the solution is 8 plus 7i, and here the solution is 3 plus 7i. Great work

00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:08.923
if you figured those two out. We're really adding these two complex numbers

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:12.354
together, so we can drop the parentheses. Next, I want to combine my real parts

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:17.731
and my imaginary parts. I know addition is commutative, so I can rewrite this

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:26.100
line as 2 plus 6 plus 3i plus 4i, 2 plus 6 equals 8 And 3i plus 4i equals 7i.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.170
Remember I represents the square root of negative 1. So we have 3 square roots

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.750
of negative 1 and 4 square roots of negative 1. That gives us a total of 7

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.310
square roots of negative 1 or just 7i. When we subtract a complex number, we

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.530
want to distribute this negative 1 to each of the terms. So we'll have negative

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.160
3 plus 2i. Then we combine the real parts of 6 and negative 3 and combine the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.458
imaginary parts of 5i and 2i. This gives us a total of 3 plus 7i. Our final

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:57.293
result.
