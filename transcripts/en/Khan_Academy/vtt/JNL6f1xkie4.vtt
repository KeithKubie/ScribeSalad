Narrator: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:03.898
is give ourselves a
framework for thinking about

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:09.688
the rent versus buy decision for a home.

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:12.412
The key takeaway I hope
you have after this video

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.821
is there's not just a simple right answer,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.421
that it's always better to rent

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.320
or that it's always better to buy.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.723
For full disclosure, I own a house

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:22.924
and I bought it for a
whole series of reasons,

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:26.474
some of them emotional, some
of them potentially economic.

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:29.897
It depends on your personal context,

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.222
where you are in your life,

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.172
and what part of the world you live in,

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:35.387
and what the economy is
doing at that moment,

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:38.452
and what rents are versus
what housing prices are.

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:40.136
Hopefully this video
will give you a framework

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:41.460
for at least how to think about them.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.811
Let's say this house in on the market,

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:48.401
and it's on the market for
rental at 1,500 a month.

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:56.807
1,500 per month, which is the
same thing as 18,000 a year.

00:00:56.807 --> 00:01:01.002
18,000 a year; so, that's
one option that you have.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.785
Let's say there's an identical neighboring

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:04.665
house that's on the market for sale,

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.453
and you are in a position to buy it.

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:11.354
Let's say that house is $400,000,

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.721
is the price that you can get it at.

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:15.677
You don't have $400,000, you're going

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:17.055
to have to borrow some money.

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:20.858
You saved 100,000 for your down payment.

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:26.607
100,000 down payment. Down payment.

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:30.051
You're going to have to take
the remainder out as a loan.

00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:36.721
You're going to take out a 300,000 loan.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.715
Now, a traditional mortgage,
one that has a fixed term;

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:45.963
maybe it's a 15 year fixed mortgage,
or a 30 year fixed mortgage.

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:49.149
Every month you pay your mortgage bill,

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.078
and some of it goes to,
in a traditional mortgage,

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:56.095
some of it goes it towards
the loan and some of it

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:01.010
goes to pay down the
interest, and the rest of it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.682
will go down to pay down the loan.

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:07.145
For example, let's say that
your mortgage payment is 1,800.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.212
1,800 per month.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:12.809
Early on it might be
disproportionately interest.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.015
It might be, say, 1,500
a month in interest

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.859
and $300 to actually pay down your loan,

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.535
to actually pay down this $300,000 loan,

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:24.528
and then as that loan is paid down

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:27.414
near the end of the term of your mortgage

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.470
it might have gone the other way where

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.151
each month you're paying much
more to pay down your loan.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.651
Maybe by that time it's
1,500, and the interest,

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.365
since it's interest on a
lower amount by that much

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:39.985
because you've paid down the loan so much,

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:42.079
your interest might be lower.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.392
This would be a traditional
process of a traditional mortgage.

00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:48.445
To simplify our analysis, I'll assume

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.166
that you're taking an interest-only loan;

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.320
a loan where you're only required to pay

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.983
the interest portion of it, and you could

00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:57.860
pay down your loan as you want to.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.516
Let's say that this is interest-only.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.614
This is going to help
just simplify things,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:02.975
and obviously if we want
to get really detailed

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:04.789
we'd probably have to
get a spread sheet out

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.849
to really analyze things and see how

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.652
the interest payment changes

00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:12.251
as we go through the life of the loan.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:18.926
Let's assume it's interest-only
at 6%, 6% interest.

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:21.525
Interest-only at 6% interest.

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:23.332
That means on an annual basis,

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:25.439
you're going to pay 18,000 in interest.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:32.122
18,000 in interest; 6% of
300,000. 18,000 in interest.

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:34.056
Now, depending where you live

00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:35.852
and what your income level is,

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:41.486
in a lot of places, you can
deduct mortgage interest

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.289
from your income, so this
doesn't mean that you get

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.598
all of the 18,000 back, this
is saying if you're making

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:50.788
100,000 a year, instead
of paying, say, 30%

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.050
on 100,000, you're now
going to pay your taxes

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.874
on 100,000 - 18,000.

00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:01.658
Your taxable income
would go down to 82,000.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:06.221
You'll save, roughly, your tax
rate as a percentage of this.

00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.138
Let's say you save,
roughly, a third of this

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:12.216
on reduced taxes; so,
that's reduced taxes.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.950
So, your effective
interest that you're paying

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.437
after the tax break,
let's say it's $12,000.

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:24.975
$12,000 is out-of-pocket,
or the effective.

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:32.025
Effective cost of
interest. Cost of interest.

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:36.196
We're not done; we know that
there are costs of home ownership.

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:38.648
You'll have to pay, usually,
some type of property tax.

00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:42.452
Let's say it's 1% property
tax. 1% of 400,000

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:48.590
would be 4,000 in property
tax. Property tax.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.325
You, of course, have to upkeep the house.

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:53.327
Maybe you have a gardener.

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.604
maybe you have to repair things,

00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:58.145
you get things painted;
who knows what it might be.

00:04:58.145 --> 00:04:59.995
These are things that
you usually would not

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:01.996
have to pay if you are renting;

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:04.440
so, let's say, although
it might be different,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.194
once again, depending on the situation.

00:05:06.194 --> 00:05:07.988
Let's say there's 2,000 a year.

00:05:07.988 --> 00:05:12.381
2,000 per year in upkeep. In upkeep.

00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:14.280
Now, the reason why I
listed all of these things,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.704
and obviously we can go into more depth

00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:17.621
and more detail and
think about other things

00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.797
that are more particular
to different circumstances,

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:22.991
but this is a list in
either of these cases,

00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:24.657
are the things that are essentially

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.457
are going out the door.

00:05:26.457 --> 00:05:29.095
If you're renting, that $18,000 a year,

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.551
that's just going out the door;

00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.529
that's what you have
to pay for the benefit

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.077
of living in this house.

00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:39.061
If you buy, things that
are just going out the door

00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:43.193
are your effective cost of interest,
your property tax, your upkeep.

00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:46.655
This will all add up to, let's see,

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:53.724
4,000 + 2,000 is 6,000 +
12,000 is 18,000. 18,000.

00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:56.395
Just like that, it looks
like our annual costs

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:57.996
that are just going out the door,

00:05:57.996 --> 00:05:59.589
given the assumptions, in every different

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:00.980
circumstance you're
going to have different

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.935
assumptions, so this is just a framework.

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:09.876
Your what's going out the door
is $18,000 a year in either case.

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:11.541
But, we are not done yet.

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.886
In this case, we didn't even talk about

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:14.650
what we're doing with our $100,000.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.898
Over here we had to use
it for our down payment.

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:21.266
Over here we still have $100,000 invested.

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:25.421
100,000 invested, so we're
going to get some income

00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:28.060
from this 100,000 that we
wouldn't have gotten here,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.226
and it depends what we're doing with it,

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:31.868
if we have it in a
really safe bank account,

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:34.378
maybe we're getting 1% or 2%,

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:36.928
but maybe we're investing
it in a portfolio of things

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:40.210
and getting 4%, or who
knows what we're doing here,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.450
but we need to think about what we

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.774
could have gotten from that down payment;

00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:48.427
from investing this incremental money.

00:06:48.427 --> 00:06:51.898
Let's just say, for the sake of
argument, that you get a 2% return.

00:06:51.898 --> 00:06:57.258
At 2% annual return;

00:06:57.258 --> 00:07:01.474
so you're getting $2,000
in investment income.

00:07:01.474 --> 00:07:06.600
Investment income, from that $100,000.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.561
Your actual out-of-pocket,
if you were to net

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:13.198
your income benefit
that you didn't have to,

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:15.400
or the investment return
that you didn't have

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.066
to use up on the down payment,

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.701
that netted against your
rent and now you're 16,000.

00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.468
Now you're 16,000 out-of-pocket.

00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:26.030
16,000 cost per year.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.479
Now, the way that I rigged
the numbers for this video,

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.421
it turns out that for this individual,

00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.948
purely on the economics,
purely for this year,

00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:34.676
as we'll talk about in a few seconds,

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:37.485
things might change in the ensuing years,

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:40.068
but purely for this year, if we can assume

00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:45.251
these numbers, it actually might
make sense to rent a house.

00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:47.871
Of course, this analysis
completely changes

00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.302
depending on how these numbers change;

00:07:50.302 --> 00:07:52.863
if this house were cheaper,
if you got lower interest,

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:54.876
whatever it might be, and all of a sudden,

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:56.486
this number might look better.

00:07:56.486 --> 00:07:59.172
If the rent was a lot higher, this number

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:01.458
would look, similarly,
would not look as good.

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.734
If your return on investing
weren't that good,

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:08.393
this number would be higher
and it would not look as good.

00:08:08.393 --> 00:08:11.478
The key thing to realize
is just try to analyze

00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:15.123
what your actual out-of-pocket costs are.

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:17.742
Well, look, just psychologically,

00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:19.275
when I'm doing this mortgage,

00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:22.194
at least it's forcing me to save;

00:08:22.194 --> 00:08:25.809
and that's true, it is a forced
saving that's happening here.

00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.326
But, in theory, you could do it here.

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:30.428
The equivalent amount
that you would have paid

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:33.142
for interest, or the interest
portion of your loan,

00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:35.336
that's your rent, and
above and beyond that

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:38.396
you could just save that $300 a month,

00:08:38.396 --> 00:08:40.773
and put it into your investment pool,

00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:42.609
and after 30 years, you might very well

00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:44.191
have a good amount of money there

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:47.734
collecting a lot, or
generating a lot of income.

00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:50.553
There's no very clear-cut
answer that renting

00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:52.352
is always better than
buying, or that buying

00:08:52.352 --> 00:08:53.646
is always better than renting.

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:55.363
It really depends on the circumstances.

00:08:55.363 --> 00:08:57.060
This is a back-of-the-envelope version;

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.092
in future videos we'll do
a more in-depth version.

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:01.291
But, other things that
we should think about

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.176
beyond just the numbers
are the intangibles.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.399
Let's just think about those in a second.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.269
Let's think about the
intangibles that favor renting,

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:12.116
and the intangibles that favor buying.

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.823
The biggest reason, and this is why

00:09:13.823 --> 00:09:15.601
we bought a house a few years ago,

00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:17.747
is for buying their stability.

00:09:17.747 --> 00:09:19.455
There is stability.

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:21.270
You might get a great deal on a rental,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.801
and the owner takes care of it,

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.530
and it's in a great neighborhood,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.065
but maybe they want to
rent it out to someone

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.860
else or maybe they want
to move into the house

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.734
themselves and then you've got to move.

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:34.251
If you buy a house, as long
as you pay the mortgage,

00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:37.188
or you pay off the house eventually,

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:39.487
you're pretty much, and you can pay

00:09:39.487 --> 00:09:40.876
the property taxes and things,

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:44.139
you're pretty much guaranteed
that you can stay there.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:45.947
Another reason that you might want to buy

00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:49.287
is rents are unpredictable;
rents could go up.

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:53.676
Rents could go up.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.531
If you're in a really rapidly
rental appreciating market,

00:09:56.531 --> 00:09:58.877
say, some place like
Manhattan or San Francisco,

00:09:58.877 --> 00:10:01.334
it's nice to be able to
say, "Oh, look, I got

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:03.132
"a fixed mortgage payment;
this is what I got to pay.

00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:05.952
Once I pay this thing
down, I don't have to worry

00:10:05.952 --> 00:10:08.505
about the craziness of
what rents might do because

00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:10.534
the economy is, because so many people

00:10:10.534 --> 00:10:13.197
want to live wherever
your house might be."

00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:14.873
Then, another thing, and once again,

00:10:14.873 --> 00:10:16.547
this isn't an exhaustive list, is that you

00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:19.127
can customize, and you
can make improvements.

00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:22.065
Back when my family was renting,

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:24.001
I can't tell you how many places we saw

00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:25.810
that looked really nice if they

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.890
had just changed this
bathroom a little bit,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.927
or if they just changed
that kitchen a little bit,

00:10:29.927 --> 00:10:32.660
or if they did not paint
that one wall yellow.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.751
When you buy a house you can
make those same improvements.

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:38.568
All the intangibles aren't
just on the buying side.

00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:40.267
They could also be on the rental side.

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:42.302
If you're just settling down in an area

00:10:42.302 --> 00:10:43.990
and you want to figure
out the lay of the land,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.797
you might not want to
commit to one neighborhood

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:47.878
or one house without
understanding things better,

00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:50.433
so you might want to have the flexibility.

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:52.657
Flexibility of renting.

00:10:52.657 --> 00:10:54.147
To keep buying and selling houses,

00:10:54.147 --> 00:10:56.008
there's a lot of costs
involved, especially

00:10:56.008 --> 00:10:59.656
when the cost of the
brokerage fees and whatnot;

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.461
so, you might like the flexibility,

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.167
you get into a 6 month
lease, 1 year lease.

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:04.778
Once you understand things, then you might

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:06.077
want to buy a house or then you might

00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:07.817
want to rent in another neighborhood,

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:13.398
and as we saw earlier in
the 2003 to 2008 period,

00:11:13.398 --> 00:11:14.945
sometimes you have housing bubbles,

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:17.055
and sometimes these
economics go way out of wack

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:20.465
and housing is just over-priced.

00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:24.701
Housing over-priced relative to

00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:27.663
Housing is over-priced relative to rent.

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:30.305
Once again, big takeaway,

00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:31.929
it all depends on the context.

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:33.855
Hopefully this gives you a
little bit of a framework

00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:37.117
for thinking about the
rent versus buy decision.
