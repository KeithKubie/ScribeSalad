THE NERD IS STRONG IN THIS ONE.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.601
[ ELECTRONIC BEEPING, CHIRPING ]

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:11.834
Narrator: THIS IS DONALD PAPP
AND HIS WIFE, SUSANNE...

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.434
SHOWING OFF THEIR SCI-FI WAY
OF COMMUNICATING.

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:18.767
IT SEEMS LIKE DONALD AND SUSANNE
HAVE LEARNED TO SPEAK DROID.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.801
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME CLEVER
ENGINEERING GOING ONE.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:27.868
Narrator: WHAT'S THE SECRET
BEHIND THIS CONVERSATION?

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:29.567
Wrigglesworth:
IN ORDER TO SPEAK DROID,

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.701
DONALD AND SUSANNE FIRST OF ALL
SPEAK NORMALLY INTO A HELMET.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.934
AND INSIDE THE HELMET,
THERE IS A MICROPHONE,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:39.534
BUT UNLIKE A REGULAR MICROPHONE,

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:42.400
WHICH PICKS UP SOUND WAVES
AS THEY TRAVEL THROUGH THE AIR,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.968
A LARYNGOPHONE WHICH IS
PRESSED AGAINST THEIR NECK

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:46.167
PICKS UP THE VIBRATIONS

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.467
DIRECTLY AS IT COMES OUT
OF THEIR VOICE BOX.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.701
THIS IS PERFECT
FOR THESE DROID HELMETS

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.000
BECAUSE THE MICROPHONES
ARE SO SENSITIVE,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.167
THEY CAN SPEAK QUIETLY AND NOT
BE HEARD OUTSIDE THE HELMET.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:57.367
[ ELECTRONIC CHIRPING ]

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.400
WHEN DONALD SPEAKS
INTO HIS HELMET,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.901
HIS VOICE IS PICKED UP
BY HIS LARYNGOPHONE,

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:04.067
CONVERTED INTO
AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL...

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:07.434
AND TRANSMITS IT WIRELESSLY
TO EARPHONES IN SUSANNE'S MASK.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.267
AT THE SAME TIME
THAT DONALD'S VOICE

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:10.801
IS BEING TRANSMITTED TO SUSANNE,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.501
ANOTHER ELECTRONIC SYSTEM
HAS DETECTED THAT HE'S SPEAKING

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.033
AND EMITS DROID SPEECH,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.601
RANDOM BEEPS AND BOOPS FROM THE
CONCEALED SPEAKERS ON THE MASK.

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.868
THE OTHER GREAT THING
ABOUT USING A LARYNGOPHONE

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:22.567
IS THAT IT DOESN'T PICK UP
ANY OUTSIDE OR BACKGROUND NOISE.

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:26.000
THIS MEANS THAT THE ACTUAL DROID
NOISE THAT THE MASK IS MAKING

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.567
ISN'T TRANSMITTED
TO THE OTHER PERSON'S EAR.

Narrator: YES, COMMUNICATION
IS KEY FOR EVERY MARRIAGE.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.634
WELL DONE, GUYS,
FOR TAKING IT TO THE EXTREME.
