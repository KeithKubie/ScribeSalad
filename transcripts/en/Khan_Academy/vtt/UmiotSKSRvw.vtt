00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.582
So where I left off, I was
hopefully trying to give you

00:00:04.582 --> 00:00:07.650
an intuition of this inward
acceleration.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.820
In this case, I have a rock
spinning around, and I'm

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.020
holding it on a string.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.100
And I want to think about what
the inward acceleration is

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.440
dependent on.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.570
And so we talked a little bit
about its velocity in these

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.250
multiple red arrows.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.740
These are potential
velocity vectors.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.760
So the point I was trying to
make is, if the velocity

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.070
vector is bigger, to change its
direction requires even

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.550
more acceleration.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.230
Because the change in the x
direction is bigger, and then

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780
the change in the y direction
is bigger.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.580
Because for example, right here,
it's y-- I'll draw it in

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.540
a different color-- it's
y velocity vector.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.350
And I'll do it for
the big velocity.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.100
Its y velocity vector
was here.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.720
And then now its y velocity
vector is almost essentially

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.150
the whole vector.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.490
So when the velocity increases,
and let's say this

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.940
is the case of the big arrow.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.480
If the velocity was less, like
the small arrow, its velocity

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.890
of vectors was here, and it
would have to go to here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.480
So I don't know if it's
completely obvious, but the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.220
change in velocity, for example
in the y direction

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.770
over this course of time,
has to be more.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.140
And likewise, the change in x
direction over this, and this

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
might be more obvious, because
here this is the x velocity

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.810
vector if the velocity
was less.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.840
And this is the x velocity
vector if it was more.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.020
And that's going to 0.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.060
Between when the dot goes
from here to here.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.920
Here it has no x component.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.672
So clearly, I would have had
to decelerate in the x

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:39.420
direction more, if we have
a larger velocity vector.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.315
I'm either giving you an
intuition, or I'm confusing

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.450
you, but I'll keep going.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.220
So velocity clearly-- the
greater the velocity, the more

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.290
I'm going to have to pull
in on this one.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.800
The more the inward acceleration
has to be to keep

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.730
this thing going
in the circle.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.840
And not only does the
acceleration have to be bigger

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.295
just to get that velocity vector
down, but you've got to

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:05.490
realize when, between this
point and this point, the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.360
faster I go, the less time it's
going to take me to get

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.340
from here to here.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.980
So not only am I going to have
to change the velocity more, I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.670
have to do that in less time.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.310
So the velocity is affecting
this acceleration that I need

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.390
to pull in two ways.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.650
So the higher the velocity, I
have to change more of the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.290
velocity, and I have to
do it in less time.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.170
And it actually turns out
that the acceleration is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.410
proportional to the
velocity squared.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.680
And then there's another
term, and I won't

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.360
prove it in this video.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240
I'm going to prove it
in another video.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360
And that might be out of your
scope just now, because it

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.120
requires some calculus.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.420
But I want to give
you an intuition.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.670
So we know that the acceleration
is dependent on

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.880
the velocity squared.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.800
And I want to make that point of
why it's not just velocity,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.390
because there's two ways that
the velocity is affecting how

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.980
much of an acceleration
I need.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.880
One, is just the magnitude
of the velocity.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.170
The more that is, the more I
have to accelerate to change

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.070
this direction.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.800
And the second is, between this
point and this point, I

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.190
have less time to change
that velocity.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.470
So the velocity affects
it in two ways.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.370
And that's where you get an
intuition for the v squared.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.780
The other thing that matters
is actually the radius.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.960
So let's say this
is the radius.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.990
And the acceleration
is inversely

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.850
proportional to the radius.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.180
And why is that?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.700
Well, it's kind of like the
second, I guess we can call

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.940
it, velocity argument I gave.
The bigger the radius.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.260
So let's say that, let's look at
this rate and let's look at

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.480
another radius that is bigger.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.350
Let's say that this
is another radius.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.040
Let's say if the string
was longer and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.290
this was another case.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.830
Let's says this was the case.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830
But the velocity was the same.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.110
So this is the case with a
larger-- so let's say it's the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.930
same velocity vector.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.890
So we have the same thing
at play, to go from

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.600
there to say, there.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.320
We have to change the velocity
the same magnitude.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.250
As we had to change the velocity
from here to here.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.920
But one thing changes.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.099
This distance is longer.

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.430
So if this velocity is the same
as this velocity, but

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.830
this distance is longer,
you have more time

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.550
to change the velocity.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.140
So the larger the radius, the
more time you have to change

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.240
the velocity.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.780
And so the less acceleration
you need.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.590
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.170
Let me repeat it.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.280
Because I think it's nice
to have the intuition.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.730
Between this point and this
point, unless you have a

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.040
smaller radius, if I want to
change the acceleration vector

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.380
from that to that, I have
however long it takes to go

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.030
this distance.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.660
I have that long to change
its velocity vector.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.990
But if the radius was
a little longer.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.840
And I had the same velocity, so
here the velocity is that.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.680
And then here, the
velocity is that.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.180
I have a little bit more time
to change its velocity.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.470
And remember, acceleration is
just change in velocity over

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.890
change in time.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.600
And so if I have the same change
in velocity, but I have

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.250
more time to do it with.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.170
This is a bigger number.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.370
The required acceleration
is less.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.330
So maybe I've given
you an intuition.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.630
And I will prove
this for sure.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.150
Because this is kind of a very
touchy, very soft way, and not

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.000
very rigorous way of proving
that the required acceleration

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.490
to make something going in a
circle is v squared over r.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.270
But accept that as a bit of
faith, and I'll prove it.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.960
Especially once you learn your
calculus, and you can watch

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.810
that video.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.890
And we could do a couple of
problems. And this is probably

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.930
what you care about anyway.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.100
But I think it's nice to
have that intuition.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.880
So once again, let's say
we're in deep space.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.280
Let's do a little
orbit problem.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.290
Let say that this is Earth.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.420
I will do Earth in blue.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.480
Let's say that is Earth.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.610
And I have a satellite that
is going around Earth.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.040
And I'm not going to calculate
its-- this is a satellite

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.370
that's going around Earth.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.730
And I'm going to do a whole
other video on actually

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.300
figuring out the gravitational
force depending on how far

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.530
away you are from an object.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.010
But let's just assume that its
gravitational force is similar

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.800
to what it is on the
surface of Earth.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.540
And that is a big assumption,
or let's assume this is a

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.170
different planet and I'm going
to give you the gravitational

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.300
acceleration.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.590
Let's say that the planet, and
maybe this isn't Earth, is

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.520
pulling inwards.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.340
It always pulls towards
its center.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.220
And I'll do that in
a different color.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.700
That it's pulling inwards
at 30 feet per second.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.200
My question is, what does the
velocity of the satellite have

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.890
to be for the object
to stay in orbit?

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.670
Well, we could just apply the
formula and then maybe we can

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.380
have a little intuition.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.040
So acceleration is equal--
oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:38.810
Let's say that the object is
6,000 feet from the center.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.970
And when we learn gravity, we'll
learn actually that it's

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.670
the distance from the radius
that you're going around is

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.640
actually relative
to the center.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.260
Well, actually it's always
going to be,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.900
because this is a circle.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.560
So, the radius.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.800
This is the center
of that circle.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.760
You don't have to worry
about that.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.330
It has nothing to
do with gravity.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.990
OK, so the acceleration
is v squared over r.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.590
Acceleration, we know is
30 feet per second.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.200
We want to figure out the
velocity, and then the radius,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.330
I said, is 6,000 feet.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.820
So let's ignore the
units for now.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.530
This could make things
complex.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.260
Multiply both sides of this
equation times 6,000, so 3

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.080
times 6 is 18.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.980
You'll have four 0's.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.690
2, 3, 4.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.200
So v squared is equal
to 18,000.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.120
Everything's in feet
per second.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.110
And so what's v?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.922
So v is equal to the square
root of 180,000.

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:34.159
Let me get the calculator out,
because I haven't memorized my

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.470
perfect squares that high.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.100
1, 2, 3.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.770
Take the square root, so 424.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.530
So the required velocity
is 424 feet per second.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.660
So if the satellite is at that
velocity, it will go in

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.970
perfect orbit around
this planet.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.860
Now what happens if
this object's

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.560
velocity is a little slower.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.280
What happens-- let me do it in
a different color so you know

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.680
what I'm talking about.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.790
What happens if its velocity
is a little

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.400
bit less than that?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.820
Let's say its is 300
feet per second.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.720
Well, then it's not going to be
able to travel far enough

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.180
tangent to the circle
to-- well, it'll

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.630
essentially just do this.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.480
It'll always be getting
a little bit closer.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.520
And it'll spiral in and
it'll hit the planet.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.510
And another way to think about
what the required velocity is,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.520
you have to go fast enough so
that you're always falling in.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.180
But every time you fall in, you
want to go in this case,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.440
the right enough so that you're
an equal distant--

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.540
you're still the same distance
away from the center.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.630
So that your distance from the
center never changes if you're

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.950
going fast enough.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.950
And then what happens if its
velocity is too fast?

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.530
What happens in the case
where its velocity is

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.800
600 feet per second?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.010
Well, in that case, the object
will have enough velocity to

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.020
actually escape the orbit
of the planet.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.020
But anyway, that's enough
about that.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.390
I'm actually out of
time, so I'll see

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.910
you in the next video.
