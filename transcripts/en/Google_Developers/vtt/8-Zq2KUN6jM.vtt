MATT MCNULTY: All right.

00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:04.720
I'm Matt McNulty.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.940
I lead the Polymer
team here at Google.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.900
That's a little small.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.320
I blame Eric, he actually made
these slides-- not the slides,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.770
but the framework for them.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.690
So my Twitter handle is there.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.420
Feel free to tweet
at me any time.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.370
About every three
months or so, I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.740
start getting tweets from
mostly women in the UK

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.120
saying that they love me
because apparently there's

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.450
an actor there whose name
is also Matt McNulty,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.390
and they follow me instead.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.230
So feel free to tweet
at me because I think

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.102
my most recent 10 tweets or so
are all about that because I

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.997
have to repeatedly point
out that I'm not an actor.

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:45.455
But yeah, so,
apparently, he's been

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.246
in something that's
not so great right now.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:50.450
But there's still a few people
that love him, apparently.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.240
So it's a nice
little ego stroke.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.760
So first thing I
wanted to show you,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.530
we have this designer tool.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.284
And we showed the beginnings
of it at I/O last year.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.950
And it's evolved quite
a bit since then.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.464
It's actually all
new code since then.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.630
And a few people are going
to be showing it tonight.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.910
So I just wanted to
introduce it really quickly.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.220
So this is what Steve
Jobs would call a hobby.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.240
This is not actually our
thing we're working on.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.480
But it's particularly useful
for showing off components.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.099
Eric talked about it
for a little while,

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.890
just about how composable
these things are,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.600
and how interop works, and
how it's really, really

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.540
awesome that you can
do things like drag

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
out a whole scaffold that's
built into an element.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.525
And I can maximize it.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.270
And if I flip to the code view,
which is very, very small as

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.130
well, you see that
all that is really

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550
just a little bit of markup.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.060
So it's really pretty cool.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.150
And Rob's going to demo this a
whole lot more in a little bit

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.327
as is Salesforce, so it'll
be pretty cool for you.

00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:48.910
But I just kind of
wanted to show that

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.970
and just show how
powerful Polymer is,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.550
and how you can build a lot with
just a little bit of markup.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.870
So how did I do that?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.550
Polymer.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.390
That's our pretty new logo
that you all now have toys of,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.140
which is pretty
awesome, by the way.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.640
We all spent about
four hours trying

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.860
to make them look like the logo.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.443
And that's actually
pretty challenging

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:10.330
if you don't have
something to work on.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.950
But so the big question
is what is Polymer?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.100
So Polymer is a library
utilizing web components,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.224
which you just learned,
about for building elements

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:19.630
and applications.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.150
So that's a lot of words.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.574
None of them have
a lot of meaning

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:26.240
other than web
components at this point?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.700
Web components, elements,
applications, like everyone

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.520
talks about that.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.090
These are very generic words.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.980
So really, what is Polymer?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.240
So Polymer is actually
a new kind of thing.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.364
This is something that
we need to do a better

00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:39.530
job of explaining to people.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.490
So this is not like the
things that have come before.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.490
Web components shipping is
a major inflection point,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.730
kind of, in the history
of web development.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.650
So there's going to be kind
of the things that came before

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.650
and the things that came after.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.300
And way you build
the web applications

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.675
is going to change, regardless
of whether you use Polymer

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.710
or not.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.064
This is the future
of web development.

00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:00.480
And it's the future
we were always

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.340
promised, way back in the day.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.780
This is the hoverboard.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.180
This is the thing
that we were told,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.680
you can build
applications this way.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.055
This is the way
it's going to be.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.720
But it's actually here now.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.190
And the only thing out there
that's this in any way similar

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.740
is actually X-Tags,
which Daniel Buchner's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.160
going to come talk
about in a little bit.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.597
Basically, everything
else is-- we're still

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.180
out in front right
now and just trying

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.630
to figure this
whole situation out.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.630
And these things haven't
even shipped completely

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.160
in the browser yet.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.380
So we're kind of out in Front

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.970
So Polymer uses web components.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.270
Eric talked about web
components quite a bit.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.060
But the major
differentiator with Polymer

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.643
and things that came
before is Polymer

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:38.300
doesn't paper over the platform.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.470
So as everyone in this room
is probably painfully aware,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.760
frameworks have had to
deal with a deficient web

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.210
platform for a
couple decades now.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.540
It just doesn't provide
enough functionality out

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.240
of the box to be
useful for people.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.490
And web components
and object observe,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.180
and a template tag change that
because a platform doesn't

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.610
need to be papered over anymore.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.550
So we came to Google
to prove this.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.460
So A, to prove that
the specs were good,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.807
and we did a lot
of work on that,

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:12.390
and also to prove
that they're useful,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.223
that you can build
something new out of this

00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:17.670
and that these things are
useful right out of the box.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.699
So wait, Polymer
isn't a framework?

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.990
They keep calling it a library.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.190
I'm saying previous
frameworks, things like that's.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.010
It's a little confusing.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.790
So with Polymer, the
thing we like to say,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.030
is the framework is DOM.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.034
So instead of
building a framework

00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:33.200
on top of the web platform,
now, if the web platform

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.830
is extensible, now that it
has scoping via shadow DOM,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.220
you can actually build things
and just use DOM methods again.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.352
So when we built
Enyo, the fastest way

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:44.810
to render something
on the page was

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.910
to splat out a big long
string in innerHTML.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.650
And we came to Google and
joined the Chrome scene.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.650
And we were like, well,
this is the fastest way.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.004
And they're like, no it's not.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.920
And we went and looked,
and it wasn't anymore.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.430
They had actually made creating
DOM nodes imperatively faster.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.010
So our mission here is
to use the platform,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.700
and the platform is DOM.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.877
And DOM is much more functional
now than it used to be.

00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:10.710
And our component model
was custom elements.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.150
We don't need a component
model built out of JavaScript

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.290
because custom
elements now provide

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.440
that same functionality
in the platform.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.510
And scoping, again, is
provided by shadow DOM.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.360
So a lot of people think
that shadow DOM provides

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.620
a level of security, or
that the JavaScript in it

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.240
runs in a different context.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.630
And none of that's
actually true.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.206
That would be useful
for some cases.

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:35.580
But what this
really does is kind

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.250
of the equivalent of classes
in almost any other language.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.400
It's scoping that you can pierce
the boundaries of if you really

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.330
need to.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.964
And it's still really,
really useful as is,

00:05:45.964 --> 00:05:47.880
even though this isn't
quite what people think

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.710
might think it is by
the name shadow DOM.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.970
So am I hating on
other frameworks?

00:05:55.427 --> 00:05:57.010
We actually wrote
quite a few of them.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.430
So there's people on the
team that helped write Dojo.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.140
We all wrote Enyo.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.070
And now we're here doing this.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.190
But there's a ton of great JS
frameworks out there right now.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.150
And they all had to do
superhuman things in order

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.091
to deal with the web platform
the way it exists right now.

00:06:13.091 --> 00:06:14.590
They didn't work
on the Chrome team.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.923
They didn't have Web Components.

00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:17.810
They didn't have
any of that stuff.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.020
And in my opinion,
actually, too much talent

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.450
is being spent
working on frameworks,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.390
papering over deficiencies
in the platform.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.941
And it's time to change that.

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.690
It's time to give those
people the ability

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.340
to build stuff beyond frameworks
that's actually interoperable.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.360
So a brief word about Polyfills.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.000
So Eric touched on this briefly.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.520
The Polyfills are
kind of a bridge

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.300
to the future that's
available right now.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.384
Polyfills are also a
lot of work to create.

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:50.300
So we built those Polyfills
for web components

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.800
and put them out there.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.370
About a year ago at I/O,
when we unveiled Polymer

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.940
with its current
name and everything,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.450
we've been open source
from the beginning,

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.220
the Polyfills
represented about 80%

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.430
of the work we'd actually
done to that point.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.720
So we presented it
as all as Polymer

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.925
because this was new
enough for everyone else.

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:10.760
It turns out, like,
Polyfills are really--

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.390
they are something that is
supposed to go away over time.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.940
And it's kind of
utilitarian thing.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.360
And they're not
actually Polymer.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.980
They're not what
we're providing.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.907
Polymer is the layer
above the Polyfills.

00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:24.990
So you'll see-- I see it
all the time where people

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.516
are like, oh, Polymer,
this set a Polyfills.

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:28.640
And it's actually not true.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.240
The Polyfills are
a means to an end

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.960
they are a bridge to
the future platform.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.510
And the other thing
about Polyfills

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.020
is that they actually
focus on compatibility

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.850
over everything else.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.270
Their goal is not performance.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.240
If you can make really
highly performant Polyfill,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.799
you wouldn't need
the native features.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.840
So a lot of times, you
have questions about that,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.390
and it's like, you know what?

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.500
The idea is the Polymer
works everywhere

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.130
because of the Polyfills,
but it's awesome on Chrome

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.440
because it has it native.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.720
So let's dig into Polymer.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.280
So Polymer is a sugaring
layer on top of the Polyfills

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.747
that lets you build your
own elements sets and apps.

00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:08.455
Again, sometimes you
hear people say, oh,

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:09.680
that's just for
building elements.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.929
But it's actually for building
everything if you want.

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:14.030
Your element can
be an input tag.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.786
Your element can
be an entire app.

00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.910
Eric did a great job of
showing a bunch of examples

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.300
of all that.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.720
And Web Components, why did
we have to build Polymer?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.240
Well, Web Components
are completely awesome.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.790
But by design, they are a
really low level primitive.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.580
It's in the name primitive.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.450
And that's the way
primitives should be.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.220
They should be maximally
flexible, maximally powerful,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.190
and maybe not
necessarily as focused

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.470
on developer ergonomics.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.172
So using them together right now
on their own is kind of tricky.

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:44.380
There's a lot of boilerplate.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.890
There's a lot of ways that
you can go wrong really,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.860
really quickly.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.236
And Polymer's whole job is
to make this way easier.

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:54.110
So the other thing is
Polymer is opinionated.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.780
So the things that are in the
lower levels in the platform

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.140
layer are standards track.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.940
But Polymer is where
the opinion lies.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.000
And we actually did some
changes here recently

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.970
where a lot of the
data binding stuff

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.680
we have was down in
the platform layer.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.138
And it's really not actually
ready for standards track yet.

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:13.480
So we pulled it up into Polymer.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.390
It makes Polymer
a little bigger,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.047
but it really
streamlines our story

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:19.630
and makes it really clear that
that platform layer is intended

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.340
to go away and go
away fairly soon.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.715
And the other
thing about Polymer

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:25.650
is these are conventions.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.899
These aren't standards, right?

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:30.450
These have not gone through
the standards process.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.700
And as such, they represent
our opinion, right?

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.500
So what is that opinion?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.090
What's our philosophy?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.240
So components all the way down.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.450
Thank, you sir.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.980
So we like to build things
out of smaller pieces

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.370
and compose them together.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.019
And honestly, we
feel like that's

00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:59.310
one of the major keys to
building a really big scalable

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.090
application.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.910
So a lot of people believe
that strong typing is a key.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.219
And it definitely is.

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:06.760
And one of the things
that we believe

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.370
is the separation of concerns.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.910
If you've got a
developer, and he

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.330
can worry about just the thing,
the small composable pieces

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.980
that's in front of him that has
one job to do that's reusable,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.880
you can compose that into
bigger and bigger pieces, right?

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.450
Smaller, reusable
components that

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.770
compose into larger components.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.010
Those components compose
into applications.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.260
And you can put those
applications wherever you want.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.670
And scoping enables
this composition.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.570
And again, it's scoping.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.635
And shadow DOM is about
scoping, not security.

00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:37.030
Not that I'm trying
to nail that home.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.300
So the other piece of Polymer is
that everything is an element.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.250
So this is our
implementation of components.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.480
Custom elements are the
components of Polymer.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.315
We use them
absolutely everywhere.

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:48.520
Eric touched on this.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.720
We've got UI elements.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.800
We also have, you
can wrap an API.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.190
We have a core local storage.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.700
And local storage is a
notoriously tricky API

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.270
to deal with.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.440
And you can throw a core
local storage element

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.080
on your page, link to using data
binding from any data source,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.800
and it persists.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.930
And it's that simple.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.350
It's really like a
couple mustache elements,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.010
and you're set.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.130
And even data, right?

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.760
We started out like JSON is
the format data should be in.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.301
And we decided to really push
the envelope here and go, well,

00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:21.170
what if we actually
stored data in markup?

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.500
I mean, it's basically JSON
and markup are essentially

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.590
the same thing with
a different syntax.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.150
So some of this we're probably
pushing a little too far,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.650
and we have to
really figure it out.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.920
But we're trying to
really explore this.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.961
Everything is an element.

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:34.600
Every single thing on your
page is a composable piece

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.480
you construct other things with.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.755
And then finally, the last
major philosophical piece

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:41.820
is less code.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.200
So don't repeat yourself is
a really big deal for us.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.740
And we want developers
to only write

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.239
code that's unique to their
app, or unique to their element,

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:50.820
and nothing else.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.270
And arguably, we're pretty
successful with that.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.180
And you can always get better.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.260
And the data binding,
including data binding,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.060
which we haven't done
before, greatly reduces code.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.740
And it's generally just
are a really awesome thing.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.290
I think Rob's demo
is really going

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.437
to show that off
really strongly.

00:12:06.437 --> 00:12:07.770
All right, so what's this world?

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.270
I've been talking
about what Polymer

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.055
is, what it isn't, and all
these different layers-- we

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:15.370
have a nice fancy
slide for that.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.660
So native, the bottle
layer is the browser today.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.320
And in reality, this is a
super, super rough surface

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.870
with a lot of nooks and crannies
where demons and dragons hide.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.715
And it's really pretty awful.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.090
And idea of the platform
layer of platforms JS

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.540
is it's a set a Polyfills
that lets everyone

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.800
build to the same
standards and puts them

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.350
across browsers today.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:40.430
And the idea is this big purple
box goes away completely.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.680
Polymer is this middle layer.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.500
So Polymer is a layer
of sugar on top.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.170
And it gives you an
easy way to build

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.397
these composable elements.

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:50.480
But this is our opinion--
this will never go away.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.910
This is the thing, the
value we are providing.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.000
And then what you build
with it is elements.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.955
So from sets of elements,
to individual elements,

00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:01.860
and we're working on this
kind of actively right now.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.610
So when we think about
how to use Polymer,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.480
there's really kind
of two major ways.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.850
Using elements is the first one.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.891
So we think that, the vast
majority of the world,

00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:12.990
they just want a particular
element on their page.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.310
If they've got a button
that's particularly cool,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.250
it has some progress
indicator, and they

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.040
want to put it on their
website and not think about it.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.740
And that's going to be the vast
majority of this kind of usage.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.360
Most people build selects.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.890
They don't re-created
them from scratch.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.570
So this is the majority case.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.530
But the majority case in this
room, and for developers,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.010
is going to be
creating elements.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.670
So we'll go over both of those.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.720
So using elements, we have a
whole bunch of elements today.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.800
We've namespaced most
of them core dash.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.600
We did a clean up
a couple of weeks

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.808
ago where we put all the
stuff that we weren't really

00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:51.180
concentrating on into the
Polymer labs organization

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.630
and left everything in Polymer.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.740
And we originally
had Polymer dash

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.100
on every single element
and pretty much everyone

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.600
who built Polymer
elements just kept

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.990
calling their
things Polymer dash.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.640
We realized that we needed
to set a good example.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.390
So the core dash is
just a name space

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.920
that we're using for
core utility things that

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.460
can be reused in a lot
of different places.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.280
But it's just a convention.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.170
And, as Eric touched
on as well, we

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.760
have a whole bunch of
non visual elements

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.260
that we've built
in Polymer as well.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.094
I've talked about core
local storage before.

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.593
And we have a whole
bunch of others.

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:24.850
And you can still see some
Polymer dash stuff there

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.850
that we haven't
quite updated yet.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.645
I focused on this being an
accurate slide as opposed

00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:33.070
to particularly sensical.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.680
And Polymer actually already
has well over 100 elements

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680
at this point.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.710
You can actually check
them out at Polymer Repo

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.010
and then also the Polymer
labs organization.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.120
So to use an element,
again, this is just

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.690
kind of for everyone, the
first step is to get the code.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.987
We tend to use
bower on the team.

00:14:49.987 --> 00:14:52.070
But you can also use, we
have zips for everything,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.736
you can use github,
you can use whatever

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.430
you want to use to get the code.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.380
So if you bower an
element and then include

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.100
platform.js at the
top of your page,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.480
and this is what gives
you the platform,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.190
the Polyfills will fall
back to the native code

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.987
automatically as it goes.

00:15:08.987 --> 00:15:10.320
And then you import the element.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240
This is an HTML import
that Eric showed you.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.120
You link rel and then
name of the element,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.927
and it's a .html
file, for first time.

00:15:15.927 --> 00:15:17.260
You're not importing JavaScript.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.006
You're importing HTML.

00:15:19.006 --> 00:15:20.630
And then once you do
that, you can just

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.210
use the element anywhere on
your page, and it just works.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.959
So it's really that
simple to get going.

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:30.250
But now creating elements is
where it gets interesting.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.150
And this gets to where Polymer
provides a lot of value.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.340
So we created a Polymer
dash element-- and this

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.930
is kind of the base
class of Polymer--

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.510
that you used to
define your elements.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.480
So this one, in
particular, just has,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.630
it's really, really simple.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.895
It actually has noscript
attribute in there.

00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:51.770
It's just a template.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.240
So a Polymer element, it's
creating an element named

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.015
my-element, which, when you use
it, is the tag name you use.

00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:01.140
And it just has a template.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.430
And the template has
CSS and some HTML.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.180
And this is about as
simple as it can get.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.971
And it justs put out
hello from my element,

00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:09.856
and if you inspect
it, it's my own.

00:16:09.856 --> 00:16:12.466
And this just works today.

00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:13.840
But you can add
a prototype to it

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.340
if you want to add
behaviors, if you

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.980
want to add properties and
methods to your element.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.580
So, in this case, we added
a method for say hello.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.450
And on a click, it's going
to do alert, howdy folks.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.982
And we're missing
some of the code

00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:27.690
here to make it a
little simpler to read.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.356
But I click on it,
it says, howdy folks.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.410
And then data binding is
another big piece that we do.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.360
So in this case,
we have a property

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.740
on the protocol called owner
that's default value is Rob.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.560
And then if you use the mustache
syntax actually in the HTML,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.160
and there's no other setup you
have to do, it will just work.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.651
So when it renders, it puts
Rob built me with Polymer.

00:16:52.651 --> 00:16:54.500
But you can publish
those properties, too.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.550
So if you want to publish
an API for your element,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.990
you can add it to the
attributes attribute, which

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.750
is cleverly named, of course.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.300
In this case, it has a default
value, but when you use it,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.580
you can override that value.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.520
The user of that
element can use that API

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.660
to override that value.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.910
And it does when it renders.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.530
But wait, you say,
how do I use this

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.540
with x, where x is name a
framework, name a technology,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.270
name some random
thing that you found

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.609
on the internet somewhere?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.849
So this is about interop.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.390
So Polymer elements are
"just" custom elements.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.550
This is our story for this.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.550
And I put just in quotes
because custom elements

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.240
are really, really cool.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.690
Outside of the
element boundaries,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.660
you have this element.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.880
It's got shadow DOM,
so it's got some scope.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.730
It has a boundary that can be
pierced if you really want,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.360
but it's safe in there.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.550
Outside of that element
boundary, looking in,

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.050
they can be interactive with
just like regular DOM elements.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.770
They have properties.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.370
They have methods.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.078
They have events.

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:54.080
This is just useful.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.470
It's just like any
other DOM element.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.400
Once you're inside
that element boundary,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.860
that's where you get
all the Polymer goodies.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.484
And the thing is,
those Polymer goodies

00:18:02.484 --> 00:18:06.170
don't leak outside of
that element boundary.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.090
So this lets Polymer play
really nicely with lots and lots

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.730
of other kinds of projects
because you can just

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.500
drop this element
in and it acts just

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.270
like a regular DOM element.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.830
So for interop, it's a
really, really good story.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.020
And you'll have instances where,
if you're inside of an element,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.790
there's things that need
to know about shadow DOM.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.070
But, basically, outside of
the element, it's all good.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.486
You can share
everything you want.

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:30.790
Inside of the element,
you get all the goodies.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.130
But things have to be
a little bit smarter.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.362
So the take away is this is a
really, really big new thing.

00:18:38.362 --> 00:18:39.820
We're bootstrapping
this ecosystem.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.472
And it's really for everyone.

00:18:41.472 --> 00:18:43.930
We're not going to be the first
do this, or the only people

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.790
to do this.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.120
We expect a lot
of other providers

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.860
to do this, and
individual developers

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.230
to build elements
and share them.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.290
We're creating a technology
for catalogs, standards

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.260
for documentation, ways
of distributing elements,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.926
and tooling, like
we were showing you

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:01.100
with the designer tool.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.100
And we're moving kind of
on all of this all at once.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.300
And where we're going, so
Polymer is in alpha right now.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.740
We said we were a pre alpha for
a fairly absurd amount of time.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.470
We changed that about two
months ago now to alpha.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.680
We'll be beta once the native
features ship in one browser.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.980
So what this looks
like is Chrome 36,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.960
which is Canary right now.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.510
It'll be in the stable channel
on the next two months.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.280
And then, kind of
at that point, we'll

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.887
flip it to beta because every
time one of the native features

00:19:33.887 --> 00:19:36.220
comes in, there's a lot of
churn right at the end, where

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.020
it works subtly differently
than the Polyfill does,

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.380
and we have to
reconcile the two.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.720
So we want to kind of avoid
exposing people to that churn.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.980
But you'll see, later
on, right after me, right

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.280
after the break, that
there's a lot of crazy people

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.300
who've actually built
stuff on this already.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.550
And more power to them.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.040
So how can you help?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.091
You don't have to do a
thing because there's

00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:02.090
going to be a whole bunch
of people here talking

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.881
to you in a minute.

00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:05.080
You don't even have to move.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.060
Go to Polymer project.org
and read more.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.470
You can tweet us.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.890
You can say love us there, too.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.155
I'll assume you're
talking about an actor.

00:20:15.155 --> 00:20:16.780
You can check us out
on Stack Overflow.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.655
That's where we like
all the questions to go.

00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:20.120
There's a Polymer
dev mailing list.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.786
We really prefer the
questions get there

00:20:21.786 --> 00:20:23.490
so everyone can see them.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.320
Build us something.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.028
Write an element.

00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:27.200
Wrap an API, and share it.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.490
Join the revolution.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.733
And check back soon because
we'll be at Google I/O,

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:35.510
and it'd be awesome to see
you guys all there, too.
