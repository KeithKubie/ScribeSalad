break them into three categories the
first one is about focusing on your

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.150
first one is about focusing on your
 

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.420
first one is about focusing on your
current user base and optimizing their

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:33.430
current user base and optimizing their
 

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.190

conversion the second one is thinking

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:38.860
conversion the second one is thinking
 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.530
conversion the second one is thinking
about new users that you can now reach

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.540
about new users that you can now reach
 

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.200
about new users that you can now reach
and the third one is completely new use

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.210
and the third one is completely new use
 

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.600
and the third one is completely new use
cases so again for conversion we think

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:48.610
cases so again for conversion we think
 

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.220
cases so again for conversion we think
about your current users and we're

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.230
about your current users and we're
 

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.660
about your current users and we're
thinking when we say conversion we mean

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:51.670

people because I'm not sure if they

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.170
people because I'm not sure if they
 

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.629
people because I'm not sure if they
listen to podcast and I don't know what

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639
listen to podcast and I don't know what
 

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:25.800
listen to podcast and I don't know what
their experience is going to look like

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:25.810
their experience is going to look like
 

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.370
their experience is going to look like
but now when I share a URL I know that

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:29.380
but now when I share a URL I know that
 

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.540
but now when I share a URL I know that
they're going to dive right into that

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.550
they're going to dive right into that
 

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.250
they're going to dive right into that
same native act experience that I'm

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.260
same native act experience that I'm
 

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.930
same native act experience that I'm
experiencing and I know that's a great

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:33.940
experiencing and I know that's a great
 

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.500
experiencing and I know that's a great
experience

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:34.510
experience
 

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:39.439
experience
so my propensity to share has increased

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:39.449
 

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.240
finally there are new use cases that

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.250
finally there are new use cases that
 

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.430
finally there are new use cases that
we're excited to see what what the

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440
we're excited to see what what the
 

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.170
we're excited to see what what the
people in this room start to think about

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.180
people in this room start to think about
 

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.120
people in this room start to think about
and develop now that there's no install

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.130
and develop now that there's no install
 

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.470
and develop now that there's no install
friction and there's not as much

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480
friction and there's not as much
 

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.910
friction and there's not as much
friction between the physical and

friction between the physical and
 

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.819
friction between the physical and
digital world so you can imagine when

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:53.829
digital world so you can imagine when
 

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:57.180

you go to a baseball game a museum and

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.190
you go to a baseball game a museum and

you want to map for the day you're not
likely to install an app or if you go to

likely to install an app or if you go to
 

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.889
likely to install an app or if you go to
the baseball game and you have an option

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:04.899
the baseball game and you have an option
 

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:07.170
the baseball game and you have an option
to order food to your seat but you're

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.180
to order food to your seat but you're
 

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.460
to order food to your seat but you're
like I don't want to install an app I'm

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470
like I don't want to install an app I'm

we've removed a lot of that friction so

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:13.269
we've removed a lot of that friction so
 

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:15.059
we've removed a lot of that friction so
there are opportunities to onboard users

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:15.069
there are opportunities to onboard users
 

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.470
there are opportunities to onboard users
and we're thinking here

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480
and we're thinking here
 

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.139
and we're thinking here
things like QR codes beacons NFC new

all friction points that we've heard

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:31.870
all friction points that we've heard
 

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.280
all friction points that we've heard
from developers so sign-in is one where

I mentioned it and a few slides ago

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120
I mentioned it and a few slides ago
 

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.000
I mentioned it and a few slides ago
where sometimes you're asked to sign in

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.010
where sometimes you're asked to sign in
 

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.500
where sometimes you're asked to sign in
when you have no idea what the app is

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:40.510

about other times with purchasing you
 

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.040
about other times with purchasing you
might not have a credit card around and

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.050
might not have a credit card around and
 

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.630
might not have a credit card around and
and yet you still want to purchase how

can we remove those friction points from

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400
can we remove those friction points from
 

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:59.370
can we remove those friction points from
apps so as I mentioned before sign-in

numbers what I'm wondering is how much

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:14.350
numbers what I'm wondering is how much
 

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.350
numbers what I'm wondering is how much
of that is from the decreasing install

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360
of that is from the decreasing install
 

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.970
of that is from the decreasing install
friction and how much is it from

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:17.980
friction and how much is it from
 

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.800
friction and how much is it from
decreases in the payment friction and as

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:19.810
decreases in the payment friction and as

we get more and more data I'm really
excited to parse that out and really

excited to parse that out and really
 

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.530
excited to parse that out and really
understand where how much value is

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:25.540
understand where how much value is
 

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.990
understand where how much value is
coming from each but right now as jet

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000
coming from each but right now as jet
 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.580
coming from each but right now as jet
has told us they're seeing significant

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:29.590
has told us they're seeing significant
 

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:35.010
has told us they're seeing significant
increase in purchases I also want to say

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.020
increase in purchases I also want to say

additional friction points and with our

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:40.570
additional friction points and with our
 

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.970
additional friction points and with our
partner early partners we did a lot of

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:41.980
partner early partners we did a lot of
 

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.560
partner early partners we did a lot of
testing we try different stuff out and

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.570
testing we try different stuff out and
 

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.149
testing we try different stuff out and
we realized that

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159
we realized that
 

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:46.649
we realized that
the thing we want to do is get the user

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:46.659
the thing we want to do is get the user
 

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:48.869
the thing we want to do is get the user
to that action that they came to do as

00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:48.879
to that action that they came to do as
 

00:21:48.879 --> 00:21:52.080
to that action that they came to do as
quickly as possible some early partners

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.090
quickly as possible some early partners
 

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.029
quickly as possible some early partners
tried splash screens others tried a lot

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039
tried splash screens others tried a lot
 

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.979
tried splash screens others tried a lot
of installation problems and we just

00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:55.989
of installation problems and we just
 

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:57.479
of installation problems and we just
think getting rid of all of these

00:21:57.479 --> 00:21:57.489
think getting rid of all of these
 

00:21:57.489 --> 00:21:59.669
think getting rid of all of these
friction points allows for a very smooth

installation in that case so let's talk
 

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.019
installation in that case so let's talk
about what that experience looks like

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:19.029
about what that experience looks like
 

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:22.909

to have this for offline usage so I
 

00:22:43.749 --> 00:22:45.479
to have this for offline usage so I
installed there and it allows me to

three different tracks there's the

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720
three different tracks there's the
 

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.050
three different tracks there's the
development track the pre-release track

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.060
development track the pre-release track
 

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.030
development track the pre-release track
and the prod track and this allows you

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.040
and the prod track and this allows you
 

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.560
and the prod track and this allows you
to do some testing upfront and make sure

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:34.570
to do some testing upfront and make sure
 

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.950
to do some testing upfront and make sure
that you're ready for production also

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960
that you're ready for production also
 

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.960
that you're ready for production also
the latest update that you push will go

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:39.970
the latest update that you push will go
 

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.210
the latest update that you push will go
directly to to who your users will serve

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:42.220
directly to to who your users will serve
 

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.560
directly to to who your users will serve
it directly to the user so if they click

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:43.570
it directly to the user so if they click
 

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.780
it directly to the user so if they click
that URL you get that updated Internet

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:47.790
 

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.520
we're also big proponents of

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:50.530
we're also big proponents of
 

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.990
we're also big proponents of
experimentation so we included something

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000
experimentation so we included something
 

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.850
experimentation so we included something
called the mobile hold back and we love

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:53.860
called the mobile hold back and we love
 

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.920
called the mobile hold back and we love
this idea this allows you to hold back a

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:55.930
this idea this allows you to hold back a
 

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.290
this idea this allows you to hold back a
percentage of your traffic to go to the

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:58.300
percentage of your traffic to go to the
 

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.900
percentage of your traffic to go to the
mobile web so if I put in point to point

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:00.910
mobile web so if I put in point to point
 

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.700
mobile web so if I put in point to point
to 20% of your traffic will go to the

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:02.710
to 20% of your traffic will go to the
 

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.710
to 20% of your traffic will go to the
mobile web and 80% of your traffic will

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720
mobile web and 80% of your traffic will
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.690
mobile web and 80% of your traffic will
go to in snaps this enables you to do

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:06.700
go to in snaps this enables you to do
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.970
go to in snaps this enables you to do
testing and experimentation we know that

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:08.980
testing and experimentation we know that
 

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.620
testing and experimentation we know that
you've optimized for years and years

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:10.630
you've optimized for years and years
 

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.420
you've optimized for years and years
your native app experience you've

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:12.430
your native app experience you've
 

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.230
your native app experience you've
optimized your mode

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240
optimized your mode
 

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.120
optimized your mode
web site and you've optimized your

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.130
web site and you've optimized your
 

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.980
web site and you've optimized your
desktop and we want to make sure we give

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:16.990
desktop and we want to make sure we give
 

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.900
desktop and we want to make sure we give
you the tools to now optimize in snaps

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:18.910
you the tools to now optimize in snaps
 

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.850
you the tools to now optimize in snaps
and try to make it the best property

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:20.860
and try to make it the best property
 

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:26.310

that you can so let's talk about now

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320
that you can so let's talk about now

that you can so let's talk about now
what type of metrics you'll now be

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240
what type of metrics you'll now be
 

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.150
what type of metrics you'll now be
tracking in the instant app that might

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.160
tracking in the instant app that might
 

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.200
tracking in the instant app that might
be different than how you thought about

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.210
be different than how you thought about
 

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.510
be different than how you thought about
with installed apps so I've showed two

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520
with installed apps so I've showed two
 

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.760
with installed apps so I've showed two
flows up here one is where you start in

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:35.770
flows up here one is where you start in
 

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.830
flows up here one is where you start in
an installed app with the Play Store you

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840
an installed app with the Play Store you
 

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.380
an installed app with the Play Store you
install your app you then signup you

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:40.390
install your app you then signup you
 

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.020
install your app you then signup you
then browse and engage with the content

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:43.030
then browse and engage with the content
 

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.870
then browse and engage with the content
of the native app and then potentially

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880
of the native app and then potentially
 

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.300
of the native app and then potentially
purchase for instance a few of these

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:48.310
purchase for instance a few of these
 

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.580

start to flip around first you're

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:50.590
start to flip around first you're
 

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.830
start to flip around first you're
entering the instant app from a URL

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840
entering the instant app from a URL
 

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.410
entering the instant app from a URL
you're then can immediately engage

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.420
you're then can immediately engage
 

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.870
you're then can immediately engage
without ever without signing up and you

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880
without ever without signing up and you
 

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.810
without ever without signing up and you
actually can purchase without signing up

00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820

install so you have to start thinking

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:07.300
install so you have to start thinking
 

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.270
install so you have to start thinking
about what are different metrics that

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:09.280
about what are different metrics that
 

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.890
about what are different metrics that
you now track that are important in in

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:10.900
you now track that are important in in
 

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.540
you now track that are important in in
snaps first you probably want to

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:12.550
snaps first you probably want to
 

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.550
snaps first you probably want to
separate installed apps and in snaps

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:14.560
separate installed apps and in snaps
 

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.660
separate installed apps and in snaps
when you're tracking just to see

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:15.670
when you're tracking just to see
 

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.520
when you're tracking just to see
different behavior maybe a user who's a

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:17.530
different behavior maybe a user who's a
 

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.170
different behavior maybe a user who's a
first visitor for your installed app

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:19.180
first visitor for your installed app
 

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.080
first visitor for your installed app
acts differently for your first visit

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.090
acts differently for your first visit
 

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.580
acts differently for your first visit
for your internet and that's because

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:23.590
for your internet and that's because
 

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.960
for your internet and that's because
you're actually creating different flows

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:24.970
you're actually creating different flows
 

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.760
you're actually creating different flows
the user might be coming through a side

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:26.770
the user might be coming through a side
 

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.740
the user might be coming through a side
door so that user in that context might

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:28.750
door so that user in that context might
 

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.260
door so that user in that context might
act differently you also might now think

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.270
act differently you also might now think
 

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.300
act differently you also might now think
about signed in users versus non signed

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.310
about signed in users versus non signed
 

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.250
about signed in users versus non signed
in users so from some of our partners

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:35.260
in users so from some of our partners
 

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.530
in users so from some of our partners
only had signed in users before and now

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:37.540
only had signed in users before and now
 

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.180
only had signed in users before and now
that they pull that out or moved it to a

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.190
that they pull that out or moved it to a
 

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.260
that they pull that out or moved it to a
different point in their internet

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.270
different point in their internet
 

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.760
different point in their internet
they're going to have non signed in

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:41.770
they're going to have non signed in
 

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.370
they're going to have non signed in
users you also have to think about URL

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:44.380
users you also have to think about URL
 

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.080
users you also have to think about URL
traffic sources which you might not have

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.090
traffic sources which you might not have
 

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.620

sure that all these metrics start to be
tracked for your instant app they are

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.050
tracked for your instant app they are
 

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.660

continuing to work with us to put
 

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.820
continuing to work with us to put
additional tracking and think through

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:05.830
additional tracking and think through
 

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.740
additional tracking and think through
different additional complex metrics

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:07.750
different additional complex metrics
 

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.930
different additional complex metrics
that make sense in Internet's for our

early partners a lot of them have
 

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.170
early partners a lot of them have
actually used their current analytics

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.180
actually used their current analytics
 

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.240
actually used their current analytics
SDK so now that we're opening

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.250
SDK so now that we're opening
 

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.580
SDK so now that we're opening
documentation today we were excited to

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:17.590
documentation today we were excited to
 

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.020
documentation today we were excited to
talk to more analytics providers and

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.030
talk to more analytics providers and
 

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.580
talk to more analytics providers and
start thinking about more metrics that

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.590
start thinking about more metrics that
 

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:25.049
start thinking about more metrics that
we need to start including in the SDK

00:28:25.049 --> 00:28:25.059
 

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:28.389
so with all the these partners have

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399
so with all the these partners have
 

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:30.310
so with all the these partners have
shared with me I've noticed actually a

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320
shared with me I've noticed actually a
 

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.899
shared with me I've noticed actually a
shift when they first started within

shift when they first started within
 

00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:33.340
shift when they first started within
synapse they often talk to me about

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:33.350
synapse they often talk to me about
 

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.379
synapse they often talk to me about
installation and there has been a shift

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:35.389
installation and there has been a shift
 

00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:37.720
installation and there has been a shift
