00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:11.006
&gt;&gt;Shula: Mission Lab is a design
studio within Quest to Learn.

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.206
It's comprised of game designers
and curriculum designers

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:16.926
and we work with
teachers at Quest to Learn

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:20.336
to help them develop their
curriculum and to design games

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:21.596
that are played in
the classroom.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:35.786
&gt;&gt;Shula: Part of what we do is
to identify pieces of content

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:39.586
that students tend to have
trouble learning or picking up

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:42.946
and when those areas come
up, we work as a team

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:45.906
to brainstorm ways that
we can design a game

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:50.396
that will help kids to better
understand and really learn

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.806
and remember these
content areas.

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:54.876
&gt;&gt;Arana: Mission Lab is
something as a structure

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:56.516
within a school that
does not exist

00:00:56.516 --> 00:00:58.526
in any other school
that I know of.

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:02.076
The support that it gives
teachers, I think especially

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:04.336
at a public school, makes
it extremely unique.

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.746
It's just a place where
teachers can really be creative

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:10.156
and are really encouraged to
be creative with our curriculum

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:12.056
and also a space
of collaboration.

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:14.176
&gt;&gt;Eliza: It is an
amazing experience

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:16.556
because you not only have
three heads working together

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.906
but you have three
heads that bring

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:21.416
such wonderful different
knowledge and skills

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:23.876
to the table that you
end up with products

00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:25.796
that wouldn't have ever appeared

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:27.756
if it was just three
teachers working together

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.896
or three curriculum designers
or three game designers.

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:32.906
&gt;&gt;Ameer: The teacher obviously
comes with the content expertise

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:36.956
in terms of what is mandated
to be taught and then through,

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.956
you know, group meetings
and discussions

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.276
with the curriculum
developers and game designers,

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:44.196
start to flesh out possible
ideas and directions

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.226
to go to teach the content.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:51.006
&gt;&gt;Daniel: The space
that we offer is just

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.466
like physically a necessary
place for teachers to go

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.036
to that's not like
a faculty room.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:57.866
It's a place where they can
go and think, not just go

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:00.456
and chill, and we are
there to help them think.

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:04.626
&gt;&gt;Claudio: In terms of knowing
what the teacher wants to teach,

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:06.526
I have some ideas
in my mind already,

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.516
but then the teacher comes
up with something else

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:10.656
which is very close to that.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.826
So I say, "Well, actually,
I was thinking the same,"

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:16.646
so when I see that connection
happening, we are almost

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:20.546
on the same wavelength, then I
say, "Oh, we should at least try

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.376
to prototype this idea
and see what happens."

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:25.456
&gt;&gt;Shula: When the collaboration
works, it's more successful

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:28.036
in the classroom because the
teacher feels ownership over it.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.156
&gt;&gt;Eliza: We see kids
excited, they're jumping

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:31.766
out of their seats,
they're yelling.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.396
They're talking about triangles
and Pythagorean theorem

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:36.896
and you can just see the
energy in the classroom.

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:42.206
I call it controlled
chaos, it is a lot of noise

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:45.426
but very specific noise
geared towards learning goals.

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.346
So it's this amazing
time in a classroom

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:51.316
where you know learning's
going on at the same time

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:52.716
that the students
are having fun.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.976
&gt;&gt;Student: We're not just
playing the games for no reason.

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:58.386
We have a goal in mind, so
our goal for the day may be

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:00.426
to learn certain Spanish words.

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:03.196
So we played Clue once,
but it was a Spanish Clue

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:06.846
and the object was to learn how
to say different Spanish foods.

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.146
So by playing the game we were
able to pick up the language

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:11.526
and speak it by the
end of the class.

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:13.836
&gt;&gt;Ameer: At first
you're like, "Oh man,

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:17.396
the second these kids hear
game, their minds change

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:20.586
and they start to get a
little excited, they talk,

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:21.576
they don't listen as much."

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:25.576
And that's true, and
from a kid's perspective,

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.306
every time they have
experienced games,

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.226
it's been in a more
lax environment

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.696
where they're supposed to
have fun and not worrying

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:32.896
about rules or anything else.

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:37.136
So as a teacher, it's your
job to present the game

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:41.076
in such a way that, yeah, we're
having fun, we're learning,

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:43.636
but at the same time, although
you're enjoying this game,

00:03:43.636 --> 00:03:46.846
you're still in a classroom and
the ultimate goal is not only

00:03:46.846 --> 00:03:49.586
to have fun but to learn what
we're trying to teach you.

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:52.806
&gt;&gt;Shula: One of the things
that gives games so much power

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:56.016
in teaching kids is that
games really encourage you

00:03:56.016 --> 00:03:57.346
to just keep trying.

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:01.436
This seems like a perfect fit
with when you're teaching kids,

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:05.676
to teach them in a safe
environment and encourage them

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:07.896
to just try without
fearing failure.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:12.446
&gt;&gt;Eliza: Oftentimes the
teachers bring up ideas

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:18.046
that we never thought of, and
so it changes the direction

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:20.256
of where we're going in
a particular brainstorm

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:23.256
or with a play test of a game.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:29.066
The teacher's feedback may then
shift the redesign of that game.

00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:32.836
&gt;&gt;Claudio: One block, you
need to touch that with one

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:36.456
of your units so it's touching,

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:39.906
then you can attack
and you can use that.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:43.216
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Mission Lab and
our meeting times are prompts

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:46.726
for teacher learning and teacher
reflecting on their next steps

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:47.636
when they're long term planning.

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:50.756
It's very easy to get caught
in the day to day as a teacher

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.146
and planning for the next
day, or maybe the next week,

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:54.246
or maybe two weeks
down the road,

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:57.476
but we try to force
the long term vision.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:01.356
And while it can be
a pain sometimes too,

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.516
teachers do appreciate
it in the long run.

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:04.916
&gt;&gt;Arana: There's
sort of a trajectory

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:07.156
to understanding the
nature of the collaboration

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:08.536
and so teachers who
have been here

00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:12.756
since the beginning are very
protective of their relationship

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.076
with the curriculum team.

00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:16.906
Curriculum meeting times
are kind of like times

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:20.866
that are never touched
unless they really have to be

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:23.686
and teachers protect that
more than anybody else does.

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:25.516
&gt;&gt;Claudio: Games can
be considered almost

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:27.726
like a second language,
a universal language

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:31.056
for the world, because those
are experiences that a lot

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.206
of people go through
and they connect to,

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:34.516
maybe in similar ways.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.856
And so there is already some
kind of connection there,

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:41.016
so if something is working
here, I don't see why something

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.786
like this wouldn't
work in other places.
