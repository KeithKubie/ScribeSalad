BRADY FORREST: Hi I'm
Brady Forrest,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.900
and welcome to Ignite.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.970
BRADY FORREST: Unfortunately, we
don't have beer this year.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.059
You can bring that up
with the management.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.180
But I'm just thrilled
to be here anyway.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.595
And how are you all
enjoying I/O?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.680
I hope you are ready
for just kind of a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.190
Gatling gun of ideas.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.610
We have a great set of speakers
today to kind of

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.010
round out the second day of I/O.
And believe you me, these

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.510
people will enlighten you.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.460
And what these--

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.250
in case you haven't been to an
Ignite before, what we have

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.830
here is a series of five minute
presentations, where

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.760
each speaker gets just five
minutes on stage.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.920
They get 20 slides.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.830
They get 15 seconds a slide.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.960
And just like me, they have no
control over those slides.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.530
And so it makes it for a little
bit more frenetic--

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.420
a little more fun if they're
drunk-- which they're not.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.880
We didn't bring whiskey--

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.129
but it has its charms anyway.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.560
And we've got a great selection
of content tonight.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.650
Now Ignite, if you haven't heard
of it before, is in over

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.410
200 cities around the world.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.630
So I encourage you to go home
and participate in your local

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.620
one or start one.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.940
Now our 13 speakers are going to
cover topics as diverse as

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.330
the Shenzhen hardware ecosystem,
the Marvel data--

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.860
Marvel Comics, that is,
and the rise K-Pop.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.080
Now, a good friend of mine who
actually spoke at the very

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.390
first Ignite, is here
to talk about better

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.950
living through Bluetooth.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.200
Please welcome Dan Shapiro.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.750
DAN SHAPIRO: Thank you Brady.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990
So I got this amazing
headband.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.810
You put it on.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.750
It has these little silver
eye sensors.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.070
It measures the microvolt
signals coming off of your

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.290
brain and the twitch from your
eye muscles, sends to your

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.430
phone via Bluetooth, where
there's a neural network that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.530
decodes them and puts
them up in a graph.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.920
It's called a Zeo.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.780
And it basically knows if you're
sleeping, it knows if

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.315
you're awake--

00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:07.580
It's like Santa Claus
in a box.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.310
It can tell you your
sleep over the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.789
course of a whole night.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.260
I got this for my dad.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.560
He wanted to learn more about
his sleep habits.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.310
Unfortunately, what he learned
about his sleep is that he's

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030
in the habit of grabbing the
thing off his head in the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.530
middle of the night and throwing
it against the wall

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.800
very vigorously.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.840
So he never got too
much from it.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.790
But I thought it was amazing.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420
I actually have trouble falling
asleep-- always have.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.800
And so I wound up getting all
this data every morning.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.650
I could tell what the phases
of sleep were, if I

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.870
woke up, how long--

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.940
and what I learned was, I always
thought it took me an

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.370
hour to fall asleep.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.440
It actually only took me half
an hour to fall asleep.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.760
And this was magical.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.490
Because once I knew it, I
started falling asleep in 15

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.560
minutes because I wasn't
stressed out anymore.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.790
And once I started falling
asleep in 15 minutes I started

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.100
going to bed earlier, because
hey, I didn't, like, postpone

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.150
it because I thought I was going
be tossing and turning.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.030
It was awesome.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.960
So just by getting the data,
I wound up sleeping better.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960
And as the nights wore on I
wound up having more REM

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.760
sleep, more deep sleep, and
longer nights of sleep, even

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.010
though I wasn't doing any,
like, bedtime setting

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.100
craziness-- nothing like that.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.970
I was just following the data.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.480
So more data.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.220
I went to my doctor and I said
I want to get a sleep study.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.970
This is where they strap 20
electrodes on your skull.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.600
They measure your arm motion,
your leg motion, your

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600
respirometry--

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.480
the whole thing.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.290
And it turns out I have
something called sleep apnea,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620
which basically means I
stop breathing in the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.400
middle of the night.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.250
So I get this sweet jet fighter
mask that I get to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.400
wear every evening that prevents
the heart damage that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.770
comes from sleep apnea,
and actually

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.170
helps me sleep better.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.330
I was talking about this with my
friend Matt, who also had a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.610
sleep study, and he said, you
know, my sponsor for my latest

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.120
video is this company up in
the corner called 23andMe.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.040
You should send them
a cup of your spit.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.830
Because these guys actually
measure your chromosomes, and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.640
tell you all sorts of

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.660
interesting stuff about yourself.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.620
So I drooled into a little cup,
shipped it off to them,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.280
and it was amazing.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.690
I learned I'm predisposed
to heroin addiction.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.860
I learned I'm a descendant
from the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.300
Cohen tribe of Israel.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.980
I learned that I'm at seriously

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.560
elevated risk of dandruff--

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.640
3 and 1/2 times the normal
person's risk.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.760
But the thing that was most
interesting was I learned I'm

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.625
a fast caffeine metabolizer.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.150
Now, I've never been a
coffee drinker, which

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.430
is kind of a shame.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.940
Because coffee is like vitamin
C. The more research that's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.010
done, the longer the list of
things that coffee seems to

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.120
prove to prevent--

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.010
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
cavities for Pete's sake.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.100
This stuff is miraculous.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.510
One problem.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.890
Coffee tends to lead
to heart attacks.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.430
But not for fast caffeine
metabolizers.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.140
Fast caffeine metabolizers who
drink coffee regularly in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.360
moderation actually experience
fewer heart attacks than the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.890
general population.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.310
Sweet.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.170
So now I'm drinking
coffee every day.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.100
That was easy.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.650
At work they offered to give
us this health workup.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.790
They give you a yellow, red,
or green for all sorts of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.980
different attributes.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.440
I did it and I don't
eat particularly--

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.380
I eat a lot and I don't like to
exercise, so I thought it

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.350
was going bad.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.270
They basically came back and
said, Dan, you should lose

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.250
some weight.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.750
OK, wait.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.130
This isn't like LDL
cholesterol.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.400
This is physics.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.560
This is mass.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.900
I can measure this.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.680
So I bought a Bluetooth scale.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.330
Every morning I stand on
the Bluetooth scale.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.820
It sends the weight
to my phone--

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.040
to the web--

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.780
and the weirdest thing
happened--

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.590
data.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.930
Change started happening.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.320
I started losing weight.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.640
I didn't go on a fancy diet.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.590
A friend of mine at work started
going vegan at the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.020
same time, and he dropped
weight a lot

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.100
faster than I did.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.070
But the man was miserable.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.280
I was losing weight just by
watching what was going on.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.490
OK.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.040
Well wait.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.300
Let's try exercise.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.780
I've never held an exercise
regime in my life but this

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.545
little thing, this Bluetooth
pedometer cost $50.

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:57.080
I've got one in my pocket,
gave a half dozen to my

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.100
friends and coworkers, and
I've gone from walking an

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.240
average of about 2,500 steps a
day to 8,500 steps a day just

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.580
by watching the email that
comes out every week that

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.680
makes fun of me for not walking
enough when my friends

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.360
are doing more than I am.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.220
So, I'm sleeping better.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.095
I'm eating better.

00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:18.290
I'm drinking more coffee, which
I've learned is a good

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.700
thing, and I've lost weight.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.560
I am not a health guru.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.990
I am no fitness expert.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.890
I am not going to tell you
how to live your life.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.490
But there is something I
want to suggest to you.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.880
If there is some aspect of your
life that you would like

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.140
to change, you could do a lot
worse than finding some gadget

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.950
that can measure it for you.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.440
Thank you very much.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.300
PETER OLSON: Hi.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.000
As I wait for the slides.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.970
My name's Peter Olson.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.480
I work for Marvel
Entertainment.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.990
Some of you may have heard
of this company.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.150
And I'm going to talk to you
today about the challenges of

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.000
finding structure and meaning
in very complicated data

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.980
sets-- say a data set that has
been put together by hundreds

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.840
of writers, artists, editors
over the course of 70 years.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.250
Now, a lot of you probably deal
with very important real

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.610
world data sets, and I'm hoping
that our exploration

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.940
into fictional data sets
is of some use to you.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.320
Now comic universes are
amazing places.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.290
People can fly.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.790
They can survive lethal
doses of radiation.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.380
Southern accents sound
like that.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.490
But they do not lend themselves
to structure.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.320
But in order to represent
a universe and the

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.330
bibliographical things that
contain it, you need

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.520
structure, you need data, you
need schemas, you need

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.990
semantics, you need data types,
and you need a shared

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:55.080
understanding of how entities
behave in the universe you're

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.970
looking at.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.730
And I believe personally that
data is actually part of the

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.360
comic's experience.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.410
If you've ever been in an
argument over whether

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.150
Wolverine could beat Sabertooth,
or Batman could

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.320
beat Superman--

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.370
and I've bet a lot
of you have--

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.430
you've been in an argument
about data.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.300
Data also gives us new
and interesting ways

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.900
at looking at fiction.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.120
This is a graph representation
of the Marvel Universe.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.170
Each point is a character.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.700
Each line is an interaction
between one or more

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.450
characters.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.690
So a first challenge--
how do you

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.450
represent a fictional entity?

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.390
Now you might think it's a
pretty simple exercise.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.380
There's an entity.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.100
It has attributes.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.640
Those attributes are
relatively static.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.679
So you think of Hawkeye.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.039
He has blond hair.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.299
He is an archer.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.680
He has a purple costume.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.710
He shoots arrows.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.580
And we modeled characters like
this for a long time.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.890
And then we started to look at
the stories, and we realized

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.530
that this wasn't a complete look
at how characters behave

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.890
in fiction.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.590
The important thing about
fiction, and characters in

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.660
them, is that they change.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.990
So Hawkeye has been a villain.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.720
He was Goliath.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.270
He was Hawkeye.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.650
He was dead.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.450
He was Ronin.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.140
He came back.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.500
And now he's Hawkeye just
in time for the movie.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.960
Another challenge--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.120
comics use bibliographical
organization to tell stories.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.460
So you might think, OK
I've have seen the

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.960
Captain America movie.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.830
I want to read the first issue
of Captain America.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.600
Where should I start?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Oh, Captain America,
number one.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.340
Well there are six Captain
America number ones.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.180
This isn't just Marvel.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.910
DC just renumbered their entire
line about a year ago.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.160
And renumbering is actually
a way of signaling to an

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.700
audience that something
important has happened in this

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.640
story, in this character.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.770
It's actually part of the
comic's experience.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.630
By the way, if you actually want
to find Captain's first

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.070
appearance, it's not in a book
called Captain America.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.490
It's Captain America Comics.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.070
Yes that is Cap punching
Hitler in the face.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.330
The first book called Captain
America starts with issue 100.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.000
This type of thing happens
all the time in comics.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.870
X Men becomes New X Men becomes
X Men and then goes

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.680
back to X Men--

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.920
goes to X Men Legacy without
changing numbering.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.520
The Incredible Hulk dropped its
main character but kept

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.630
its numbering.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.100
The Deadpool book starts at
900 and counts backwards.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.200
Oftentimes bibliographical
structures fight against story

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.730
experience.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.370
If you think of stories as an
ordered sequence of events--

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.640
they have a beginning,
they have a middle,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.950
they have an end--

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.810
you would expect that the books
that organize those

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.590
stories follow that
story in sequence.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.440
So in the Spiderman books, you
would expect that a story

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.890
flows from friendly neighborhood
Spider Man, to

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.020
one, to two, to three,
to four, and so on.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.910
But in order to read this
story-- it's call Spiderman,

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.380
The Other-- you actually have
to read across series.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.670
This is very, very difficult
to represent to consumers--

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.630
to people who have never read
a comic book before.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.500
So what can you do when you
have crazy data like this?

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.860
Well first, find atoms.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.240
Find things that are
indivisible--

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.730
that don't change.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.960
And often these atoms
are under the hood.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.260
They're not in the entity you're
used to dealing with.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.030
So in the example of characters,
we found the thing

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.840
that is important is not a given
set of entity attributes

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.750
that doesn't change.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.510
It's that there are moments in
story time where entities have

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.090
specific attributes.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.910
For comics we found that there
are indivisible units of story

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.410
that exist outside of the
bibliographical structures.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.470
And those units of stories can
be organized into new and

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.270
interesting organizational
entities such as storylines,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.680
such as character timelines,
and things like that.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.390
So thanks.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.200
If you're interested in this
type of comic arcana, we have

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.120
a schema.org proposal currently
under consideration.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.160
And you can get me
@dethtron5000.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.130
Thanks a lot.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:58.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.980
FREDDY VEGA: My name
is Freddy Vega.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.210
I came from the exotic land
of South America--

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.740
Colombia.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.005
And I'm here to talk about how
we are living in the best age

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:09.720
of humanity ever, and that's
thanks to education--

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.950
mainly online education.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.950
There's a lot of people talking

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.330
about online education.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.480
Coursera is incredible.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.910
EdX is amazing.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.160
There's something called Massive
Online Open Courses.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.270
It's like a MMORPG's, but
without the multi-player part.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.330
They are doing great things,
but online education can be

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.720
so, so much more.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.610
This is a story that
starts in 2004.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.830
I wanted to learn PHP.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.770
There was such an era
when PHP was cool.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.380
And so I went ahead and used
PHP to create Cristalab--

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.220
a community of web designers
and developers.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.930
That community grew a lot.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.490
We are right now at
two million unique

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.530
visitors per month.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.100
So we decided to create
another company.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.190
So with Christian Van Der Henst,
that guy over there, we

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.470
created Mejorando la.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.490
Mejorando la is a company
dedicated to organize courses

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.510
around Spain and
Latin America--

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.900
courses about HTML5,
Node js, Python.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.020
We started in 2010, and we've
already done 30 courses around

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.680
12 countries.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.200
And we teach to 3,000 students
all of these technologies--

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.150
HTML5, Python, Node js.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.380
We wanted to bring them the
best, not just the PHP course.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.750
I'm sorry about all
the PHP lovers.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.800
I'm so, so sorry.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.220
These courses are great.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.950
And they started to grow
incredibly, incredibly popular

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.980
because we were doing
something different.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.250
For example I think that copying
from the projector, or

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.370
from a white board
is medieval.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.840
So we have a central server
and other things to copy.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.100
But traveling sucks.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.480
Traveling plus 9/11
absolutely sucks.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.210
And we were traveling to a
different country each week.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.980
I was tired of travel, and I
wanted to fix online education

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.040
with a multi-player part.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.230
So what's wrong with that
Massive Online Open Course

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.510
that we have right now?

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.480
Right now Massive Online Open
Courses are specialized CMS

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.680
for text and media.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.150
And sadly nothing more.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.940
They are doing a great job for
bringing the best content on

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.260
big, huge brand schools to
all people for free.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.500
But they are lacking the
connection to students.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.010
Coursera right now has a
retention rate of 7%.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.170
EdX and Udacity have
similar numbers.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.560
That means that for each 100
people that try to take a

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.430
course on Coursera, only
seven people finish.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.780
Why is that happening?

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.730
So we tried to create a
different kind of system--

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.690
a different kind of education
system that will fix that.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.780
And we were trying to gather
inspiration from where people

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.970
were really spending time.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.890
So I tried to earn inspiration
from threaded discussions,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.770
quota questions, gaming
and streaming--

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.940
a lot of people are spending
time over there-- and we

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.060
created something
called Platzi.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.500
Platzi is online education
with that part.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.870
We tried to bring
that community

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.280
part to online education.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.280
We didn't have any money because
funding in Latin

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.760
America is almost nonexistent,
but we did

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.910
these on-site courses.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.960
We used all the money from
the on-site courses

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.500
to create the platform.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.240
This is the platform.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.430
And it has all the things that
you would normally expect from

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.860
a platform.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.350
It has guides, text,
media tutorials,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.310
and blah, blah, blah.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.260
But interesting things are
on the right side.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.630
That's our question
and answer system.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.030
A question in our system is
only as big as a tweet.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.140
People have to be specific
to ask questions.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.420
You have nested comments,
very similar to a

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.250
mobile version of Reddit.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.720
You have upboats, downboats.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.990
We also have a system where
people can write answers with

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.330
Read Text and code without
needing to

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.550
run Markdown or BBCode.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.510
Just [INAUDIBLE], as far as
I know, is the only one.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.740
Our first course generated
40,000 questions.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.190
And 99.1% were rightfully
answered, mostly by the

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.750
students, because we were
making the best

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.850
students answer it.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.170
And the slow or normal students
are being leveled out

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.450
by those best students.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.950
We also have live streaming
classes.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.070
We are using a technology that
enables us to do online

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.580
streaming in PCs, desktops,
mobiles, et cetera.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.250
When a teacher wants to share
a file, he just right-hand

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.560
drops, and the students
see it on the corner.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.110
And if it can be selectable,
its colored, et cetera--

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.770
also for any kind of file.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.360
Chats are normally useless.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.980
But in our system, the students
use the chat as an

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.580
annotation system and it has
the stars, an about.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.660
So the system outergenerates
a summary of each class

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.110
automatically, after one
of each classes.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.030
In three courses, 97% of the
students finish everything.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.090
We've done three
courses so far.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.960
So it works.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.840
Our system works.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.360
How much have we done this?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.430
How many students
have we reached?

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:15.890
We've done three courses
this year.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:21.410
We had 3,400 students, charging
$95 to each of them.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.460
And right now we have only
done this in Spanish.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.932
We are really wondering what
happens if we do this in the

00:16:27.932 --> 00:16:30.110
English world.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.075
What I want to say is that
online education is not about

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:32.600
technology.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.220
It's not even around who's
teaching or who's certifying.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.370
It's about finding a way to
connect the students to our

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.300
students, to create the
workshops, the study groups,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.260
and the things that
the students

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.230
normally do in colleges.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.690
And if you want to learn more,
if you want to know more about

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.240
the platform, or you want to
say, hey you are wrong,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.290
education is like this and like
that, please contact me

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.215
over there on Twitter.

00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:52.390
Thank you

00:16:52.390 --> 00:17:00.070
very, very much [APPLAUSE]

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.870
NATHAN FREITAS: So I was
encouraged yesterday at the

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.910
keynote, hearing about Android
and the reach of Google

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.200
wanting to expand to the rest
of the world that we haven't

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.180
gotten to yet with
this technology.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.380
Unfortunately, the rest of the
world doesn't always work the

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.260
way we think it should, and
doesn't treat users with the

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.170
same respect that we
think they should.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.670
The great firewall might be a
familiar term to a lot of you

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.195
but the problem today is more
one of a panopticon--

00:17:22.195 --> 00:17:25.940
an all-seeing eye at the end of
a gun, where every action a

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.819
user is doing is being
surveilled.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.550
We're not talking about
blocking a site.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.470
We're talking about all the
activities of a user in their

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.380
mobile device and their
digital life.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.320
And the surveillance
is crowdsourced.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.700
It's not just one firewall.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.550
It's every person around you.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.210
The onus is on the company,
the service provider, the

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.910
software creator to observe
and watch and report and

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.260
filter to create a harmonious
society.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.100
It's not about websites
anymore.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.970
It's about ebooks and apps--
filtering them, blocking them,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.550
reporting their authors.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.170
It's about blocking artists
and cultural figures from

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.690
communicating such as Ai
Weiwei's Gangnam Style video,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.030
which never reached a mass
audience in China.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.090
So into this comes an
app like WeChat.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.000
WeChat is yet another of these
all-messaging, all-phone, take

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.150
all your communications and
put it through our app--

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.480
all with stickers and emoji,
and colorful icons, and a

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.260
whole lot of fun and
great marketing.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.900
So WeChat is a Chinese
company.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.120
This is what's interesting.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.580
It's been growing like
crazy since 2012.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.570
It's got numbers, WhatsApp
numbers, Facebook numbers,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.150
Twitter numbers-- it has HangOut
numbers in and it

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.600
didn't even auto-install
the app.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.330
So it's really crazy.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.840
So you take this issue that it's
a Chinese company working

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.050
within a Chinese society, and
of course you have baggage

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.966
like restricted keywords
happening, right?

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:38.660
So keywords being filtered--

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.530
Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen
obviously, but much more.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.240
Eviction, environment,
everything--

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.860
and now that's exported
to the world.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.870
So what we've seen is that
Hu Jia, a famous Chinese

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.300
activist, decided, well maybe
I can use this WeChat to

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.810
organize and communicate.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.200
And what he found was
the opposite.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.030
It had made the surveillance
state that much more

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.070
efficient, within an hour, able
to report and communicate

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.370
and interrogate.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.460
Expand this to others
in China--

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.720
Tibetans who have been fighting
a battle to have

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.940
their country back for
over 50 years.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.880
They gravitate towards
smartphones because it helps

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.440
them communicate to
their exile and

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.350
diaspora family members.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.470
At the same time as the rise of
WeChat, we've seen a rise

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.650
in the self-immolation protest,
where Tibetans are

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.070
setting themselves on fire
in order to have

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.320
their voices heard.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.380
So of course this is a topic
of discussion for Tibetans

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.130
around the world.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.000
They're using WeChat.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.840
Of course they are.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.500
It's the best way to
get information

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.720
when it's not filtered.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.490
And so inevitably we see Tibetan
monks being arrested

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.690
for using WeChat to talk about
things that are happening

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.670
right around them
with each other.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.390
Instead of texting or calling,
they're using this friendly

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.950
auto-surveillance state app.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.160
Now there is a light at the
end of this tunnel.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.370
There's something that Tibetans
are doing themselves.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.320
A project called the YakChat,
based on code by

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.750
[? Marley Moxenspike, ?]

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.750
that uses secure messaging along
with delightful icons to

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.820
create a humorous response to
such a bad, onerous problem.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.670
So YakChat is an app that is
available for Android.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.610
It's open source.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.150
But it's not really about WeChat
or China or Tibetans.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:10.860
This is really about you.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.330
Because the problems in China
are quickly becoming problems

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.160
everywhere.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.380
The tools are being
commoditized.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.760
The software is easy.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.480
Everyone knows how to do
surveillance state stuff.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.160
So you really need to encrypt
all the things, right?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.330
Because you don't know who might
be doing something that

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.140
someone doesn't like.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.970
You could be gay in Uganda, you
could be a woman in Saudi

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.260
Arabia, you could be a
journalist just about

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.990
anywhere, these days.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.250
You can't expect the network
to behave properly.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.000
Man in the middle attacks
are normal.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.430
CA cert route, pwnage, and
exploits are normal.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.780
You need to use things like Tor,
and build proxying into

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.830
your applications.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.120
Twitter added proxy support
into Twitter.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.910
Why does your app not
have proxy support?

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.940
You need to expect the internet
may not exist.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.010
And if you've been at this
conference, you can sympathize

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.320
with that because every single
app just falls over and stops

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.270
working as soon as there's
no internet, right?

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.510
So you need to build in
peer-to-peer, mesh.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.690
And finally--

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.670
well not finally, there's
a few more slides--

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.790
free beer is good.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.870
Free stuff is great, especially
for activists and

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.050
people around the world.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.310
But you need to consider the
impact on speech, and the

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.780
ability for them to express
themselves and to build on

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.990
your code, and to build
on what you've done.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.230
So YakChat came out of
TextSecure which is an open

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.740
source project from Moxie.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.760
To stop being serious for a
moment, emoji are awesome.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.460
Emoticons, stickers, emoji--

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.450
I love these things.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.640
People that work in movements
that work for change are often

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.580
very creative and expressive.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.080
So you can't make an
app that's boring.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.500
Ultimately, China is an amazing
culture and it's an

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.190
amazing place.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.340
And I want them to take their
place in this world.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.850
And I love cultures
within China.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.430
There's so much-- the
Tibetan culture--

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.190
you can learn more
about China.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.545
The reason WeChat is taking off
is they know more about us

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:54.220
than we know about them.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.010
So you need to take
responsibility and make your

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.030
apps great.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.470
And use some of this code
we have at Guardian

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.550
Project to do that.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.925
Thank you very much.

00:22:01.925 --> 00:22:09.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.120
KIM TECK CHUA: Hello everyone.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.140
I'm Kim from Singapore.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.180
So as you can see from the slide
show, this is the Helix

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.330
Bridge we have in Singapore.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.720
And the reason why it's being
named Helix Bridge is because

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.410
it's part of the
DNA structure.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.410
And it also represents life.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.600
So the topic I'm talking about
today is digital afterlife.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.790
So, in the 18th and 19th
century, when a user actually

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.010
passes away, how do they
actually announce it to the

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.620
family members and the
rest of the people?

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.220
They do it through
word of mouth.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.500
So what they would do
is that, you tell--

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:42.730
OK.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.810
You get how many of the
gold, how many of the

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:45.990
house, and so on.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.630
And fast moving forward into
the 1960's and through the

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.660
1990's, people actually
started using a will.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.655
And they would write down in a
will how much of this that you

00:22:56.655 --> 00:22:57.580
will actually get.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:04.830
And moving forward to 2000, we
are still living in a written

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.160
will concept, where we
don't have a concept

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.530
of the digital world.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.840
So when a user has passed on,
let's say in social media and

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.130
stuff, the account is actually
left vacant.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.240
So we can see that in social
network, we have more than one

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.030
billion mildly active users.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.650
And this is has actually created
a very huge potential.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.100
And you can also see that, as
more and more users get

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.440
online, we actually have
more online friends

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.530
than offline friends.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.920
So this a page of Larry Page.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.220
And I got it from my Google+.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.640
We have a lot of information
overload where information

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.660
comes from all around the
world, all around the

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.710
different content, like multiple
devices, like, in the

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.230
day we use the iPhone or we
use the Google Android.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.000
And at night, we
use the tablet.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.300
So we also face, more and more,
older generations coming

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.530
into the online world.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.990
So we have seen the younger
generation has actually

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:12.060
populated the social
media online.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.800
And from this graph you can
actually see that the fastest

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.080
growth now is actually coming
from the older generation.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.010
So the question lies within
what happens if the user

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.490
actually passes on to the world,
and who will actually

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.610
take care of all that
digital excess, like

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.930
on the social network.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.340
Or if suddenly you find one
day, this person no longer

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.840
updates the posts on Facebook
or Google+.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.450
As far as the email, we have
seen more and more of us are

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.760
storing a lot of valuable
information in emails.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.960
What happens to the email
accounts if no one is

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.270
accessing it?

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.570
And we can really see from
financial accounts, like the

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.740
stock market, 4x, and the rest
where we put in a lot of

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.910
investment in it--

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.560
a lot of finance and wealth.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.570
And what happens if one fine
day, we do not have--

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.220
nobody is aware of what the user
has actually put in into

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.460
the online accounts.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.430
And also digital access like
Google drive, Cloud,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.620
Dropbox, and so on.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.680
So we create a lot of content
every day, and this is

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.440
constantly uploaded to
the online storage.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.690
And also the online
subscriptions, like movies,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.350
gaming accounts, and so on.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.210
So more and more information
is being uploaded and

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.460
subsequently, everyone is
concerned about creating more

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.350
information.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:42.060
But this also creates a term
called the digital black hole,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.550
where data is being left
vacant on the server.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.040
So for all the developers out
there, you can see that

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.160
digital actually grows.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.630
And all you need is more storage
on the internet.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.460
But there will be a problem
where you will see, what

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.410
happens to the inactive data
storage out there.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.090
It will increase on its own.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.560
And nobody is aware of why it's
happening over there.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.280
So this is a pretty
big problem--

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.940
And of course, missing person
in action, where we have our

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.600
friends, and our online friends,
where you won't be

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.630
actually aware of what happens
to each of them until we

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.390
actually find out from the
physical connections.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.280
So recently Google actually
launched the Google inactive

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:38.620
account manager, where it allows
the user to set a time

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:44.010
time-out period where you will
ping the user, after the user

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.660
doesn't log in after
a certain time.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.620
So this is wise as the first
step in making the data

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.370
management more efficient.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:58.350
And of course we will
subsequently see more and more

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.210
relevant services coming
out in the market.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.070
And the last slide
which I want to

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.100
share is unspoken words.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.860
So I'm sure that many of us have
many words which we may

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.073
not say to each and every
one of them at certain

00:27:14.073 --> 00:27:17.070
times of your life.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.810
So this is one [INAUDIBLE]
of vSwitch I

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.750
would like to highlight.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.410
So thank you.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:27.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.640
JOYCE KIM: Hi everybody.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.040
I'm Joyce Kim and I'm here to
talk to you about Korean pop.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.230
So quick quiz-- how many of
these guys do you recognize?

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.700
On one side we have Kim Jung
Un, the Supreme leader of

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.180
North Korea.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.150
In the middle we have Psy,
the Korean pop sensation.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.310
And the last guy?

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.150
That's just my baby brother.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.820
I threw him in there because he
looks like the other guys.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.700
So Korea is awesome.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.550
Korea has actually been
impacting pop culture on the

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.290
web for quite some time now.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.600
And I'm here to give you a crash
course on the industry

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.820
that brought you
Gangnam Style.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.435
So Korean pop got its start in
1992, when a band call Seo

00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:57.670
Taiji Boys debuted on the Korean
equivalent to American

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.360
Idol on TV.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.170
They were unlike anything
Korea had ever seen.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.890
They had electronic music
mixed with hip hop.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.440
They had these choreographed
b-boy moves, and the judges

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.470
absolutely hated them.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.130
They came in dead last.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.050
But the very next day, their
sales started to go through

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.260
the roof, and they quickly
became the longest running

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.900
number one hit in
Korean history.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.730
After that we had a flurry
of girl bands and

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.470
boy bands come up.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.750
They look kind of silly to
us right now, right?

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.020
We're not used to seeing
groups like this.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.310
Really?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.370
If we look at the '90s here in
the US, it actually wasn't

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:26.960
that different.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.090
We had the Spice Girls.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.480
We had New Kids on the Block.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.720
We had the Backstreet Boys.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.590
So the reality is that pop
music is really about

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.840
manufactured groups.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.840
And if we go back a little bit
further in history we can end

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.040
up in the Motown era.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.180
So Motown came about at a time
when TV distribution was new.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.880
And for the first time, people
really start to care about

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.320
what the singers looked like.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.980
So I want you start thinking
about Korean pop as the next

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.220
iteration of the Motown model,
only for the internet era.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.870
So let's talk about
the people.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.960
Korean pop stars, like their
Motown predecessors, tend to

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.420
be ridiculously good looking.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.380
And it's not like they went to a
school of really hot people,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.040
and then decided to make
music together.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.180
They are assembled this way.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.060
They are brought together
through a series of intensive

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.620
auditions and scouting that
happens all across the world.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.920
And because Korean pop always
had its eye on international

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.220
growth, they really recruit
talent that

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.600
speaks foreign languages.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.880
So these two singers, who are
really popular in Korea, are

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.030
not even Korean.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.180
He's Thai-American and she's a
Chinese-American rapper from

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.780
L.A. But both of them speak
Korean fluently.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.100
So the reason they speak Korean
fluently is because

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.620
most Korean pop stars are put
through a very intensive,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.420
full-time, two to seven year
training program, from

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.780
audition to debut, where they're
trained in everything,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.110
from singing and dancing,
and of course,

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.890
more foreign languages.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.750
So you're probably asking, why
they always so focused in

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.620
foreign languages.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.080
Well it's because the fact that
people outside of Korea

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.070
don't speak Korean.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.670
So how do they deal with
this challenge?

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.390
Anybody that's worked with
content on the web knows that

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.480
internationalization is a really
hard nut to crack.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.300
So how did Korea take
this issue on?

00:29:59.300 --> 00:29:59.920
It comes down to one fact.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.750
Korea is really wired.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.820
We have fastest internet
in the world.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.300
People are always connected.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.070
And what this culture of
connectedness has created is a

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.110
nation full of online marketing
experts, from

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.580
StarCraft to Psy.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.210
Koreans just really know
how to use the web.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.490
So Korean music executives--

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.760
they kind of looked
at the situation.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.450
They said, you know what, we
think we can use the internet

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.660
to get more fans.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.060
But how do you really start to
communicate with fans that

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.640
don't speak the same
language as you?

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.250
One option is photos.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.140
And Twitter became a great way
of posting photos online to

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.390
talk to fans that didn't speak
the same language as you.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.956
Do guys know who this cat is?

00:30:36.956 --> 00:30:39.010
This cat is more famous
than all of us in

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.440
this room put together.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.010
He's owned by a Korean pop
star named Hee Chul.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.260
And this cat spent most of his
2011 hanging out on the global

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.180
Twitter trending list alongside
Justin Bieber.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.870
And the reason that is, is that
Hee Chul would tweet a

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.340
photo of his cat, and then the
internet would just explode,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.970
because we know that the
internet is powered by cats,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.950
so it had that impact.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.420
So from here they
went to YouTube.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.800
YouTube was used really
differently.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.870
Because they wanted
international sales, they

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.150
started to change the songs
and add really catchy

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.090
repetitive English lyrics,
for better or for worse.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.810
And the subtitled versions
would end up on YouTube.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.140
And this allowed non-Korean
fans to sing along to the

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.250
songs that they loved.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.380
The other thing they did is they
invested really heavily

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.540
in the music videos.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.100
Korean music videos are epic.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.630
They're insane.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.550
They are designed to tell a
story to somebody who doesn't

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.880
speak the language.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.430
You can see that Gangnam
Style is kind of the

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.650
epitome of that trend.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.630
So where does Psy fit
into all of this?

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.410
It's kind of interesting to
note, in Korea, Psy is

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.500
represented by an agency called
YG Entertainment, one

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.920
of the top three record
labels in Korea.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.850
YG was founded by the same
singer whose own debut was

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.150
ridiculed by the
judges in 1992.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.970
So Psy is repped by the
godfather of Korean pop.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.970
Now this guy pretty much hacked
television distribution

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.500
in Korea in 1992 by becoming
a breakout success.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.670
In the past few years, he's
been focused on internet

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.480
distribution and figuring
out how to make

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.750
that work for K-Pop.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.220
So it's no accident that Gangnam
Style became a success

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.430
on YouTube, because this man
had spent years focused on

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.590
internet distribution.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.770
So what did you guys
know about Korea

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.310
before you came in?

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.900
You knew that we make
great phones that

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.760
most of you guys have.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.060
You know that we kick ass in
StarCraft But now you know

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.230
that we can dance, and that
it's a nation full of user

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.550
acquisition experts.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.720
So hopefully in the past few
minutes,I've piqued your

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.550
curiosity a little bit
about Korean pop.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.720
If you want to learn more, I
made a playlist on YouTube.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.560
So you can go to that bit.ly
link, slash kpop101 to see

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.370
some of my favorites and some
historic K-Pop videos.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.329
Thanks.

00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:31.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.070
JOYCE KIM: So they're going to
be switching the slide deck.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.150
And they wanted to
take a picture of

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.950
everybody in the meantime.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.050
So everybody get up and do
your best horsey dance.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.610
Or at least put your hands up
in the air and smile so this

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.490
gentleman can take a
photo of everybody.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.195
Hi everyone!

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:45.884
All right great.

00:32:45.884 --> 00:32:47.315
Oh, one more for him.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.910
Thanks, everyone.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.150
PANOS PAPADOPOULOS: Thank
you very much.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.890
Unfortunately, my presentation
has no beautiful girls.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.420
It's mostly about crisis
and money lost.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.570
So, you know, I'm from Greece,
so I'm the right person to

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.130
talk about the StartApps and
how to save Greece-- not.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.550
So I'm Panos Papadopoulos.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.630
I'm the founder of Bugsense.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.630
It's one of the most used
Android SDKs in the world,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.770
actually after Google
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.880
And we started during
a time of crisis.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.710
And a crisis is not something
that you're going to react.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.000
It's something you
have to plan.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.380
Because there is this function,

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.850
The Kondratieff Wave.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.310
And he was an economist in the
Soviet Union, and he found out

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.850
that capitalists have
these cycles, so it

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.390
distracts and recreates.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.390
And then he found out that the
capitalism is more stable, so

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.730
they sent him to Siberia.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.380
So I was in Greece, when I was
a student, and there was the

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.110
Olympic Games.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.975
We were in the Euro.

00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:43.270
Everything was great.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.560
And everybody wanted to be
working in the public sector,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.320
and be a teacher
for 400 years--

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.670
for 2000.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.340
But then they said I have
to invest in knowledge.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.220
And you know, here
we're close.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.830
And we're in the news every day,
which is awesome, because

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.730
we have all the TV studios in
the world in Syntagma Square--

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.590
the Doctor Who-- we
have everyone.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.610
If you want to be famous,
come to Greece.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.830
So then there was-- every day
you listen to the news.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.950
On Monday, the banks
are closed.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.530
So I was betting here.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.210
I was staying in a motel in
Mountain View, dirty.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.810
And then I was listening to the
mandate there would be no

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.929
ATM to get money.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.230
So you can imagine that's a
great time to have a StartApp

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.190
and you have great psychology.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.600
Of course it's not.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.219
But what can you do?

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.300
This is life.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.699
Bad things happen, and the only
thing we can do is burn

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.500
the ships and go forward.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.850
That's what the Athenians
did when they were

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.219
attacked by the Persians.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.190
So what we do?

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.290
You know, we're developers.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.429
You can find a job everywhere.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.210
But we wanted to have
our own business.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.900
And so this advertisement in
the airport, for HSBC.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.520
Every company is going
to be multinational.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.639
So you can be [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.690
at selling souvenirs to
tourists, but you have to

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.020
speak, like, ten languages.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.040
You can even make shoes.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.620
You can sell them online.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.710
And of course there's
this StartApp

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.100
movement, which is global.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.730
And you can make a business--
a thriving

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.500
business in a weekend--

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.469
of course not.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.909
But everybody in the world can
create something online and

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:56.659
put it and make money.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.680
Of course you knew
that already.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.630
So it's very easy to
do that these days.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.910
Everything is flat.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.550
You have great services, like
Google App Engine, and

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.070
Twitter, Reddits to promote.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.620
We started with Agility Group
to find the first market.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.420
We hosted the Google App
Engine to be scalable.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.250
We built an Android with the
fastest growing platform.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.080
And of course we found
code to keep up the

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.360
with the first iteration.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.850
We're didn't start
from the scratch.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.080
Challenge accepted, yes.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.750
Now we're a StartApp.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.280
We're famous.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.150
We're going to be
at Tech Runs.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.650
We'll be there at [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.900
And this is how you're going to
make money after we raise

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.580
like a few million funds.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.070
Of course this is not the
way it is when you're in

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.740
a country in crisis.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.670
So you go back to the basics.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.950
What I'm going to do here--

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.180
actually it's about jobs.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.740
I want a job for me,
first of all.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.110
But a StartApp is not
freelancing, so you have to

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.110
find other people.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.570
And you have to respect the
fact that, in crisis, they

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.490
feel insecure.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.500
So they need a job.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.010
They need a job that
they can relate to.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.120
It can be interesting.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.810
You don't want them to go to
another country, because it's

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.600
technology, and it's
very challenging.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.820
So you have to have a mission.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.670
And the mission is
self-improvement--

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.460
self-improvement, personal
growth, and of course, have a

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.130
nice payday at the
end of the month.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.610
And this is what keeps
you going.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.273
Because you don't make money all
the time, but you have to

00:36:03.273 --> 00:36:05.180
have a mission when you're
in a crisis.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.970
So you're in a crisis.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.330
You are the center
of the world.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.930
But basically you're
not in the network.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.832
You're not in the network that
matters, which is the Silicon

00:36:11.832 --> 00:36:14.510
Valley, or whatever you do
according to your business.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.490
So if you're a great developer,
you have money.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.500
But if you're not
a center in the

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.950
network, this is a problem.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.260
And of course revenue matters.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.390
Cash flow is king.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.520
Your competitors have
a lot of money.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.420
But you're in crisis.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.820
So the only thing you can
do is look at this--

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.540
your cash flow.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.720
So yes it's ten Euro cents,
or ten drachmas.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.190
The next day it's twenty
drachmas-- it's double--

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.340
still drachma though.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.170
So you are the whole StartApp.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.120
And this is the good thing.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.280
Journalists, they
like the story.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.730
You have two guys from Greece.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.890
They have to battle
with this crisis.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.690
So go on, and tell the story.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.960
So people love the stories.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.710
And you are on the news.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.560
And because you're on the news,
you can attract talent.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.240
You can attract talent
through stories.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.590
And of course you have
to be a Spartan.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.940
Actually, I am.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.350
You have to battle, not only
because you have to prove

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.180
yourself to us, because you
are from nowhere, but also

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.270
because of your competitors--

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.900
you have the perception about
yourself that you are a

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.170
lesser, because you don't have
the basic capital, or you're

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:01.820
on no Tech Runs.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.970
And you have to fight.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.710
And then, you know, everything
is systemic.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.590
You cannot be on your own
and make something.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.590
You have also to create
the ecosystem in your

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.360
city or your country.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.530
We do it in Greece, people do it
in Barcelona with Barcelona

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.720
I/O. So it's not
about yourself.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.820
It's about the ecosystem
of where you are.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.830
And then after you have the
velocity speed, think big.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.430
No, you're not allowed, because
there's more StartApp

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.360
in the crisis.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.550
You can do things better.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.870
So your competitors
are big in the US.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:25.250
So what?

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.400
Go away.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:25.660
Go to Japan.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.300
Go to Korea.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:27.795
You go to China.

00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:29.340
There are opportunities
everywhere.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.360
It's just about the
perception.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.400
Don't think you are miserable
because you're in a country

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.450
hit by crisis.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.830
And of course there is slack.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.310
If you are a villager back in
15th-century Europe, you will

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.020
be a villager for the
rest of your life.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.240
There's no way to be
a cleric or a king.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.730
So the US revolution told us,
you can't be everywhere.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.640
You can try, but there
is only lack.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.360
So don't blame yourself
all the time.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.230
It's also a matter of flack
if you don't make it.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.740
Crisis.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.560
That's a varied stereotype, but
crisis is an opportunity.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.466
So plan for the next crisis and
said opportunity is there.

00:37:57.466 --> 00:38:06.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.800
MARCO COCHRANE: Hello.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.450
So I did "Bliss Dance" for
Burning Man in 2010.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.390
At the time I had never done
anything that big or built

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.590
anything in that way.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:24.170
And the way I did it was to
follow my bliss, and let doors

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.590
open where I didn't know
doors existed.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.020
I'm really interested
in patterns and

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.480
structure in the universe.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.310
And I used to dream
this every night--

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.450
triangles and triangles and
triangles and triangles.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.990
I got into patterns that exist
in the universe that are

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.600
repetitive.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.060
And one of them is an attractor
that's surrounded by

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.690
material and energy.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.340
If you use that as a model, it's
a little scary because

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.800
there are no straight lines.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.050
It's all spirals.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.200
So you have to trust that what
you need is going to come when

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.450
you need it.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.312
So in the center of this project
was a sculpture that I

00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:18.700
did in 2006.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.280
OK.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.810
And I did it with Deja
Solis, the model.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.470
And there's something--

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.120
one of my favorite pieces.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.430
So what I needed to do was
enlarge it to 15 feet.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.200
And I had never done anything
that big before, so I used a

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.320
panograph, which is in the
background there--

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.030
a tool from 1602--

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.580
very low tech.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.910
That's the armature
for the clay.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.230
And I put clay all over it.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.740
And it ended up pretty good.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.710
There it is.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.940
That was the biggest sculpture I
had ever done at that point.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.660
So the next thing was to draw a
pattern on that clay piece.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.040
And that was actually a lot of
work to figure out how to make

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.980
all the lines flow together,
and build a mold.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.100
So that's-- you can see
the lines drawn

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.520
on it and the mold.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.780
So I needed the mold so I could
make a hard copy, so I

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.500
could use the panograph again
to build basically a giant

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.220
point cloud, that could hold
itself up, and deal with high

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.000
winds and reality.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.330
So one of the problems with that
is how do I hang these

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.490
balls in three dimensional
space, that I would then

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.510
connect to.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.260
So I had to invent this little
tool here that's made out of

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.570
goose necks and magnets to hold
the balls in 3D reality

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.760
and weld to them.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.640
There's 55,000 connections
and I couldn't

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.920
possibly do that myself.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.370
So one of the flow things that
happened is people came into

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.100
my life that I didn't even know,
who spent six months at

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.070
a time for free to help
me build this thing.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:04.560
And many other people
helped too.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.870
One of the other aspects that
was really important to me was

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.860
the beauty of the
piece itself.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.290
And the structure was much more
beautiful than I thought

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.560
it would be in my mind.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.920
And that was really fun--

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.530
fun to play in and
fun to climb on.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.990
One of the things that
I hadn't even

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.640
thought of was the color--

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.760
the lighting system.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.050
I hadn't dealt with
RGB LEDs before.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.720
And somebody put one inside of
that structure and it just

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.740
made it come to life.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:37.240
And it became a big aspect
of the sculpture itself.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.100
Risk-taking--

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.820
the face on something--

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.650
on a sculpture is really
important.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.440
In doing this wire
frame, I had to--

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.700
I just hoped that when I put
mesh on it, it would actually

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.910
work and be a beautiful face.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.460
And it did.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.450
I was really happy with it.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.580
So that year was total success
and wonderful.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.140
And the flow happened.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:04.650
So in 2011, I brought the next
piece, which is "Truth is

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.900
Beauty." This is the
torso of it.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.790
And I wanted people to be able
to climb in it and hang out in

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.870
this, structure like we had
done when we built it.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.880
So this year we're bringing the
finished product, which

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.350
will be 55 feet tall.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:27.155
That's the clay version of it
to Burning Man this year, so

00:42:27.155 --> 00:42:29.740
if any of you are going,
it will be there.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.660
I always like to think big
to keep myself motivated.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.570
So before I die, I hope
that this happens--

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:42.740
200 foot "Bliss Dance"
on Alcatraz.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.770
That's the Statue of Freedom
on a prison.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.080
You've got to go for that.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.770
So truth is beauty.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.940
Your truth is your bliss.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.880
And if you find that within
yourself, and follow it, doors

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.530
will open where you didn't
know they existed.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.510
Thank you.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:08.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.600
CHARLIE DECK: OK I'm going to
shift into a different kind of

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.560
beauty here because I'm about to
share something spectacular

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.470
and surprising about numbers.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:23.050
And it all starts with a doodle
in 1964, at UC San

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:27.270
Diego where this man, Stanislaw
Ulam, the legendary

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.390
mathematician who helped
invent the computer and

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.370
discover nuclear fission, is
stuck in a department meeting.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.440
And he's bored.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.580
But he's a mathematician,
so when he's

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.750
bored he doodles numbers.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.690
One, two, three-- the numbers
are marching out in a spiral.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.260
And in his boredom he decides
to see what happens when he

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.840
circles the prime numbers.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.490
And when he does something very

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.500
special does indeed happen.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.670
The prime numbers tend to line
up along these diagonals.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.860
And that defies our intuition
that prime numbers are hard to

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.770
calculate or are distributed in
a randomish way along the

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.900
number line.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.220
And it turns out that there is
something to these spirals

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.230
with respect to primes.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.290
And they're called Ulam Spirals
after this man.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.440
When I found out about them
I couldn't wait to

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.750
start making my own.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.520
So I started my own doodle,
but this time in code.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.620
And I'm going to share some
of my explorations.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.990
I started simply though, just
with the number line--

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.120
One, two, three, four,
in order left to

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.290
right, top to bottom.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.050
The bright squares are primes
and the dark squares are

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.450
everything else.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:39.270
Now I taught my doodle how to
go into the Ulam Spiral.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.670
And as you can see, we are way
more zoomed out than we were a

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.030
second ago.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.160
But you can see just how
consistent the pattern of

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.030
primes is along those diagonals,
but also how

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.840
inconsistent it is.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.210
Is this just a coincidence
in the noise?

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.570
Well let's compare it to a
grid where I've lit up

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:56.000
completely random numbers.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.690
And I think that will convince
you that there really is

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:59.840
something special
going on here.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.560
But what's really exciting is
it's not just this square

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.140
spiral I constructed triangular
spirals, hexagonal

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:11.050
spirals, circular spirals, and
in each one we see some kind

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.610
of recognizable, and conspicuous
order going on

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:15.820
with respect to the
primes-- they're

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.580
these little diagonals.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.740
So what's going on?

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.390
We're curling numbers in a
spiral, and for some reason

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.030
the prime numbers seem
to be lining

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.650
up along these diagonals.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.900
Well I went online, I found
some code that fits three

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.670
points to a quadratic equation,
plugged that into

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:35.370
the doodle, and I went and
saw what would happen.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.520
And it was incredible.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.190
It turns out that these
diagonals line up perfectly

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.370
along just that kind
of equation.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.560
I could select a given arm in
the prime-- in the number

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.330
spiral, I mean.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.630
And that meant I could address
the question of whether we're

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.710
seeing the same order across
these different spirals.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.230
Is the prime-rich vein in one
spiral the same as the

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.320
prime-rich vein in another?

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.620
Well in my doodle, I had all the
features already there, so

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.370
I could see for myself.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.080
This is just a tiny selection
of all the different

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.300
possibilities I could have shown
you, but I think you can

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.590
see that there is a relationship
there.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.660
But it's complex.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.250
And it's varied.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.490
And this-- you know, from here
I could construct more

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.186
complicated arrangements of
numbers, or maybe we could

00:46:18.186 --> 00:46:20.950
look at semi-primes or
perfect numbers.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.770
But there's even more beauty
if we go simpler.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.350
And what's simpler than
prime numbers

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.930
is just simple multiples.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.150
And these are the same number
spirals, but I'm just

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.970
highlighting 22, 44, 66, 88--

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.760
multiples along those spirals.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.650
And if I animate the multiple
that I'm highlighting, you get

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.570
a whole secondary
pattern that--

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.250
like a perceptual phenomenon
that emerges from the

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:45.640
underlying patterns.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.600
And again, I mean I cut this
talk in half, and half again.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.120
There's so much more I could
share with you, but I want to

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.230
leave you with two big
picture points.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:57.210
And one is about the process,
that my doodle was just as

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.210
casual as the original doodle
in that department meeting.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.270
It's just the product of some
procrastination, a little bit

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.180
of creative coding, and I got
to experience the thrill of

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.000
exploring some of these
ideas for myself.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.360
That can and that should be one
of the joys of having some

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.790
coding skills.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.630
Our skills are like a prosthesis
or an amplifier for

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.760
imagination.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.970
And that's not just an
empty platitude.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.400
The second point is about why
it's important to look at

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.710
something so abstract
this way.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.000
In the platonic sense,
these patterns

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.100
have always been here.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.360
They always will be here.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.110
It's like the sound of a tree
falling in the woods, but it's

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:37.220
always there whenever we
bother to tune into it.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.620
Perceiving and appreciating
this kind of abstract

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.730
phenomenon is one of the joys
of being a thinking human

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.770
being in this day and age.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.750
And algebra and taxes
and spreadsheets--

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:51.690
they might have turned us off
from numbers, but never forget

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.640
that just below the surface,
there's a startling and

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.670
magical beauty.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.280
It's just a simple
one, two, three.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.720
You can play with the tool that
I used-- or that I made--

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.450
the doodle.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:02.720
It's at primes.io.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.150
My name's Charlie Deck.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.410
My ID is Bigblueboo.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.580
Thanks a lot.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:14.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.520
LIRON SHER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.100
My name is Liron Sher.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.460
I'm an Israeli entrepreneur.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:23.140
I'm here to speak about the
Israeli StartApp ecosystem,

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.230
and how it is to be
an entrepreneur.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:31.270
So I just started my journey
about one year ago.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:32.940
Of course, I'm from Tel Aviv.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.940
And basically, Tel Aviv is the
capital of StartApp in Israel.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:44.020
We have some StartApp in Be'er
Sheva and Haifa, but the most

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.940
StartApp ecosystem
is in Tel Aviv.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.140
You can see that if you throw a
dime in Tel Aviv, you going

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.620
to hit a StartApp.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:55.190
It may be a StartApp, it
may be an accelerator--

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.460
everything you need in order
to be a StartApp,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.710
you have in Tel Aviv.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:00.930
So come to Tel Aviv.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.130
It's very good for to
make a StartApp.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.540
But in order to make a
StartApp, you have

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.960
to get a cool idea.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.330
Everybody in Israel thinks you
have an idea, because we've

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:09.230
been through the army.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:10.550
We can do everything.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.010
So we think we can
do a StartApp.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.450
But not all the StartApp in
Israel are successful.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.600
Some of them-- most
of them, less.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.610
But you have to have a big
idea in order to get a

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:20.020
StartApp in Israel.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.870
So my first tip for you,
get a good idea.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.960
Do a good idea, so
it can last--

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.790
in order to get your StartApp.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:32.480
And then, before you can go to
the StartApp journey, to be an

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.080
entrepreneur, think
about yourself.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.400
Are you up to it?

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.150
Can you be an entrepreneur?

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:39.080
Can you do a StartApp?

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.470
Can you be a CEO?

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.480
Because if you're not
up to it, give up.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.090
Go be a salary man.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.840
But if you can do
it, just do it.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.640
And then, build your A-Team.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.400
Build the one that will
help you to go this

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.980
long journey of StartApp.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.050
They have to be a good guy.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.770
They have to be the best guys.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.080
They have to be a tech guy.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.730
Get the guy that will complete
you as you can.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.690
But then, are your partners
up to it?

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.020
Find out first that if you have
the tech guy that's very

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.290
good in tech, will he help
you do it your way?

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:08.940
Will he be there?

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.460
Will his family support
your friend there?

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.800
Think about it before you choose
your colleagues through

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.140
this long journey.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.520
This is what I can
share with you.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.730
Now find the business model.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.350
You have to find the business
model for your StartApp.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.215
I found four business models
for my StartApp, so I

00:50:23.215 --> 00:50:25.370
recommend you to find at
least two business

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:26.710
models for your StartApp.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.220
Otherwise, don't think about
starting developing.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.570
Don't do anything before you
find a business model.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:32.990
And think about the user.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.670
Will you use your StartApp?

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.410
Will you use your application?

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.150
Are you going to be the user?

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.980
Because if not, give up.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.900
You have to think about the user
and what they're going

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.740
earn from using your
application.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.100
Then you look for money.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.210
Every angel can say, hey, you
have a good idea, but show me

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.960
some traction, and I will
give you some money.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.580
But then, if I have traction,
why do I need money?

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.610
If I have traction, I would
have already the egg.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.150
It's like the chicken
and the egg.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.330
So then you find yourself
bootstrapping.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.570
You leave your company-- you
leave your day to day job and

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.890
start bootstrapping
your company.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:07.370
OK.

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.680
What next?

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.140
Every day you have to
build something.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.030
And then what do
you want to do?

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.450
Then you think about
what is the MVP--

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:18.340
minimum viable product?

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.260
Because you cannot build
everything while you are

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:20.950
bootstrapping.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:24.800
So from one end you have to
be as minimal as you can.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.550
From the end, you have
to get more users in

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.390
order to get the money.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.060
So think about what is your MVP
before you go into market.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.550
And then we are doing mobile
application, so we have to

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:38.100
choose what you're going to
do, Android or iPhone.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.750
People are still using iPhone
these days, so you cannot

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.180
neglect them, especially
in Israel.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.780
And then you find out that
you want to use HTML5.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.560
One year ago, HTML5 was
very hard to debug.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.530
Also it doesn't work the same
on every iPhone and Android.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:59.310
You find yourself working
differently

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:00.740
on two Android devices.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:01.520
So what should you do?

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.380
But my app is viral.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.400
So if I develop only for
Android, I will miss half of

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.910
the market.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.290
So we decide to develop natively
iPhone and Android at

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:11.870
the same time.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.450
I find myself writing Java code
and x code, and I said

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.270
otherwise reversal.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.220
And then we try to
find out backend.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.160
What is the best backend
for you?

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.560
I recommend going Google App
Engine, but if you're not a

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.640
Python developer or Java
developer, how can you use the

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.180
Google App?

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.440
That's how it was back then.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.450
So we decided to go to
Amazon Web Services.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:37.280
So Amazon Web Services
is a great tool.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.640
They have great tools to scale
up, but you have to be an IT

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.450
guy in order to work
with Amazon.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.140
So my recommendation for you,
if you're going for Amazon,

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.970
just to be an IT guy.

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:50.590
And now we released our MVP.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:51.080
Our MVP is ready.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.350
We're sending it to
all our customers.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.390
And everybody is saying,
where is this feature,

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.760
where is that feature?

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.490
And you have to tell your
friends what is MVP, because

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.810
nobody except everyone
knows what is MVP.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:03.840
My name is Liron Sher.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.520
And I hope I've enlightened you
to something about Israel

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.310
and StartApps.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.750
And thank you very much.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:14.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:14.912 --> 00:53:16.790
BUNNIE: Hi everybody.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:17.500
I'm Bunnie.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.780
I'm also hailing
from Singapore.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:24.200
And I'm here to talk to you
today about an ecosystem that

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.110
I've been exploring in China
called the gongkai ecosystem.

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.690
It's kind of about how ideas
get shared in China,

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.370
China-style.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.500
A hobby of mine is I like to go
to Shenzhen, every now and

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.750
then and look for wacky
pieces of hardware.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:41.340
This one here is it looks like
a mouse, except for the

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.110
screwed up logo.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.580
But when you go ahead and you
turn it over, you find that on

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.810
the inside--

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:51.160
advance slide, advance slide--
there is in fact a full GSM

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.250
phone on the inside complete
with a camera.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:56.510
It makes calls and so forth--

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:57.620
rather funny.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.820
A more serious kind of
application you can find out

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.470
there, sort of unique, is
they have this phone

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.540
which is for children.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.980
It's a child's safety phone.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.100
It only allows you to dial five
numbers, so your kids

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.240
can't text message other
kids in class, and

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.300
so on and so forth.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.270
It's an interesting sort
of application of the

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.290
technology out there.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:19.770
Other devices that I have also
found out there that I found

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.740
very interesting is this
one, which is a phone.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.150
It looks kind of plain.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.470
But the interesting thing about
it is that it's $12.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:28.340
And it was kind of
the retail price.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.460
It wasn't with a contract.

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.480
Which means that the actual cost
of manufacturing was less

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.790
than $12, probably
around $8 or $10.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.070
So of course, I buy it and I
take it apart to see how the

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:37.870
heck they do this.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.790
I find on the inside they've got
a multi 100 megahertz arm

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.370
CPU, with 8 megabytes
of memory, a

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.150
Bluetooth, quad-band GSM--

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.250
all this kind of cool stuff.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:47.280
And I go, geez, I really want
to build one these.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.470
How do they do this?

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:50.630
So I go on the net and I
start looking around.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:54.360
And I find I can actually
download the PCB files.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.510
I can download the schematics.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:58.120
I can go ahead and actually
source the chips in the

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.850
markets, and they're only,
like, two bucks.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.910
Why haven't I seen more StartApp
doing this kind of

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:04.510
stuff, is what I wonder.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.970
And when you take a look at the
StartApps that they do in

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.390
China, a lot of them are around
phones, whereas in the

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.825
US, a lot of the StartApps are
around "app-cessories." They

00:55:13.825 --> 00:55:15.520
don't actually build
phones themselves.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.030
They build stuff that
work with phones.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.750
And I wonder is it because
maybe there's no economic

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.990
incentive to actually
build phones.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.690
And that's not the case.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.770
There's a company in China
called Xiaomi that was founded

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.700
in 2010, and two years later it
was valued at $4 billion,

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.420
half that of Nokia.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.890
So clearly there's an economic
incentive to go ahead and

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.860
build these kinds of phones.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.190
In fact, the thing is that if
you look at the documentation

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.820
you get, they've got
confidential

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.140
written all over it.

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.470
They have dubious copyright
terms, and so on and so forth.

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:49.640
So in fact, there's an IP
barrier that is presented for

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.890
people who are trying to build
these things from the West.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.890
Now this set of terms here,
which we are all very familiar

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.270
with, means about as much to the
people in Chinese as if we

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.070
were to fill this with Chinese
characters to you.

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.800
They don't know, you know,
confidential, DMCA, patents--

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.610
all these sorts of things.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:05.980
They kind of just--

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.720
they're in an ecosystem
that is free of

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.070
these kinds of things.

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:11.270
So it's interesting
that in China I

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.770
can access the designs.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.340
And so the kind of open, and
sort of the end result--

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.570
well it's not really open with
the big "O." It's not open in

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:22.690
terms of GPL, or Creative
Commons, or

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.770
these kinds of things.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.080
Fortunately in Chinese, they
actually have different words

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.890
for big O Open, like Foss, which
is kaifung, and open

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:32.770
with a little "O" which means
you can just sort of share it,

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:33.320
and it's out there.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.760
It's called gongkai.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.650
And in order to sort of
differentiate and sort of-- if

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.040
I told people, oh I'm looking
at the open harder ecosystem

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.270
in China, people would be
like, you're crazy.

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.970
It's not actually open.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.885
So I just call it the gong kai,
harder ecosystem, to sort

00:56:44.885 --> 00:56:49.970
of differentiate between what
would be the open ecosystem

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.320
versus just a simple open
access ecosystem.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.920
It's interesting to look at
sort of now the kind of

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.320
mainstream platforms
per ecosystem.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.840
So in the Western open style,
we have the Ardweno.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.810
It's probably the most
popular one.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:06.760
It's 15 megahertz CPU you can
buy it for $29 in SparkFun.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.130
And then you go ahead and you
look at the gongkai ecosystem.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.400
And if you remember we have
these devices that are like

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.270
200 megahertz and quad-band GSM,
and they cost about $12.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.340
And of course they're not
legally licenses open, but

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.907
these schematics, the sharings
of all the blueprints and the

00:57:20.907 --> 00:57:23.370
plans through the different
people out there enable them

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:26.060
to go ahead and slot these into
other products, which

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.410
enable them to do things, wacky
things, like put a phone

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.410
inside of a mouse, or make a
phone with only five buttons

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.900
so your kids can use
it, or just sell

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.460
outright phones for $12.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.520
So people then ask me-- or
like, kind of the next

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.200
question is, how does the system
work in the face of

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.020
such theft.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.720
Is it the case that the
consumers are just paying the

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.750
entrepreneurs--

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.000
thieves, if you will--

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.560
and they're taking all the
value, which would be the case

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.810
if they were just, like,
stealing software music.

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:57.630
In fact the entrepreneurs have
to rely on the entire value

00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.030
ecosystem behind them.

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.610
They have to rely on contract
manufacturers and brands,

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:05.250
channels, supply chains-- they
have to buy the chips from the

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.610
people who they're stealing
the documentation from.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:11.000
And people have to get
SIM cards with the

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.240
carriers and so forth.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.850
So in fact all the players still
make money, it's just

00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:15.800
distributed a little
bit differently.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.880
There's a little more money for
the people at the bottom,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.190
and the carriers and the chip
manufacturers don't have quite

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:21.240
as much control.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.050
So that is about the quickest
introduction I can give you to

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.120
the gongkai ecosystem.

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.860
There's a lot more
stories to tell.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.600
Thanks very much.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:36.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.540
JAISEN MATHAI: Hello
my name is Jaisen.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.690
So let's talk about the
preservation of human history.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.810
And there's something that all
of us in this room have in

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.180
common, and it's that
we all have a story.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.800
And as humans, we're actually
natural storytellers.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.330
So I'm going to go into my story
a little bit, and it

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:53.400
starts back with my mother,
back in 1955.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.990
This is a picture of her
family-- her brothers,

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:58.080
sisters, parents, and
grandparents.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.030
Some of these people aren't
even living anymore.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:02.230
These are not miserable
people.

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:05.380
Indians don't smile in
any photographs.

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.460
But this is where
my story starts.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.400
If you fast forward a little bit
to 1981, this is what my

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.070
parents would send me out of the
house looking like on the

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:14.920
day that they take
pictures of kids.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.960
You can see the disgust
on my face.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.070
But this is evidence that
I'll show you in a

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.700
little bit of something.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:27.080
This is actually one of my
favorite pictures that I have.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.530
I despise fishing.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:29.660
I'm not patient enough for it.

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.290
But this is a photo of my
father and myself--

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.010
apparently I caught something
and it was a picture worthy.

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.210
So, fast forward a
little bit more.

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:41.280
This is a photo of me
and my grandfather.

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.910
He's passed away, and
he lived in India.

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:43.950
I grew up in the US.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:46.170
So the time that I did
get to spend with him

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:48.160
was very, very valuable.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.740
And so this is part
of my story.

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:52.000
And I've told it to
a lot of people.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.700
But the interesting thing is,
in 2010, I wasn't just a

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.810
storyteller anymore.

00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.240
I became a story preserver
when I had my son.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.780
And so it really started
changing how I looked at all

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.370
this content that I'm taking.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.940
I have a bunch of pictures
of my kids.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.910
But it doesn't start there.

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:11.330
We have to go back, like, 5,000
years, when the ancient

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.510
Egyptians were writing
hieroglyphics on the walls of

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:18.010
caves so that future generations
could see them,

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.390
little knowing that people would
be devoting their entire

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.780
lives 5,000 years later
studying that content.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.720
And it's very sad for me to
stand up here and say that

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.610
technology has really failed
us in this aspect.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.180
It's much more easier for us to
capture moments like photos

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.960
and videos, but it's more
increasingly easy for us to

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.920
lose all of that content
as well.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.910
And so this happens
by-- is users--

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:43.350
what people do is upload all
their content to any number of

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.650
service providers.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:47.720
And in doing so, we then entrust
the service provider

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.610
to not only maintain our data,
but to preserve our data.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.305
And the internet, if it's proven
one thing, it's that

01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:55.260
that doesn't work.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.530
It's like handing our car keys
to these guys and hoping that

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.300
when they're done parking and
bringing it back, that

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.450
everything is still in the
glove compartment.

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:07.390
But what if we could actually
write applications in a way

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:10.330
that's different from how we had
done in the past, giving

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.880
us something similar to what
car manufacturers do

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.940
with a valet key.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.770
And if you're thinking, oh well,
that doesn't actually

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.980
solve the problem that
I'm talking about.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.150
And so Albert Einstein
once had a quote.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:26.250
He said that you cannot change
the problems by using the same

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.610
thinking that you did when
you created them.

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:33.360
And so what I'd like to do is
ask all of us to stop thinking

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.980
about the way that we've always
developed applications

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.910
since the start of
the internet.

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:38.700
This is a photo.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.110
This is really important
stuff.

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:44.090
This is a photo that was found
in the notebook of a soldier

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.180
during the Holocaust.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.080
And on the back of it,
it was written,

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.050
The Last Jew of Vinnitsa.

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:50.700
This has become one of
the most valuable

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.540
artifacts of the Holocaust.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.530
And so--

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.990
I lied.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:57.910
Technology hasn't actually
failed us yet.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:00.580
But this is where we have to
actually think about writing

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.250
applications and services
for users that put data

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.560
portability and data ownership
as first class citizens.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.800
And for me I'm most passionate
about the decoupling of data

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.360
storage and application logic,
and how that can apply to

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.250
software that users
and companies use.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.980
And as a result I started to
open source project called the

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.700
Open Photo Project, which
is now called Trovebox.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.310
It's 100% open source.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.590
And the purpose of this is
to provide a service for

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:34.890
individual users and
organizations to allow them to

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:38.540
have 100% data portability
and ownership of

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.830
all of their content.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:42.270
And so we have Android
applications.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:43.870
We have iPhone applications.

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:45.870
We have a web application.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:48.320
And an entire API stack and
language findings in every

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.210
popular language.

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:53.340
And all of this is available
on GitHub.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.810
And so what we've done is we
started this initially on

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:57.350
Kickstarter.

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.660
We went and partnered with
Mozilla as part of the WebFWD

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.260
program, and we received funding
from the Shuttleworth

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.680
Foundation, which was started
by Mark Shuttleworth.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.270
And we're off to really
great start.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:09.770
But what I'm here today is to
try to get as many people to

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:12.960
help us, either by participating
in the project

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.990
that we've done, or start
thinking about this in the

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:18.080
applications that you build.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.880
How can you decouple data
storage from application

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.860
logic, so that when a service
ends up shutting down, all of

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:27.120
your user data doesn't
go along with it.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.890
This is all the information if
you want to chat with me

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.050
afterwards, or catch
me on Twitter.

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:30.973
Thank you.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.290
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:36.290
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:39.280
So we've got just one
more speaker.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.100
He's a good friend of mine.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.900
We worked together at Microsoft,
and been to Burning

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:42.920
Man a couple of times.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.950
And this year he's got
two books out.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:48.160
And so he's here to talk about
your brain on Google.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.660
Please welcome Ramez Naam.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.420
RAMEZ NAAM: Awesome.

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.660
Thank you Brady.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.695
My name is Ramez Naam.

01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:55.190
I write science fiction.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.260
And I have a novel out that's
about the ultimate Google I/O

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.760
The I/O of electronics and data
directly into your brain.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.550
Now you already know about this
topic in your familiarity

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.330
with great American
philosophers, like this man--

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:13.550
Keanu Reeves, who said I know
Kung Fu What I'm here to tell

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.950
you about is that this is no
longer just science fiction.

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:19.720
It's actually becoming
science fact.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.240
And the motivator is not
Hollywood, it's medicine.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.160
We already have cyborgs
among us.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.250
In particular, a number of
people around the world carry

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.180
the cochlear implant.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.670
The cochlear implant looks
like it's a hearing aid.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.590
You'll see a photo of
it in a moment.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.440
But it's not actually
a hearing aid.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.650
It's a device that picks up
sound from the environment

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:46.200
around you, and then bypasses
the ear entirely and beams it

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.100
into Keanu over and over and
over and over again.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.650
No, it picks up sound, and
bypasses the ear, actually

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:58.260
transforms sound into nerve
impulses in the auditory nerve

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.060
that go straight into the human
brain, unlike a normal

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.940
hearing aid that just cleans up
sound and plays backsound.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.740
So it's actually interfacing one
type of data to the brain.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.610
And as a result about 200,000
people around the world, like

01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:14.580
this four-year-old girl who is
hearing for the first time,

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.030
are now cyborgs who can
hear because we've

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.180
learned to do that.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.140
We've also taken data from
inside the brain and sent it

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.880
out into digital systems.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.500
This man, Johnny Ray,
was paralyzed by a

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.910
stroke, that him--

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:30.810
left him unable to move from the
neck down, unable even to

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:32.590
speak, only able to blink.

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:36.120
But his doctors implanted the
first ever human brain implant

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.020
in the motor cortex that allows
him to, by thinking

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.300
about it, move a cursor on
an on board screen--

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.770
online keyboard--

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.170
and type out messages to
his friends and family.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.450
Which is a big quantum leap up
from blinking once for yes and

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.630
twice for no.

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:55.560
And now this tech is moving
towards actual approval as a

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.900
medical technology.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.710
This woman last year was
implanted with the top of its

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.850
line system that allows
her to control a

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.820
multi-access robot arm.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.390
And what you see is that she's
feeding herself coffee for the

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:07.560
first time.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.040
We've also sent vision
into the brain.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.680
This man, Jens, was rendered
blind age 19.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.550
At age 40, this cyborg
eye was implanted.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:22.890
It captures images and then it
sends them into a jack in the

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:26.790
back of his skull, straight
into his visual cortex.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:29.140
And it restores vision, of
a crappy kind, but a

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.480
quantum leap up.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.610
Now humans have more than just
sensory data and motor data.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.580
We also have these
higher functions.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.390
Who here has seen the
film "Memento"?

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.270
Some of you.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:42.700
Well this character Lenny can't
form long term memories

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.570
because of damage to part
of his brain called the

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:45.760
hippocampus.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.580
So seeking to fix that, doctors
and scientists have

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.040
built a hippocampo
prosthesis--

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.840
a chip that simulates that
part of the brain.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.800
And in erratic experiments,
it's able to restore the

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.630
memory of rats with brain
damage, and actually go beyond

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.430
that and give them
super memory.

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:05.260
These rats learn better than
normal healthy rats.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.450
Now we've gone better to that
and we've gotten into

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.000
decision-making and IQ.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.150
These monkeys have had their
performance on a monkey IQ

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:13.810
test-- a pick and match test--

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:16.720
degraded by repeated
doses of cocaine.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.760
They think they've got better,
but they didn't.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.020
But a chip implanted in their
frontal cortex can actually

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:27.100
restore them back to
normal and beyond.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.300
They got about 10 points better
scores on these tests

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.320
than normal, healthy monkeys
with this frontal cortex chip,

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.170
which of course leads to the
cyborg Planet of the Apes.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:38.350
Now we don't just use computers
for thinking or

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:39.260
calculating anymore.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.350
We use them as communication
devices.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.850
And that's where this will
become transformative.

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.630
Because if we can send data in
and out of one brain, we can

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.620
transfer it between
multiple brains.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.870
Now Dartmouth is very
interested in this.

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:54.870
Their Enhanced Battlefield
Communications program has

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:58.140
funded this study, which takes
two monkeys in separate rooms,

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.380
sound proof, with electrodes
in their auditory cortices.

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.130
And they play a sound for one
monkey, and monkey two can

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:07.530
hear that sound and can
identify what it is.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.880
In humans, we've even put
people in FMRI machines.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.270
We've shown them images like the
one on the left, and the

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.569
image on the right is
reconstructed by an algorithm

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.899
looking at the brain scan,
and nothing else.

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:21.109
It's not very good yet, but you
can kind of see that it

01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:22.810
can tell what's going on.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.000
And the folks who brought you
enhanced rat memory are

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.479
working on wiring together
memory chips from two

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.700
different rat brains to see if
they can really get to the

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.450
point where a rat can
say, I know Kung Fu.

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:37.560
Now there are many, many,
many hurdles to this.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.479
Voluntary brain surgery is
not that common yet.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:42.399
It's going to be a while
until it's good enough.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:43.470
And there's questions.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.479
What if it crashes?

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:45.899
I mean, no computers
are perfect.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:47.040
What if you get a virus?

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.840
No computers are
totally secure.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.930
What if you get malware
or a phishing scam?

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.750
Those are all very
good questions.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.000
But I think the biggest
questions

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.310
actually are societal.

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.686
Who gets to control
this technology if

01:08:57.686 --> 01:08:58.450
it's in your head?

01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:59.760
Is it a bottoms up thing?

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.790
Can we hack it ourselves?

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:01.649
Do we own the data?

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:02.939
Or is it top down--

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:03.779
imposed on us.

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:06.220
Can someone snoop on our
thoughts or worse?

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.660
So those are the fun questions
I get to attack in the novel.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.590
I hope you'll check it out.

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:14.270
And I look forward to a true
super Google I/O one day.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:15.133
Thank you.

01:09:15.133 --> 01:09:18.590
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.540
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much, Mez.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.140
And that concludes Ignite.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.779
Thank you all for coming.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:27.899
Thank you Google for
hosting us again.

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:31.359
And you can find these videos
later at Ignite show and on

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.479
our Twitter feed.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:33.729
Cheers.
