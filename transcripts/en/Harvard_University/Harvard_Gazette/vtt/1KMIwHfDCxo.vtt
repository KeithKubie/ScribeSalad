My name is Harry Yeff, my artist name is

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.960
Reeps One. I'm here at Harvard University taking

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.900
part in a few lectures: phonetics, talking about creative

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.880
process and the human voice. Of course

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.800
there's my speaking voice and the thing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.539
I'm using to communicate now but there

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.340
is a palette of hundreds and hundreds of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.710
other pressures and sounds which are not

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.660
only unique but you can interconnect

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.489
them. They can start interacting and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.809
working together so you can have

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.760
percussion and melody happening at the same

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.040
time. And this is something that isn't

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.290
common in physical instruments, so I found

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.780
a freedom in the voice I can't achieve

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.030
with other instruments, and that's why I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.810
fell in love with it originally.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.239
I am teaching Linguistics 105 which is sounds

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.160
of language. Language is a highly

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
systematic, subconscious system. The same

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.109
thing happens with beatboxing: it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.910
subconscious people develop it. The

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.359
brain systematizes sounds that they

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.240
make for a musical effect. I think that's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.159
just fantastic for the students to see

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.200
both of those angles. You can have a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.820
hundred kids anywhere in the world and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.979
they can't and get access to instruments

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.540
but they can start learning percussion

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.670
immediately. You can learn drum theory

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.740
with the voice, you can learn a piece that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.119
you're playing on the violin with the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.680
voice. Speaking about how that's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.060
effectively creative is the main goal.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.640
People don't realize what they can do what

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.009
their potential is, and sometimes it can

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.470
be something as simple as an art form

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.689
to show that there are still new things

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.119
to be discovered, and I really love that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.700
sentiment. If at any point an artist or

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.350
musician can show there's a new way of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.600
thinking about something or a new way of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.820
doing something or finding a new palette of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.579
the voice, I think that has purpose and is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539
beneficial, and I would love to send that message.
