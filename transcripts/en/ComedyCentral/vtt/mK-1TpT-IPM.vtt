00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.901
- So my first job,

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:02.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
I worked at a
horse racing track.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.170
- Okay, that's good.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.805
- I would seat all the
pilled up old ladies.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.040
- Yeah, yeah, yup.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.608
- And I babysat my
cousin one time.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:09.409
- Oh, there you go.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.910
- For a whole summer,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.379
and the great trick was
I taught him to go to bed

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.315 align:start size:94% position:6%
at 3:00 a.m., so he'd
wake up at like 1:00 p.m.,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start size:81% position:19%
his mom would come
home at three,

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.251
only had to watch
him for two hours.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.652
- Perfect.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.453 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Come and watch American
Gladiator, jump--

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.955
- There you go scheming,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.223
I mean ruined his cycle.
- I ruined his whole life.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.724
I ruined his whole life.
- Yeah, 100%, literally.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.059
But, that's a good way to
make money right there.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.127
- Thanks brother.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.596
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.797
- Welcome to Stupid Questions,

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.332
I am Chris Distefano,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.833
AKA Viking Head,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.102 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and we are with
Casey James Salengo,

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.871 line:0%

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.340 line:0%
and he has got an album out.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.909
It's called Wild
Country Phoenix.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.477
And you also have a
great podcast called

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.179
The Good, the Dad, and the Ugly.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.480
There it is.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.748
- Look at that hand,
that's a thick hand.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.050
- I appreciate that,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.384
that is a hand that
gets a lot of work.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.218
- Woo hoo hoo.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.053
- [Chris] Wow.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.854
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.890 line:0%
- What mythical creature
would you like to ride?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.924 line:0%
- Cerberus.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:58.758
- What's a Cerberus?

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.692
- Three-headed dog.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.627
- Yeah.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.294
- Protector of the river Styx.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:02.462
- Yeah!

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.663
- Ride him through Hades.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.864
- [Chris] Yeah.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:05.665 align:start size:84% position:16%
(makes horse clomping
noise with mouth)

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.866
Dude is scrapping.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.801 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Dude, I wanna
ride (bleep) Dumbo.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.735
- Is that mythical thing?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.669
- It's a flying elephant.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:10.870 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Sure.
- With ears.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.272 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I know who Dumbo
is. (laughing)

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.808 align:start position:0%
- It's not just a neighborhood,
you hipster shits.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.809
- Whoa!

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.911
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.546 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- If you could change
your first name,

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.047 line:0%
what would you change it to?

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.283 line:0%
- When I was younger, I
moved to a new school,

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.820
and I told everyone Casey
was short for Casanova.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.621
So, I changed it to Casanova.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.823
- Wow!

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:30.757 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And everyone found
out so everyone

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.492
at school called me Nova.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.326 align:start size:81% position:19%
It was the coolest
I've ever been.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.761
- That's hilarious!

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.863 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And then one time
somebody called my house,

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.131
looking for me,

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.165
and my mom's like, I
just hear my mom go,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.300
"What? Casa, no, what?"

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:43.303
And she goes,

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.270
"Casey, what the (bleep) are

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.105
"you telling people at school?"

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.207
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.476 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
If you were given a
nickname off a diner menu,

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:50.977 line:0%
what would you be called?

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.712 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
What would be, it's gotta
be from a diner menu.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.546
- Tuna melt.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.581
- Yeah, baby.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:55.415
- Wouldn't that be cool?

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.382
- Yeah, the tuna melt.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.984
- It's tuna, like a tough fish.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.619
- I feel like you'd
be the Monte Christo.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.787
- Saucy, ooh, yeah!

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.055
Well--

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.223
- Reuben, you could
look like a Reuben.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't think
about it long enough.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.427 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Is there, like do you
like tuna and cheese, or--

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.430 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I feel like a tuna is like
a scrappy fish, you know?

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.631
- It is a scrappy fish.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.066 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I consider myself
pretty scrappy.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.301 align:start size:97% position:3%
The cheese, the melted cheese
is a layer of elegance.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.004
So I'm kinda like the scrappy
guy with a layer of elegance.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.906
- Tuna is a scrappy fish
when you think about it.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:20.840
- Yeah, man.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.041
Nobody gives any respect.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just like me, I
don't get respected,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.911
but I'm hey, listen, I've
been here since day one

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.212
and I'm gonna be
here 'til the end.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.046
And they gonna love me.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.281
- And I stink.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.115
- And I (bleep)
stink. (laughing)

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.818 line:0%
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.154 line:0%
- How did you learn the
truth about Santa Claus?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.289 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- So I walked downstairs
to get my stocking.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.725 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm coming down the stairs,
I look on the couch.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.261
I see my uncle butt naked.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.796
My uncle is around my house,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start size:81% position:19%
big alcoholic,
you know, fun guy.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.166
- Duh!

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.300
- But was completely naked.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.835
- Right.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.870
- Next to the Christmas tree,
some half-wrapped presents.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.639
Clearly something had gone awry.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.807
I'm like, well, alright, uh.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.277
So I go around the corner,
the stocking is not filled.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.111
- Right.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.445
I start wailing crying.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.380
- Sure.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.447
- My mom just says, "Go to bed!

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:02.282
"Go back to bed."

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.950
So I go back to bed.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.486
Her boyfriend goes down,
wrangles my uncle Randy

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.922
in the other room, throws him
under the dining room table.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.990
And then he starts
wrapping the gifts.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'm like alright,
well this seems

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.061
like Santa wasn't involved
in this particular magic.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:15.995
- Right.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.530
And so you just figure it out.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.865
- So I figure it out, but I
see my uncle Randy's balls.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.334
(upbeat guitar rock)

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.268 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Did you have a good
time on Stupid Questions?

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.203
- I had such a good time, man.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.137
Thanks for asking me questions.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.371
- Dude, of course, bro, come on.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.172
- Had fun hanging with
you, you're a fun dude.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:27.106
- You get a stupid gift.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.107
So here's what we got you.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.342
- Oh my god, a baby kitty!

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:33.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is a blind
cat singing karaoke.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.414
I just figured you're a guy.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.348
You like cats.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.182
- I love cats.

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.016
- You like karaoke.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.017
- Baby.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.252
You're the best.
- There it is.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't know you
knew so much about me.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is my best friend.
- Absolutely, dude.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.723
Cats and karaoke, you
talk about it a lot.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.159
And there you go, there it is.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.227
What's its name?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.094
- Chordley.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.229
- Chordley.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.563
This is Chordley the cat.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.531
- Sit on my arm like this.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:52.732
- [Chris] There it is.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:53.433 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is the best
day of my life, folks.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.467
- [Chris] Yes.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.435
- (kissing noise) I love---

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.536
- You know he can eat tuna.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.503
- Ah, tuna melt, me and tuna--

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.038
- It's just you.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:03:59.872
Don't let the cat eat you.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.607
- Thanks, man.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.441
Give us a hug.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.408
Give him a kiss.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.409
(kissing noise)

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.510
- God, dude, you
smell like tuna.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.379
(laughing)
