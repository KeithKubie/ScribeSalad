00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.403
MALE SPEAKER: Today we
have the pleasure of having

00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:03.830
Marc Goodman here with us.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.320
Marc Goodman has spent a
career in law enforcement

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.350
and technology.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.320
He has served as a street
police officer, senior advisor

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.950
to Interpol, and futurist
in residence at the FBI.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.170
As the founder of the
Future Crimes Institute

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.355
and the chair for
policy, law and ethics

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.800
at Silicon Valley's
Singularity University,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.130
he continues to investigate
the intriguing and often

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.330
terrifying intersection
of science and security,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.710
uncovering nascent
threats and combating

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.270
the darker sides of technology.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.853
Let's give a warm
welcome to Marc Goodman.

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.302
MARC GOODMAN:
Thanks [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:40.720
Thank you very much.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.960
Hi Google.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.970
MARC GOODMAN: Hey,
how you guys doing?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.160
Thanks so much for coming,
I really appreciate it.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.731
We need to also be thinking
about the internet of things,

00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:54.230
right, because we're going to
be attaching a lot more things

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.404
to the internet.

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:57.070
So it's not just the
internet of things,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.580
it's just more
crap to be hacked.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.410
We're switching
from IPv4 to IPv6,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.750
that will mean that our
network will grow from about 4

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.660
and a half billion simultaneous
connections to 78 octillion,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.590
or 78 billion billion billion.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.440
To put it in perspective,
today's internet

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.540
is the size of a golf
ball, tomorrow's will

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.280
be the size of the sun.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.000
That means every pet, plate,
prisoner, knife, fork, chair,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.740
every device will be going
online with RFID and near field

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670
communication, because
they'll basically be free.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.650
Our threat surface area is
going to expand tremendously.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.470
And guess who's
excited about this?

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560
General Petraeus of the CIA.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.080
Right, we will spy on you
through your dishwasher.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.040
And you guys heard about
this Samsung brouhaha?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.030
Where Samsung-- who
hasn't heard of this?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810
So right now, I have a
smart television at home.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.520
But in order to
change the channel,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.150
I have to push a
button while I sit

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
my fat ass in a
Barcalounger and might

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.760
burn a billionth of a calorie.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600
So Samsung has
solved this problem

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.982
by allowing for voice
interactive TVs.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.356
But in order to
do that, they had

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.160
to update their terms
of service and say,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.800
everything you say
to your television

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.258
we're sending out
to third parties.

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:05.670
We're processing it, we
keep it, and the like.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.530
It's in part of their
terms of service.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.744
And then they said,
Samsung did, by the way,

00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:12.160
if there's something
sensitive you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.006
want to discuss
in your own home,

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:15.630
don't say it in front
of the television

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.860
because we're listening.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.400
Which didn't make
people very happy,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.260
so there's a big
brouhaha about this.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.350
"New York Times" talked
about hacking everything

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.210
from vents to soda machines.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.960
And do you guys remember
that Target hack?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.840
You remember how they got in?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.880
Through the air conditioning.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.580
Yeah, the HVAC system.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.775
The HVAC was connected to
the general network which

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:36.150
was connected to financial
management which was connected

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.160
to the cash register
which was connected

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.080
to the point of sale terminals.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.160
When you have 78
octillion connections,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.270
the system complexities
are so great.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.430
You have no idea what's
connected to what.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.240
And bad guys are good
at finding this out.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.525
Of course, refrigerators
will be sending spam.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:52.730
This has already happened.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.740
This is already
happening, right?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.410
Oh, and by the way, this has
happened too, I'm sorry to say.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.120
So a lot of apps now have
bitcoin mining malware in them.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800
This is from the
Department of Things

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.361
Not to Connect to the Internet.

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.110
In Florida, they thought
they'd save money

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.620
by connecting their prisons
throughout the state online.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.870
It turns out, somebody
hacked them and they unlocked

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.120
all the doors at a maximum
security prison in Miami,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.660
leading to a riot.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.881
Of course, cars are nothing
more than computers on wheels,

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.380
right?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.422
200 chips.

00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:24.880
And people have
hacked those, there

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.730
was a guy in Austin, Texas that
remotely disabled 100 cars.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.310
Everything from the air bag
to the brakes to the steering

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.290
can be hacked.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.075
And of course, we're
putting computers,

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:38.450
we're not just
writing computers,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.210
but we're computers
inside ourselves.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.560
There are 60,000 pacemakers
in the United States

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.970
and have an IP address and
connect to the network.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.600
300,000 implantable
medical devices a year.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.810
At hacker conferences
like Black Hat and DEFCON

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.630
they're talking about
how to hack them.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.810
Diabetic pumps.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.850
This is something called
the Bluetooth Cannon.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.660
From a distance of
300 feet, it can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.580
find people that have
got diabetic pumps

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.780
and take 45 days
worth of insulin

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.870
and release it in five minutes.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.644
Resulting in a
condition known as--

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:06.310
AUDIENCE: Death.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.601
MARC GOODMAN: That's very good.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.157
Mostly irreversible,
very hard to change.

00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:11.490
This is my friend Bertolt Meyer.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.180
He was born without a left hand.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.670
He has one of the most
advanced bionic arms and hands

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.440
in the world.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.350
I said, Bertolt tell
me how do you control

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.800
your arm if you need to fix it.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.890
He was like, oh, I have
an app on my iPhone

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.154
that controls my hand.

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:24.570
I said cool, can
I see your phone?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.528
He hands me his phone,
I start pushing buttons,

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.230
his hand starts doing this.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.729
His body is online.

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.520
By the way, I didn't
need to have the phone

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.478
because it's Bluetooth.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:34.940
I could have just used
Blue Snarf or anything else

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.350
to hack it.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.980
So again, our threat
surface area is expanding.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.870
And it's not just
today's technologies

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.446
with ones and zeros, but
there are other technologies.

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:45.070
All the stuff we've
been talking today,

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.720
they've been hacking silicon.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.520
But there was another operating
system, the original operating

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.820
system, DNA.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.750
We only coded in ones
and zeroes because we

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.440
didn't understand DNA.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.020
Now we do.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.310
We can write
software code in DNA.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.750
There are bio hackers.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.870
And you can take
somebody else's DNA

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.550
that you recover from a left
tissue or a comb or a drinking

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.950
glass and replicate it.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.510
And you can take that DNA and
leave it at a crime scene.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.284
And according to a study, the
cops can't tell the difference.

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:13.950
So if you really really hate the
guy in the cubicle next to you,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.960
this is a fun trick
to play on them.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.400
Plant their DNA at
the scene of a crime.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.270
And of course we will
have new bio weapons

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.690
that will be permitted
through synthetic biology.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.390
Aum Shinrikyo, you guys remember
them, subway attack in Tokyo?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.910
These guys had a bio program.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.320
They had $10 million that
they spent from '85 to '95

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.050
trying to launch a bio attack.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.070
The biology wasn't
there, so they

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.490
went with a chemical attack.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.530
Today it is.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.630
And so we're going to have
all of these new issues

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.820
to deal with, ranging from
cloning to discrimination

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.970
to new forms of identity theft.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.410
If you find any this bio
hacking stuff interesting,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.440
I did an article for
"Wired" magazine.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.340
That's my ugly mug on
the / so every crime

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.630
that we have today with
silicon ones and zeroes,

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.050
we will have in the
future with bio.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.790
What's the bottom line?

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.790
With all of this computing,
going golf ball to sun,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.410
we're increasingly connected.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.750
We're dependent upon these
systems, and we're vulnerable.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.810
Computers run all our
critical infrastructures,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.130
from electricity to
health care to 911 system.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.752
And they're all hackable.

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:16.210
There's never been
built a computer

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.501
system that couldn't be hacked.

00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:20.730
And we keep rushing, connecting
more and more stuff to the net,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.990
but more connections
equals more vulnerability.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.510
So what do we do?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.840
I'm not saying
technology is bad, right?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.880
I'm in Silicon Valley.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.790
I love tech.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.680
Tech is awesome.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.780
Fire was the first technology.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.480
It could keep you warm at night.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.800
It could cook food
in your cave, or you

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.420
could use it to burn down
the village next to yours.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.050
It's just how we're using it.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.090
But make no mistake,
there is a war afoot

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.450
between people that want
to use tech for good

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.600
and people that want
to use tech for evil.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.760
And in exponential times,
the ability of one person

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.710
to reach out to 100
million or a billion people

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.230
is a growing problem
that we haven't

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.730
solved how to handle yet.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.200
When the entire world
is becoming a computer,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.430
Marc Andreessen famously said
software is eating the world.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.670
When maps become GPS
devices, when music becomes

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.750
Spotify and Netflix is movies.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.910
Every physical object
is becoming a computer.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.600
And all computers
are run by code.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.640
So if you can control the
code, in a world where

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.940
computers run the world, then
you can control the world.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.370
And the biggest problem
is, unlike other times,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.800
most people have no idea
that they're a victim.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.430
If you go out your garage in the
morning and look for your car

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.230
and it's missing, you're like,
holy cow, my car was stolen.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.180
But when bad guys break into
your computer, you don't know.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.710
According to a study by the
US Secret Service and Verizon,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.270
only 6% of hacks
of data breaches

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.720
are picked up by the
system administrator.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.500
94% of the time, it's
because customers complain,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.270
the FBI comes knocking
at their door,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.510
or a competitor was also hacked.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.690
And this is a really
scary statistic.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.540
This is the time to discovery.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.640
On average, it takes an American
Fortune 500 company 211 days

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.985
to know that they're penetrated.

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:59.360
Which means that
the bad guys are

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.830
living in your system
for nearly seven months,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.500
roaming around,
putting in back doors,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.380
leaving malware,
watching and studying

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.240
everything that you're doing.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.590
And in the same study,
they said that 75%

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.490
of American
corporations networks

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.780
could be penetrated
in just 15 minutes.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.170
So breaking into the information
technologies of today

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.360
is a lot like a hot knife
going through butter.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.480
It's super easy.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.370
And yet all of these
computers are the foundations

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.700
of our modern world.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.520
So when they fail,
when they're hacked,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.390
when that cyber crisis occurs,
what is our backup plan?

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.610
We don't have one.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.240
In effect, our modern
society's is kind of

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.480
built on a digital
house of cards

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.360
that can come falling down
unless we start to care for.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.309
This is how we handle
cyber threats today.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.580
We arrest people.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.070
The problem is that NYPD officer
cannot make an address right,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.010
in Moscow, or in Canada.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.190
Internet broke policing.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.880
Policing only works city to
city, country to country.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.100
International law is
horrible for these types

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.290
of investigations,
and therefore we

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.840
will never investigate or arrest
our way out of the cyber threat

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.380
problem.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.390
The two systems are
completely mismatched,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.300
and yet this is the
primary tool we use today.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.886
Right, the cops,
we're in charge.

00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:10.010
We're going to handle this.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.970
We need to break that
paradigm of policing.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.750
We need to get the
public involved.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.040
The bad guys have been really
good at crowd sourcing offense.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.590
We need to get crowd sourcing
on defense on our own security.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.480
There are some great
examples of that.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.305
This was highlighted at
Google Ideas, organized crime

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:26.530
and corruption project.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.830
These guys are crowd
sourcing the investigation

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.920
of dictators and their funds.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.190
And in Mexico, where
over 50,000 narcotics

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.400
related homicides have
occurred in the past six years,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.780
people are using
tools like Google Maps

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.440
to go out there and
crowdsource where

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.910
the dope dealers are at great
personal risk to themselves.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.540
So open source tools like
this, free tools like this,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.230
can play a role in helping us
to crowdsource our own security.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.780
But I think we're going to
need to take it a step further.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.450
We have reserve Marines, reserve
Army, reserve police officers.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.690
We have FEMA for
national disasters.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.026
We have no national
cybersecurity reserve corps.

00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:04.650
And we're definitely
going to need one.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.395
And folks in this room
are the exact type

00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:09.250
of people that I would
recruited into it, because we're

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.290
going to need your help.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.220
Because that big cyber
emergency is going to occur,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.060
and we have no plan
for when it does.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.080
The other thing I
would offer is that we

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.490
talk about cyber attacks.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.100
We use the language of medicine.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.950
We talk about
computer infections.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.990
We talk about viruses.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.610
We use the language of medicine
to describe the problem.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.050
But we don't use the tools of
medicine to solve the problem.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.630
What could epidemiology
bring to the table, right?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.120
What would a World Health
Organization for cyber

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.010
look like?

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.510
Public health models,
epidemiological models I think

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.450
could go a long way
in terms of helping

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.820
to protect the internet.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.570
And by the way, what could
we learn from bio-mimicry?

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.230
Right, nature for
four billion years

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.890
has been building immune
system's, resilient systems.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.150
How could we learn
from biology and nature

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.700
to drive this forward?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.800
Another big challenge is
human centered design.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.800
Anybody every use like a
Norton Utilities product.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.240
When my mom uses her
software firewall,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.570
it says warning, error, MSCX
DL3 DLL error at line code this.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.620
Do you wish to proceed?

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.140
That is not helpful to my mom.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.960
It's not helpful to me.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.455
OK, think about all
the beautiful products

00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:18.330
we have in the world.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.850
A Leica camera, a Porsche 911.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.710
Whatever those
beautiful things are,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.740
where's the Johnny
Ives of security?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.170
The guy that's going to design
the most beautiful, human

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.600
centered design for security.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.440
We don't have that.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.300
And so because of
poor engineering

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.890
and a lack of designed
thinking, we're

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.630
driving people to make
poor security decisions.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.832
We need to fix that.

00:11:37.832 --> 00:11:39.540
And I also think that
we need a Manhattan

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.270
Project for cyber security.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.220
We need to get really, really,
really intentional about this.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.760
And we are not at all.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.850
I think you guys about
the XPRIZE Foundation?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.370
Just a couple miles from here.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.360
I'm working with them
to launch a $20 million

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.150
cyber XPRIZE for cyber security.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.990
Whether it's a
10-year-old kid in Chennai

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.590
that's got the answer or an
80-year-old woman in Montreal,

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.510
I don't care.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.310
We need to build more
resilient and redundant systems

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.350
to protect us.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.250
The good news is, just to
put it all in perspective,

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.500
we can fix this.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.210
Right, President Kennedy
said in the 1960s,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.520
before this decade is out, we're
going to put a man on the moon.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.540
We did that, with way worse tech
then we have available today.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.280
If we could solve that
problem, surely we

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.500
could solve this cyber
security problem.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.020
And we need to, because
technology is awesome.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.970
And it's going to bring billions
of people out of poverty.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.510
It's going to
radically extend life.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.093
It's going to reduce
infant mortality.

00:12:34.093 --> 00:12:37.490
It's going to educate millions
of people they never had access

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.090
to education previously.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.700
But in order to achieve
that better future,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.880
we're going to get
really intentional

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.200
about protecting against
these exponential undersides.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.861
The downside of technology.

00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:50.860
And that's what I'm hoping
to do with this book,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.842
and I hope you guys will
join me in that fight.

00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:53.800
Thank you so very much.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.150
[APPLAUSE]
