00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.210
The answer is B. Recall that in order to paint the page, we

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.870
need to construct the render tree. And to build a render tree, we need

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.390
both the DOM and the CSSOM trees. As a result, the browser will

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.840
have to wait until it fetches the CSS before it can paint the page.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.450
&gt;&gt; Right. We don't want to paint an unstyled page, hence the render

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.140
blocking CSS. So, is there anything we can do to optimize this?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.490
&gt;&gt; Yep. Let's take a look.
