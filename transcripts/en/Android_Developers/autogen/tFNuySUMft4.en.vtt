 and it's me bruno oliveira works who 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.120
 did not have the name here of the android and its 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.400
 grandson and working here with 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.050
 android in Brazil is our job is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.309
 prohibited by legislation then to whom 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.170
 do not know we're trained by 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.630
 alexandre cenci but our work is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 make sure you are happy, you are 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 our developers and if you do not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.910
 are happy with the platform we are 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.020
 doing a good job 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.789
 if you are not happy with the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 platform but we are not making a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 Good job, so our job is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 just talk to you know the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 that is leaving the happy or not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.160
 and to make sure that everyone 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 had a good experience 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.910
 oh I'm transmitting this here is the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 our android studio here has maintained or 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 do not have among all things in our 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 This business said nery 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.239
 in fact he spoke in it independently 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 Are you on time or not? 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.649
 china controls sun he goes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 permanently writer is but always 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.649
 that appears on the screen is a place to people 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 It's shit so by definition it's 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.910
 working right here at khan's house in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.260
 suggestive name our new office of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 Sao Paulo with some people to 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 interview and in the subjects that came 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.100
 see this is in other magazines 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 We are count, it has turned brown and hot. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 directly cast the cane juice 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 chose a theme well see Brazilian will 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.200
 characterize this transmission of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.110
 national legal 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 well, let's get started now I noticed 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
 that I was playing with the product shirt 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.420
 wrong to know that I should have called 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.659
 in medical wardrobes but anyway 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 space will see now compete with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.840
 the right product shirt 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.720
 almost barely perceptible in what was a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.899
 Last moment correction is good, right? 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 so we're here to talk about 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.930
 android development for this to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.040
 people have here our list of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.560
 Questions that it is raining 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.250
 public where you could make your 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.259
 questions 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.920
 So I think we can start. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.939
 or picking up the questions and seeing which 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.750
 are the ones that we can 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.970
 answer questions 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 the first one is I wonder if 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.069
 is pedro fsn from goiÃ¢nia 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.260
 Is he asking me? Would you like to know if there is 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.390
 about the possible solution with the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.769
 to the previous rigor 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.810
 about the use of lead in androids 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 I have already used the solution of the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.940
 gecoc would like to know google solutions 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.000
 then the one to whom only to upgrade 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 Why are not you following along? 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.629
 last goal last year 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.769
 we have an interest in everybody 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.760
 saying that we were working 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.230
 in a fight or a fight 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.959
 compatible version of chumbar 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.849
 with all versions to this day whites is 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.549
 I remember that because I did this 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.140
 promise is to say it was not in my 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.000
 session of this promise was made 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.440
 so now you have to fulfill it, it's just that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.430
 to take action to function in the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.590
 previous versions 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.019
 what we have today does not have a 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.879
 official google solution yet 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 if you want to use chumbar you need 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.890
 have at least connecting top 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.540
 and if you mean that if you want 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.640
 use more previous campaigns 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.680
 a very good solution that was made 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.319
 by gecoc in this solution call itself 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.630
 schumacher Ã³ is essentially a cheerful 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.950
 that you include in your project and it 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.060
 allows you to use chumbar in the tests 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 previous android 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.859
 so the question is when google goes 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.389
 launch the version itself is not closed 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.340
 Are you working on it? 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.880
 in fact it's the center of the guy's side 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.239
 what are you working on then I found 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.440
 that things are progressing but it is 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.060
 It's hard for us to know when it's going 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.280
 to have available is because it's what I 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.750
 I always play engineering. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:54.959
 three dates, that's what you have today and never 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.760
 then it means that in the future it will 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.379
 happen in the future 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.239
 I hope it's soon but it's too much. 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.980
 it will hardly ever be a school day 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.980
 but a kick at least one day of the week 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.470
 even though it's hard could not paste 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.129
 is arrested 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.269
 but then I thought it could only be 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.600
 understand with this framework of discussion 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:20.600
 with the people of my Brazil 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.990
 He can say exactly that. 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.790
 Unfortunately, there is no date to see if 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.410
 This is a solution that only 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.350
 each one must choose our own here 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.210
 here it fits most try to solve the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.740
 North smell, right? 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.600
 the very good solution you have in lime 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:49.130
 at the discretion of each one who would like to 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:51.350
 use and also have nothing nothing obliges you 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.910
 To use to leave, then, for example, 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.290
 some applications that we have more 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.450
 simple example if you are using 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.940
 plus a bar that only has two exceptions 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.380
 application title buttons is perhaps 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.600
 You do not even have to do all this 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.670
 complication of wanting to use sherlock 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.040
 For sure you may as well say it is not 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.750
 it's no problem, you try 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.060
 to jump on the basic rate until 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.680
 I got there with two buttons since the 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.080
 appearance is something connected to the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.270
 user since it guides them easily 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.220
 that's an equivalent to the show bar 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.990
 for example there is no problem 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.490
 with it's own methods that 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.190
 He is also the father of Laila. 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.290
 but you do not always have to use 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.240
 all dogs if you can doubt their 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.460
 application the shared call is 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.470
 a thing that is not to be woven into 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.169
 angola of each one the way that I am 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.950
 daring then you can leave it leaves 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.390
 wow, what 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.120
 the call is one of the first regions 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.580
 more fights and probably used 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.130
 can benefit the application and 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.930
 In addition, it is worth noting that 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.690
 people already helped you are when people 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.320
 launched the e-mail education plan already 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.360
 is being trained to use the interface 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.710
 application is to use skype will 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.680
 get even stronger from them app 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.850
 the user wants the user is he 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.620
 learn 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.720
 he learns with applications he learns 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.190
 using then if since you bought the 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.630
 android device he is he is 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.310
 using google apps using 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.630
 applications that use one more bar 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.180
 so he is under training 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.740
 intensive there and learning the sax 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.300
 bar and learning that those buttons 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.310
 to do such thing is that 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.560
 the other thing then if you use chumbar 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.360
 Are you joining this pattern? 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.409
 then you will automatically know how to use 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.030
 app 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.680
 so it's something I always say 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.569
 Here for who does this for long. 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.740
 We already had share but the reservation 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.479
 this user experience thing is 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.129
 extremely important this does not 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.110
 should be underestimated 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.430
 if the user needs to read a book to 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.509
 learning to use the application is 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.610
 doing wrong 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.050
 an experiment that I always thought 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.090
 the time is the next before you 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.190
 launch the application is to give your 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.360
 application with laymen you already know what 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.770
 they knew they did not understand anything about 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.330
 code with that smile what I think 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.440
 things are savior within 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.830
 word processor 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.419
 So, take this guy, lend it to you. 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.550
 android for he hopes to use the application 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:16.280
 to stop writing what the application 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.199
 do it and you want to write how to do it 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.389
 some things if he gets the look with 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.560
 a question mark is because you 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.879
 need to improve a little by your 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.169
 interface unless of course your 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:27.110
 goal be they had for geeks 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.360
 educational nerds 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.340
 it's okay but it's always important you 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.500
 make sure your entire target audience 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.849
 your app and sometimes funny is 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.009
 As we as the victory has something that 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.449
 shocks it like this, but it's obvious that 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:42.349
 you stay flat will detail the deal 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:44.150
 but the new one to produce other users 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.550
 There are things that are very obvious to us. 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.139
 as a citizen user and I do not have 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.139
 no doubt of what is going to happen 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:08:00.379
 I think he can move on to the next 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:08:08.870
 ask the question live the staff 

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:14.750
 here you go in galt if you can 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:16.580
 ask the question by doing what leaves the 

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.740
 board shows android versions only 

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.319
 I think mclaren and world fashion 

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.789
 is a way of knowing for example that 

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:28.669
 type of record is being posted in the 

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:31.370
 Brazil in determined there changes of country 

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:35.000
 most emergent or even android level 

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.649
 for simpler devices to this 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.339
 question 

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:41.959
 whether or not the strategy brings this 

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:42.919
 question obviously the following this is 

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.019
 a strategy that we generally 

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.240
 recommends that you have met the users 

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:48.889
 I do not think your users are you know 

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.119
 what android versions are using to 

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:51.199
 you prioritize issues 

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:54.110
 right are not 

00:08:51.199 --> 00:08:56.360
 so it is important to have 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.399
 precisely this concern with the 

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.269
 distribution of androids on the market 

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:01.129
 you want to achieve 

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:02.329
 Unfortunately we do not have the sport. 

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.269
 of the country to this is something I think 

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:06.050
 extremely useful indeed is but it is a 

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:07.610
 thing that we do not currently have 

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.249
 this statistic is computed 

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.499
 globally and I do not know if for a 

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:14.929
 difficulty in understanding which 

00:09:12.499 --> 00:09:16.759
 country ends android but anyway I do not know 

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:20.480
 the fact is that they only have this 

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:22.459
 statistics in a world-wide way. 

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.220
 specifically in the case of Brazil, which 

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:27.319
 I've seen too much that I need 

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.360
 does not deviate much from that statistic 

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:32.029
 world in Brazil we do not have 

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.319
 has a very very different market 

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:35.360
 of the world statistics you see 

00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:36.980
 currently if you look at the other 

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.350
 stores you can see that it is extremely 

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.420
 important that it stays of the day 

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.149
 strike up at least if you 

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.249
 can make it work was 2.2 is a 

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:48.769
 bonus but you about evolution 

00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:51.920
 functional upwards you already 

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:53.449
 rate as well as almost 

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.220
 percentage to say 

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:58.699
 the massive percentage of the market 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.529
 potential is and there are because there 

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:01.939
 types of applications or those that 

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:03.620
 They do not want to make money. 

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:05.990
 those whose goal is to bring a 

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.240
 user information or enable the 

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:11.179
 access to services and those who want 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.220
 to make money, then to those 

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:17.329
 goals that want to make money with 

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.309
 one is how the neighborhood is this slice of 

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:21.230
 users who have been down and door 

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:24.319
 less and less because the next 

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.160
 to see if you would care in direct 

00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:28.569
 up 

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.499
 Are you? You get more than 90% of the 

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:32.179
 devices and you can also 

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:34.429
 a much larger percentage of 

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:36.319
 income is a much larger percentage given 

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:38.629
 an attachment that happens with each 

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:40.279
 successive version the collective android 

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:42.290
 annual per user, for example if 

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:44.689
 look at real monetization per user 

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.759
 are you getting a gÃ©rin device? 

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:48.529
 this is much higher than the actual 

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:50.089
 user on the device you have to 

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:52.129
 It was a mistake, it was a mistake. 

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:54.290
 then it means if the objective of winning 

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:56.059
 money with your application is always 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.769
 The more interesting you use pleasure 

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:59.329
 for the newer versions of the Android 

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:00.980
 that older people 

00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:04.220
 Of course this is clear if you have the 

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.889
 an engineering reception but the case the 

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.660
 best case scenario is if you are 

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:10.660
 optimize for all devices and 

00:11:10.689 --> 00:11:17.689
 personal observation that is 

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.399
 Excuse has not flowed and it's cool you already 

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:22.670
 made it look like the newer versions 

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:25.279
 and use the medicine only ask more 

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:29.149
 educational in the newest and most 

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:31.009
 have the oldest profile if it is 

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:33.139
 better you appear more modern than 

00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:34.790
 you look older than your 

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:37.370
 contract 

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.540
 sometimes I can follow the patterns 

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.249
 new 

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.680
 you should as far as possible always 

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:53.809
 that the patterns that are there always use 

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:56.959
 with a weak for example is because despite 

00:11:53.809 --> 00:12:00.620
 We're very focused on Brazil. 

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:02.569
 of an ovi service in Brazil but has to 

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.519
 remember that the global apps market is 

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:07.819
 so many people who do not like the 

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:10.670
 your asset the more you have better 

00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:12.470
 makes a big difference when it comes to 

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:15.769
 do this to give success over the 

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:17.089
 application also in particular and 

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:19.009
 to bear all this is one thing 

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:20.449
 very important because sometimes 

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:21.980
 is developing we think the 

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:23.149
 user will have seen in our life 

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.220
 on the screen like that 

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.929
 but suddenly he's pulling out a screen 

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.999
 Thus was born the 17 

00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:31.399
 so we here is a brutal difference 

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:35.389
 Annex 4, annex 7 at that time. 

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:37.429
 one thing that looks very complex 4 is 

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:38.990
 It may seem a little less good. 

00:12:37.429 --> 00:12:41.139
 more successful and certainly more 

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.399
 you pick up your nexus 4g interface 

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:45.379
 phone play it only do is 

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:46.399
 Resize the tablet size 

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:47.779
 you are doing here you are 

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.220
 wasting user money is 

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:49.879
 because the user pays dearly to have a 

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.559
 tablet 

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:53.149
 he paid dearly for all those pixels 

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:55.160
 so suddenly you're using all 

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:57.139
 the pixels he paid dearly for a 

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.949
 interface as long as the pt does 

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:00.019
 smaller 

00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:02.059
 then for the best user experience 

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:04.339
 it's always good to have your app it 

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:06.319
 can use the tablet screen 

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.970
 an intelligent and used way was the 

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:09.769
 Next stretch is not catching you all 

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.439
 have a cell phone and make the source bigger is 

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:13.910
 the users did not confront the study is 

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:15.379
 because they are free 

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.240
 they buy tavares because they want 

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:18.740
 a larger screen space utilization 

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.509
 better the space of land 

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.519
 for example if you have a spiral of 

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:24.740
 a mobile TV that has a 

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:26.180
 list of things and then another screen 

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.709
 which details 

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.269
 suddenly no tablet defending your 

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.870
 content makes sense you make two 

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:31.790
 vacancies 

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.889
 you put a piece of 

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.259
 left that has what's on your list 

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.749
 of items and in the right fragmentation 

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:40.370
 the details is obviously a solution 

00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:42.079
 works for all apps then entire 

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.730
 in a single example then depending on the 

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:44.930
 complexity of the data you display 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.589
 can do so may make sense or 

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:51.709
 no and and there was also the boss 10 no 

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:53.149
 has this 10-inch tablet is that 

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:55.279
 they are significant but 

00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:55.879
 significantly larger than your 

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:59.329
 cell phone 

00:13:55.879 --> 00:14:01.160
 I'll make the size compared to cnaa in 

00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:03.230
 at least five times the other air 

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.089
 side then you surely get your 

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.110
 interface and make them reach the 

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:08.629
 this size 

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.160
 It's going to be a house so it's very 

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:13.189
 It is important for you to think about it when 

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.470
 also develop one of the non-financial 

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:17.870
 Call people you can only use with 

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.120
 Your top address has a champion of everything. 

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.399
 and against all are able to insure 

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.399
 so a second a form and also 

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:28.970
 show one more way to hold for such 

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:32.540
 different motif then usability and the 

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:35.259
 ex is not just images resize the 

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.939
 size and larger fonts since 

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:41.139
 the other thing is a very common mistake 

00:14:37.939 --> 00:14:43.519
 also reminds us that the resolution 

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:45.309
 other modern devices is very 

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:47.120
 great for example in the four 

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:49.249
 325 cpi 

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.769
 so if you have a cell phone once 

00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:53.179
 oldest has 160gb episode for 

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:55.069
 trying to talk about the perfect lack can 

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:58.009
 see the small intact perfect in 

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:59.959
 my screen is over or are great but 

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:01.879
 You'll be running a newer device. 

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:03.889
 and then you notice that the resolution of the 

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:05.329
 graphic is not constructive enough 

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:06.740
 this gives a horrible feeling of a 

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:08.209
 daughter of a little professional clarifies 

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.639
 that the discount in time is seeing a 

00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:12.110
 page to 90's page knows those 

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:15.230
 pages will keep costs and 

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.879
 immense size is then it is always 

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.850
 important, I'm sure that 

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:19.350
 Are you using one more? 

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.910
 that it is compatible with the devices 

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.250
 more modern 

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.380
 and I think I'll pass the next question 

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.670
 in the attack of the electoral Sunday and 

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.370
 even more iran 

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:31.649
 so the question here from the south was ewerton 

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.089
 of prudent president against the 

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:35.819
 brunet grandson, I would like you to speak 

00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:38.459
 a little about frequency only and I moved 

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:39.690
 lightning down next best 

00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:42.120
 practices for the existence of objects 

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:46.759
 could not be the first officer 

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:53.399
 Thank you for the same work, this is 

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:56.009
 this subject has not yet discovered which 

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:58.560
 best libero in the world so I guess 

00:15:56.009 --> 00:16:00.360
 he will live for some decades with 

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.029
 a fairly large competition between the 

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.680
 different buses and would be the people 

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:06.180
 could have a renovation could in 

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.690
 theory 

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:12.180
 Only if we do one does not seek 

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:14.430
 did not want to make or put a solution 

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:18.060
 as official seat for everyone's strength 

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.500
 everybody used because who will know 

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:23.220
 if these people really know how to do it 

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:25.019
 avaÃ­ is in fact what is best to have a 

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.040
 open community with the following you 

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.649
 can have this competition between 

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.170
 different rmc ever better choose 

00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:33.569
 It is best to have a situation 

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.880
 depends on it will put a 

00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:37.680
 For you, you make inputs for me. 

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.839
 Do not answer because you're not with 

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.130
 I have never seen a business there. 

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:43.740
 You'll have to do it again. 

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.240
 to launch another trailer and people 

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.279
 also danced time doing something 

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.680
 that even if it really promises to be 

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:52.819
 does not mean it's going to be a 

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.519
 solution in a group 

00:16:52.819 --> 00:17:00.509
 complicated to come up in a few kind 

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:03.149
 by default this is really complicated 

00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:04.740
 then the ideal is the following everything that is 

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:06.720
 whether it's official or things that are 

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.510
 Platform Essentials and things that 

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.740
 are important to other things to 

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.699
 other things to be developed in 

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.220
 top 

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:15.630
 in the case of today I think that the 

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.120
 freedom you have to use any 

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.100
 rm and this freedom precisely from the 

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.250
 compete for equal 

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:26.220
 is a very productive thing at the time. 

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:29.549
 system is difficult to answer 

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.750
 What network is right for is provocative? 

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.770
 you know in depth what the application 

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.290
 does 

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.210
 it's certainly not so it's important you 

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.480
 choose that it is appropriate for 

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:44.190
 every application is forever person 

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:46.260
 the musician is bring the android already comes with the 

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.540
 sql so at least so is the basics 

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.970
 which is the sql and obviously is very 

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.490
 far from being one and less during the 

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.290
 falls already comes with an already built-in 

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.910
 nuno andrade then for most of the 

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.110
 that are simpler and pensions 

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.230
 lj 

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:04.500
 but you really need to use one on the 

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:09.000
 mpe is then in this case you have to 

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.790
 really select h1n1 to be more 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.940
 This is particularly 

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.950
 simple humble frei ruiz and in general 

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.320
 So Portuguese is this question of the 

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.600
 It's worth a little bit with the frei but he messes 

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:26.790
 appears as for example a framework of 

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:29.160
 dependency management systems can use 

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.380
 It's something I always said when 

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.980
 student stayed overnight when I saw nothing 

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.840
 I've seen and other mobile technologies that 

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.390
 You talk about frankfurt is already over 

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:44.310
 generating other things in your 

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:45.810
 application and that this may not suddenly 

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.960
 had something have you use 

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.670
 freak mister worth getting the premium do 

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.640
 a test to see if that little man 

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.350
 happened articles that planned 11 for 

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.670
 example an unnecessary layer of your 

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.110
 app 

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.660
 I always think of every activity 

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:03.270
 the furniture but the nexus 

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:06.630
 four other rivals are capable 

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.910
 of excellent processing device 

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.990
 which has its limitations in the then much 

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.840
 be careful when selecting a 

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:16.140
 flashback and tests and more tests are 

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.340
 always welcome also has another 

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.280
 problem also with the indiscriminate use of 

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.200
 the rn is the following can not be tempting 

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.640
 because it's easier, it's easier to see the 

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.770
 code you pick up and save all 

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.510
 objects do not get caught by your application 

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.640
 whole state takes all objects that 

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.490
 you have and save as a strategy 

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.260
 similar I checked and you take all eight 

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.180
 shot shots of the state of all 

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.010
 objects and all relationships between 

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.260
 they won in the file is when you 

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.520
 you load this file 

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.410
 this may work well for the 

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.420
 computer is not only a reminder of people and 

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.300
 a mobile device first 

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.490
 access to the author where it is more or less 

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.380
 slow and expensive then if every time the 

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:55.500
 lord who starts will be charged 1 gb 

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.720
 storage data but slow 

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.730
 then you're also using a lot of cpu 

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.400
 the user will notice that he has problem with 

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.500
 your lithium's battery consumption then 

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.350
 is dangerous because precisely these 

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.790
 clouds objects you would say in applications 

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.170
 sometimes they get out of control 

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.280
 especially you forget to do 

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.380
 comply on foot 

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.000
 And by the way, you're rolling trash 

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.220
 example things that have been deleted 

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.020
 still faced by one thing is 

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.720
 when you save cloud with objects 

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.450
 they get taken in there so it's important 

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.790
 remember that the other mobile despite 

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.740
 having a fast government is still a 

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:33.470
 limited form in comparison to the 

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.470
 desktop is then also excreted 

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.400
 asked mom too so now it's like 

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:48.960
 make a change what you want to do 

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:51.000
 a comment to the question nothing in the backpack 

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:58.590
 that the sun was encouraged to ask a question 

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:03.390
 who does not carry a backpack but the backpacks 

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:05.550
 eagles that win the next right 

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:26.490
 so I think you can bypass 

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:28.320
 backpack for any google make a 

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.810
 prediction of when ronaldo will work 

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.150
 all those available in other countries 

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.250
 not be taken, for example, to seek 

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.640
 as well as sound feedback 

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.890
 in other languages ââit's soooo the newspaper 

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:50.130
 he currently has many expensive works 

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:52.410
 usually united because it ends up launching 

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.240
 carlos pinheiro that is well and 

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:57.620
 remembered the pastor is not relevant to people 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.620
 will expand the world 

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:04.170
 things on the I know the newspaper here 

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.390
 considers ronaldo to be a 

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.070
 very important product to do everything 

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:11.130
 Brazil considers alcohol to be a 

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.750
 central element of the android in the final is 

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.120
 that tool that understands the most 

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.640
 user learns from the user but 

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.790
 I understand the user and it is the one that in 

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:22.800
 theory becomes more and more 

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.170
 more suggestions but other users 

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.970
 this means of course that you need 

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.650
 appropriate cards for each country in the 

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.600
 However, the cards are played by 

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.120
 but they have cards that are 

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.620
 the country here for example 

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.330
 has stayed with the games 

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.790
 baseball and football focuses on 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.770
 other forums that I do not do 

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:44.100
 minimum idea of ââhow to play and not right 

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:46.800
 but I just know it's the whole world is going to be 

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.840
 an integer and just put the plus 

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.430
 would be high forest for example not 

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.460
 had the same thing implemented to 

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:55.320
 National soccer clubs is the one I know 

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.630
 that the team is also committed to 

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:01.020
 become more and more international 

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:03.750
 but it is quite difficult to tapas are one thing 

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.760
 only and not reliable engineering 

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.500
 I've been on good projects in 

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.570
 out of the way to speak with certainty that 

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.820
 will launch national skates date x more 

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.960
 five aspirants will yes but it is necessary 

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.120
 martins 

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.700
 this happens not as the lack of 

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.790
 planning but because the market is a 

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:28.290
 very dynamic thing so it's one thing is 

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:29.940
 talk football but the UN where you speak 

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.330
 mobile things change very fast no 

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.980
 it was zero hour ahead of time what 

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.730
 is a priority for all but behind 

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.730
 suddenly ceases to be a priority 

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:47.160
 there are no dates for the ministry 

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.070
 in which if not I will not count on six 

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.540
 conditions there but it's not going to work 

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.790
 mystery or lack of planning 

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.550
 which is really the achievement of the right 

00:23:53.790 --> 00:24:00.390
 to learn these things then to us 

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.960
 Do not mind it, it's not even better, it's just the date. 

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.000
 that 

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.830
 but what I know that rural is very 

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.430
 important a central square of our 

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.930
 strategy is certainly to etc. and the scope 

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.430
 global android also another piece 

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.809
 strategy but we will combine 

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.610
 both 

00:24:12.809 --> 00:24:16.139
 there was a cultural here is very 

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.120
 important to have a tablet or not 

00:24:16.139 --> 00:24:19.320
 working this time the source the 

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.429
 good countries 

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:26.129
 there is someone here asking whether or not it is legal 

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:28.230
 The hand is just a question, same name. 

00:24:26.129 --> 00:24:30.600
 but developed android only 

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.519
 I did not have world developed all 

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.070
 planet outside our ruined burg 

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:36.720
 the world is an excellent question is this 

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.090
 question is very very relevant because 

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.629
 therefore it is difficult to know where the 

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.159
 angle 

00:24:39.629 --> 00:24:43.019
 we all means we live in the cloud 

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:44.999
 for example 

00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:46.889
 this is a question we always had 

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:48.929
 several products here where it is 

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:50.759
 developed on these shores asp world 

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:52.619
 physical or less relevant to zero or 

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:53.340
 android is developed from behind in 

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:56.879
 money 

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.919
 the engineer who happens to be 

00:24:56.879 --> 00:25:01.379
 already composed tubes but by chance used 

00:24:58.919 --> 00:25:03.090
 they are here kept but have some 

00:25:01.379 --> 00:25:05.249
 money for using all others 

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.649
 places of the world but what I 

00:25:05.249 --> 00:25:08.669
 which imports 90 the code that produces 

00:25:07.649 --> 00:25:12.720
 then sometimes for example engineers 

00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:15.619
 have described coke trams are 

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.149
 here we have to have a team of 

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:20.249
 good part of this andrade money lives 

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:22.529
 in london for the moving part zurich a 

00:25:20.249 --> 00:25:24.330
 I myself worked with android and 

00:25:22.529 --> 00:25:26.070
 jackson and things for android it 

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.980
 I was working in Brazil. 

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:31.350
 that is, the physical location has a 

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.440
 income will be more or less reduced 

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.330
 for these engineering things but 

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.970
 Always insist boot off when you are 

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.200
 most of the gold that lives the largest 

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.190
 part of the money because of work 

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.559
 android 

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.419
 I think it's a partner so I 

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:47.999
 I do not know if it's like this. 

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:49.409
 surrounding area, we have other 

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:51.299
 Engineering wins also in the states 

00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:53.460
 united and on components android 

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:56.100
 are shared with the products they have 

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.049
 as it has components that are 

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.549
 entire group and each time it developed 

00:25:58.049 --> 00:26:01.919
 with different teams received from a 

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:03.029
 different way of the world then it's 

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:05.070
 It's difficult to answer a question where 

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:08.970
 products developed in a diagram of 

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:13.169
 faith but I think most of the 

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:14.149
 androids and is developed here without 

00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:17.149
 consider the components are 

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:17.149
 shared 

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:32.909
 we can no longer separate the cheap vapor 

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:34.830
 or less ok but mauro pedro would like to 

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:37.559
 make experience of the list similar to 

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.779
 the goal scored against you with animations 

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:41.669
 notable change uses mask 

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:43.889
 horizontal view of varzim sat 

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:46.259
 for him there is an example with this and 

00:26:43.889 --> 00:26:46.860
 max is what should make the payment of the 

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:49.500
 damn it 

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.120
 ok let's see what my client is 

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.399
 are the main reasons one thing 

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.779
 these career here is me too. 

00:26:53.399 --> 00:26:57.419
 first time I tried to make a list 

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:59.399
 with graphics do not know how much I expected 

00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:00.990
 to do it there on care 

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:06.240
 did not expect to make 5 the selected list 

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:08.159
 the necklace and you see no show in the 

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.399
 the first time she went from 

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:16.529
 shooting in 51 of the mayors is 

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:18.389
 because it happens when you put 

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:22.470
 thanks to the land in all operations 

00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:24.570
 more delicious on an android device 

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.419
 if you do not put graphics on the screen a 

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:31.740
 efficiently graphics in law while 

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:33.629
 try it this way gets bad 

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.730
 for example one of the common mistakes is you 

00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:38.419
 do not make a box of stairs then 

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:41.070
 when you make one of these lists in the 

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:44.149
 example uses needles is not because you 

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.149
 have on google 

00:27:46.309 --> 00:27:52.649
 stone he sent the city brought some 

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:55.169
 years off the screen while others 

00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:56.940
 simply entering the screen and what 

00:27:55.169 --> 00:27:59.190
 happens when the help has come up 

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.500
 is that those elements that you that 

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:03.330
 just leave the screen can not return to 

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.990
 happen and will never return to power 

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:08.700
 But I need to write, you decide if 

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.980
 You did not solve this, certainly. 

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.929
 Slow down if you when you draw 

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.269
 you determine which of these are 

00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:16.679
 graphics now on the screen and if you 

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:18.210
 have not you been loaded on that will 

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:22.850
 happen you will have that experience that 

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:24.960
 the team becomes economical the paradigms to 

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.940
 new good experience 

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.860
 The first strategy is to use the cash 

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.779
 you make a pipe and a cigar and all 

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.299
 Once you load you leave it saved. 

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:35.490
 in the box until the box more space then the 

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:37.270
 box he has he got that concept 

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.120
 money 

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.530
 the display is not always that you have to 

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.450
 Put a box thing on it 

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.520
 space you will do the eviction of a 

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:48.610
 90 the criterion of admission defense of the team 

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.950
 of the cachets were box in the middle of a 

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:53.440
 dog you'll take the box here from 

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.630
 which was - recently use the image that 

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.910
 You did not even show up to feel 

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.250
 scarf in an image box 

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.270
 will certainly improve the 

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.010
 performance 

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:06.190
 Another thing the following is to make predictions 

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.230
 is if the user is rolling the screen in the 

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:10.660
 secretary has shown a certain 

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.860
 speed is more or less easy to predict 

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.780
 that it will need several images 

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.330
 so follow then you can already do 

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.200
 perfex you can exit loading of 

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.970
 soccer 

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.730
 your cache for the singer arrives there and 

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.280
 chance to win is something else 

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.520
 important is not to force the oil 

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:31.480
 redoing this is a little sometimes it's 

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.290
 easy and it's easy to get that many 

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.120
 times 

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.760
 the following when you are using this 

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.010
 the list of atp he make a movie for 

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.410
 you recite then this date is the 

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.640
 technological training and education as 

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.710
 make this picture 

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.840
 so instead of creating a new one every time 

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.880
 that a mechanism he spends a bingo 

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.620
 beneficent of your old ones to you 

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.210
 can pick up and convert it predicted that 

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.100
 it works at that time 

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:58.450
 There are a lot of people that have a lot of developers. 

00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.640
 which is not ecological and still plays 

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.290
 We listened to the previous one and wanted a good but if 

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.620
 You did not see the new one besides you 

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.970
 trash in memory 

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.710
 You're going to have a very slow goal. 

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.530
 because I remember garbage is not free 

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.240
 the collection of garbage subject to the 

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.880
 collection wherever you spoke with 

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.170
 zero hour you lose a little bit of 

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.180
 application performance 

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.130
 if you are just constantly being 

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.900
 a garbage generating machine 

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.700
 then it will certainly have a 

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.170
 performance has been reduced then if you 

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.550
 enjoy the cold that came to you 

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.990
 do a recycling 

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.120
 performance works best for you 

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.580
 Check here only that you will have a 

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.660
 problem that tragically betray the 

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.240
 trap 

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.370
 if you are re-use and civil 

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.260
 way to change his hotel is for 

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.250
 behind the chicken is to take a step back from 

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.260
 layout 

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.510
 he has to play the role every time 

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.280
 who is going to show a view is you will have 

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.570
 a performance too then you 

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.190
 you have to be careful to keep the same 

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.650
 layout and not make 

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.930
 is and is visible or invisible with the 

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:58.330
 athletic go but you need to take items 

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.340
 visible and invisible 

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.140
 never because when you make a goal at 

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.880
 he needs to get the one in there. 

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.410
 hierarchy when he was 11 years old read 

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.970
 what can do the layout 

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.130
 so it is important to be careful with 

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.440
 this is particularly so your code 

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:13.960
 to reuse vilta very complicated 

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.040
 it's his chance he's trying we need 

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.520
 of an elton partner is very large 

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.300
 so that's what I always get 

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.640
 simplify as much as possible 

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.380
 reuse code saw if you 

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.840
 need several different types in the 

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.390
 your list you may have different you 

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.520
 date registered and look only goes 

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.870
 appropriate time to call 

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.850
 appropriate so you never try 

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.340
 reuse oil of type x to make 

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.830
 a red wine always moving 

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.810
 type x and y prophetic are without ever 

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.640
 try to convert the two and certainly 

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.210
 will improve the items in the 

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.890
 list 

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.530
 Another thing is the following lists 

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:50.500
 rarely are the example lists 

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.540
 that items 123456 in the Hawaiian 

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.340
 useful lists have data that are pulled 

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.660
 disclose if you have a list because 

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.270
 has content this content is being 

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.310
 probably downloaded from the internet. 

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:02.740
 internet a file to another place 

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.330
 and you have to be careful with just 

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.370
 with this part of loading the contents of 

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.020
 other place what can happen if you 

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.670
 is loading content from elsewhere 

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.020
 here is taking this step of 

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.120
 content elsewhere than 

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.220
 is holding your performance 

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.900
 so for example you are finding the 

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.060
 your server something can be 

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.490
 servers is clean at that time is 

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.350
 impossible to foresee in the law because of 

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.480
 Your talent list is with another 

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.190
 What in here is what you always do 

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.080
 a fred will not have the ong who cares 

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.870
 of this bureaucratic part of and to the 

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.190
 consumer to take pictures is this part of 

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.320
 always have to be done with a 

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.550
 another thirst never make a better fred 

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.830
 thing that is very heavy what 

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.840
 involve trips to him and why this 

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:43.300
 in the network said that always slow then 

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.710
 never on premiere and fred has to 

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.060
 worry only one thing that is the 

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.290
 most central component of your creative 

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.120
 that users 

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.830
 the premiere that the user's butler 

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.690
 then the user with the user is in the 

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.610
 finger to a referendum detect there she does not 

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.960
 can be engaged in something else and 

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.850
 nothing more important to one side of the 

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.560
 eyes so if you're carrying it gives 

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:01.870
 Some of the internet does a fraud 

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.390
 election and what will happen in the worst 

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.940
 of the cases the user 10 pro arrives at 

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.790
 Image 

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.230
 you have not uploaded yet is the is not the list 

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.640
 gonna lock you have to continue 

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.800
 making the goals only you do not show the 

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.630
 image shows some country or from there 

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.730
 Wow, what are you doing well? 

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.670
 Rodrigo inspires that little thing expires 

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:21.220
 that generates is and still needs to study more 

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:23.750
 psychology because I do not understand it yet 

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:25.340
 but one thing I always say is that it is 

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.690
 very strange effect that when the 

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.230
 user sees something spinning from staying 

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.940
 calm 

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.620
 then you think the process is 

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.480
 slow and suddenly you put it on 

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.520
 this thing that turns on the screen he was 

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.810
 directed against her will ask that he not 

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.700
 Do you think you're dating? 

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.440
 so it's important when you have a 

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.540
 image and loading leave blank 

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.580
 If you leave the blank hour goes 

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.350
 have training this farm and gave paulo 

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.630
 the last scene within the 

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:49.730
 environment is exactly it will know that 

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.500
 he will despair of the eyes if 

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.150
 desperate to see easily then 

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.070
 you put the tires will not have a 

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.480
 will you have more patience, will he know? 

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.620
 everything that inspires you because you have 

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.880
 very cool thing is going to happen 

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.280
 shortly 

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.740
 so it's important to you from spe 

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.290
 with the user and something else if you notice 

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.030
 if your experience is that the user has 

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.920
 What do you keep looking at waiting all the time? 

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.540
 so there's something wrong with some 

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.480
 another component of the native blood by 

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.490
 example if you depend a lot on these 

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.010
 graphics sale time 

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.300
 I just do not think it makes sense without 

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.890
 exactly worth investing in 

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.870
 server is a bit faster to 

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.300
 it would return user graph but 

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.040
 recalls that the most precious resource 

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.730
 you have more expensive is the patience of the 

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.290
 user 

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.030
 You do not want to spend 

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.560
 The user you do not need is much 

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.730
 better of this real why spend for 

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.590
 your users 

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.690
 then we must have you not too 

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.370
 download to 5 in the images as 

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.680
 put if you have to take 

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:44.180
 conquering adapter has one thing that the 

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.220
 the size of the visa it displays on the screen 

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.570
 the size of elements on your list has 

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.520
 huh 

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.950
 it will use the non-element 

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.080
 are on the screen but you can already be a 

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.150
 father for example and shot is weird 

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.660
 which will simultaneously 

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:02.780
 pictures making you think 

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:04.910
 locally there only remembering that images 

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.370
 not very fond of bitmaps acting 

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:10.010
 immutable business and carried an hour 

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:14.690
 Most importantly, the government is 

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:16.220
 great but it's also important to have 

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.340
 mobilized against the Flemish I had many 

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.340
 problems 

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:25.070
 Of course I never told 

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.990
 very low forget that there is 11 on the river 

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:30.320
 android has a clash to the part of the 

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.970
 application is part of the routine and if you 

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.590
 download too much application bitmaps can 

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.390
 being with low memory usage will be 

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.690
 very good if you have delivered you will 

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:43.160
 have a fatally provocative problem 

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:45.080
 so think about strategies of your 

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.760
 frame is very complicated racked 

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.670
 twitter something wrong maybe there 

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.970
 is getting too much because also 

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:55.070
 I think the strategy is favor is by 

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:57.170
 love of god keep this loading 

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.660
 the athletes away from their tragedy that 

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:03.740
 will draw the user list 

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:06.710
 This is very important indeed and back there 

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.210
 to be displayed on the screen searches for 20 

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:13.940
 jets for tragedy but the input 

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:17.000
 has several solutions or the tea with 

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:19.310
 mainly low 

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.580
 product catalog image 

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:24.350
 places with five important ones you 

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.150
 do this simultaneously in three 

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:31.570
 modalities to seek a little warned 

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:38.960
 the user will always have the slightest idea 

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:40.670
 The important thing is that there we remember. 

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.760
 this all in galt but it's because that 

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.690
 really really important is the 

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.460
 Another important thing is the 

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.710
 following the world currently suffers from 

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:51.410
 the problem of megapixel inflation in the 

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.970
 then even the camera plus that camera 

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.250
 cheaper on the market shelves 

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.470
 take pictures of him and many 

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:59.270
 megapixels gift much faster than 

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:02.540
 You really wanna use only have 

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.310
 for example that photo that photo of 

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.410
 a product that had a photo of the pot of 

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:08.570
 yogurt is that photo has 12 megapixels 

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:10.820
 because you need to see the almost more 

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.890
 used on twitter williams 

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.110
 so what happens when images 

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.640
 they are usually much larger than 

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.780
 you really need it especially in 

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.060
 a screen in the neighborhood 

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.700
 if you take a mobile screen here you 

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.590
 make image that size is and you will 

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.300
 carrying a 12-megapixel image 

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.340
 for what you're spending a lot of 

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:32.450
 memory waiting a lot but very much 

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:34.700
 a lot of memory is then 

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:37.670
 I am important is to load 120 maps of 

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.380
 according to you will need this too 

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.240
 It's not immediate and you're not alone. 

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.160
 makes new max papis and only loads with 

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.589
 bishop you will load the image in the 

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.619
 full resolution of them you have jr of 12 

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:50.329
 megapixels and yogurt and you will put 

00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:52.010
 in a window but nothing that nobody wins 

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:53.480
 You use your lip only the way you do. 

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.220
 he come you're carrying 12 

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.109
 megapixels to compress after 2 

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.660
 megapixels but not even then and this 

00:37:57.109 --> 00:38:02.000
 memory is we thanks boness is talking 

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.040
 there is a limit is the limit and not much 

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.150
 generous than when the memory of 

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.829
 bike you can carry the 

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.530
 android application so if you put 

00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:11.420
 two of these groups is one more apple 

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.440
 all with 14 megapixels you 

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.260
 will probably end this 

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.599
 It improves very fast so it's talk 

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:20.710
 staff is warm about your company and 

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:23.599
 usually from the south or by doing 

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:26.030
 questions so have staff doing what 

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:28.490
 before descending image generates pressures 

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:31.490
 such as neighborhoods where the same 

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:33.320
 have to make these accounts because of the 

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:35.869
 size of a good but do it already 

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.810
 less 12 megapixels than 

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:40.970
 you can download in several is not a 

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:43.730
 good practice is an excellent practice you 

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:46.099
 has more adapted with the father already leaves the 

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.599
 even if you are the 

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:50.150
 neighborhood 

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:51.859
 now if you have no image used 

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.660
 for mobile, for example you have a 

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:54.890
 image what the user got the camera 

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.109
 for example you allow the user 

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:58.310
 take a picture with the camera projectors 

00:38:57.109 --> 00:39:02.150
 something of your game 

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:04.040
 so the game has a user avatar and 

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.780
 I prefer that he use the image he 

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.180
 take an auto stitch and put a 

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.980
 lift this self photo of the user take 

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.290
 probably it has a device 

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.180
 android that has a camera is this and if 

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.800
 this camera has at least 15 thousand 

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.050
 people in the eyes on the modern 

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.819
 some prosecutors is much more 

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.400
 example that only has 8 megapixels so 

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:23.780
 Who could play your game and I'll see 

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.849
 Even cool, I can put my own 

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.589
 photo as retail 

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:29.359
 so it's cool, I want to take a picture of me 

00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:31.250
 even with the front camera for the attack 

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:33.680
 the four a front camera 

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.839
 only that the front camera means either the 

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.880
 rear camera that has even more than the 

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:40.040
 solution still does not take a photo and 

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.839
 I suddenly pass by a teacher to 

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.760
 your app is a huge lack of 8 

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:45.950
 megapixels to my face with all 

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:49.040
 wines etc then 

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:51.020
 of 8 megapixels huge so if you have 

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.760
 this in the file is a jr 

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.320
 How do you do in this case on you? 

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.970
 obviously you will not ask the user 

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.430
 does not remember the convenience only the user 

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:01.130
 Please, take a photo of your face. 

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:02.060
 Encourage to get the time is you do not 

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.410
 Are you going to say that? 

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.910
 so you have to work with what? 

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.829
 you think there's that 8-image 

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.089
 megapixels to my face you have to 

00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:10.040
 do is turn it into an image 

00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:12.050
 small so that you could 

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.680
 load in memory resize after 

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.079
 throw away 

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.250
 only this is not enough the best 

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:18.770
 Way You Make It Already 

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.329
 always count if you look 

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.980
 sbt at the time has something called 

00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:23.450
 hebe factors 

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.430
 if you look at the options 

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.550
 her payment you can pass it on to her 

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:31.400
 is called cÃ©cÃ© with sites or century in 

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:33.589
 2008 the next if you pass 2 it goes 

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.720
 load one in 2 pixels 

00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:37.730
 if you happen to be by law 4 goes 

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.349
 one person in four 

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.720
 which means you can first 

00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:44.150
 medimagem this you can do also the 

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.160
 well done and you have another option that you 

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.570
 load image size 

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.609
 Our first try loading the image. 

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.349
 only with the size this will cause that 

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:52.400
 the image is not loaded unless you 

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:54.560
 will know what the 

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.060
 dimensions in images you will know that 

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.550
 That image of my face is 14 

00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.619
 megapixels and type 3 thousand and 2 thousand 

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.060
 so based on that you calculate which 

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:03.349
 also what you need like you 

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.910
 also calculate that you need 

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:06.410
 Do you know the resolution of your 

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.190
 device and spoke at the end of the 

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.569
 screen 

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.890
 so if you know these two things 

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:11.420
 you can do a simple math 

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.579
 you will find that the image you 

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.650
 you need 300 to 200 

00:41:13.579 --> 00:41:18.200
 if you know you have 300 thousand two hundred and 

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:20.200
 original image is from 3 thousand to 2 thousand 

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.800
 so you do another simple math 

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.930
 8 and 10 

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.030
 so you need for every ten people 

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:29.210
 who have the image of one then you pass 

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:31.369
 gives it a flavor of 10 of the bush product and 

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.869
 you upload an image already directly 

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:34.430
 of memory that is already the right size 

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:36.079
 for you to show your application and 

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.910
 you do not waste now any 

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:39.950
 so this is a very very technical 

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:43.490
 important if you take an image that 

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:45.380
 It was not you, it was what you got 

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.150
 something was missing 

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.650
 I do not think this part is that 

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.750
 just be careful because sometimes you 

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.750
 will load eui-sun thing I already 

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.190
 I committed if you upload the image and how much 

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.500
 will carry both in size we are 

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:58.819
 carry the whole team to remember 

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.030
 even if you carry the team 

00:41:58.819 --> 00:42:01.560
 all 

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:04.530
 you will always carry the goal of the other 

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.150
 so the same tone always broke the 

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.850
 music you uploaded before the image 

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:11.970
 from yeda here the hills the image 

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:13.560
 Then everything is only decided. 

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:17.310
 Another important thing is the following 

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:19.530
 times in java 

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.120
 program and I have already left 

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.410
 people have the impression that everything has 

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.120
 to be abstract right? 

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:26.100
 I have seen, for example, implementations of 

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.420
 java things that are like this instead of 

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.670
 have only one thing I have another 

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.080
 thing is not almost the right kind and that 

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.180
 creates another class that creates a 

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.040
 interface interface implements four 

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:37.380
 different interfaces you create one of 

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.600
 leather encoder you create a sound that 

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.910
 implementation there you are the downgrade 

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.980
 four other interfaces to it that the 

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:46.410
 object that is one that cleiton and 50 eu 

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.300
 we created the 500 foreign mall in 

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.640
 subject that instance and diseases you 

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:54.390
 have to do is leave her alone there 

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.460
 parameters and then you take those 

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.870
 I mean, well, you can do that. 

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.790
 to argue that this is very good for the 

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.350
 code organization for collaboration 

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.150
 team is only certain that the place of 

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.920
 to do all are common to all 

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.450
 certainly not equal and fred in that 

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.770
 moment you're going to draw something 

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.090
 if you can find out what you think you have 

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.970
 what draw do you need to write the 

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:14.610
 100-line code and place and place 

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:16.650
 a price around that and deal with 50 

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:18.630
 different types of exception 

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:22.080
 surely that your receiving code 

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:23.940
 then this java already exists in this 

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.280
 temptation to do abstract things 

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.390
 It's really when you're there when you 

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.340
 You need something with a lot of 

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.960
 performance sometimes is much better kiss 

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.550
 do this situation all you do something 

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.470
 simple as for example equal pains 

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:37.170
 so this does not have any problem in 

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:38.670
 to do the same 2 is even if two is not 

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:41.130
 an abstract representation of everything that 

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:43.080
 you have to do it, but when you have 

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:45.030
 that piece of rope you know you have 

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.780
 that being is having a very 

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.370
 great 

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.230
 It's okay, you make some shortcuts. 

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:52.500
 It will not show all of you someday. 

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:54.150
 need to use another type of 2 you 

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.950
 had not thought before 

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.420
 if maths invent a new type of 

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.160
 all 

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.690
 so you can modify your code only 

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.300
 This must happen, but it's you. 

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.770
 prematurely use to say undo 

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.510
 everything extremely abstract so that 

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.830
 never having to modify the code says 

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.150
 The only thing that's going to happen here 

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.470
 you will get into your account from the slow and 

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.030
 you'll have to modify your code 

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.070
 when many things change because the 

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.660
 chance is that this observation 

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:18.750
 covers that need that goes 

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.850
 appear in the future so be careful 

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.920
 these abstractions are simple 

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.970
 clear that the application that does not 

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.500
 You must have that you do not have to have 

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:27.270
 performance, how are you? a little more 

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.190
 abstract because it's a good practice you 

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.530
 do not leave too much rodrigues to 

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:34.140
 good practice is your own 

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.510
 for the future of the project but it is a code 

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:39.000
 you need to run fast 

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.160
 It's better that it be simpler than that. 

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.600
 was strictly related to the 

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.850
 Sometimes crimes are something we use 

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.300
 half without thinking much more strange is 

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.190
 expensive 

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:50.580
 for example if you are once wrote 

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.800
 method that is that jumped screen with guess 

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.360
 that I choose her something to 

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.260
 do high score and see for myself 

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.240
 converted normal because I wanted to 

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.090
 formatting especially I would get every 

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:03.570
 every number and make a stranger the 

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:04.650
 number puts on screen that happened 10 

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.750
 frames per second 

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.400
 but as it should be the second type the 

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.870
 game was taking so long to 

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.580
 to return to school while he was 

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.640
 taking forever to render everything in the 

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.440
 your screen because what happens when 

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.490
 You'll buy another 30 already generating 

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.960
 trash, right? 

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.450
 so why do you get a sling? 

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.280
 which is number 1 was there that is created 

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.720
 other 30 the number 2 you join 

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.700
 when you put together and create a third 

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.830
 expires in 2012 and throws out the two 

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.540
 other stars you get the number three if 

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.740
 they add that it's more a star he 

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.360
 created in memory 

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.400
 after joining the other two wanted 

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.780
 a new strang remembers forever only are 

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.440
 immutable was unable to modify the 

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.440
 stream 

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.600
 so if I next to en125 and 3 he is 

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.300
 wanting a new star that is 123 

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.460
 then played out a two and three 

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.290
 so I do it all holy frame by 

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.900
 a high score that has five digits 

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.180
 It's a lot of trash right so it's always good 

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.010
 be careful about this excessive generation 

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.590
 it's not just because I already take it 

00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.330
 trash bill for you that means 

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:03.000
 What do you have is that you neglect it? 

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.740
 so not only are several other 

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.180
 things so always use more attention 

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.270
 to see how much garbage is being generated 

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.830
 your jams soup 

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:13.410
 required very carefully 

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:15.360
 only who is listening is not here 

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:17.130
 not only to remember that we have people who 

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.890
 commented that not being able to enter is 

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:23.010
 closed there is a limit of participants and 

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:24.930
 one in galt then we try central 

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.240
 the customers reaching you can not 

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:30.210
 enter more people are participating 

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.130
 It's tart with casting away cast a 

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:34.500
 people had a little time in the world 

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.420
 even renault same time tries to 

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.280
 new next time they will become one more 

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.810
 you little you can enchant the world 

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:44.730
 I just wanted to enjoy that we're 

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:47.070
 In the final 15 minutes there, it's up to you. 

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:50.760
 do not talk to the folks who pick up your 

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:51.480
 Galt to leave positions that are of 

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.700
 communities 

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.560
 On the contrary, I forgot, we are 

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.890
 creating even more of Jesus in the 

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:03.600
 Brazil and we consume July 14 six 

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:07.530
 or seven days in campinas in salvador vai 

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.290
 to go out paulo and reef also in blumenau 

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:16.490
 Santa Catarina 

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:16.490
 no one is actively in the community 

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.140
 of time the food group had been 

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.970
 starting work here in brazil had 

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.530
 transition time 

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:28.140
 one of the things that has very cool the 

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:33.630
 staff sees that they must exist in 

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:36.270
 version that is the team where it is 

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:38.640
 analysis of some applications is not 

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:42.480
 and thus make it more the latter the 

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.650
 ideas on what to do with the 

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:47.330
 staff there 

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:49.740
 simply grabbed some apps and 

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:52.350
 analyze the application of a sanction 

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:54.180
 30 40 minutes or up to an hour people 

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:56.400
 wants to help you make an app 

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.619
 of quality and android we have 

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:01.050
 many apps you want to improve 

00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:02.670
 as indicative of you as the 

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:06.480
 People want to do this by acting 

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:08.970
 more direct in goal in cups than this 

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.290
 agreement has more difficulty and 

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.180
 example first common point had 

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.980
 the question of navigation of the 

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.260
 application is that it messes up 

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:19.290
 the doubts that I observe cheese as 

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.359
 the sax a bar of some elements 

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:23.460
 I wanted to give a sign to 

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:25.590
 You guys, not in the next days. 

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.600
 or next week you should open a 

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.010
 consumption formula also submitted the 

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.440
 applications that want us to give 

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.240
 navigation text and the 

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.060
 people will also show the apps 

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.800
 example are some applications that the 

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.030
 People are referring here in Brazil 

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.800
 including applications that 

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.570
 having recently emphasized again that 

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.090
 sing captives with the urban fish 

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:48.250
 that we work together 

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:51.070
 with manson and help improve on 

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.620
 Do you work with you, too? 

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.090
 It's soon we will announce more 

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.330
 some of us do not have 

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:01.950
 unfortunately when fixed issue of 

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:04.900
 trips and times played here are 

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:07.990
 This year we will have more fests 

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:09.490
 are also connected dgs there is the 

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.580
 People are going to do some more 

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:14.110
 mainly steps to win 

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.940
 specific points and make an analysis 

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:18.760
 more specific as you do in the 

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:21.340
 navigation such that anyone who has any 

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.010
 personal suggestion may change in the 

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.470
 google plus in mexico in the other paper until 

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:28.720
 more on this commented today we will 

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:32.560
 try as far as possible to respond 

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.760
 for you 11 personal satisfaction as 

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.300
 curious and what would be the next 

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.710
 steps our world well my mine 

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:42.040
 make a comment in the meantime 

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:45.370
 thing and I do not think it's already 

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.710
 that it was important to see that there a good 

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.910
 point is fundamentally the 

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.950
 this quality of user experience 

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:54.160
 so I think it's important that we 

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:57.450
 legault clarify the three points but it is 

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.590
 more complicated about navigation is to 

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:01.420
 who only after having everyone 

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.940
 making a great co-alternative 

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.380
 model to upgrade from zero to 

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.960
 environment that have helped to improve 

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.060
 So here we hangout a 

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.650
 time to talk or talk 

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:14.380
 specifically in the face of complaints of 

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.150
 get lost get a theme over 

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.310
 a few weeks and will discuss item 

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.140
 specific then s navigation 

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.760
 We can talk about cash after that. 

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.260
 images for example the use of 

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.600
 most important lists that a 

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.650
 ask very good education with bruno 

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.870
 made excellent 

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.550
 We can do this with some 

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.710
 personal question but we party 

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:43.510
 maybe the last question all letter 

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:47.710
 time is asking is in 

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:52.490
 relation to finding the key d link from 

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:59.450
 spelling of the key 

00:50:52.490 --> 00:51:01.940
 You use to put it in products and 

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:05.000
 what would be my way of saving the 

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.530
 yet how much can you 

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.240
 just recently I was 

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:14.450
 working just the example code 

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:19.369
 dnpm is three but if you say that 

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:21.140
 You take it as it should, no problem. 

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:23.090
 is really is the following if you put 

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:25.100
 It literally gives you lots of 

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:28.910
 vulnerable to attacks is because you 

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.320
 literally puts there any 

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.060
 Anyone can sort of 

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.830
 discover your code find out which 

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.869
 Are we here and you do not want to do this? 

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:39.590
 not because the secret key of that key 

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:40.580
 a public key is is the republic wants 

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:44.420
 to tell people that they know 

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:46.700
 she the big problem of the keys is 

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.800
 easily accessible is that someone 

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.480
 could in theory replace 

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.030
 those that public key 

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.619
 by his public key in this way 

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:57.350
 he could fool his 

00:51:54.619 --> 00:52:00.020
 application thinking that it is that the purchases 

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:01.940
 that he himself signed was 

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.500
 signed by our key 

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.869
 This is the big problem on the second 

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:08.150
 literally friends and I stayed 

00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:10.550
 tempted to put a way there in the 

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:12.350
 code is not an example of how to 

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.900
 that so much grace only that any 

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:17.420
 I wake up because I put there stays 

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:19.850
 being standard for example certainly 

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.140
 if there is someone who will want to make a 

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.880
 he will try to make an attack 

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.410
 against any form the example write 

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.480
 that's why I thought it was better 

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:29.740
 leave the criterion of each one invents the 

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.850
 your own way of photographing find 

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.609
 one of the ways to do it for example 

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:36.140
 Are you making one in it? 

00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:39.410
 shock with some mode some stream mode 

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.270
 this is very easy to do and effective 

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.550
 another way you can get it from a 

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:46.670
 way for example I see they signed up 

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:47.960
 key literally writes it in note 

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:52.100
 only that evil remains 

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.230
 so football is more the key america 

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.030
 so is the number so I could very much 

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.530
 also to pick up and convert the 

00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:00.230
 the equivalent number to write with the bic 

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.640
 10th congress does not write it later 

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:03.350
 you convert team gracie purchase 

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.809
 base and 64 

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:08.269
 Then you get your good name. 

00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:10.219
 I just can not do much, it's just one 

00:53:08.269 --> 00:53:13.819
 way you do not leave that key as 

00:53:10.219 --> 00:53:16.160
 exposed so that's what brings a topic 

00:53:13.819 --> 00:53:17.809
 What is important is that it's very cool. 

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.789
 Why do not you use Xavier? I've already seen one. 

00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:21.489
 genetic implementation in which 

00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:25.219
 I would have to think that so the key chance 

00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:26.989
 and ends up picking up and not doing the 

00:53:25.219 --> 00:53:29.259
 verification of signatures is a terrible 

00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:32.119
 The idea is for him to stay any 

00:53:29.259 --> 00:53:34.249
 anyone who picks their up their ep 

00:53:32.119 --> 00:53:36.199
 and pick up and put a fake account it 

00:53:34.249 --> 00:53:39.589
 and only on the purchase effect 

00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:41.479
 false then it is always important you 

00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:43.400
 use this key and one of the changes that 

00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:45.529
 people did in version 32 in penalty that the 

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.509
 next is now this key for 

00:53:45.529 --> 00:53:49.219
 application is no longer pure savior 

00:53:47.509 --> 00:53:51.229
 it used to be the same for all 

00:53:49.219 --> 00:53:54.109
 applications or even developer and 

00:53:51.229 --> 00:53:56.299
 currently it is specific objective is 

00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:57.769
 much easier this way is 

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:59.420
 answer to the challenge is at your discretion 

00:53:57.769 --> 00:54:01.459
 how to photograph 

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.499
 I recommend cut into pieces of 

00:54:01.459 --> 00:54:05.989
 make you cry with other stars or 

00:54:03.499 --> 00:54:10.339
 come in one way and another very 

00:54:05.989 --> 00:54:14.779
 important is to make the 

00:54:10.339 --> 00:54:16.609
 code is a code a form that is 

00:54:14.779 --> 00:54:19.009
 easy sorry there to see how it works 

00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:23.239
 make the wheel fix the garnde something 

00:54:19.009 --> 00:54:26.619
 yes to leave can only overshadow the own 

00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:30.859
 customer has integration of the 

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:32.959
 own director a deck you 

00:54:30.859 --> 00:54:35.089
 but they already have their court and 

00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:37.189
 I see that this case including you 

00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:39.529
 doing this is just set up some 

00:54:37.189 --> 00:54:41.719
 Latin parameters that never used mustache 

00:54:39.529 --> 00:54:44.329
 on the network a little bit before we 

00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:47.709
 You use law, I distanced something. 

00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:50.150
 yes in the guardiola plans 

00:54:47.709 --> 00:54:52.640
 the last question of the world elected here 

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:56.239
 very interesting sale on map here 

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:59.689
 that is web that I use the resource to 

00:54:56.239 --> 00:55:01.429
 chip stuck on the floor - now ask for the gps 

00:54:59.689 --> 00:55:03.410
 when they are in a place 

00:55:01.429 --> 00:55:06.439
 closed it is obvious that there would be no opposition 

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:09.410
 sees gps but would like to know if there is 

00:55:06.439 --> 00:55:10.369
 a way of detecting this absence of 

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:15.949
 position 

00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:18.579
 So there's no way you do not have a voice. 

00:55:15.949 --> 00:55:18.579
 to detect 

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:24.590
 given the absence of opposition by the 

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.270
 lack of presence even if your 

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:28.100
 colleague who is not called knows that the 

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:31.910
 organization is not available on that 

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:33.530
 moment I've seen code from the tomb the 

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:36.700
 inter precisely because of this people 

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:39.470
 thousands is always the software uses the 

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:41.180
 software 

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:43.760
 there's always going to be something there so the 

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:46.370
 dude go there and get the location ltda one 

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:50.360
 hot item something already comes out using 

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:53.960
 itahum inter in the home of the user who 

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:56.570
 and it will give a no nr will give an error 

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.750
 even worse and show pro and no 

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:01.760
 time I discovered that it is true is this 

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:03.980
 and good practice 

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.880
 check the advise I studied you 

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:11.860
 used in this case is there is nothing that 

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:13.910
 You have no organization, so this is it. 

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:15.860
 just then you have to take 

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.300
 care of the wall presumably 

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.740
 Commander spoke the next time you 

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.900
 there is one thing you may not have 

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.190
 mobile is pretty bad you are 

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:24.050
 for three friends will now have 

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.670
 location it will have network and 

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.960
 users do not have a network organization with 

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:29.120
 For example, the question is close to a 

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.130
 garage they sometimes do not have 

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:33.920
 network organization when how much they 

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:35.900
 are passing through the tunnel 

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.340
 then if it behaves badly when 

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.120
 this happens and only that is that 

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.340
 users 

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:44.270
 particularly in the case of location is 

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:45.920
 It always makes sense to you or you use the 

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.270
 best information you have 

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.580
 It's okay that this information can be 

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:51.290
 some time ago right but not yet 

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:55.160
 you can call the average expense has 

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:57.740
 a call to have a call 

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.600
 call new light diet made war 

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.970
 slight tone than that it will return 

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.440
 with the last position that is known from the 

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:05.060
 not only with the last position 

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.260
 but it will tell you what the accuracy is 

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.880
 of that organization 

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:11.270
 and how long ago time was there 

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:13.700
 so if the app what exercised its 

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.240
 user is not an alien is a super 

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.680
 hero 

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.380
 if five minutes ago he was 

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.880
 at an intersection of x and y 

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.810
 minutes later it's not exactly going to be 

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.450
 in another city 

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:24.860
 So you can you can make you lonely. 

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.230
 need to know how much oil is 

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.610
 to provide relevant messages to you 

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:30.290
 you know that you do not need 

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:32.510
 exact location at that time 

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:34.100
 you know that using the boots cat 

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:36.200
 chance she has a good concern the 

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:40.370
 enough you can already provide the 

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:42.470
 user does not pass the pt if by 

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:44.630
 do not you have information that is 

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.940
 good enough crf-df east not 

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:48.940
 block windows returns the user there 

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:51.710
 a week ago i was in chile 

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:54.080
 so maybe it's not chile anymore 

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:56.810
 a week later on the airplanes of all 

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.130
 it is perfectly possible then in this 

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.050
 In case you do your best 

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:01.460
 application shows in any way the 

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.710
 chile 3 data a company that it 

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.270
 is there because it's the last one you 

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:07.670
 Just put a little box for him. 

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:09.170
 saying that the organization is not 

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.610
 available and that is why you are 

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:16.700
 presenting the data of the last 

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:19.220
 presentation he is also setting up 

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.470
 console will use gps and things and 

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:23.270
 putting was in cheese curd cheese 

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:29.690
 As you like with a lot of stuff. 

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:33.590
 this is what users can go on play 

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:35.480
 We did not question the lessons 

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:37.700
 elections and I'm glad it's all right 

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.440
 even questioning that lesson is only 

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.940
 ok I do not know 

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.310
 for example you need to get your 

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:45.650
 city ââor will be able to offer a 

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:48.530
 delivery service what you say so 

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:51.050
 Welcome to the city, you do not need 

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:56.350
 use a specific GPS application 

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:59.570
 using what can be a city that 

00:58:56.350 --> 00:59:02.780
 need so, so stay tuned 

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:05.090
 the type of permission request that you 

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.820
 will request a user and always 

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:10.430
 remember to turn on and off tac as well 

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.520
 only has indicatives unfortunately you 

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:15.200
 application keeps seeing that glue 

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.750
 week of the location staying up there and 

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:20.840
 You'll kill shooting app it to 

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:23.210
 fish or that everyone forgot to 

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.450
 Uncle Uncle to take the update there 

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:28.370
 also because that 

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:31.580
 concern with the part of gps only that 

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:33.470
 this if you use it wrong you can 

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:35.240
 damage battery including users and 

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.680
 it can hurt you getting caught up a lot 

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.070
 That sort of thing is evident. 

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.990
 unnecessarily you may end up 

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:44.330
 impairing the use of the experience of 

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:46.260
 your app also remember too 

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.910
 once again 

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.530
 of those things that we have lists 

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:51.870
 I do not even know if you're the calculation type. 

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:54.210
 catching the catar is a fatality one 

00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:56.820
 tragedy, too, because only to 

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:59.190
 remember once more if you give this detail 

00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.840
 also that exists today we came to stay 

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:03.810
 not seen in the transaction and 

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:06.390
 The student never locked gps with a 

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:08.310
 value that can not play that teach 

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:11.040
 she has this function she had not borrowed 

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:12.840
 the other thing so the user does not want 

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.100
 wait you user does not want to wait for the 

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.140
 application to do something for more 

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.580
 important that you are doing 

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.260
 the user does not want to wait for more than 

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.990
 It's own time you asked for it. 

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.400
 The user was not expecting us then the worst 

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.050
 thing that happens in application when 

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.880
 type the whole screen is locked 

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:28.050
 because I'll know that china decided 

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.690
 that has something important to do 

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:32.040
 now for example reaching 73 

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.780
 the battle will be blocked because he is 

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.340
 the time of ex-users of the 

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.930
 minimum time left in time to use the 

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:39.150
 application then block the entire law 

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:41.960
 this is not the same as with 

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.960
 vocalization nÃ© 

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:57.930
 the owner of memory the minute answering 

01:01:55.430 --> 01:02:00.360
 Welcome back, when you ask. 

01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:03.180
 do pedro in relation to 20 recommend a 

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:08.190
 course you are initiating recommends that the 

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:12.810
 android training for trainee is there and there 

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:16.490
 as article 2 of the specific article on the use 

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:16.490
 from fred timecos 

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:39.210
 the registration dates still a date of 

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.790
 when you are going to open registration exactly in 

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:47.430
 Brazil beyond the media 

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:51.090
 official google brazil and also 

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:53.400
 When you hear from our blog 

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.660
 just remembering the code brings google.com 

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.790
 sport.com 

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.760
 point br then access fire there 

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:03.810
 also has our profile in replanting 

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.730
 on our twitter also trying to warn 

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:08.370
 You guys do not have an exact date yet. 

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:09.420
 when you are going to open registration 

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.770
 disclosed 

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:15.930
 we also like the other years 

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:18.960
 people will keep the broadcasts going 

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:20.580
 also be able to watch there and the 

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.350
 prepare something special maybe 

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.890
 some cities you've had in the past 

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:28.050
 who was the man of 60 years possibly 

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:29.960
 will have something this year also with 

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:32.640
 the energy company of the region 

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.910
 taking advantage of space if within your 

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.910
 region
