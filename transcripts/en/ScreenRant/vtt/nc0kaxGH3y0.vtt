00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240
Introduction

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.180
Everyone knows that Hollywood bends the rules
of reality to bring stories to the big screen.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.900
Even movies based on true events fudge things
up a bit.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.730
It’s called artistic license, and many viewers
accept it as part of the film industry.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.470
The problem is when the “truths” movies
present are so prevalent, they become accepted

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.470
as actual fact.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.880
People have a misconstrued vision of how society
operates because of movies, and they may be

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.720
surprised to learn how much films get wrong.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.620
Here are 10 movie myths you probably still
believe.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.640
Laser Blasts Are Visible

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.280
A staple of any sci-fi film, laser guns are
the go-to weapons for the characters.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.019
They look cool and don’t require ammunition
reloads, but there’s one issue.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.390
The laser blasts are visible.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.530
If laser guns were every created in the real-world,
people wouldn’t be able to see the blasts.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.530
Beams need something to reflect on to be seen.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.560
In addition, invisible laser blasts would
be more powerful, since visible beams scatter

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.260
photons, making it less potent.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.460
This would certainly make all the fun Star
Wars dogfights a little less exciting.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.920
Thankfully, it’s simply science fiction.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.071
Cops Have to Read Miranda Rights

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:10.730
If you’ve seen any cop TV show or film,
chances are you’re familiar with the Miranda

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.730
rights.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.220
Beginning with the famous line “You have
the right to remain silent,” police officers

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730
say this upon arresting a suspect before bringing
them in.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.969
If they forget to read the rights – as shown
in 21 Jump Street – the criminal can go

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.100
free on a technicality.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.149
But that’s not how it works.

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.740
The Miranda rights are only for people about
to be interrogated by authorities and are

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.700
not required when someone gets arrested.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.340
This way, perpetrators can’t claim the officer
didn’t read the rights and exploit a loophole.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.479
They’re still in police custody.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.930
The Insanity Defense Works

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.319
Frequently, when a character commits a murder
in a movie, their lawyer will attempt to prove

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.729
insanity so the alleged criminal gets off
free.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.380
As long as one of your multiple personalities
did it, it’s OK, right?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.380
Wrong.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.170
The insanity defense is rarely used, only
in less than one percent of all cases.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.840
Even then, it’s successful less than 25
percent of the time.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.520
There are also states that don’t even allow
that defense to be heard.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.869
Considering a criminal can prove insanity,
they’re not “free” per say.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.929
They have to stay at a mental institution
until the doctors deem them fit to return

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:07.929
to society.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.800
That could be twice as long as a jail sentence.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.050
Explosions Aren’t a Big Deal

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.640
As the Lonely Island once told us, cool guys
don’t look at explosions.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.980
Turns out, they wouldn’t survive any, either.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.870
Several action movies showcase jaw-dropping
explosions that shatter just about everything

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.390
in its path – except the main protagonist.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.250
The hero will typically make a dashing escape
by using the explosion as a means to propel

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.500
him through the air.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.690
Unfortunately, should John McClane try his
antics in real life, his body would be torn

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.730
to pieces by the shockwave.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.170
Explosions go through things, which would
obviously kill somebody and end a film franchise

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.840
quicker than any villain could dream.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.690
Airplanes Are Easy to Start

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.450
Whenever the heroes need to make a quick getaway,
there’s always an empty aircraft for them

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.450
to use.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.760
All it takes is the flip of a couple of switches,
and the plane can take off.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.120
If only it were that simple.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.320
Being a pilot isn’t the same as driving
a standard car, and there’s typically a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.790
huge checklist of things to go through before
flying a vehicle.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.450
A 747 jet requires 123 items before going
off the ground, and the helicopter from The

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.100
A-Team has a 9-page list.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.150
In real life, even fighter jets take 15 minutes
to take off when they’re called into action

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.070
in an emergency, so Hollywood needs to find
a new way to get heroes out of a jam.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.590
Tracing Calls Take a Long Time

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.890
In a game of cat-and-mouse, the villain may
call the hero to taunt him or her, and there’s

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.760
a mad dash to trace the call and track down
the evildoer’s location.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.840
When the good guys get oh so close to completing
the task, the villain hangs up, smug in victory.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.760
But if movies were following real world practices,
they’d find the baddies in no time.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.230
Police usually know where you are as soon
as you call them, and the FCC requires wireless

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.220
networks to have location-tracking technology.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.011
They only time this would work is if the villain
was using a stolen or prepaid phone, and it

00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:48.060
still wouldn’t take a minute to find.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.510
Mid-Budget Movies Are Easy to Green Light

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.400
Movies are a business driven by profits, so
one would think that smaller budgeted projects

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.150
would be welcomed by executives looking to
make a quick buck.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.430
That isn’t the case.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.120
As you may have noticed, franchises are the
dominant form of film these days, with the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.870
studios banking on well-known intellectual
properties to drive their release slates.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.620
If a movie isn’t a huge tentpole based on
something, it’s harder to get approved.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.350
Mark Wahlberg spent years developing the boxing
drama The Fighter, which went on to be an

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.350
awards player.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.840
It doesn’t matter how great a film can be,
it needs to be recognizable or it could never

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.090
be made.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.340
Hacking is Only Done By Criminals

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.030
There’s no denying that hacking is illegal
and can lead to serious consequences.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.030
Just ask Sony.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.379
Still, it isn’t something that’s exclusively
done by criminals looking for a way to get

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.379
ahead.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.720
Hacking is actually a legitimate career, and
professional ones are usually hired by companies

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.490
to look into their systems for weak spots.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.580
These are typically normal, everyday people
just trying to make a living and have no malicious

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.449
intent when they hack into servers.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.999
Finding vulnerabilities can lead to a substantial
payday, so this really doesn’t sound so

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:56.039
bad after all.

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.620
T-Rex Can’t See Things That Don’t Move

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.509
When the t-rex breaks out of its Jurassic
Park paddock, Alan Grant tells Lex that the

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.599
dinosaur can’t see them if they don’t
move.

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.629
Sure enough, the t-rex is right in front of
his prey but doesn’t know it.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.530
Studies have shown that Grant and the kids
would have been a tasty meal for a real-world

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.610
t-rex, whose eyesight rivaled that of a hawk
or eagle.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.360
In the novel, this trait was explained by
the amphibian DNA used to fill in the genetic

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.219
gaps impacted the eyes, but the film makes
no mention of it.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:27.500
It’s a plot hole that bothered scientists,
but general audiences didn’t seem to care.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.710
Instant Communication Is Possible Across Great
Distances

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.580
Sci-fi movies love to show people communicating
with each other, even when they’re on completely

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.580
different planets.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.499
Their messages get across instantly, and there’s
typically no delay.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.949
They have a conversation as if they were in
the same room.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.650
If someone tried this in the real world, they’d
be disappointed.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.810
The average time lag for a message from Earth
to Mars can be almost 21 minutes, with another

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.409
21 added for a reply.

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.479
That certainly paints Mark Watney’s plight
in a new light.

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.539
Thankfully, his communications system in The
Martian seemed to be more advanced.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.949
Those are our picks for movie myths you still
believe.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.029
Are there any we missed?

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.349
