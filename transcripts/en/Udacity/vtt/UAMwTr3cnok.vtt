Hi Michael.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.920
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles, how are you doing?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.580
&gt;&gt; I'm doing just fine. How are you doing?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; I'm fine, thank you.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.130
&gt;&gt; Excellent. We are on our penultimate topic in unsupervised learning.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.950
&gt;&gt; Huh, that seems kind of fast.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.880
&gt;&gt; It does seem kind of fast, but we'll probably

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.735
go back and pad things so that it seemed longer.

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:17.800
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe we could just talk more slowly.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.510
&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure I'm capable of that, but

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.180
I'll do my best to talk more slowly. So, today,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.420
what we're going to talk about is feature selection.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.620
&gt;&gt; nice.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.390
&gt;&gt; Oh. Now it turns out that this is one of two topics that we'll

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.790
be talking about. That's what I meant by

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.170
penultimate. And the other is feature transformation, which

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.050
is something that has a long history, and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.970
is very interesting in its own way. But

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.420
I think it's better to talk about feature

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.280
selection first. It's a nice crisp problem. Okay?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.970
&gt;&gt; Sure and then this is in the unsupervised setting?

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.190
&gt;&gt; Yes. This is in the unsupervised setting,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.490
though it'll turn out that, as is often the case, it's

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.310
not clear what it means to do something in the unsupervised setting,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.470
in the absence of some supervision later down the road. But we'll

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.310
see that as we, as we talk in a couple of minutes.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.690
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.000
&gt;&gt; Okay? Alright. So the first thing that we should

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.310
do I think for feature selection is, define the problem.
