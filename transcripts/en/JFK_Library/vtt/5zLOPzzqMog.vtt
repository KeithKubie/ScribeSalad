00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:04.680
- It's difficult when we're
in front of a mirror everyday,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.884
but that mirror is not there
for us to criticize our bodies

00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:09.141
in a negative way.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:12.980
It's there for us to be
able to see our line,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.073
to realize if our hips are
square, if we're not sickling,

00:00:16.073 --> 00:00:20.015
you know, all of these
things to improve ourselves,

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:22.182
not to put ourselves down.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.541
And it's really difficult when
you're a part of something

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:31.206
that over time, throughout
history, has become,

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:34.717
you know, there are so many
negative things attached to

00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:36.193
being a ballet dancer, you know,

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:39.076
when people hopefully not
to this day, but you know,

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:40.965
a lot of the time in the
past when people think

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.264
of ballet dancers, they
think oh they don't eat,

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:47.326
they have eating disorders,
they're this, they're that.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:48.742
I think that it's important for us

00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:51.472
to understand that we are athletes,

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:53.694
and that's why I emphasize that so much.

00:00:53.694 --> 00:00:57.185
Not to make us seem less than,
or that athletes are better,

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.653
but we have to take care of
our bodies in the same way

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:02.620
that athletes do, it's
how we fuel our bodies,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.937
it's what we're putting into it,

00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:08.104
that's what keeps us dancing
for a long period of time,

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:12.196
and hopefully not getting
injured as often as,

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.702
sometimes it just happens,

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:17.451
but it's so important for us to remember

00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:21.818
that being healthy and
fit is going to make us

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:24.485
the best dancers that we can be.
