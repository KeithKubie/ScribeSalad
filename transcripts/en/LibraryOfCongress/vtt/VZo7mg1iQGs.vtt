00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.540
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: And I'd like
to welcome you to Immigration

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.900
and Children's Literature, the
Role of Heritage and Storytelling.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.110
It's sponsored by the Young Readers
Center and the Center for the Book

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.540
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.170
This program is a sequel
to our diversity symposium,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.110 position:56%
which we hosted last Spring in
which many of you were participants.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.830
We had such a terrific
response, both to the program

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.010
and to the utility of the
online webcast that followed

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.930 position:56%
that we've expanded the conversation
to explore the contribution

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.210
of diverse cultural
experiences from first

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.040
and second generation Americans to
literature for children and youth.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.280
I want to extend our gratitude to
the Virginia Center for the Book

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.610
at the Virginia Foundation for the
Humanities and the Maryland Center

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.340 position:56%
for the Book at Maryland Humanities,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.050
for supporting this
program again this year.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.090
Also our colleagues at
the Center for the Book,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.280
most specifically Dr. John Cole
and Bonnie and Guy Lamallanara

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.510
and the YRC staff Kaheen Mohammad,
Monica Valentine and to our interns

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.850
and volunteers who always
make what we do possible.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.900
This exchange comes at a critical
time in our national conversation

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.790
about American and its immigrants.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.320
And thinking about that role,
the role that culture has

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.540
in this conversation and literature
in particular, I'd like to go back

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.240 position:56%
to 1947 when Rogers and Hammerstein
premiered South Pacific on Broadway,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.940
based on the book "Tales of the
South Pacific" by James Michener.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.960
The song that stirred
quite a controversy was

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.590 position:56%
"You've got to be carefully taught".

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.980
And here quickly is a first stanza.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910
You've got to be taught
to hate and fear.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.200
You've got to be taught
from year to year.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.990
It's got to be drummed
in your dear little ear.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.860
You've got to be carefully taught.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.370
Many letters and the papers of
Oscar Hammerstein at the Library

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.560
of Congress demonstrated the
polarizing nature of this tune,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.970
very much meant by both Rogers
and Hammerstein to be a comment

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.750
on the racial prejudice
of the times.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.150
And by the way the library has the
piano vocal scores of South Pacific

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.760
in the performing arts reading
room and the sound recording

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.930 position:56%
of the original Broadway cast in
the recorded sound reference center.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.640
But our conversation today takes a
very different and optimistic turn.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.980
Our premise does include the
value of language and education,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.870
but from a different place, by
sharing values, culture and stories

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.190
from the heritage, their
heritage our authors

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.500
and illustrator make
positive contributions

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.600
to the future of our children.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.650
And we're going to hear about
some examples this afternoon.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.400
Our first author Meg
Medina also serving

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.250 position:56%
as the moderator for the discussion.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.980
Meg has been a collaborator
both last year's symposium

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.300
as well as today's program.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.920
And we're so grateful for her
wisdom, creativity and passion

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.960
for her profession and
for her compatriots.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.990
Meg is an award winning
Cuban American author

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.830
who writes picture books,
middle grade and YA fiction.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.870
She's the 2014 recipient
of Pura Belpre medal

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.740
and the 2013 Civil Fiction winner

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.540
for her young adult novel Yaqui
Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.550
Everybody always makes
a noise about that Meg.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.750
And in 2015 her picture
book, Mango Abuela

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.650
and Me was a Pura Belpre
Honor medal.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.310
She is also the 2012 Ezra Jack
Keats New Writers medal winner

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.680
for her picture book
Tia Isa Wants a Car.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.340
Her other books are The Girl
Who Could Silence the Wind,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.020
a 2012 Bank Street Best Book and
CBI recommended read in the UK.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.660
And Milagros: Girl From Away.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.990
Her newest novel Burn Baby Burn
has earned four star reviews

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.530
and is a Junior Library
Guild selection.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.890
Perhaps the most revealing accolade
is her 2014 nomination from CNN

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.100
when she was named one of CNN
10 visionary women in America

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.260
for her work to support girls,
Latino youth and diversity

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560
in children's literature.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.520
I now turn the program over to Meg,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.640
who will introduce her
colleagues and lead the discussion.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.880
including a 20 minute
Q &amp; A at the end.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.410
At the conclusion of the
program we'll have a book signing

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.090
with all of our panelists.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.510
Meg.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.370
[ Applause ]

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So I have my phone
up here, not because I'm waiting

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.770
for an important call, but
because I talk too much and I want

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.750
to make sure that I get everything
in that we have to get in today.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.270
So, good afternoon everybody and
it is such a pleasure to be here

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.810
with all of you today at
the Library of Congress,

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.260
which I think is easily one of
my favorite places in the world.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.950
Whether I'm touring the beautiful
rooms in the Jefferson Building

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.850
or whether I'm here tucked away in
the Madison Building doing research

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.780
as I did here for Burn Baby Burn.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.550
It's safe to say that I think the
Library is a place that stands

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.790
for our best ideals, about
the written word and the power

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.930
of being a literate
and engaged people.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.210
So many, many thanks to Karen
Jaffe and the young leaders center

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.630
for this kind invitation.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.600
To me and to all of these authors
and for this wonderful opportunity

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.720
to be with all of you today.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.580
So, I have been looking forward
to this afternoon's conversation

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.240
about immigration and
children's literature for months.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.200 position:56%
I am, myself the daughter of Cuban
immigrants, the wife of an immigrant

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.800
and a children's book author who
seeks to write about all the places

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.320
where childhood culture
and family meet.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.040 position:56%
It's my life's work really, and it's
a privilege and a joyous work even

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.420
when I'm writing about
the harder aspects

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.370
of a dual identity and that strain.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.850
I find myself in exceptional
company this afternoon with a group

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.460 position:56%
of talented up and coming authors
who we've invited because they bring

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.900
to their work what we decided was
a very nuanced and authentic voice

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.180
and because they represent a range
of nations and a variety of points

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.360
on a continuum of what we
collectively call immigrants.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.140
Today the goal is to
talk about, to each other

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.890
and discover how the immigrant as
an experience shapes us as writers

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.740
and why it matters to us
to voice our experience

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.610
in works for children.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.630
And of course our hope is that this
conversation offers you a window

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.110
inside immigrant children and their
families and a road map for how

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.590 position:56%
to use diverse stories with children

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.770
in your personal and
professional lives.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.510
Our hope is that today's
conversation strengthens our

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.510
collective commitment to plural
narratives in children's fiction

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:11.860
so that all of us who are American
can feel valued and included.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.600
As ground work some statistics from
the migration policy institute here

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.100
in Washington D.C. that
you might find interesting.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.050
As of 2016 the US foreign
born population

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.000
and the US foreign children
accounted for 81 million people.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.160
More than a quarter
of our population.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.600
In 2014, 1.3 million
people migrated to the US,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.440
a figure that includes
estimates of the undocumented.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:49.580
The top countries of origin in
order were India, China, Mexico.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.090
Canada and the Philippines.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.910
And for those of you
who work with children

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.410
and families you might
be interested to know

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.500
that in 2014 17.5 million
children lived

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.680
with at least one parent
who was an immigrant.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.900
And interestingly 88% of children
of immigrant parents are born

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.570
in the United States

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.180
and are therefore second
generation Americans.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.020
All of those figures
represent a quadruple growth

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.030
in the immigrants present
in the US since 1970.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.950
So yes, we are a nation
of immigrants

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.000
and our collective identity is
based on the Statue of Liberty.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.230
Given your poor, your tired masses
and all the rest of that inscribed

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.010
at the base of the Statue of
Liberty, but as we know especially

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.040
in this election year there
is considerable backlash

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.920
against the foreign
born in our country.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.150
This native rhetoric is nothing
new sadly; it's what Dr. Alan Krout

00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:02.180
of American University refers
to as old wine in new bottles.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.660
Our nation unfortunately
has a history

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.900
of native sentiments particularly
in times of economic downturn.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.810
Throughout history we've selected
different groups to target

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.960
with suspicions of their
religion, with accusations

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.430
that they bring disease or
lawlessness, that they are a threat

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.930
to civil order or our
national security.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.690
So think of anti-Catholicism,
which regard to Irish and Germans

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.370
in the early 20th century
and the backlash

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.040
against Muslim Americans today.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.560
Think of quota systems to limit
the foreign born, and legislations

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.650
like the Chinese Exclusion
Act of the 1800's.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.710
Think of internment camps for
Japanese Americans in World War II,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:50.200
and think today of these
conversations about sparkling walls

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.740
that we will build at our borders.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.940
And yet, we are all
here, all Americans,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.580 position:56%
all trying to find a way forward and
a way to love families and children.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.820
And in this effort we turn as a
people, as we always have I think

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.030
to the arts, to help us name the
experience and to build bridges.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:17.460 position:56%
So today I'd like to introduce these
wonderful colleagues who will speak

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.700
on how immigrant identity
impacts their works for children.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.740
If you are tweeting, parentheses,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.750
you would use the hashtag
please #youngreadersimmigration,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.920
and also tag @librarycongress.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.980
All right.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.140
On the end, Aisha Saeed.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.440
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: Hello.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.240
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Is a Pakistani
American author of several works,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.140
including her beautiful debut young
adult novel Written in the Stars,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.500
which came out of England in 2015.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.240
And the upcoming middle grade
novel This Promise I Will Keep,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.130
also Penguin and we
can expect it in 2017.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:07.100
Her work also has appeared in
anthology such as Love and Shout,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.340
the secret love lives of
American Muslim Women,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.620
that came out soft scull in
2012 and Faithfully Feminist,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.800
which came out White
Cloud Press in 2015.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.250
Aisha is also one of
the founding members

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.180
of the non-profit we
need diverse books.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.360
She lives in Atlanta with her
husband and her three sons,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.810
including a little baby,
who was just born this year

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.680

fabulous Wendy Wan-Long Shang.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.370
Her most recent book is the Way
Home Looks Now, which was inspired

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.870
by Taiwan's dominance of the
Little League World Series

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.230 position:56%
and her father's experience coaching
baseball in the early 1970's.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.710
Her debut novel, which is
when I first fell in love

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.270
with Wendy was the
Great Wall of Lucy Wu,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.800
which came out of Scholastic

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.440
and received the Asian Pacific
American Librarians Association

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.580
Children's Literature Award,
as well as recognition

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.760
on several state reading lists.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.070
When she is not writing, Wendy
volunteers with her local library

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.660
and roots for the Nationals with
her husband and her three children.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.100
Beside her Elizabeth Zunon.

Drawing and painting have always
been among the most important things

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.490
to Elizabeth Zunon.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.500
She was born in Albany,
New York and grew

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.900
up on the Ivory Coast, West Africa.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.180
Surrounded by the bright,
vibrant colors

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.130
of everyday West African
fabrics and tropical vegetation,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.800
Elizabeth's love of color
and pattern grew, lingered

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.110
and is a fixture today
of all of her works.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.510 position:56%
After returning to the US&lt; Elizabeth
attended Rhode Island School

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.340

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.940
and received other awards.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.160
Elizabeth now lives in Albany where
she explores a multi-cultural world

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.630
through painting, beading, sewing,
collage and fine art painting

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.430
from her own imagination and
in published children book

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.500
where she brings to
life other stories.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.440
Her ninth illustrated children's
book is the Legendary Ms. Lena

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.650
Horne, which is from
Simon and Schuster

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.050
and will publish next year in 2017.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:45.220
And last, but certainly not least
my good friend Rene Colato Lainez.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.900
He is an award winning
Salvadoran author

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.040

including Vamanos, Let's Go.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.750
The Tooth Fairy Meets El Maton
Perez and From North to South.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.390
He's a graduate of the Vermont
College MFA Program in writing

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.590
for children and young adults.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.580
Rene is a bilingual
elementary school teacher

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.260
at Fernandalez Elementary School
where the students know him

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.030
as the teacher full of stories.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:19.040
His goal as an author is to produce
good multi-cultural literature,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.800
stories where minority children
are portrayed in a positive way,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.440
where they can see themselves as
heroes and where they can dream

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.770
and have hopes for their future.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.840
He wants to write authentic stories

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.490
of Latin American children
living in the United States.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.510
Will you please help me welcome.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:44.290
[ Applause ]

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So the first
question I have is really just sort

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.990
of place us because immigration is
in fact, a continuum from a person

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.400
who has arrived yesterday,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.580
to a person whose family
has been here for some time.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.150
So Rene, can we start with you.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.750
Can you just sort of place us
where you are from originally

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.460
and where you fall in
the immigrant continuum.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.310
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: I was
born in El Salvador and due

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.250
to the Civil War my father and
I had to leave the country.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.120
My mother was already
here in the United States.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.040
And I remember that we
leave in early morning.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.840
I had brand new shoes and I
loved those shoes so much.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.890
And through the journey
those new shoes became worn

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.540
and filled with holes everywhere.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:37.100
It was a trip of three months from
El Salvador to the United States.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.060
So, I had been in every single
state of the immigrant experience,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.560
first as an undocumented
immigrant, then later I was able

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.950
to get a work permit
to start working.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.590
Then my mom qualified
for the amnesty program,

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.000
so she became a resident and
she applied for my residence.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.480
And finally I became a USA
citizen; so I have been everywhere.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.210
I'm happy to be here.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.090
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Zunon: I was actually
born here in the United States.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.310
My mother's family has been
here for many, many years.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.680
My father came here from the
Ivory Coast in the 70's to study

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.120
at the State University
in New York in Albany,

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.240
and that's where they met.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.310
So, growing up in the Ivory Coast,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.100
we lived there until
I was almost 13.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.370
I did most of my schooling
there but we came back

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.630
to the Albany area almost every
summer to visit my grandparents.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.000
So, I feel like no matter
what country I was in,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.580 position:56%
I was always looked at as the other.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.360
When I was living in
the Ivory Coast,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.410
which is a French speaking country,
many of the kids referred to me

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.340
as le melikel (ph) and when I came
here sometimes the kids would refer

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.000 position:56%
to me as "oh that girl from Africa".

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.810
So I was called -- always had one
foot in two different cultures

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.340
and kind of always in between,
but I've been here full time

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.510
for almost 19 years now,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:09.250
so I consider myself a
bi-racial African American.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.550
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: Hi I'm Wendy Shang.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:18.510
I was also born in the United
States, my mom is right there.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.120
[ Applause ]

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.220
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: My parents
came here in the late 1950's,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.700
early 1960's to study and by the
time I was born they were already

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.180
American citizens.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.700
But I would say that even under
kind of rather ideal circumstances

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.230
for coming here that you know
there is still that dual identity.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.560
And also I grew up in Northern
Virginia, and we live there now

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.750
and I tell my kids I was the only
Asian kid in my elementary school.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.670
And they really cannot
conceive of that now.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:56.150 position:56%
And I was told them like I remember
the second Asian kid that showed up.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.130
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: So I'm
Pakistani American.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.680
I was born in Miami, Florida.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.660
But my father immigrated to the
United States in the 1960's as well

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.460
and he was an electrical
engineer there.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.460
When he came here he found out
that even though he had that degree

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.270
and experience he kind of
needed to start over here.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.030
So, he started off
working I think Jersey subs

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.330
and working his way back up.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.600
Went to school and
got another degree

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.980
and became an engineer
again here in the US.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.490
And even though I was
born and raised here,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:30.230
I was telling Meg earlier, I felt
like I didn't maybe go to Pakistan

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.670
that much, but Pakistan came to me
because all of our friends growing

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.200 position:56%
up were Pakistani American, like me.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.930
All of my relatives over the
years from the time I was

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.240
about 18 months old, slowly
began immigrating to the US.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.780
And our home was the doorstep
that they always arrived at.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.750
And so all the way
until I was pretty much

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.330
in college I always was having
people from Pakistan coming

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.900
and immigrating in and coming

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.320
through our home in
order to settle down.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.830
So, yeah, that's my story.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.710
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So what are some
of the topics that you think

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.450
of as very culturally
specific to your group?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.120
That find their way into your work?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.750
So, for example I often
look at strong women

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.190
in my work, Machismo in my work.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.030 position:56%
Lack of language and those kind of
things; what do you pull from inside

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.220
of your cultural experience
to put in your books?

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.320
And any one of you can answer.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.630
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez:
For me it's equality

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.820
because even though we
are different corridors,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.720
we speak different languages,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.780
at the end we are all
children of plant earth.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.970 position:56%
So, in my book I see equality, if we
can say in English we can also sing

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.710
in Spanish to same song and
we can have fun together.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.500
We have heroes, Latina
heroes, American heroes.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.770
My idea is why to fight for,
because I am different from you?

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.600
Together we can have fun and
we can have double the fun,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.240
double the culture.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.190
And also in my work you can
see the immigrant child,

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.300
especially the child that is
insecure, the child who has been

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.580 position:56%
for the future, but at that point he
has a problem related with culture

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.780
or with immigration and
he wants to continue.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.030
He wants to succeed so I'm
telling him, "Yes you can do it.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.170
It happened to me, I know it
is happening to you right now.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.120
But there is always a light
at the end of the tunnel",

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.260 position:56%
so that's the main focus on my work.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.030
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I think for
me growing up I loved to read.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.950
I started reading when I
think I was three years old.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.240 position:56%
I just loved to read, but I never
saw myself in books and I never knew

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.720
that I wasn't seeing myself
in books because I didn't know

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.480
that I should be in the books.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.060
And so I think it wasn't until
college that I actually read a book

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.840
where there was somebody
from my culture represented.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.090
And so -- and that was a very,
very moving experience for me

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.910
to see a cover, Shabanu,
Daughter of the Wind.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.390
And I remember just reading
it and it had nothing to do

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.690
with my life or upbringing.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.130
But there was so much I saw of
myself in that book anyways.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:15.250 position:56%
And so when I write books, because
of that life long experience I have,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.470
I -- it's very important to me

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.140
that my stories reflect
Pakistani Americans.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.310
They're not generalized, everyone
has a different experience

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.130
but I did, definitely my upbringing
and my culture and my book --

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.190
my book is about a girl who
is forced into a marriage.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.440
I was not, but a lot of
the cultural aspects in it,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.140
like how her parents were just
very nervous about she related

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.490
to western society and how much
they wanted her to stay a part

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.380
of their culture, all of
that I put in my book.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.850 position:56%
And it's been very gratifying to
hear from other South Asian children

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.320
and other Muslim kids who read the
book and said, "Yeah that's me"

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.650
because I never had that.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.890
And so for me that's a very
important part of writing

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.970
for young people is to give
them that mirror in the book

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.720 position:56%
that reflects their own experiences.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.650
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: I was going to say
I think from my book and it was

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.060
about the sense that you are
representing if you are not

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.440
of many people, what you do is
you are representing everyone.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.770
I remember my dad always telling me
"What you do represents our family

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.940
and represents our
people", pressure.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.250
And--

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I know that horror.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.080
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: I think in my
second book The Way Home Looks Now,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.970
there was that sensibility of
wanting to maintain that facade

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.210
of everything is oak from the fire
even though things were not okay.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.760
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I think Wendy just
touched on such an important point

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.670
when writing about your
culture there are bad parts

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.970
about your culture too.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.770
Like there's the forced marriage
in my book and that is a challenge.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.440
When you want to reflect a mirror

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.040
but you're also sometimes putting
a mirror onto things that --

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.420
and you don't want to do that.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.560
You don't want to be the one that
puts that bad thing out there,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.490
but it also needs to
be talked about too.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.310
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I was
thinking about that earlier

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.710
because I was thinking also
sometimes you write in North

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.430
to South for example you're writing
about a mom who is deported, right?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.300 position:56%
And you're writing about a forced
marriage and so are there moments --

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.880
and then I'm going to get
back to other question.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.800
We knew this would happen.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.640
So what do we do collectively?

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.800
There are moments when you're
writing about something

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.170
that you know is going to set
somebody's hair on fire, right?

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.640
Or you're going to receive
heavy criticism for it or does

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.430
that ever creep into you like
do you ever say "I don't want

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.060
to say that" or what do you think?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.360
Like when you're writing

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.870
about undocumented children
or undocumented parents?

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.350
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Yes for
example my shoes and I is a story

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.030
of me crossing three borders from
El Salvador to the United States.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:52.910
And since I was writing it, I
knew I could see people talking,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.230
this book is about
illegal immigration.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:01.780
Someone crossing a river,
but I wrote it that --

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.240
and I knew that it
would be a hard book.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.670
At the same time, the same year
From North to South was published

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:14.930
and this book is about mom,
who is deported to Mexico

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.500 position:56%
because she doesn't have the right
papers to live in the United States.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.330
And I remember our reviewer, the
same person review the two books

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.020
and one said this book is excellent

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.820
because we are deporting
people who are illegal.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.790
And this book is terrible because
someone is crossing the border

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.460
and it is written by
the same author.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:42.230
So, I said that before, I'm
talking about it, but my focus is

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:47.860
for those -- so we can hear
there are many different ways

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.160
to immigrate.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.730
And I think children and
the population is to hear

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.030
that the different voices.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.090
And one voice is as
important as the other.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.980
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And so there
are those hard corners,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.540
and then there are these
beautiful corners as well.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.820
And it brings me to Liz's work
and also to Wendy's because I --

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.700
in the books that you illustrate
Liz you're often working

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.120
on heroes of other cultures.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.420
The Boy Who Could Harness the Wind,
if you could talk a little bit

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.750
about that book, and
also one plastic bag.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.350
And Wendy the history and the
heroes associated with Taiwan.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.530
And so Liz you first,
tell us about that --

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.430
about the process of writing,
introducing the heroes

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.830
of one culture to children here.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.360
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Zunon: Well as
the illustrator I'm tasked

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.620 position:56%
with visually depicting the
characters for an American audience.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.370
And in the case of the Boy
who Harnessed the Wind,

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.520
it's a story about a young
boy who is 14 years old

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.970
in Malawi in East Africa.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.620
And he lives in a farming
community and there happens

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.350
to be a very bad drought
that particular year and all

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:04.750
of his families crops, corn
and tobacco crops died.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.150
And they are not able to earn
any money for him to keep going

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.080
to school, so he has to drop
out of school and he ends

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.040
up finding a library down the road
that has a lot of science books.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.140
He finds a science book called
"Using Energy" and he figures

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.350
out from the pictures in this
book how to build a windmill.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.700
So he goes to the local junk
yard, he takes all these pieces

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.440
of scrap metal, lumber and he
finds a tire from a bicycle

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.010
and an old light bulb and
all these scraps of things.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.580
And he brings them home and he
kind of cobbles them together

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.890
and makes an actual
working windmill.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.670
And when I was tasked with
illustrating this book,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.430
I thought okay I've
never been to Malawi.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.340
I've never been to East Africa.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.410
He lives in a very different
country than my experience

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.960
in the Ivory Coast,
the Ivory Coast --

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.450
the city that I lived
in is very cosmopolitan.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.290
You know I didn't spent a lot
of time in the countryside,

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.350
I didn't know any farmers.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.350
So, I figured what about his
life can I kind of appropriate,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.890
and kind of use in my process
of creating the illustrations.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.610
So, his process of
going to the junk yard

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.670
and collecting all these different
pieces of things reminded me

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.530
of my process of collage, which
is how I create the illustrations

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.830
for the books.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.250
I use oil paint to paint the
faces and the skies and the ground

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.730
and then a lot of the fabric
that people are wearing

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.900
for their clothing, houses,
trees and things like that I use

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.710
by taking colorful paper and
fabric that I've collected

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.210
that has different
patterns and things on it.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.360
And I cut them out and I glue
them to create one piece of art;

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.690
so that's one way that I
kind of associated myself

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.790
with William's experience
even though I,

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.030
my life was nothing like his.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.080
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And
he's real, William --

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.840
I mean this actually happened.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.330
And the Plastic Bag is the
same sort of heroic simple,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.570
the heroic and the ordinary person.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.350
I found that so empowering.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.250
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Zunon: Yeah One
Plastic Bag, the recycling women

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.330
of the Gambia, West Africa
was an opportunity for me

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.110
to illustrate a story about a
crafter, and that's another thing

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.240
that I do when I'm not illustrating
books is I make jewelry and purses

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.500
and I sell them at
local craft fairs.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.300
So, it was a way for me to identify
with this woman Isatou Ceesay,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.210
in this story who lives in a
small village where there's a lot

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.180
of plastic bag trash
floating around.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.770
And I thought the feeling that
she must get from making something

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.750
with her bare hands and then going
out and sharing it with the public

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.210
and hoping that somebody
likes it enough to buy it,

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.410
is a feeling that I have
too when I go to craft fairs

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.130
and I have a table full of my
things and I'm hoping okay,

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.180
I hope I can make my money
back from this today.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.710
So those are little things that I
pick out of these characters lives

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.280
that I can associate with
myself, either with the process

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.940
of illustrating the book by
collecting different things,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.520
or the feelings that they
must go through in the books.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.500
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Wendy I'm going
to talk to you about humor.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.130
And also Rene I'm going to throw
you under the bus for this one too

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.940
because you're both
really funny people.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:24.590
And if you would talk a little bit
-- I remember laughing out loud,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.210
certain the Way Home Looks
Now is not a comic novel,

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.230
but the Great Wall of Lucy Wu was.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.250
I remember laughing
out loud several times

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.680
and your main characters
relationship.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.640
And also Rene in the Big
Mish mash of what happens

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.800
when the Tooth fairy meets
Raton Perez and so on.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.140
So Wendy, why don't
we start with you.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:52.510
How do you go about
grabbing humor and how --

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.910
especially as it relates to
you know, against the back drop

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.010
of Chinese American culture?

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.670
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: Yeah I find
the mechanics of writing humor,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.480
dying is easy, comedy is hard.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.930
And I think just generally is
to not aim straight for it,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.230
but to write the scene and
then find the funny in it.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.790
And then start pulling it out.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:21.020 position:56%
For example in the Great Wall of
Lucy Wu, Lucy finds out that she has

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:25.420
to give up basketball to go to
Chinese school, and she is furious.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.170
And so that's the first
layer is "I'm really mad".

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.540
And then you know second, third
pass it's like she's going

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.080
to write a song about this.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.230
And so she has a protest song

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:42.510
that she sings [Inaudible]
Chinese school is not for me.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:48.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.260
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: And
you know it's just --

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.100 position:56%
humor is always finding the
unexpected connection between things

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.510
and I think especially
multi-cultural literature that's

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.840 position:56%
so important is to find out that the
person you thought you had nothing

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.140
in common with is some --

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.370
has something that you
both can be joyous about.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.620
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And
how about in your work

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.750
because I think it's
hilarious do you know,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.460
tell them about who Raton
Perez is, they may not know?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.760
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Raton
Perez is a tooth collector

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.270
from Latin America.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Did you know?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.070
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: In El
Salvador I grew up with the idea

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:27.570
of Raton Perez and when I came to
the United States they talk to me

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.940
about a tooth fairy
and I was confused.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.370
Who is the tooth fairy?

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.020
For me at that point a
tooth fairy was the one

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.400 position:56%
from Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.080
And I couldn't believe that fairy
collecting tooth from children.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.740 position:56%
So my story is about [Inaudible] and
of course because he speaks English

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.760
and Spanish, Raton said
this is a new one for me

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.270
and it took [Inaudible], but at
the same time the tooth fairy said

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.230
"This is my territory".

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:08.010
In that book is confrontation of
mine, mine, mine, mine, me, me,

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.710
me to see who will get it.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:16.940
And I think I use my teachers
voice because I teach kindergarten

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.670
and the children say the
funny teacher, he's funny.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.150
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: He is
funny, they're right.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:30.560
So you do this mish mash
and you bring up also

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:36.210
that you are a teacher, and so as
I was thinking about my own work

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:41.710
and your work collectively
like in your dream,

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.090
in your mind how do
you want educators

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.320
to use your book with young people?

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.410
If you could prescribe
this for them,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.550
like please use this book this way.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.440
For example I will
often tell teachers,

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.890 position:56%
please don't have them do vocabulary
list and answer questions at the end

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:05.020
of the chapter, I'll be really
mad at you if you do that.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.090
How -- and let's start with
Aisha, how would you want Written

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.500
in the Stars used in a
classroom with students?

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.800
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: That's
a good question.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.740
I think no vocabulary tests.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.040
Then they will hate my book.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.720
But one way that I saw --

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.690
I just actually as going to
do a school visit and I walked

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:26.020
in on a teacher and what they
had done was they took my book

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.590
and they took American Born
Chinese and so they were looking

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.800
at the similarities between
the books and the differences.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.810
And I had not actually read
his book at that point.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.220
I had it but I hadn't read it;
so I went home and read it.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.280
And it's a graphic novel,
it's completely different.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.580
It has nothing to do with my book,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.880
but I loved that they took
two totally different books

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.110
and were researching what they
have in common, what they don't.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.860
I really would love for teachers
to use it as a way to look

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.170
at the specific aspects of Pakistan
that are covered in the book,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.690
but also take from there
what are the things we share

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.540
in common just universally
with the themes in this book?

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.360
For example parents
to exert pressure,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.900
not just Pakistani parents.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.580
All parents and children have that
yin yang of I want to do this,

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.360 position:56%
and no you can't do that and when
is that too much, when is that okay.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.920
I think there's a lot of themes
in the book that are specific,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.600
but that can be related to and so
I think I would love to see it used

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.290
as a way to learn about Pakistan,

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:31.390
but also to highlight how
are we the same as well?

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.690
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: My mind went

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.310
in to two totally opposite
directions with that question.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.920
I mean on one hand, I would
just like my book to be used

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.790
like any other book that
gets to go in the classroom.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.340
And sometimes you get in the
danger of being pigeon holed.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.470 position:56%
I have a friend whose children go
to immersion school in San Francisco

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.400
and she sent me the reading
list and both of my books are

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.310
on there; that never happens.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.380
But I would love you
know, for classrooms

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.420
that don't necessarily have
Chinese American students

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.560
in them to be open to the book.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.100
Boy book, girl book, who
is interested in this book?

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.280
I would hope that it would
be opened up to that.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.230
And then the other direction
my mind went was in both

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.470
of my books there are adults

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.080
who don't always say
what they are thinking.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.380
But as a writer I know
what they're thinking

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.010
and I know why they
did what they did.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.380
And I think it would be
really cool for teachers

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.350
to invite their students
to rewrite a scene

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.930 position:56%
from the other characters
perspective and as a way of learning

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.210
to see that sometimes people
behave in a certain way

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.670
and that they might have
a completely different set

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:39.770
of motivations than what you
are initially tempted to think.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.110
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Fascinating.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.690
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Zunon: I like
the idea of using my books

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.550
as a jumping off point for
other creative projects.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:55.470 position:56%
For example one plastic bag is about
women who use strips of plastic bags

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.510
to crochet little change purses.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.240
So I do a lot of schools
where I bring all these strips

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.910
of colorful plastic bags,
and I'll bring plastic,

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.960
empty plastic yogurt cups or
other cardboard or plastic items

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.660
and we'll have like "What can
you invent with these things"?

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.960
"What can you create"?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.080
"What kind of fashion accessories
can you make with these"?

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.460
With the boy who harnessed
the wind, I like to you know,

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.260
put in some science, technology,
engineering and math in there.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.570 position:56%
Like if you could create any
invention that would solve a problem

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.660
in the world, what would it be?

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.440
And I like to ask different groups

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.650
of especially elementary school
students to identify a problem

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:43.680 position:56%
in their community and then sit
down and draw a thing that could fix

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.430
or help that problem, or make
a machine that would solve

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.080
that problem using found objects.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: That sounds to me
like a really empowering thing.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.170
You know to take an example of what
William did in his life and sort

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.650
of apply it to your own,
and how about you Rene?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.120
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Yeah for
me is for children and teachers

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.390
to open new doors, new windows,
new horizons to discover new ways,

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.540
new games that [Inaudible]
and it always nice

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.850
to see all the children
playing Mexican Bingo.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:23.980 position:56%
And even though all the pictures are
in Spanish, I can see the big smiles

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.220
at the same time, looking
at the picture.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.250
And that is culture for them, so --

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.950
and also for the tooth
fairy of Raton Perez,

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.450
at the end of the book children
say "Oh for my next one I would

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:43.420
like the little mouse
to come to my house".

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.390
And that is great for me because
a book they discover a new hero

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:53.560
or a new game, a new song.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.810
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I also like
-- we were talking earlier,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.410
we sat outside in the sunshine.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.110
We got here a little early
and you know Rene's books come

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.230
out in bilingual format often.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.270
And my books come out
in English editions

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.680
and Spanish editions,
right, they're separate.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.350
Some of its design and
we talked about the pros

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.430
and cons of that as well.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:18.050 position:56%
Because sometimes the role of books
for families that are multi-lingual.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.880
Where grandparents don't
speak the same language

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.980
as the parents, as the children.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.070
And so for me I feel a certain
urgency around making sure

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.720
that we have editions either
bilingual or dual language

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.130
so that families can rally around
story, that names their experience

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.450
but in the languages that
they're most comfortable with.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:44.890
And then I wanted to ask you
also sort of a difficult question

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:50.490
because certainly children are
not immune to what they see

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.810
on television, what they're hearing
in the news and the conversations

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:57.970
that are coming from the
lips of adults in the world.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:04.430
And so I'm -- I guess the question
I have for maybe Aisha, Rene,

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:11.390 position:56%
really anybody who -- what is the
role of books right now when we have

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.580
so many really ugly
characterizations

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.340
of immigrant children
or immigrant families?

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.040
So, I'm asking this
question because I know Aisha

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.100
for example you're
raising three sons.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.930
And what do you say?

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.830
You and I have talked about
this, you've expressed this

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:37.830
like there are moments of injury
and you've probably seen this

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:43.470
with your students where people
say really painful, awful things.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.020
What is the role of our
work to address that?

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.320
Is there a role?

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.710
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I think one
thing for me personally as a mom,

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.590
my oldest son he just started --

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.210
he's ending kindergarten
actually next week.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.160
But his first week of kindergarten
I had to pull him out just

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.360
after one week because
every single day

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.360 position:56%
from the first day he was bullied,
called racial slurs, religious slurs

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.180
by other fellow five year
olds and shoved to the ground.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.190
And I had to withdraw him and
take him to a safer place.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:16.440
And he is in a safer place
and he's thrived there.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.050
But you know the things that he was
saying, the children were saying,

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.120
the things that he came
home like started asking me

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.420
"How can I get lighter",
"Why is my skin this color"?

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.880
All these questions, you know
somebody taught them that.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.430
And I just feel like now more
than ever the role of teachers

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.480
and librarians and others that
come in contact with children

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.270
who are getting these messages
is to counter those messages

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.800
and the most powerful
way is through a book.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.880
And through you know, through
reading a book about another child

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.570
who they can suddenly relate to.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.150
Even though back home their parents
are teaching them certain things

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.450
and there are certain news stations

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.150
on telling them certain
things in the background.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.660 position:56%
They can read a book and say "Wait".

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.460
And so they may never
meet somebody like that

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.540
but that prejudice could
possibly be affected.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.670
And that's actually one of the
reasons that I started thinking

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.310
about writing picture books
sometime in the future just

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:09.370
because it is a very, very serious
issue and it's not just my son.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.270
It's happening -- the percentages
in California, they did a study

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.540
and I think it was
75% of Muslim teens

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.080
in high school have reported
bullying or harassment.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.520
75%. So it's a really big issue,
and I mean books alone can't do it

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.090
but I do think that they are a
powerful resource that gatekeepers,

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.110
librarians, teacher
can get in the hands

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.230
of children can potentially
make a difference.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.010
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Yeah
for example my student,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.800
their parents speak Spanish and
they are trying to speak English

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.550
and for many Spanish is not enough,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:47.670
Spanish is not good,
Spanish is not cool.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.010
They have to speak English because
everyone are speaking in English.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:59.980 position:56%
So I think -- I am writing books to
tell those children Spanish is good.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.520
You can speak English,
you can speak Spanish.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.700
You can play games in
English; you can play games

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.420
in Spanish; so that's my main goal.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.580
That's why I am writing
about equality.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.350
You can have tooth fairy
of course, was wonderful

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.980
but also you can Raton Perez.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:22.770
And also let's play football,
football can mean soccer in Spanish

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:27.160
and you can play football which
is Amirian football in Spanish

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.200
and even though football
is something,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.130
they are two different games and
you can have fun in both of them.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.430
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Can you
tell them a little bit

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.900
about my mother's an alien.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.510
This one cracked me up.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.450
I look at the cover
and I said oh it's sort

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.570
of a science fiction
story, what a new thing.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.020
And then Rene said to me "no".

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.350
Tell them --

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.280
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez:
That book is about Sophia

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.100 position:56%
and she has discovered a big secret.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.230
By accident she found out
a little card, mamas card

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.510
and mamas picture is in there
and also the word alien.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.790
So she believed that
her mother is an alien.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.270
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: You got to love it.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.340
You can't make this stuff up.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.580
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: When Sophia
asked "Mama is this really you;

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.710
is this a real card" and
Mama say "Of course it is.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.740
I always wanted this card.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:30.020
The day that I received this
card it was a wonderful day".

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.650
So Sophia now she really
believed that mom is an alien.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:41.020
And this is my new book
coming out in July.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:47.220
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And I think we are
almost, okay I have one minute

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.660
so I'm going to put this in.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.180
And so some of us publish
with large presses,

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.830
and some with small presses, right?

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.130
And so -- and for those of
you that don't' know Simon

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:03.340
and Schuster announced this year
Salam Reeds which is a new imprint

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.020
that deals with Muslim literature,
Muslim characters and so on;

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.820
so that seemed to me so
hopeful when I saw it

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.170
and we have Cinco Punto press.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.630
We have places that we go to,

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.360
but can you talk a little
bit about your experiences?

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.600 position:56%
Large press, small press, which has
been -- how has that worked for you?

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.050
Wendy I know that you
publish in a big --

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.350
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: Yeah
I'm with Scholastic.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.950
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: That's
as big as it gets.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.560
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: It is and
when I first saw it I was

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.260
like I don't have anything
to say about small presses.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.910
And then the last week I had the
pleasure of -- Kathy Crutcher.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.390
Is Kathy Crutcher here?

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:44.320
There's a woman who developed
a model where she partners

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.440
with local non-profits and
encourages kids to write

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.290
and publish their own stories
and they're beautifully done.

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.310
Nice everything and
they're fantastic looking.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.790
And then I was made aware

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.480
of the [Inaudible] has a
diverse minds book contest

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.780
where they encourage young people

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.290
to write stories incorporating
diversity.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.150
There is like a $5,000 first prize
and their stories get published.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.550
So, I'm not in it but I can
definitely see where it's coming

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.310
from and I'm supporting
them as best I can.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.360
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina; Last thoughts?

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.630
Okay I see the microphone coming
around, so here's the deal.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.010
If you have a question you
have to wait for the microphone

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:25.040
because you're being
recorded, no pressure.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.860
You're being recorded and
I really encourage you

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:34.850
to ask these wonderful people
anything that's on you reminds.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.180
So, questions?

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.380
Great. In the back.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.680
Hold on for the microphone.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.690
&gt;&gt; Hi, it's almost nice to
be here at this program.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.620 position:56%
But I have a couple questions,
first I'm a retired school librarian

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.310
so I'm always glad to meet authors.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.610
I'm also on the board

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.520
of the children's [Inaudible]
book awards program,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.820
children's illustrators.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.230
My question is mainly for Aisha or
anybody else who wants to answer.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:09.350
I really liked your comment where
you said that as you were growing

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.720
up you didn't know that you
should see yourself in books,

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.120
so you didn't really miss it.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.720
And another comment you mentioned
that you want your book treated

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.630
like any other books, well I grew
up in Washington D.C. and like you,

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.830 position:56%
I didn't really see myself in books.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.270
But it was okay, right?

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.240
And I think sometimes
those who don't know,

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.420
they say those poor
deprived children.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.350
How did they manage?

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.200
But the question then, and
it's for you or anybody else,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.730
how can we explain to people
that even though we didn't grow

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.620
up seeing ourselves, and
on another note I do want

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.500
to say there actually
were books written.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.860
For instance here in
Washington you can go

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.780
to Morlan's [Inaudible] Research
Center and just see books written

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.720
about African Americans from
beginning of time almost,

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.320
go to Alexandria and
Egypt but anyway,

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.120
the point is for the most part we
didn't see ourselves accurately.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.990
That's the other piece because
we might have seen the Tarzan,

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.600
the sambos and so on.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.170
But I guess it didn't
mean that much to us,

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:17.070
or you know we weren't
astute enough to be offended.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.370
So --

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.010
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well that's
changed; I'm here to tell you.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.600
&gt;&gt; Exactly, but I have to
say this, I was in a museum,

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.530
a school museum right in
Arlington a couple years ago

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:33.020
where they had a classroom set
up and they had some old books,

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.300
slid into the little wooden desks.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.060
And there actually was a little
black sambo book in there and I had

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.720
to bring it to the attention
of the director there.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:47.530 position:56%
But how do we explain to people the
history of how this has all evolved?

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.310
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I mean
for me personally just

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.820
because I didn't see
myself in a book,

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.070
and as a seven year old
wasn't bothered by it,

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.990
doesn't mean that it
wasn't a problem.

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.120
And I think just because I
didn't' see myself in a book,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.780
I still felt like the
other because of that.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.000 position:56%
I just didn't know how to articulate
it as a child or as a teenager.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.930 position:56%
But I did, when I would write my own
stories, because I loved to write,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.490
I never wrote about
Pakistani Americas ever

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.220
or Muslims because I never saw it.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.200
Like I said it was only until
college when I saw that book

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.500
and I then I started talking.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.530
I was a book seller briefly and
I talked to other book sellers

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.870
and they were like "No you should
write your stories if you want to"

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.280
and then I started doing it.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.870
So I think yeah, I mean I didn't
miss it because I didn't know

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.960
that I was -- I could have it.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.420
But I think I did --
I was deprived for it.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.340
My children do not have that
because there's Salam Reeds

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.640
and there's all these like --

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.540
and people are taking
chances on books now

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.840
that they weren't back then.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.530
And there are more
books being published.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.140
And I see my son, he
sees Kalmalah Hahn,

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.430
Ms. Marvel she's a Pakistani
American teenager and when I saw

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.600
that first edition I cried.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.670
My son was like "Okay
cool", that's neat.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.300
Because he has a library,
there's not enough in there,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.240
there should be more but he
has much more than I ever did.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.420
And so I think I see, I
see how it matters to him.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.550
I see how it helps him
feel like he belongs;

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.700
so yeah when people say it didn't
bother you then, it should have.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.620
I just didn't know
better like you said.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.900
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: I wonder
if it's the right question

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.560
to ask, were you harmed?

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.680
And maybe a better question
is what more could you do

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.260
if you saw yourself in books?

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.200
And you know how much more of
your potential could you reach

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.880
if you saw yourself as the hero in
the story and every other place?

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.360
&gt;&gt; If ever there was a year

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:39.330 position:56%
that proved post-racial society is
nowhere close it would be this year.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:42.670
But I'm doing exit interviews
with students right now

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.730
and for the first time ever
I'm asking them to identify --

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.420
I always ask for demographics.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.850
Please give me your
race or ethnicity.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.190
This year quite a number of them
are calling themselves Americans

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.130
and it does have me thinking,

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.710
what does a post-racial society
actually look like for the young?

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:07.090
And how long do you think it's
going to take us to get there?

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:08.960
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I'm so
glad I'm the moderator.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.910
What do you think guys.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.530
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: You
know you meet people

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:25.960
and it's like I don't see race.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.260
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: But they do.

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.640
&gt;&gt; Wendy Shang: First of all
that's a very privileged thing

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.410
to be able to say.

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:35.500
Because that means -- whether
or not you choose to see people,

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.480
doesn't affect how
other people get seen.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.810
And I think we're kind
of reaching --

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:47.730
we see, let's talk about
it and you want a timeline?

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think the big lapse
also is what's really difficult

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.020
of course when you have
conversations that deal

00:51:54.020 --> 00:52:00.010
with people's perceptions in
books, around race and so on.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.880
Is that any conversation
surrounding race

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.420
in the United States
is a very delicate one.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:11.680
And it comes against a really
complicated and painful context.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.220
And so everyone gets worked up.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:18.530
It is hard on both ends.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:25.790
It's hard to be on the receiving
end of something and pointed out

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.490
and have people say
"That's not what I meant.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.840
I didn't mean to injure you.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.230
I'm not racist", but
those kinds of things.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.650
It's a hard conversation and
I find myself sometimes moving

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:41.680
through the world with like
this little invisible plaque

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.770
over my head, "I come in peace".

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.940 position:56%
that's really what I'm trying to do.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.590
I'm trying to make people feel
comfortable at the same time

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:56.420
that I'm telling them the
truth of what's happening.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:04.210
I also -- I looked at my
World Book Encyclopedia Child,

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.090
remember those, if you're old.

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:10.820
You remember, I had a set of
those and my favorite was volume 9

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.640
and anyway I looked through
it recently because I have it

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.260
and there's not a single child
of color, any color on the pages.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:24.270
And it was my favorite
book and I wasn't there.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.040
I don't know what it's
going to look like.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.470
I think that right now sometimes
I worry that when people dive into

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.630
"I'm American, I don't see color".

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:39.400
I think that is a very
telling statement,

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.440
and a worrisome statement.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.210
Because if your eyes work
you do, in fact see color.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:49.270
You do in fact see
what people look like.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:55.250 position:56%
The real question is what do you see
here and here in your heart in terms

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.370
of how you interpret and embrace.

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:08.680
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you guys.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.690
Okay reviews have started
naming race

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:15.580
in their reviews, have
you seen them?

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.030
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I saw
one and I was so --

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:18.800
I sat there and just stared at it.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.600
I was like "Wait, what"?

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:32.080
[ Cross talking ]

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.800
&gt;&gt; So I actually read one of the
reviews and it went out of its way

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.690
to call out the White characters.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.990
The White character,
the white character.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:42.810
I started laughing really hard
because I was so unused to it.

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:45.800
What do you guys think
about that now?

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.360
&gt;&gt; Aisha Saeed: I was like
you, I started laughing.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.270
So I need to process
it a little bit more.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.880
I think it's great because it is --

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.030
that's my initial reaction,
that it's great.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.570
If you feel the need to point
out in the story about basketball

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.580 position:56%
that the main character is -- the
whole story is all about basketball,

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.860
you need to point out that the
main character is a certain race,

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.160
other than White.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.630
Then why not point out
that they are White?

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:13.190
I think fair is fair,
but like you it really --

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:18.720
it made me laugh and it stayed
with me and that's kind of telling

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.010
that it stayed with me so much,
just for the fact that they named

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:25.340
who the main character
was, it was interesting.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.080
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Zunon: I have a
little anecdote to do with that.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.280
My mother is White, my father
is Black and when I was applying

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.230
to college I refused to check
only one box and I refused

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:37.660
to check the other box for race.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:43.950
So I always checked white and
the box for the white and black.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:50.050
And I got into school
and the -- after my --

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.260
the end of my junior
year in college I needed

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.420
to find a new work study
job so I applied to work

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:59.250
at the multi-cultural
affairs office at my college.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.370 position:56%
And when I showed up there they
said "Well we've never heard of you,

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.670
how long have you been
at this school"?

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.480
I said "I've been at this
school for three years,

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.180
I'm about to be a senior".

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.610
And so they looked in their
paperwork, because they had a list

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:14.640
of all of the students of
color attending the school.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.600 position:56%
And when they found my name they saw
that next to my name it said "White"

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.790
and they all started to laugh.

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.740
Like "ha, ha, ha Liz,
we've never heard of you

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.350
because you've been
White for three years

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.350
and you're just showing
up here now".

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.920
And then I thought yeah
it's funny because according

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.920
to the school I am
white, but if you look

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.310
at me maybe you don't see white.

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:38.590
As far as my DNA I'm equally
white than I am black.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:42.230
So should we be laughing at the
fact that "Oh Liz is white".

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:47.380
It was a very weird feeling.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.090
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Yeah many
people think that I am Filipino

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.220
and one time I was speaking
with this person in English

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.570
and finally I started
talking in Spanish

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:00.400
and he said hable es Spanish?

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.160
I thought you were
from the Philippines.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.270
And that's Latino, we have
all the colors of the world.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.000
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: That's the biggest
misconception of Latino culture

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.100
because we come across every race.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:22.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, Roxanna with First
Book and I just want

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.390
to say what a pleasure it is
to actually use your books

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:30.360 position:56%
for family engagement opportunities.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.100
It's one of the things
that educators

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.530
from our networks say all
the time that you know how

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:39.900
to actually use a book in a
way that it brings conversation

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.130
that is extended from the
classroom into the home.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:46.500
And I know for a fact that
your books have done that,

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.130
so just really wanted to
say thank you for your work.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.080
&gt;&gt; Yes. Hi thank you, it's
been a wonderful conversation.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.500
I am also with the schools, with
family and community engagement

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.150
and the experience with many
programs and always looking

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:15.670
for books that bring
interesting perspectives on race

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.000
and culture and gender as well.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.670
And what I find myself
sometimes struggling

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.910
and a little bit turned off and now
I'm more hesitant is there seems

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:29.990
to be a tendency among writers
of those books to choose topics

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:35.090
that are real topics,
like poverty or racism

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:40.710
or even historical situations in
the past in which I have found

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:45.880
when you read them to kids, I find
myself torn a little problematic

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:50.980
because they are in a
sense kids that define

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:53.500
with those characters,
they are embarrassed.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.160
For example you have a book
with something about Mexico,

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.670
just inventing something here.

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:02.440
And then you see all the little
Mexican kids without shoes

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.720
and you know really ugly looking
parents who are very poor,

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:12.710
or things like that and it's a real
kind of embarrassment for them.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:15.170
Or the same when you
deal with certain issues

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:17.700
about slavery and things like that.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.360
So I'm curious about
your thoughts about that.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.930 position:56%
Because I'm always looking for books
that affirm kids and especially

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.120
when they are in elementary
school, I think with middle school,

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.240
high school is a different thing

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.820
because we can have
more deep conversations

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.800
about races, inequality, injustice.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.610
And I do go there with
elementary kids,

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.690
it's not that I'm avoiding the
topic, but I am trying to look

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:48.770
for those other books that
you know create a sense

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.380
of empowerment of kids and hope.

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.570 position:56%
So I'm curious to hear your thoughts
and if you have struggled with that

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:57.240
when you choose your
topics for your stories

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:02.000
and what's your reaction to that?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.590
&gt;&gt; Rene Colato Lainez: Yeah
for me it's to be authentic.

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:09.840 position:56%
When I am writing a story I focus on
the positive in the authentic way.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.860
Because if I want to talk about
Mexican I don't have to talk

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.530
about their sombreros or
singing and eating tacos.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:22.170
There are many wonderful
things to talk about Mexico.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:26.350
And also in my country El
Salvador, so I go for the positive.

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:31.580 position:56%
I see that the positive and the
authentic is the most powerful thing

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:39.520
to talk about for children to
love their culture and language.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.640
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And also where
you're picking the books.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:50.450
So you know Los Americas award
winners, [Inaudible] Asian Pacific,

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:54.440
literature winners, I think
you want the best examples

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.950
because when books are selected

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:59.820
for those lists sometimes I
think those questions come up.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.790
Does this book authentically
portray the experience

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.250
but also respectfully
portray the experience?

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:13.150 position:56%
I write about folks often families
who are from moderate to low income,

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:18.130 position:56%
but I think respectfully and in a
way that doesn't show them as broken

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:20.880
or excessive suffering and so on.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.920
I think it's developing a pallet

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.900
for where you're searching
for those books.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.950 position:56%
And I'm always encourage when people
are looking for them and I ask you

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:32.050
to continue to ask your
librarians and your book sellers.

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:36.260
Exert that sort of pressure; I
don't know if you feel that way.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:41.590
Your request of that material and
your conversation at that level

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:45.250
with your local librarian
is important, it's essential

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.450
because it raises their
awareness and cues them

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:52.260
into the developing conversation.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.770
Because the conversation is
getting more interesting,

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:57.960
it is getting more sophisticated.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.720
We are not just thankful
that anything is published.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.170
We're really holding things
to higher standards now.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:11.380
I was going to say I
think that's the --

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.830
&gt;&gt; If there's one last question.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:19.760
&gt;&gt; I was waiting, which I don't
do very well, so this is good.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.700
A question and again more
of a comment and gratitude.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.790 position:56%
Having worked with a large
diversity population from homogenous

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:32.250
to elite private school and
now I'm at a large urban school

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.190
in Northern Virginia, probably
one of the most diverse

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:36.310
in Northern Virginia
if not in the country

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:39.550
and having a large
number of immigrants.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:42.470
Read aside and students not reading

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.190
for pleasure is a whole other
panel we could spend several days

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:46.490
discussing that.

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:48.250
But getting books in their
hands that make sense.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:51.480
Students have lost the
ability to hear their own voice

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.790 position:56%
or to hear other voices in books
and they don't know what those sound

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.590
like and with those varying
characters look like,

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:57.920
we have to teach that.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.870
And so when a student picks
up a book and they can read

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.930
about a character that's like
them and like their background,

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.860
it's critical to engaging them.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.000
So keep doing what you're
doing and thank you.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:13.450
[ Applause ]

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:17.100

presentation of the Library
