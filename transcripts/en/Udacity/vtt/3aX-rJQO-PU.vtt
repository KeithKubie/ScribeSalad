00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.010
So, when an investor is considering
a particular hedge fund,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.480
they want to know,
what are the goals for the hedge fund?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.800
And they'll also want to know
the results of certain metrics.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.150
Let's take a look at goals first.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.750
Now, you might say, of course,
my goal is to make money.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.750
Well, it's a little bit finer than that,
or a little bit more subtle than that.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.200
There are, of course,
other potential goals, but

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.020
these two are the primary types of
goals that hedge funds go after.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.960
One type is to beat a benchmark.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.580
What does that mean?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.850
Let's suppose, for instance, that you've
got a strategy that looks at the stocks

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.945
that are in the S&amp;P 500,
there's 500 of them of course and

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.310
you're especially smart at
picking out the good ones.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.172
So you might build a hedge fund
who's goal is to beat the S&amp;P

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:59.420
500 index as a benchmark because
you're wise at selecting

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.490
among all those,
which stocks are going to outperform?

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.010
And, of course, the over all index has
the good stocks and the bad stocks,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.030
so you're going to do better because
you picked the specific good ones.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.653
An important component of
the benchmark model is

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:21.390
that many benchmarks,
like the stock market as a whole, for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.460
which S&amp;P 500 is a good representative,
go down.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
And it is of course natural
that a portfolio consisted of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.180
stocks from this index
might go down as well.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.470
So, even though both the index and
the fund go down,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.750
you can outperform the index
by going down less.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.160
So, this kind of fund that is
tagged against a benchmark

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.670
can still meet performance
goals if it goes down.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.410
So long as that index
is going down more.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.870
That brings us to absolute return funds.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.550
Their goal is to provide
positive return no matter what.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.330
These funds are usually long/short,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.770
which means they make positive bets in
stocks they think are going to go up.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.050
And they make negative bets in
stocks are going to go down.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.670
We'll talk about shorting
a little bit later.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180
In any case there objective is to make

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.580
slow gradual positive
return no matter what.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.560
Often, these types of funds don't
make the same percentage gains

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.550
as the beat a benchmark fund, but
they have very low draw downs.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.030
In other words, when the market
takes a bit hit, they often don't.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.430
The next question is well,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.060
how do we measure how well that
fund is meeting those goals?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.190
We talked about these
metrics in the mini course

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.700
manipulating financial data in Python,
but

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.460
we'll repeat it just a little bit here
to remind you, and also to bring those

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.410
folks up to speed who didn't
necessarily have the previous course.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.520
Cumulative return is a measure of,
given the funds I started with,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.680
how much more did I end up with
after a certain amount of time?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.240
So suppose we have and
in the array of values of our portfolio,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.630
where zero is the first value, and
minus one is the very last one.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.170
We can easily compute cumulative
return by dividing that last value

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.280
by the first value and subtracting one.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.840
So for instance if we made 20% over
a year this would end up being 0.2.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.850
Volatility is a measure of how
rapidly and aggressively the portfolio

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.830
goes up and down in value and
of course lower volatility is better.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.380
Volatility is simply measured as
the standard deviation of daily returns.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.670
Our last factor here which is a measure
of the ratio of risk to reward is

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.500
typically measure using sharp ratio, and
the sharp ratio is calculated like this.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.980
Sharp ratio is also sometimes
called risk adjusted reward.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.070
So, you can consider that to
be reward divided by risk.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.690
A reward is our average,
daily return minus the risk-free rate.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.120
And our risk is simply a measure of that
standard deviation of daily returns or

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.630
volatility.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.490
We multiply that ratio by
the square root of 252.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.640
That is how many trading
days there are in a year and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.940
remember we're always
working with daily returns.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.270
So that's why we use this 252 number.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.450
So recapping, hedge funds have goals,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.400
typically either to meet a particular
bench mark or to gain absolute return.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.580
And then metrics by which we judge
how well they accomplish those goals.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.050
So, cumulative return, how much do
they make over a period of time?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.900
Volatility, how volatile
were they over that time?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.420
And then risk adjusted reward or
sharp ratio.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.612
One thing I want to mention before
I leave this topic with regard to

00:05:09.612 --> 00:05:14.990
benchmarks is the benchmark you choose
should depend on the expertise you have.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.260
So let's suppose you're
an expert in Eastern Europe.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.970
And you're great at picking stocks in
emerging markets in Eastern Europe.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.910
You should select some
benchmark that represents

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.990
that similar kind of investing.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.750
And there are indexes that represent
emerging markets in eastern Europe.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.440
There are also other funds who's
values you might use as a benchmark or

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.190
let's say your expertise is in banks.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.730
You might choose an index for
the banking industry and

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.750
show that you can beat that.
