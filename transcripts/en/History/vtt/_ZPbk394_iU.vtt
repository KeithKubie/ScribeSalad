00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.710
[music playing]

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.210
[airplane engine]

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.120
RICHARD DOLAN: October 1, 1948,
you have an experienced World

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.040
War II pilot named
George Gorman, who's

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.040
out near Fargo, North Dakota.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.670
He's flying a P-51 Mustang.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.460
And as he's coming
back toward the base,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.210
he sees this light
in the distance that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.000
very rapidly zooms toward him.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.420
And what ensues for the
next 27 to 30 minutes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.830
is what we can only
call a dogfight.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.670
JACQUES VALLEE: This
was one of the earliest

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.170
pilot cases that were well
described, well observed.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.040
RICHARD DOLAN: What's also
interesting is that the Air

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670
Force investigative
project, which back then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.920
was called Project Sign--

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.000
this is 1948-- did
send investigators

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.750
out there to look into it.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.380
J Allen Hynek, who's a
professional astronomer

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.420
with very excellent
scientific credentials.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420
He was working at
Ohio State University

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.290
and was contracted starting in
1948 to work with the Air Force

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.540
to provide astronomical
explanations for some

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210
of their flying saucer reports.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.920
PAUL HYNEK: My father
loved Air Force pilots,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.250
because he said, how can the
Air Force deny reports by people

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.250
that they themselves trained?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.920
RICHARD DOLAN: Years
later, a drawing

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.580
that Gorman made of the
encounter was declassified.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.750
And it shows you've got an
experienced, seasoned World War

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.750
II fighter pilot, who's dealing
with a light phenomenon that

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.460
is clearly outperforming
his aircraft.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.290
You've got a lot of witnesses
seeing this, one in the air--

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.580
another pilot--

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.790
and a number of
people on the ground,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.120
including air
traffic controllers.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.330
And it's a somewhat
mystifying event.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.460
JACQUES VALLEE: The Air
Force ended up explaining it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.920
as a combination of
looking at planet

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.790
Jupiter and a weather
balloon, which in retrospect,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.750
does not make any sense.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.670
And Hynek was very skeptical
of that explanation.
