00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.440
This app was built using the animate
camera method that you saw in

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.930
the previous video.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.450
Note that it has three buttons,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.890
just like in a previous
application that you built, and

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.570
each of these buttons animates map
movement to a different location.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.410
So, for example, I'm now looking
at a map of the United States, but

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.610
if I tap on Seattle you see
the camera is going to animate.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.260
As I zoom into Seattle,
taking a few seconds to do so.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.390
It's a really cool effect.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.861
So once I'm in on Seattle, there you
can see some of Seattle, including,

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.522
you can even see here an indoor map of
the Pacific Science Center in Seattle.

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.289
I can for example then touch on Tokyo.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.076
And you'll see I'll fly up and
out into orbit, and

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:44.700
then back down over the Pacific
until I land on Tokyo, like so.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.248
And again,
you can see I'm now in downtown Tokyo.

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:50.545
And if I so desire,
I can also go to Dublin.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:53.878
Now here there's a case of I haven't
pre-cached some of these tiles, so

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:56.840
you're just seeing blank
as it's flying over.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.990
And it'll soon land on Dublin.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.900
So if I zoom out of Dublin, you can
see those tiles are getting cached.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.190
So none of these tiles were
pre-cached for testing the video,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.200
and that's why we couldn't see
when we flew from Tokyo to Dublin.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.210
If I just zoom out and
effectively cache the tiles,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.700
I'm not doing anything
myself to cache them.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.410
This is just how
the application is running.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.410
And so the map fragment itself
will cache the tiles for you.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.051
So here you can see Japan, and
if I go back somewhere over Ireland and

00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:33.366
now I tap on Tokyo, you'll see
that the orbit will change, and

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.332
I'll drop down onto Tokyo.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.173
And now if I try to go to Dublin,
you'll see I fly out of Japan,

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.701
up over the surface of the Earth,
over Asia, over China,

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.600
back over western Europe before
dropping down and onto Dublin.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.500
So you know have everything you need
to build this application yourself.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.670
You've all the tools.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.370
Why don't you give it a shot?

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.070
If you have any trouble, the source
code is linked to the speaker nodes.
