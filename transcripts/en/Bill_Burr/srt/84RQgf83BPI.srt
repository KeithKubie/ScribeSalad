00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's
time for the Monday morning podcast. I no,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,120
what is it? What am I talking about?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,950
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,310
Huh. Huh? I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm just checking in to see
how your Goddamn Day is going.

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:26,220
I know lately the podcast has been
a little bit quiet. I understand.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,023
All right.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,550
I was transitioning from one part of the
country to another part of the country.

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:36,540
I didn't have my,
my technologies with me.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,250
Uh,

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,300
speaking of technology now these fucking
movies that I want to see right now and

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,870
I just don't have the God damn time.
I want to see that Mr. Rogers movie.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I want to see mission
impossible and I want to see a,

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,970
there was some movie called
eighth grade where they were like,

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,920
this is what it's like to
be an eighth grader in the,

16
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,950
during the social media time.
I'm like, oh, I should see that.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,750
You know, cause I need to relate
to some sorts, Pete young people.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,740
So my jokes keep working with them. I
mean, not eighth graders, but you know,

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,430
in a blink of an eye, the way I'm aging,
that kid will be in fucking college,

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,040
right? You can't ignore the
youth, the ignore the you,

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,730
you grow old with your fucking crowd.
And then next thing you know,

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,380
you're doing shows at three in the
afternoon on a little fucking booze cruise

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,980
going around the marina,
you know,

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,510
five foot two wiser blue,
but oh,

25
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,970
what those five foots could do you singing
that song. Hey had a body, Shane mind.

26
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,571
Yeah,

27
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:40,571
right up there in some fucking mustard
stain tuxedos yelling at your agent

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,370
players to sell tickets at this town.
They ain't happen to make.

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,650
Um,
I'll tell you what did happen to me.

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,600
This is very embarrassing and
it's of a physical nature.

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,580
It's a part of my body.

32
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,610
And this is a time when I feel
everybody has been emoting and,

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,780
and we've gotten rid of the shame. So I
just wanted it. Before I tell you this,

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,460
I just want to thank all of you

35
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:14,010
for being considerate and thoughtful of
my feelings during this difficult time.

36
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,350
All right. So my, my
sciatic nerves came back.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,530
Oh, it came back with a vengeance because
I didn't keep going to them as suits to

38
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:28,000
keep fucking making sure
you know, that, you know,

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,970
whatever the fuck happened the first
time didn't happen again and it got all

40
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,410
messed up again.
And uh,

41
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,130
we were trying to figure out what
triggers it and I'm like, well,

42
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:41,080
flying helicopters, you know, I fly
the smallest one that exists, so this,

43
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,090
there's nothing about it that's has to
do with comfort and all has to do with

44
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,250
weight and balance and get in
the fucking thing off the ground.

45
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,090
As long as you can sit down, they don't
give a shit if you're on a bed of nails.

46
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,390
And I think it's just maybe that, that's
what's aggravating it. She's like,

47
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,630
all right, what else you got? I played
drums. I'll sit there for an hour,

48
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:02,290
an hour and a trying to figure out how
that cute little Asian girl played good

49
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:06,490
times, bad times, so
easily, effortlessly, right.

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,200
What else do I sit in a writer's room?
I fly in planes and all that type of shit.

51
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,710
And she goes, all right.
And she was listening to and
she just basically told me

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,880
and, uh, you know, debt. My problem is,

53
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,380
is I have no ass

54
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,010
all over the years.
I've just sat down so long,

55
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,980
what little ass I had is now gone.

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,720
So a bill, Billy, no
Goop, no glucose, right?

57
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,580
Is Al Pachino would say he's got no ass.
Right?

58
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,560
So it's just,

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,480
it's just essentially
bones, nerves, veins,

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,550
atoris in skin.
There's no muscle tone back there.

61
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,690
I basically have Michael Douglas's ass
in basic instinct, whatever that one was,

62
00:03:56,691 --> 00:04:00,490
where he was like fucking 65
and decided to do the yet.

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,810
Remember that was like a big thing
with like white guys back then,

64
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,930
be it happy in an old guy and just
showing your ass Dennis Franz on fucking

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,550
Nyp de Bleu, fucking, uh, Michael Douglas

66
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,980
and basic end state,

67
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,440
one of those movies where he was
just fucking throw in chicks around,

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,360
which you could never do anymore.
Like it was,

69
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,120
he was beating them and
fucking them at the same time.

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,420
And I'll tell you the bride's
back in the day, they loved it.

71
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,100
It was considered a hot seat.
Now a days off. Oh Jesus.

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,180
What was that couch made
of? Dead. He bent her over.

73
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:37,530
Was that fucking made of ostrich for

74
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,320
that's offensive to women in nature,
right?

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,660
Yeah.

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,920
Now I don't know what you do.
I don't know.

77
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,290
I haven't seen a love seat
in this new progressive time.

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,340
I imagine the guy is sitting
there with his hands folded

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,310
Eq skills base.
Would it be alright if I

80
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,900
leaned across the table and got
a little closer? Do you? Hi,

81
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm offended. Um, anyways, what
am I talking about here? Oh,

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,650
so I have to do some fucking squats,
you know,

83
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,350
and I got a bone bruise. I'm
falling apart here. People.

84
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:20,000
I've got a bone bruise on my left knee
because, uh, my beautiful daughter,

85
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,160
or I'm loving as I'm teaching
her how to play catch.

86
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:25,070
And we got this giant bag of
these plastic balls, right?

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,070
And I think she's right handed,
which I'm not gonna lie to you.

88
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,900
I want her to be a lefty.
You're a lefty.

89
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,320
You can get to the show with an 85 mile
an hour fast ball. We all know it. Okay?

90
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,600
You start throwing right handed.
You gotta come with the guests.

91
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,590
It's gotta be fuck it.
I don't know.

92
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,060
It's gotta be like fucking 102 miles an
hour at this point. So anyways, she just,

93
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,070
she'll pick up two at a time and then
she runs at me and just throws them both

94
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:46,940
at the same time.

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,010
And I just play like goalie and we got
hard wood floors and I was crawling

96
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:56,300
around on the hardwood on
my knees and uh, I dunno. I,

97
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,090
I thought I fucking towards something,
but thank God.

98
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:03,800
Yesterday I found out it's just a bone
bruise so it's going away. But um,

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,170
yeah, so here's a big deal. I got it.

100
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,850
I have to go on the Internet and I got
to make sure I do my squats right. Okay.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,070
And I have to get my pasty flat ass.
I gotta get some padding back.

102
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,130
There are, evidently this is going
to, it's going to become even worse.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,790
You know what I mean? I've decided
that I'm going to get fucking, uh,

104
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,030
um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ass back.

105
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,090
I've decided that rather than be that
old white guy who has the inflatable

106
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:36,840
cushion that he fucking sits on,
I can't be that guy.

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,790
You know what I mean?
Taking people up in a helicopter,

108
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,370
like looking like a Badass,
like, hang on a second, guys

109
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,950
just fucking may know.
Everybody just loses all confidence.

110
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,550
Does this guy know how to
fly this fucking thing? Um,

111
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,030
anyways, uh, that's my deal. You know,

112
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,910
and I'm also a child of the 80s
and you know who's kidding who?

113
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:02,660
Let's all be honest.

114
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,720
Nobody did legs in the fucking
eighties unless she wrote bodybuilder.

115
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,760
Everybody just, you barely
even did your back. You know,

116
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,780
everybody was just fucking, everybody
just did like, what are your benching?

117
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,370
What's your bent?
Dodi put up to 25 fucking 36 times.

118
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,270
Yeah.

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,660
Kay could try out for the
patch stowed. Right. That's
all it was about. And it was,

120
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,920
I'll tell you, you go to
a fucking gym, all right?

121
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,230
And if you have to bench,

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,410
if you're waiting for the [inaudible]
going to stand there like a line at

123
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,590
Starbucks at like eight in the fucking
morning waiting to get on the bench.

124
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,430
But I'll tell you where there's no
fucking, I'll tell you right now with,

125
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,710
there's no line. You go into
the leg room. Oh my God.

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,820
It's like walking into a furniture
store. Go ahead buddy. Try them all out.

127
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,430
See which one you like.
Right?

128
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,080
It's like going into lightened leisure.
The purple building.

129
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,860
Does that play still exist?
Um,

130
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,930
I'm making a lot of Boston references
and you probably like, why bill?

131
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,400
Are you a Ho? Oh, you fucking cunt.

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,750
The battery thing just fucking beat. Are
you fucking kidding me? I swear to God.

133
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,120
I just can't get a God damn fucking break.

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,340
I'm just going to talk to, this
runs out, I guess in 43 seconds.

135
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:27,420
42 seconds.
I'm talking Boston ship because the uh,

136
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:31,410
the Yankees, oh, when
they're Yankees come to town.

137
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,980
The Red Sox Yankees stats tonight
and prices and in judges out,

138
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:40,950
right?

139
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,130
But all they're missing is a hitter
were mentioned missing our star pitcher.

140
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,540
And I needed that guy cause I got,

141
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,750
I got a hundred bucks riding on every
game with these two different Yankee fans.

142
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:52,560
50 bucks each. I need a price to go
in there and shut those fucking pin.

143
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,540
Stripe comes down.
Now we don't have our and and uh,

144
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,450
not price with the fuck am I talking
about? Uh, the other guy, their prices.

145
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,090
The Guy I need not to fuck up. All
right, I'm back. You know what?

146
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,740
It wasn't a battery issue.
It was,

147
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:14,320
the memory was full full of me running
my fucking Yap. I'm sitting there saying,

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,660
prices out a sale is out.
Is it Chris Sale?

149
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,770
I've only been on the bandwagon
here for the last month. He's out.

150
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,120
He said he had something that's been
building something that's been bothering

151
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:30,710
him. You know what'd
you get your period? Um,

152
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:35,080
he can't play fucking a Mike Judge.

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,830
Aaron judge is out for the Yankees,
right?

154
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,380
He's standing there like a
fucking Paul Bunyan. I mean,

155
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,380
how do you not hit the
guy? I mean, Jesus Christ,

156
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,490
he's like the size of
the goddamned backstop,

157
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,940
got a bone chip in the palm of his hand.

158
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,520
He's an amazing a guy
that that fucking pig,

159
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,490
all you have to do is throw ball in his
hands and all of a sudden he can't play

160
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,140
a game of baseball.
I mean,

161
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:58,720
you're talking about a guy who could
literally rip the pillars out of the

162
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:03,010
fucking parking lot, you know, but then
you hit him in the hand. He's like,

163
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:07,450
how am I going to play Patty cake?
I can't come out for the red sox series,

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,630
but you know, that is the history of
the Yankees. You know what I mean?

165
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,080
You know, they got a lot of free agent
guys and they're all really soft,

166
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,230
just like a,
all their fans out in the bleachers.

167
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,650
All those fatties out there
that do the roll call.

168
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,390
Like that's the big thing in life

169
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,350
fe area and wave at us,

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,820
those neck fat fucking
jerk offs out there. Um,

171
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,380
it's unbelievable that you can have a
team that, that's, that's successful,

172
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:43,720
that they would, they would, uh,
be involved in something. Well,

173
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:46,390
I just don't get it.
I don't get the fucking why MCA.

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,300
I don't get why we have a fucking mascot.

175
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,330
I don't get why we sing sweet Caroline.
I don't,

176
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,300
you know what it is that they're
trying to get rid of the animals.

177
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,580
You know what I mean? I
mean, the Yankees fence,

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
they borderline doing a fucking musical.

179
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,380
I thought it was an
advertisement for that.

180
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:06,640
What was that show they
had all those years? Uh,

181
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,680
with the puppets avenue Q.
That's what I thought it was.

182
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:13,310
I was looking at the scoreboard.
Guns are coming out of that. No,

183
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:17,500
those are full grown adult males.
A tow yard.

184
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,230
We'll you fuckers by fuel. Would you
roll call lunch. I got to charge up.

185
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,760
Get aligned.

186
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,060
We're going to say your name
until you acknowledge us.

187
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,670
And I know I'm coming down
hard on the Yankee fence.

188
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:35,410
I realized this is not all of you guys.
This is he fucking 12% of you, um,

189
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,040
with your little gang of baseball fans.

190
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,930
But as much as I do that,

191
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:47,770
I don't think anything's worse than
watch should fucking do, but do

192
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:49,750
Buddo Dubar too.

193
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,690
When that song comes on and you see all
those women putting their head on their

194
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,123
boyfriend,

195
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,703
you know what I mean?

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,600
That right there,

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
that moment there is why women in
general are not in positions of power.

198
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,960
They sit there,
they try to blame guys specifically bald,

199
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,850
blue eyed white males like myself, which
by the way, I'm really offended. Okay.

200
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,710
I mean,
and I got to tell you something right now.

201
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,100
If I hear one more feminist interrupting
my privilege during the day,

202
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,380
me just walking through one open door
after another and I have to listen to her

203
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:30,000
fucking rhetoric. I swear
to God I am. I am going to,

204
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I will pull all of my money out of the
stock market and cause it to crash money

205
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:40,791
that I didn't earn money that was given
to me from my ancestors by stealing it

206
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,830
from people who did not look like me.
Okay.

207
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,290
Sorry,
I'm just steering into the stereotype.

208
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,933
MMM.

209
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,680
Oh really? Bill, we thought
you were fucking serious. Uh,

210
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,980
what am I talking about here?
This is why women,

211
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,660
so many of them do not attain a position
of power because all you have to do is

212
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:05,990
put on sweet Caroline and it makes them
want to tilt their head and put it on

213
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,580
their man's shoulder. Okay?
That is not leadership quality.

214
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,173
Okay?

215
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,930
That's just what the fuck I would do if
I was running a company right now and

216
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,980
God knows it be all this fucking pressure
as the guy who started the company to

217
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:25,240
step aside and let a woman run it
so you can act like you're fucking

218
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:27,250
progressive.
You know what I mean?

219
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,730
Where are the ladies when
it's all being built?

220
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,900
They're nowhere to be found
then when it's built, we want it

221
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,820
now that you completed it.

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,720
We want to fly planes too.

223
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,200
Now that all the guys died and we
figured out what not to fucking dope.

224
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,290
No offense to Amelia Earhart, the chick
that fucking, uh, also crushed it,

225
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,020
but for some reason nobody talks about it.

226
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,843
MMM.

227
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,250
I want to talking about,
I'm just fucking around everybody.

228
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,620
I have no problem with people of
Eddie. Fuck it back. [inaudible] but,

229
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,610
um, where am I? Let me, uh,
let me, let me complete this.

230
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,410
I have to do a fucking radio tour for
two hours starting at eight minutes.

231
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,000
And how long have I done in the podcast?

232
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,950
Is it going to work out
with a math workout?

233
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,930
Nine and five or 14 son of a bitch.
I still got half a podcast to go.

234
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,660
I'm gonna have to wait till the
end of this shit. Um, Oh bill,

235
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:30,500
why are you doing a radio tour?
Because I'm promoting rough and rowdy

236
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,510
going to be in Youngstown,
Ohio. All right.

237
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,000
There's no women. They're putting
their heads on their guy's shoulder.

238
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,840
They put their head in their ear to the
guy's chest after they hit him with a

239
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,480
fucking pen and make sure it's
fucking heart's still pumping. Okay.

240
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,710
I'm talking a tough town and Youngstown.
It's going to be great.

241
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,310
We got pride verse prejudiced.
All right.

242
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,410
We have a gay man who's
fighting a convicted felon
who does not like gay people.

243
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:58,881
All right?

244
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:03,200
We got a cop fighting a skateboarder
and then we've got a bunch of Cleveland

245
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,720
Brown fans getting in the ring
with Pittsburgh Steeler fans. Now,

246
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,620
God knows the browns cannot beat
the Steelers on the grid iron,

247
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,240
but can the people of Cleveland
beat up the people of Pittsburgh?

248
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,980
Now you'd think generally speaking,

249
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,940
the people of Pittsburgh are a little
softer than the people in Cleveland.

250
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,040
All right?
They have six super bowl titles.

251
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,480
They haven't had a fucking steel
mill in generations out there. Okay,

252
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,800
I've gone there. It's a
tech city now. All right?

253
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,130
They got all the beautiful bridges.
They got rid of three rivers.

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,090
That team plays on natural grass now.
I mean,

255
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,700
it's one of the quaintness
towns you'll ever go to.

256
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,720
Nobody can walk up this fucking hill.

257
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,830
So they've got a goddamn elevator
trolley thing that brings you up.

258
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,740
I think Pittsburgh is ripe for the taking

259
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,520
and uh, go to rough and rowdy
brawl to order the fight.
I'm telling you right now,

260
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,480
hang with your recorded or hanging
that night with your buddies. Watch it.

261
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:04,160
It's going to be, I will be
commentating. Forgot to mention that.

262
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,440
That says a little cherry in
there that I just throw. Okay.

263
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,900
A little fucking sugar cube. Oh, freckles.

264
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,920
We'll be sitting down on his
lack of an ass evidently. And uh,

265
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,670
I'll be there with the big
cat in the El Pres. Uh,

266
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,990
two wonderful individuals, you know,
who are preventing a lot of bar fights.

267
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,460
I feel, I feel like, um,

268
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,040
people with headgear and gloves are
going to be able to get all their

269
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,610
frustrations out. It's going to be
a wonderful night of entertainment.

270
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,530
I am not going to miss a
second of it. And um, you know,

271
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,200
I would appreciate if
you guys would order it.

272
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,840
It would make me look good if I could
help pump up their fucking numbers.

273
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:42,810
I love what they do over there.
I hope you do too. If you do,

274
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:46,380
please order the fight and that's the
end of this promo. How do you like that?

275
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,400
And right the day before the fucking
fight, I'm going to be in Rochester,

276
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:51,980
New York home,
Steve Gadd,

277
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,590
or at least he played with the
Rochester Crusaders according to his,

278
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,740
according to his drum instructional video
of that I actually own on VHS and on

279
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:05,370
DVD. All right. I never could
commit to the laser disc.

280
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,970
I was afraid of unpopular technologies.

281
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,840
After Robert Kelly talked me
into getting a mini disc player,

282
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,890
which I still have with the t shaped
microphone. I can't find the chat,

283
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,160
but I have all these little
fucking cassettes of, uh,

284
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,490
you know
what happened?

285
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:30,940
Many cds of my sets from years gone
by and I want to listen to them.

286
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:32,900
And people are like, well, why don't
you take him somewhere? It's like,

287
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,480
cause I have no idea what I'm saying
on these fucking things, right.

288
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,770
I used to mutter to myself between sets,

289
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,480
thrown out all kinds of crazy shit
and in this fucking today's climate,

290
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,430
God knows what, what the, the
shit you said fucking I'm,

291
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,210
when we're at 20 years ago,

292
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,790
I mean,
20 years ago I was dating this woman.

293
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,120
I used to literally drag around the city
by her hair and nobody had a problem

294
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:57,810
with it.
Okay.

295
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,670
You think I'm going to dump off my
fucking mini disc player to somebody's

296
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,193
Yeti mind?

297
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,970
It's not happening. All right. Anyways,

298
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,500
so I am a, hey, by the way,

299
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,450
guess what? I made another month,
month of July, not a drop of booze.

300
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,010
Not One fucking drop.
You got damn cuts and uh,

301
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,300
it really affected my mood.

302
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,690
I was in such a good mood when
I would wake up in the morning,

303
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:32,370
but I was so grumpy at night, you know,
just having to sit there and fucking

304
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,140
stare at the wall. Um, I,

305
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:41,700
it's weird like this, this time of day I
don't miss it, but at night I definitely,

306
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:46,140
you know, you know, you get into
with your wife or a, I don't know,

307
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,770
your parents looking
at you in a weird way.

308
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:52,270
You just need something to take
the edge off and I got to tell you,

309

nobody on the planet like you. Oh,

317
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,060
so why would you buy a generic
mattress built for everyone else?

318
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,790

All right, quip everybody.

337
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,460
All right. The truth is most of us
are brushing our teeth wrong. Oh good.

338
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:43,360
How are you doing?

339
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,090
Not long enough and forget to change

340
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,440
our brush on time. Former
porn stars, gagging on it.

341
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,630
That's because most brands focus on
selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

342
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:02,040
brushing but not quip.
So what makes quip so different?

343
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,550
You may not have asked. Uh, please
mention I'll talking points below.

Woo.

428
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,600
Um, and uh, yeah, I have
really had no intentions.

429
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,550
I'm going to drink one day next week
celebrating with the Joe de rose.

430
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,810
It's Jody rose his birthday on August six.

431
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:09,380
Make sure you give all twinkle
toes a little shout up. All right.

432
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
Make sure you get that little
saloon whore a little tippy,

433
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,400
you fucking cowboy hat day. He'd love
to hear from you. Um, Joe by the way,

434
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,960
is really an incredible
inspirational speaker on a,

435
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,060
have you guys seen Joe de Roses?
Uh,

436
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,780
Instagram when he has,

437
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:30,890
he's sitting there shirtless with
awful bodies. Like it always goes.

438
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,590
What's up hard bodies.
Jody,

439
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,210
Rosie here telling you that you don't
have to be a slave to your diet.

440
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,490
I Dunno. Just look up at Joe de
Rosa or is it at Joe de Rosa comedy?

441
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:47,540
Just look up Joe to Rosa Instagram.
Maybe I can do it for you.

442
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,980
I'll make it easy for
you because she spoke.

443
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,880
You're probably pretending to type right
now acting as though you're working. Uh,

444
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,140
Joe de Rosa Instagram.
He's on the gram. Oh,

445
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:02,030
and I'm not connected to
the fucking Internet course.
Why would I be, why would I,

446
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,130
in this day and age be
connected to the Internet?

447
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,050
It's just most of the free world is
most of the free world is right there

448
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:13,410
connected to it. They're connected.
They're connected to the know. I don't,

449
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,920
let me type this in here.
All right,

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Joe Away. Rosa. Instagram.

451
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,480
All right GRANDPA.
It's at Joe de Rosa comedy.

452
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,040
E D e R. O. S. A

453
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,510
comedy. Um, Megan, why don't,

454
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,090
why am I hyping his
Goddamn Instagram page?

455
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,880
What does Joe de Rosa ever done for me?

456
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,440
Other bench other than being being
a pal for the less fucking 15 years.

457
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,380
Um, all right. What
the what to talk about?

458
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:58,190
I was just promoting rough and rowdy by
the way. The cop first to skateboarder,

459
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:01,130
that fight is actually,
that one's called pig verse punk.

460
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,380
So you get pride verse
prejudice, pig verse punk Ed.

461
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,690
Uh, where could you go from there,
Paul Luca versus [inaudible]

462
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,840
it old boxer fight.
Say a politician.

463
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,180
That could be a good one.
They should have just sort of an uh,

464
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,680
an endless ones with,
with the letter P. Huh?

465
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,820
You could have a,
somebody with a bladder problem.

466
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,200
Peer Verse Poor.
Go with a bladder problem.

467
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,670
Fight somebody who's a
economically in the shit.

468
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,130
I don't know. Okay. Maybe there's not an
endless one. I Dunno. Maybe I'm wrong.

469
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,590
I'm just spit balling here people, that's
all I'm trying to do. Just spit balling.

470
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,220
So anyways, I got to, uh,

471
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,240
I'm going to go see a nutritionist for
the first time ever tomorrow and uh,

472
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm going to get that taken care of.

473
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,740
I did the lat pull down
machine 70 fucking pounds.

474
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:06,400
Gradually I'm putting it back
together the way it really happens.

475
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,120
Not like on Dr Phil where
he's like, yeah, oh yeah.

476
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,330
Or Nay to stop punching her in the fight.

477
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,160
And like somebody who I would
actually, yeah, punching a in the face.

478
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:21,130
The fact that he said that like it's
going to get rid of everything that he saw

479
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:25,600
as a child in that moment on Dr Phil,
stand out works. That's going to be,

480
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,320
it's going to take that guy an entire
lifetime to stop punching women in the

481
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:33,340
face or shooting heroin or jacking off
in public whatever the fuck it is he

482
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,820
stealing. Right, but not all Philly.

483
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,040
Philly makes it seem like he solves it.

484
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,490
Right then in there with the little
fucking catch phrase is some bullshit.

485
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,391
That's why,
you know,

486
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:47,380
back in the day when I used to watch
police academy and I would see private

487
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:50,020
hooks number, the cute little
black girl, you know what I mean?

488
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,130
It should be all mousy. Like,
yeah, he hit that guy again,

489
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,680
the guy you got to get a scream and then
in the end she get her nerve up and she

490
00:30:56,681 --> 00:31:00,280
jumped out of nowhere with a gun out
and she goes, don't move dirt bag.

491
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,060
And then you'd see police academy to
when she'd go back to being this little

492
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,810
mousy person again. You're like,
what the fuck? That's bad writing.

493
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,830
That's what I thought.
That's lazy,

494
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,260
you're going to have to do the exact same
arc all the way to don't move dirt bag

495
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,870
again. And I used to think
that that was lazy writing,

496
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,390
but now having tried to,
to fix,

497
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,380
to control my temper, flip out, be
like, I don't want to do that again.

498
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,230
And then I'm fucking, you know, working
on or working on or working on and I'm,

499
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,020
I'm good for three weeks and then
I, I have a relapse. You know,

500
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,890
private hooks is one of the
most accurate characters ever,

501
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,560
ever written because you
seeing somebody trying,

502
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,460
they have a breakthrough and you think,
is this it that I finally break through?

503
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:50,180
And then, uh, nope, it was
just a blip. Now you're going
back to being mousy again.

504
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,500
And she had to work on it through
like 1819 police academies.

505
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,390
And I don't know if she ever got there,

506
00:31:56,391 --> 00:32:00,620
but I think we all could relate simply
by the fact that she was just out there

507
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:05,480
trying. There you go.
So that's nine minutes.

508
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:09,110
Nine minutes in 13 minutes. That's
31 minutes. Jesus Christ. People,

509
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:10,220
I think I'm done here.

510
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,700
I'm back up to regular volumes.
Tune into the red sox, Yankees.

511
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,260
Do you want to check that out? Um,
but definitely this Sunday, man,

512
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:22,160
make me look good.

513
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:25,670
Make it seem like I drove some
traffic to this wonderful event.

514
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Go to rough and rowdy brawl.com
to watch pride verse prejudice.

515
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,310
Pig first punk and Cleveland Brown fans
trying to do with the browns have never

516
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:42,850
done on the, which is beat
something from Pittsburgh. Ah, Bell.

517
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,630
Why did you have to be mean? Because
you know what? It makes people listen.

518
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,464
All right.
Enjoy

519
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,373
music.

520
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,100
And then we'll have another half hour of
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

521
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,840
podcast just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts from a Thursday,

522
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,160
gone by from years ago, or possibly
last month. I don't know how it works.

523
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,020
God bless you.
Have a great weekend.

524
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,560
You con and a two and then
I'll be dressed in shabby.

525
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,230
I'll be in Youngstown
for the first time ever.

526
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,820
And everybody else see Rochester New York
on Saturday night with the Great Dean

527
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,560
del Rey in the opening slot.
All right.

528
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,090
God bless you in the
United States of America.

529
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,533
Yeah.

530
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,593
[inaudible] [inaudible]

531
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,740
like a boss.

532
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,510
It's like the beginning
of fucking $6 million man.

533
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,690
You know when that little
fucking kite that he's flying,

534
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,420
why don't they ever show
that fucking show in reruns?

535
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,170
That's one of the greatest goddamn
shows ever. Do you guys ever see that?

536
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,340
Do you have any idea how fucking huge it
was when the $6 million man fought the

537
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,690
$7 million man

538
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,260
[inaudible]

539
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,850
and he punched his fucking
face off his face came off

540
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,893
[inaudible]

541
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:53,290
on television in like 1974 do you have
any fucking idea? Think about that.

542
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,540
Pre Internet,
pre cable,

543
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,490
pre any sorta special that you look
how bad the graphics were in Star Wars.

544
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,130
The adjustments between frames of all
the tiny moving parts are minuscule but

545
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:08,380
projected at the proper speed.
24 frames per second.

546
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,770
These individual movements
will flow seamlessly together.

547
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,223
[inaudible]

548
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,750
actually models which can be
carried in the palm of your hand.

549
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,721
So this is like three,

550
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:25,721
four years before that Lee Majors Punch
this dude who was the fucking bad guy

551
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,380
and everything.
Oh Man.

552
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Do you remember the one with the $6
million man fought? Fought in the snow?

553
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,020
Yeah.
Your first

554
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,960
Karen as an expert and a French art
I'll set up outside that mansion.

555
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,120
They had everybody in slow motion in that
black dude jumped like 10 feet in the

556
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:49,540
air was going to kick him.
He's gone

557
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,700
flying through the fucking air.

558
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,370
[inaudible] [inaudible]

559
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,410
well you got to stand how
sheltered I was as a kid.

560
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,030
I didn't even know who Bruce Lee was.

561
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,780
I didn't even know what Kung Fu fighting
was and I didn't realize that TV shows

562
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,120
were ripping off,
you know,

563
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,330
enter the dragon and all that shit
that people were flipping out about.

564
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,590
Cause I was just a little
kid. So I saw that shit. I,

565
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,390
it was the most unbelievable thing ever.
He fought big foot.

566
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,250
He fought a black Bruce Lee and he fought
the $7 million man and he punched his

567
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:27,510
fucking face off and a tele.
They just don't, they don't make,

568
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,370
it's impossible to compete now. There's
just, they've just done too many things.

569
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,310
You know, it's kind of like when you go
to write a movie script and like, oh,

570
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,680
everything's been done and they act like
all these guys back in the forties and

571
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,870
fifties were brilliant.
It's like fuck you.

572
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,790
There was only like five
movies where ever made,

573
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,500
how hard was it to be brilliant back then?

574
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,970
It's like inventing shit and
eat and the 1800 oh look,

575
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:55,230
it's a coat hanger. You can
hang your coat on it. Holy Shit.

576
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,720
Let's put his name in the history books.

577
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:00,090
Everyone can fucking remember
this for the rest of the time.

578
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,550
I don't even know what you could event.
You always great.

579
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,630
It's still inventing a simple shit.
Is that Billy Mays guy?

580
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,310
You know that bear did fuck every night.
He just starts swab. Billy Mays, I,

581
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:15,870
Billy Mays here for the Jupiter Jack
the most can be in hands free device for

582
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:18,950
any cell phone guaranteed.
That dude,

583
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,260
he doesn't even event the shit.

584
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:24,660
I think he invented like three things
and then he's just got a sweat shop of

585
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:29,060
like smart fucking kids from Thailand.
He just comes walking in.

586
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,840
I keep borrowing and myself on the iron.
Come up with some shit.

587
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,950
Then like three weeks later he's on TV up.
Billy Mays.

588
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,900
Are you doing tired of burn their hair
off your forearm or your art in your

589
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:42,734
button down?

590
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,480
Cause your third marriage didn't work out
and you still have to date in your 50s

591
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,610
hey drug dosing,

592
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,470
the fucking thing you stick in front of
the iron that doesn't burn your forearm

593
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,250
but still irons the
fucking shirt. Um, anyways.

594
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,700
Oh let me get, let me get back to
this thing. Sorry. Huh? See like that.

595
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:06,430
There you go. I want to stand up. Mo
gave you some fucking laughs. Okay.

596
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,860
And his left eye. What does his I do,
it's like a zoom lens on a camera.

597
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,560
A Zoom Lens.
Amazing.

598
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,733
[inaudible] [inaudible]

599
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,630
it's like a boss.
So anybody watch 60 minutes.

600
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,150
This past week they did a,

601
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:03,310
they did this feature and that feature
on mountain lions and now California is

602
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:07,550
the only state that has mountain lions.

603
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,280
Just walking around.

604
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,640
Los Angeles ended suburbs are
home to 19 million people,

605
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,940
the only mega city in the
world where mountain lions,

606
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,620
also known as cougars and Pumas
live side by side with humans.

607
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,180
For 13 years, the national park
service has been studying the animal.

608
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,090
Uh, I'm going to fuck
this up in a, in a park,

609
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,220
I guess maybe the size of like
Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or,

610
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,840
or whatever those ones are
out in, uh, out in the valley.

611
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,870
P 22 wanders the hills of Griffith Park,

612
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,720
a small enclave in Los Angeles,

613
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:50,610
frequented by hikers and visitors
to the parks. Famed Observatory.

614
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,670
I guess they have these fucking
things. And um, so anyways,

615
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:59,671
I was watching it because a few of the
places where I hike with my dog and this

616
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:01,790
thing has intermittently this,
this,

617
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,760
this group of fucking mountain lions has
been around there. But fortunately they,

618
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:07,360
they try to avoid you,
I guess

619
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,410
a trail camera caught this one. A stone's
throw from the rooftops of suburbia.

620
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,890
And these animals do their best to, you
know, stay elusive and away from us.

621
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,160
Um, at least during the day
if they're not fucking hungry.

622
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:27,900
But they showed this fucking, uh, these
people, these mountain lion, right.

623
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,240
Okay.
They were having some work done.

624
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:34,340
So they had somebody going underneath
the house into the crawl space of their

625
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:38,400
house and they all ran up against this
park and the guy went down there and he

626
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,820
immediately came back up and
he was fucking like white
as a ghost and they were

627
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:45,090
like a dawn, the A's, you know,

628
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,310
fucking white people trying to
speak Spanish. Right. Oh eight. Um,

629
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,990
is it French? I don't know. Um,

630
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,590
and a guy comes out of the fucking hole
and was like, yeah, man, I fucking, uh,

631
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,970
is a mount line down there. I just came
faced tonight, get outta here. You shy?

632
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,230
And they will let, he's like, yeah,
it's fucking down there. And so anyways,

633
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:13,890
they interviewed this fucking La couple
and they had the quintessential fucking

634
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:17,160
la couple, a mountain
lion in your house, Bro.

635
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,570
I'm sorry you said that. All the
melee and he goes, yeah, man.

636
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,550
Face to face, eye to eye came out
of I with any music. Terrified.

637
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,800
You know what I mean? He looks like
the leading man of a B movie. Right?

638
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,070
She's got like bleach hair.
She's

639
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,970
wearing fuck me pumps. She's on 60
minutes. Where in fuck me pumps.

640
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:42,830
It's fucking hilarious. Walking
round, done up to the nines. And um,

641
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:48,050
I actually, uh, was pretty cool. I was
trying to figure out where the house was.

642
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:52,040
I Google mapped it and I
think I was able to find it,

643
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,520
but I'm gonna fuck this state is so
fucking insane with the droughts,

644
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,780
the fires, the rattlesnakes, the
coyotes, the mountain lions, you know,

645
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,080
and everybody's in this place. It's so
phony and so plastic. Well, you know,

646
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,370
it can get, uh, that can all go away
pretty damn quick with the wildlife.

647
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,470
[inaudible] [inaudible]

648
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,640
hey,
what's going on?

649
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:39,360
It's built borrower and it is the
Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

650
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,320
August 2nd, 2010. Oh my God. Martha,

651
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,170
can you believe it? It's already
August. Could you believe it Martha?

652
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,161
Actually,

653
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:55,161
I cared Karen because it was
just July in my entire life.

654
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,220
August has come after July,
so yes,

655
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,650
I can believe that it's August 2nd.
Why do you have to do that?

656
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,360
Do what that, you know,
why can't you just,

657
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,530
you know, have frivolous
conversation. Why do you have to pay?

658
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,440
Why do you have to be such a cunt? No,
I'm sorry. Well that's what's your big,

659
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,770
um, anywhere. Oh Gee. Oh Gee. Oh my God.

660
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,480
What the fuck did I do last night?
I was going to do the podcast last night.

661
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,730
That was the plan.
Boys and girls,

662
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,290
ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages.

663
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,040
I was going to do the podcast last night.

664
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:44,790
I was going to upload this motherfucker,
midnight my time,

665
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,750
you know, for all my friends
out there and the fucking, uh,

666
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,740
Great Britain out there in
Ireland and Iceland, you know,

667
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,010
that'd be like eight o'clock in the
morning for you, right? You get up,

668
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:01,070
you people in Iceland throwing down some
hay for your fucking JAKKS taken out

669
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:04,200
your pan flute. Skipping
around, looking for the gold.

670
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,040
Isn't that what you do out there? Yeah.
Well that's what I think you'd do.

671
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,580
Cause I took geography in America.

672
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,090
So you know what's up Holland? How's
your windmills? Ah, you're clicking.

673
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,920
Your fucking wouldn't shoes together.
That's my version.

674
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:22,960
That's my version of Holland.
They don't even have cell phones out.

675
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,100
Their cell phones is still using
pitchforks to get their point across.

676
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,730
Um, that's an even make sense.
But what did I do instead?

677
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,130
You know, this is the classic
life of the loser, all right?

678
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:41,940
And if you are a loser,
not saying you are, okay?

679
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,300
Hypothetically,
if you are a loser,

680
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,900
you're going to recognize this pattern,
okay?

681
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,910
And this is the pattern of the loser.

682
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,500
They'll see the loser knows what
he or she is supposed to do,

683
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,110
and the, and, and then you
never do it. And that is a
pattern of a loser. All right?

684
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,340
Did they make any fucking sense?

685
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:07,341
It started like I was going to make this
huge fucking point and then my headache

686
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,160
really just kicked in there.
But let's, let's try it.

687
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,050
Let's try to put the wheels back
on the cart here. All right?

688
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,910
Just like those people, um,
out there in Finland right now

689
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,780
and all the people down in
fucking Australia wrestling
those poisonous snakes as

690
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:30,090
the aborigines fucking
sit there with that.

691
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:34,170
That white God damn tooth
sticking through their nose.

692
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,030
You know that shark tooth that Greg
Brady had around his fucking neck when he

693
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,710
was going to be the next Johnny Bravo.
Huh?

694
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,630
Just sitting there fucking staring
at me. They're aborigine, man.

695
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:46,890
You think I need that shit?

696
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,040
You think you think I'm the one who
kicked you off your fucking land?

697
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,470
I'm a Goddamn indentured
servant to the fucking banks.

698
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,180
They're half naked aborigine dude. All
right. To Stop fucking staring at me.

699
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,830
All right with your Thong.

700
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,430
You fucking sad face. All
right. I didn't create plastics.

701
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,200
I'm just dealing with it.

702
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,690
Why don't you show me how to fucking
join whatever it is you're thinking about

703
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:21,120
rather than fucking judging me.
And by the way,

704
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:25,200
could you help me with this fucking
snake over here? Um, anyways,

705
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,830
this is what the loser does.
Um,

706
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,200
yeah, I, I was gonna, I was,
I was going to do x, Y, and Z,

707
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:36,990
but instead I did fucking d and f

708
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,680
fucking idiot.
Instead of doing the goddamned podcast,

709
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,440
I went out and I drank last night.
Oh Gee,

710
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,590
I wish I had two whiskeys.
And to Miller highlights.

711
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,950
Why did I have Miller highlights? You
know what? Because the bottle looked good.

712
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,300
I like the way the bottle look.

713
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:58,650
It's one of those nights there's a
shiny looking bottle. I like that.

714
00:46:58,651 --> 00:46:59,221
I'm going to have that.

715
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:02,280
I'm going to block out those fucking
awful Miller highlife commercials.

716
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,630
I hated those commercials.

717
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,190
That fucking plumber with his greasy
fingers picking up that deviled egg.

718
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,550
It's like, are you trying to stick
Budweiser? Right. These fucking ads.

719
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,210
All right.
This is just anger.

720
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,410
Just of frustration at myself.

721
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,960
I don't know why I did the things
I did last night. I shot pool.

722
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,160
You know like I'm fucking Willie Mosconi.
You know that's it. Yeah, we don't,

723
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,941
we as a man,

724
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:34,240
you just walk up to a pool table even
though you know you suck and you're just

725
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:36,700
thinking it'd be like, you
know, seven ball corner pocket.

726
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,420
It's going to fucking go right
in and never goes in. You know,

727
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,360
just like your life.
You think it's on target.

728
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,160
You think it's heading
right towards your weight,

729
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,610
where you want it to go and Bam
bounces off the fucking wall.

730
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,880
And next thing you know, it's all the way
on the other side of the fucking table.

731
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,930
This is ridiculous. I shouldn't be doing
this right now. I resent, I'm resenting.

732
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,580
I'm blaming you guys. I'm fucking blaming
you sitting in your Goddamn cubicles.

733
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:02,320
What do you think about that?
What do you do?

734
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:05,350
He can't fucking do anything about it.
What do you do?

735
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,200
Are you going to send me
fucking emails complaining?

736
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,180
Yeah. Well I don't give a shit. I
don't fucking Ivy had breakfast,

737
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:18,230
Jeff sitting in my pajamas doing that
thing. When you're hung over, you know,

738
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:19,820
we just sort of rub your feet together,

739
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,900
trying to give yourself some sort of
soothing feelings on the other end of your

740
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,310
party because your fucking head
is throbbing so much. Well,

741
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,320
maybe I can offset the headache with a
soothing feeling between my footies and

742
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:33,830
of course it's not working.

743
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:39,510
Oh Fuck Jesus Christ.
Two whiskeys and two bears.

744
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,580
I feel like I fucking, uh,
I dunno. Like, I dunno what,

745
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,830
like I had a fight in the
parking lot and I lost.

746
00:48:46,831 --> 00:48:50,970
And last thing I remember was somebody
grabbing my big ears and bouncing my head

747
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:54,810
off the asphalt as I'm going, I
write a right, you won, you won.

748
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,200
And then you just slip off into a dream.

749
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,270
Ooh. Do, do, do, do, do, do.

750
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:05,170
Um, you know, it's weird. I woke up
whenever I wake up, hung over. Um,

751
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,221
you know,

752
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:11,060
one of the first things I do is I just
start cursing out the woman in my life.

753
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,500
You know, this is my remedy
for getting over a hangover.

754
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,180
You know, you wake up and
you see them, you know,

755
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,980
and you're trying to get the fucking,
you know,

756
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,790
that goddamn cement out of the eyes
is you're trying to open them up.

757
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,970
And of course, because you're hung
over and you want to be alone,

758
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,580
the vibe you're putting out is you
want to be alone. What happens?

759
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,040
You create,
you attract what you fucking fear.

760
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,340
Not only another human being
right in your goddamn face.

761
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,120
It's gotta be a female.
Okay? And God knows,

762
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,340
can they ever stop running the yaps.

763
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,090
It's like even when they
don't have something to say,

764
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,410
they're gonna fucking talk because
as much as they talk a good game,

765
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:04,210
I'm an independent woman and I got my
money, mother Fucker, all that shit.

766
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,870
At the end of the day,

767
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,600
all these broads are afraid of the
same thing. They're afraid of silence.

768
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,913
That's what it is.

769
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:19,480
You know that when you watch one of
those goddamn shows or in my life,

770
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:22,780
you walk by and your girls watch
and one of those goddamn shows.

771
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,680
Why and why am I bringing my voice down?
Like she's still in the apartment?

772
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:30,620
She isn't, but you know what? He just
want to bring my voice down here. This is,

773
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,220
I'm either talking about the Illuminati
or I'm talking about these fucking

774
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,090
bitches. Um, this is
all hangover talk here.

775
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:41,540
So I'll fuck all you guys if you're
taking this seriously. All right.

776
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,070
Rule number one,
or is it number two at this point?

777
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:50,810
You don't fucking take the podcast
seriously. Okay. Oh, you girls out there,

778
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:55,460
you get your panties in a bunch. It's
ridiculous. Why does he make fun of men?

779
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,060
Well, it is the balance it out
because that's life sweetheart.

780
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,620
And Life isn't fair.

781
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:05,360
Why don't you go listen to one of those
fucking 2012 podcasts with the fucking

782
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,980
broad over there running her goddamn
yet between her cleavage. Ah,

783
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:15,430
why don't you go do that sister town
with your tampons in your purse just in

784
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:21,200
case. Whew. I am in a mood.

785
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,730
Um, yeah. So I'm sitting there and I
got fucked. They're afraid of silence.

786
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:29,960
Stay on target.
They are,

787
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,850
they're afraid of silence. And that's
why they talk about nothing. Oh,

788
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:35,720
that's what I was trying to say.

789
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,370
You walk by the TV and your girlfriend's
sitting there, right? She do. You know,

790
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,240
sitting there on the couch right in the
couch side saddle. You know, they sit,

791
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,540
leaned up against the arm
with their legs to the side,

792
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,800
rubbing their footies together.
That of peeking out of the Afghan.

793
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,360
What? I like this show.
You Watch your shows.

794
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,930
Do I say anything when you're
watching your shows? I don't.

795
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,330
So why didn't you extend?
Shut up.

796
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,190
So, you know, you walk by the fucking TV,

797
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,440
you walk by the Goddamn TV and what
and what is it? What is on the TV?

798
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,120
You know what?
I don't even remember.

799
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,640
I don't even know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Oh yeah.

800
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:24,170
They're just running their yeps. Oh
the, I got it. Here we go. I'm hooked.

801
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:25,940
Backed up to it.
There we go.

802
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,200
There was a little awkwardness
there like you ever see when, uh,

803
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,030
when a jet tries to refuel in mid flight,
you know,

804
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,490
and that Shark Dick is hanging down.

805
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,230
I know what a shark Dick looks like.
What do they think about that?

806
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,360
Is that scandalous enough to get on
TMZ and my low level of notoriety?

807
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,110
I do.

808
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,110
I was watching this fucking a nature show
and these fucking creepy humans cause

809
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:51,770
that's what we are.

810
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,970
Pull this great white shark
out of the fucking sea.

811
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,550
And the sharks lie in, they're like, I
can't fucking breathe over here. Right.

812
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,670
And they got this little garden hose
going into his mouth and it seemed the

813
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:05,781
shocks looking like,

814
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:10,781
really this is the same as in h isn't
fucking hailing a mouthful of ocean,

815
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,280
your little fucking true value hardware
garden hose that you got my fucking

816
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:20,720
mouth. What are they doing?
Get away from my deck please.

817
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,120
And they literally reached down
and between a couple of faults,

818
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,310
they pull out this shark cock,

819
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,210
which amazingly enough
looks just like the fucking,

820
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,781
uh,
that,

821
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:36,610
that tube that they refuel in the
air for with or whatever the fucking

822
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,980
preposition. Is that a
preposition? I don't fucking know.

823
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,240
Trying to complete a sentence over here
and that's what it looks like. All right,

824
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:44,601
there you go.

825
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:48,950
That Porsche was dedicated to all
our troops over there in Afghanistan,

826
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,130
in Tuscaloosa, um, in as a weird thing
of sitting in the airport. The other,

827
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,860
I'm going to get back to the broads.
I'm going to give them a break right now.

828
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,830
Okay. I, I tried,

829
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,350
I tried to knock them out in that
round and now I'm fucking winded.

830
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,580
I'm taking around off. Is this starting
to score points? I'm just giving them,

831
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:07,020
I'm just giving them hope.
Taken a round off,

832
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,620
but I'm coming out with the next one,
um,

833
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,600
foot in a glove in their face like Larry
Holmes and I'm coming with the overhand

834
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:17,380
right. My favorite fucking
thing in boxing. Um, ah,

835
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,080
God,
what was I just talking about?

836
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,960
I was talking about Shark Dicks and
then I have to shark dicks. Oh, I know.

837
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,570
I'm in the airport. All right, good.
This is just going to be all momentum.

838
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,370
I'm going to just try to not stop talking
for 50 minutes because when I stopped

839
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:35,260
talking, the throbbing in my head
is actually audible. All right.

840
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:37,930
Slow it down, Bill. Let's take it
down a little bit. A little fucking,

841
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,100
some fucking smooth jazz here. All right,
so I'm sitting in the fucking airport.

842
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,900
This was an awkward thing, right? Uh,

843
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:48,340
all these troops came walking by and
these people spontaneously started to

844
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:53,150
applaud, you know, and I
didn't know what to do.

845
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:55,640
Do I join in?
It just didn't seem right.

846
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,430
But then you don't want to not
fucking show your appreciation,

847
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:04,530
but applause just seems weird.
It just seemed weird.

848
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,300
And I was trying to put myself in
their fucking position. Like, you know,

849
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:10,890
you just came out of Fallujah,

850
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,250
did what you had to do over there and
then you get fucking however it works.

851
00:55:15,251 --> 00:55:18,850
Next thing you know you're on jet blue
and you land at an airport and there's a

852
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:22,240
soccer mom. Whew. Good game. Good game.

853
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,280
You know, I don't know what to do.
Definitely appreciate him. But,

854
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,080
so that's for the troops out there.

855
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:33,640
Do you want applause in the airport
or is it fucking weird? You know,

856
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:36,520
cause we don't want to do that shit that
happened to the troops when they came

857
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:40,480
back from Vietnam and all those
fucking hippies were like, hey man,

858
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,550
that was cool when you burned down that
dudes hut me and we don't want to do

859
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:48,790
that, but I don't want to
have an overcorrection,

860
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:55,290
you know where you're like Dan [inaudible]
bed in it in it is that fucking song

861
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:59,710
they played up. I'm trying to think of
like college football songs, you know,

862
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,070
here come the troops,
but Aminah bomp bomp Bam.

863
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,130
In order to want to go, he had a Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

864
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:14,960
You don't want to go like two high energy.
There's gotta be a happy medium

865
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,300
between sitting there being
like, oh, the leaves are brown.

866
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,670
And then sitting there,
you know,

867
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,690
applauding like somebody just sank a putt.
It just didn't seem right.

868
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,590
All right,
so anyway,

869
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,670
so you walked by the TV and
there's the in the broad's always.

870
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,210
They're always talking
about how much more, uh,

871
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:40,820
I guess how much, what better
communicators, females are,

872
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,510
which I've probably proven to the last
fucking 14 minutes of this podcast.

873
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,553
Um,

874
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,080
and now he did know of a woman
actually says 20,000 more words a day.

875
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,950
Then a guy does serialize that
yet. Do you think? I didn't notice.

876
00:56:56,951 --> 00:57:00,610
I thought it was 40,000 more.
Okay. Let me tell you something.

877
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:03,470
They have fucking sink hole.
We

878
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,920
just, because you're saying more words
doesn't mean you're saying anything.

879
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,863
All right.

880
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,810
You basically filler buster your way
through silence with your girlfriend

881
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,540
because both of you are sitting there

882
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,730
afraid that if you stop talking,

883
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:23,210
you're going to hear the sound
of your boob sagging. All right?

884
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,340
Oh yeah. Well that's what I think it is
in my own fucking ignorance. All right,

885
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:31,250
let's get on with the podcast
here. People, I'm sorry. I had to,

886
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,760
I had to do a little cardio there just
to get myself through the first 15

887
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:39,150
minutes, you know, now I can
fucking chill. So I woke up,

888
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:41,410
hung over today. Obviously, man,

889
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:45,820
I'm attacking the broads because I'm
hung over and for the most part I don't

890
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:49,250
like them. Um, I like to look at them.

891
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,680
I like to come over and stick my dick
in them, you know? But after that,

892
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:58,550
it's like, why don't you get out in the
kitchen and make me one of them fucking,

893
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,120
we'll log the sandwiches

894
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,630
when she just fucking love to be that guy.
You know?

895
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,980
Just find some little fucking
mouse of a woman to live with.

896
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,120
Just blame your entire afternoon on her.

897
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,650
Where the fuck is a fucking room up?
Oh,

898
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:23,180
you had it last. What the fuck did
you say? I guess it was my fault.

899
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,380
This is terrible. This isn't even
comedy anymore. This is just mean.

900
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,820
So I woke up this morning,
hung over as I've mentioned 98 times.

901
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:39,110
And for some reason I woke up and uh,

902
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:43,010
this song was in my head. I just
woke up. But this was the song.

903
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,090
It was in my head right here.

904
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,103
Yeah.

905
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:53,430
Hung over off my ass.
And all of a sudden I just hear Elvis.

906
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,460
What's your woe? Shake me
your big hitch. Oh Hoo.

907
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:07,650
That's one of the greats fucking
songs by Elvis Presley and a,

908
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,550
when you really listen
to the lyrics, um, it's,

909
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,930
he's a fucking psycho.

910
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,420
He stuck in this broad hot in the kitchen.
Holly in the whole,

911
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,120
let me go a little dude, you're
headed all because, well,

912
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,190
saw kitchen and the kitchen kitchen in
the kisses starts a team of wild horses

913
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:33,050
couldn't pull us apart.
He's singing about rape everybody.

914
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,940
But he gets that. Oh, and it's
yet, it just smooths it all out.

915
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:43,030
And that's why he was the king.
Only the king can make rape seem,

916
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,850
uh, like it's, it's the right
thing to do for both parties.

917
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,400
Let's just be clear on that
for both parties. All right,

918
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,380
let's get on with the podcast. Okay. I,

919
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,450
I fucking love that song.
I really do.

920
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:04,430
And I was working the Orleans and a casino
with Tom Papa in the marriage. Refs,

921
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:06,410
Tom Papa.
Um,

922
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:09,110
I was coming out on stage like that
and I felt that for half a second.

923
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:13,040
I felt like 1 million bucks.
If I have a fucking second.

924
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,390
Can you believe it's
August? Um, all right.

925
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:20,090
So let's get on with the podcast.
Last week, ladies and Gentlemen,

926
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:25,120
I had the pleasure of performing on the
David Letterman show and most of you

927
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:30,350
went out, you watched it and you all
sent me wonderful emails about it.

928
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,850
And I would read you the wonderful emails,
but they're not funny,

929
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,440
but you are in luck.
You know what ones are funny?

930
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,890
The ones where people did
not like my performance.

931
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,530
So let's read a couple of those,
shall we?

932
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:50,450
All right now I fucking nose is
running. Okay, here we go. Here we go.

933
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,870
I did a little coke last night.
Everybody know, never had the balls,

934
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,220
never had the balls to
mess with that shit. Okay?

935
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,530
Uh, this is, uh, this is
somebody and I was always, um,

936
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,100
for those of you whenever I read
my hate mail, um, both of these,

937
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,480
the two hate mail emails that I
would be reading this morning,

938
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:15,260
all of a sudden I sound like right now
like a teacher teaching a really boring

939
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:19,880
class. You know that year and F, you
know, first class of that semester,

940
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,470
right? You finally get yourself
a little bit a poon Tang.

941
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:27,260
You're happy, you're floating around,
everything's going to be great.

942
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,430
You're thinking, okay, let's see
all my teachers are going to be,

943
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:34,740
and then that douche comes out.
Well,

944
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:40,250
going to meteorology in the media.

945
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:46,870
My name is Mister Kahn
face and Mr can face what?

946
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,910
I'm in third grade. I'm sorry, I'm
hung over. I couldn't come up with,

947
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,370
my name is Mr McGillicutty.
Now,

948
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,220
over the course of the next three months,

949
01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:00,470
we're going to be that way against all
the wonderful world of meteorology in the

950
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:04,250
media. You'll be required to
write two to 27 page papers

951
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:09,500
on theorists,
clouds in the Dakotas.

952
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,150
Okay.
So cirrus clouds were first discovered

953
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:21,770
ever since the Hydrus via that,

954
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,410
whether they love and they
picks up the fucking marker,

955
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,740
please writing across that fucking bored.

956
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,230
Sir Makkah is largest
Catholic yet the third,

957
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,690
uh, at first, before I said
mark is the Catholic author,

958
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,370
they thought a cirrus clouds.

959
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,970
We're actually the God's sake
that your wife was account.

960
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,130
I've got nothing. What's the breathing
and knowing it was supposed to be? Um,

961
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:55,330
all right,
let's read the hate mail here.

962
01:02:55,331 --> 01:03:00,010
So what happens with all of all of my
hate mail is when people don't like my act

963
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,580
is you can't just write me evidently
and just say that you don't like my act.

964
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,920
You don't appreciate what it
is that I do on the stage.

965
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,420
What you have to do first is you have
to establish what an incredible sense of

966
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:16,421
fucking humor you have and how open you
are to all different forms of humor.

967
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:21,450
You know, it's that classic thing
like those douchebags on Youtube.

968
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,600
Obama is a fucking idiot.
And I'm a Democrat, right?

969
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:27,870
Yeah.

970
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,960
So then we can be like,
wow, this guy is left.

971
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:33,570
And even he doesn't like this lefty guy.

972
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,360
So this is what they do. All
right, so here and so these uh,

973
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,520
both these emails follow to a Goddamn
fucking t did the mother fucking UNV

974
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,680
um, they follow it here at it.
They follow that pattern bill.

975
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:53,730
Just read the fucking thing. Okay,
here we go. All right. Hi there.

976
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,200
Oh, this one starts. Starts
off. Nice enough. Hi there.

977
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:03,290
I've been a fan for awhile.
You seem to have a unique take on things.

978
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,530
Look at this, Huh? Pat
me on the head, but me.

979
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:10,770
Sniff her hand making me
nice and fucking relax.

980
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,930
I loved your bit about the muffins
and the mass vehicular murder.

981
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,900
So there you go. She just
showed how we, it just,

982
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,480
her sense of humor spans the globe,

983
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:29,330
whether I'm attacking food are actually
running over human beings on the

984
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:33,540
sidewalk.
She finds it all funny though.

985
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,900
And here's the rub though.
As a stay at home mom,

986
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,330
I now completely despise you.

987
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:44,660
I did this bit about being a
stay at home mom. Um, so anyways,

988
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:49,661
she says the hardest part about being
a stay at home mom is being respect is

989
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:54,290
being disrespected by everyone.
I now hope the worst for you,

990
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,820
despite what funny acts you
may think up in the future,

991
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:02,990
you are a jerk and deserve the
worst that life has to offer.

992
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:13,920
I don't fucking, I don't, I
don't understand like these,

993
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:18,700
this is a classic fucking person where
everything is funny until it comes around

994
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:22,300
to some shit in her life and I make
some fun and some shit that she's doing

995
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:28,030
being a stay at home mom and now all of
a sudden she goes from being a fan of

996
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,930
mind to now I am a jerk and deserve
the worst that life has to offer.

997
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,640
That's, that's a fucking
hard courts that you deserve.

998
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,090
The worst that life has to offer. So
what? I'm going to get leprosy and uh,

999
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:46,140
be constipated all at the same time
and fucking survive a plane crash,

1000
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:51,550
but not in a good way, you know?
Anyways, I don't fucking know really.

1001
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:54,730
You're going to take it to that level.
So I wrote her back and I said,

1002
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,900
a sweetheart,

1003
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,860
Oprah Winfrey called your job
the toughest job on the planet,

1004
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,970
on national television,
and got an applause break of approval.

1005
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,980
How much more respect do you need?
I think that's a great point.

1006
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:13,150
If I can step outside the email,
break the fucking fourth wall.

1007
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,110
Is that what it is? The third wall? I
never knew what the fuck it was. Huh?

1008
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,020
Oprah Winfrey's on TV saying you have
the toughest job on the planet and

1009
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,450
everybody claps.
All right.

1010
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,320
Did she say being a standup comedian
is the toughest job in the planet?

1011
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,320
You think you know what it's
like to be fucking disrespected.

1012
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:36,550
You Apron wearing sheltered
son of a bitch? Huh?

1013
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,490
You want to talk about being disrespected?

1014
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:43,060
Looking fucking comedians anytime
they show a comedian in a movie.

1015
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,210
Is it a Chris Rock level comic?
It never is.

1016
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:50,530
It's the fucking hack with the
lampshade on his head going Wakawaka.

1017
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,933
Right.

1018
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,100
Then the fucking comedian gets
shot in his gut during Scarface.

1019
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,430
Ah,
did a fucking stay at home.

1020
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:04,930
Mom gets shot in the fucking stomach with
that Mr. Potato head mask on her face

1021
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:06,250
during that show. No. You know why?

1022
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:10,780
Cause she was at home taking
care of the fucking kids. Ah,

1023
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,940
Jesus Christ.
I'm just gonna read the rest of the email.

1024
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,170
I didn't even fucking make sense.

1025
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:19,150
It started off funny and then it just
went right off the rails like a Prius that

1026
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:23,840
you can't fucking stop. Um,
anyways, uh, she says, so I wrote,

1027
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,370
I wrote a, how much more respect
do you need? And then I said,

1028
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,530
meanwhile there are children
working in sweat shops.

1029
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,640
Would you rather be a stay at home
mom or an eight year old sewing Adidas

1030
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:35,500
together for 16 hours a day?

1031
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,890
I came up with another great example that
I, I wish I had used on TV. How about,

1032
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,840
how about you work on one
of those fucking oil rigs?

1033
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,850
Like those poor bastards
who worked for BP.

1034
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,170
Then all of a sudden out of
nowhere the fucking thing explodes.

1035
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,390
You standing on a metal structure in
the middle of the goddamn ocean and next

1036
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:59,150
thing you know blows up,
probably blew out both your air drums.

1037
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:03,580
He had deaf now and you're on fire.
All right?

1038
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:08,730
And your only option is either burning
to death or jumping off of basically the

1039
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,290
equivalent of the top of a brownstone

1040
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:16,940
trying to enter the water without
doing the biggest flaming belly flop,

1041
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,650
right?
You land in the water,

1042
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:26,090
second and third degree burns
in salt water. All right?

1043
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,920
Pus and blood is oozing into the water
and now all you can do is pray to God

1044
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,630
that the coast guard gets there
before is see as sharks eat you alive.

1045
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:37,850
All right?

1046
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,270
You want to do that or you want to
watch Bob the builder for the 800 time?

1047
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,950
Lighten up. And then I wrote, Oh,

1048
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,140
and don't despise her
hope that works for me.

1049
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,990
That causes premature aging hugs.

1050
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,220
I know that was kind of mean to say,
but you know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

1051
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,010
All right, here's another one. Once again,

1052
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:01,040
we have to establish credibility
at the top of the email.

1053
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:05,090
Are you guys ready for the credibility
to be established? Jesus Christ.

1054
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:08,600
I know I am. Here we go. Ah, Bill,

1055
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:13,870
I am never appalled or capital letters
offended by comedy that I see in here.

1056
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:20,210
All capitals. This sentence,
I have a great sense of humor.

1057
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:25,100
Wow. This is unbelievable. Isn't
that amazing podcast listeners,

1058
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:30,250
this person is never appalled or offended
by comedy that she sees or hears.

1059
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,850
She has a great sense of humor.
She is such a great sense of humor.

1060
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:39,140
People that she had to
yell at at me and emails.

1061
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:43,820
All right, so tis no way. She
had a problem with my act, right?

1062
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:48,480
Let's read the rest of the
email, however, oh gee.

1063
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:53,090
Your appearance on the David
Letterman show that I just watched,

1064
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:58,630
just put down women and motherhood
to an extent that is just downright

1065
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:04,040
unbelievable. Dot Dot. Dot. Now she's
going to yell again and tasteless.

1066
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:08,480
Now she yells for the rest of this email,
but I'm going to spare you guys.

1067
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,630
All right.
I'm going to read it and soothing tones,

1068
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,670
but she's screaming the entire time.

1069
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:17,420
That's what I'm guessing because
it's all capital letters. Um,

1070
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,220
this is what she says.

1071
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:24,250
I challenge you to be a single parent
and raise a child and work and attend

1072
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:28,970
college alone without any help.

1073
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:34,610
Just in case you don't know what being
a single parent meets. All right?

1074
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,000
Um,
you have no idea how hard it really is.

1075
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:43,660
I am disgusted with your act and
will not ever buy any of your DVDs,

1076
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,440
et Cetera.

1077
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,640
For the first time in my life,
I am disgusted with comedy.

1078
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,660
Your comedy, that is like if she
starts speaking like in film,

1079
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:01,760
nor I'm disgusted with his comedy.
Your comedy that is say, Eh,

1080
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,430
23.
Skidoo all right.

1081
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Your Act touched on many topics that you
were disgraceful and very unappealing.

1082
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:15,060
I think she got so mad she stopped writing
sentences. Um, first of all, sweetheart,

1083
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:21,070
I wasn't making fun of a single single
parents that was making fun of single

1084
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:25,910
parents. Nobody would laugh. I was talking
about stay at home moms. All right?

1085
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,960
You don't remember that line hanging
out all day making grilled cheese

1086
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:33,000
sandwiches.
You given a puppet show,

1087
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:36,960
you dress like a dragon and
then some other adult comes
home and gives you money.

1088
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,680
You like a big kid. That's some other
adults coming home, giving you money.

1089
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,190
Is Your fucking husband. You dumb broad
drug on a fucking spell it out to you.

1090
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:49,060
So I just wrote her back. I just said
I wasn't talking about single moms.

1091
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,640
I was talking about stay at home moms.
You weren't listening.

1092
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:00,440
Well listen, I'm not going to do this show
anymore. If I have to put up with this.

1093
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,210
I'm just kidding. I love these fucking
hate mail things and that's all I got.

1094
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:06,280
I got,
I got to to uh,

1095
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:11,310
bad emails and then I had one guy who
wrote like a five page dissertation on,

1096
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,430
uh, on the shirt I was wearing under
my suit or something like that. And uh,

1097
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:23,390
then I just went homophobic with him.
I just wrote a,

1098
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:27,480
that's one of the gay ass
emails I've ever received. Uh,

1099
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,250
thanks for the fashion advice.

1100
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:35,570
And then he wrote back trying to act
as if I got a bunch of emails from guys

1101
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,870
telling me to wear a carnation in my
front pocket or whatever the fuck he was

1102
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:43,790
saying and he wrote this big long fucking
four page email and then I just hit

1103
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:48,200
him with, come on sweetie, don't be
like that. And then it ended it. I got,

1104
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,920
I got a lot of a little
weird emails this week.

1105
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:54,480
Somebody saw a date night and said I
need to be more choosy when I pick my

1106
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:57,450
roles,
which I thought was fucking hilarious.

1107
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:01,320
Like someone who has eight lines in a
movie is actually getting offers around

1108
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:05,640
town. We got to get this
guy. The way I'm telling you,

1109
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:10,410
the way he stands next to other people
talking in the film is incredible.

1110
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:13,720
He is the best at it. Yeah, no,

1111
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,760
I got to be more choosy
with with a fucking,

1112
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,783
yeah.

1113
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,730
Evidently because I wasn't doing
stand up in the movie date night.

1114
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,870
Like the role of my character was the
straight man and the more [inaudible] or I

1115
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:29,400
played it, the more opportunity for the
other person to be funny in the scene.

1116
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,800
That's your fucking job,
you know?

1117
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:37,210
And I did the job and I think that
wasn't the job that I was supposed to do.

1118
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:41,470
I would think that the director might
have said something and just because I'm a

1119
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:45,600
fucking comedian doesn't mean I'm
going to walk around, you know,

1120
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,380
with a lamp shade on my fucking head.

1121
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,900
I'd love to be in a bad ass fucking movie.
What do you think I want to do?

1122
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,050
You know, you think I want to be in
raising Arizona part to actually I would,

1123
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,840
but I'd also like to be in a,

1124
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,980
they can ever make a movie
as good as a good fellows.

1125
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,600
I'd love to do some shit like that.
Play a fucking psycho.

1126
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,480
Put the lotion in the bucket but
wouldn't want to do that shit. All right.

1127
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:14,080
You dumb. Fuck am I, I don't need
to be more choosy about my roles.

1128
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:18,160
I need to take anything anybody gives me,
you know,

1129
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,640
fucking shot that movie a year ago.
I haven't done another one.

1130
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,760
Is that choosing enough for you?
Not been up guns.

1131
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:30,250
Not like I'm not trying. All right,
let's uh, let's plow ahead here.

1132
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:33,790
Let's get on with, uh, what else
do we got going on? Oh, by the way,

1133
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,400
if I want to thank everybody. Seriously,
I was just fucking around there with the,

1134
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,020
uh, the Letterman stuff. I had an
unbelievably great time and uh,

1135
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:43,360
that was my best Letterman
if I do say so myself.

1136
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:49,110
I finally figured out the pacing
that I have to go on TV and uh,

1137
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:55,450
what I always used to try to do is I
used to try to go comedy club speed,

1138
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,620
but TV audiences for some
reason laughing clap a lot more.

1139
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,150
And then I would,

1140
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:05,110
I would try to do was plow through the
applause and get the tag of the joke in

1141
01:15:05,111 --> 01:15:09,040
there. And uh, I dunno, it's
like a whole different animal.

1142
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,030
You got to figure out what do
you do when they're applauding,

1143
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,260
you know, why did the chicken
cross road to get the other side?

1144
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:23,983
Woo Woo.

1145
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:28,540
Maybe that's why I didn't applaud when
the troops came by because I thought that

1146
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:32,770
they would feel as awkward as I do when
you're just standing there going, okay.

1147
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,130
Thank you. Yes, I know that was the
greatest joke in the history of the world.

1148
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,100
I am tremendous. Where do you get
a load of this one? Um, all right,

1149
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:46,530
let's read some. Um, let's read
some match. Oh, and by the way, um,

1150
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:50,950
later on that night, um, in celebration,

1151
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:55,240
I had the most ridiculous fucking weekend,
um,

1152
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:59,650
that an adult can have and part
of most of his, because, uh,

1153
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,740
you know, I chose what I wanted to do
in life was exactly what I wanted to do.

1154
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:08,350
And secondly, I'm not married and
I don't have any fucking kids,

1155
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:13,060
so I don't have any
responsibility. Hence, I, uh,

1156
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,390
I get to live the life of a,
a gay guy.

1157
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:20,290
Give me notice how happy
fucking gay men are.

1158
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:24,460
You know why that is is because
they got the fucking double whammy.

1159
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,320
There are fucking man.

1160
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:31,350
So they can earn way more an hour than
the fucking broads over there and then

1161
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:35,080
they don't have any God damn kids.
So once you get around 40,

1162
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,060
if you've done grading your, your career,
you have all this disposable income,

1163
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:41,770
you know,

1164
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:46,770
and the only way to kill the voices in
your head that you should have had a

1165
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:52,021
fucking kid by now is to go out and do
frivolous bullshit to fill up the free

1166
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:57,190
time. And that's what I've been
doing. So I actually this weekend,

1167
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,960
um, one of the things I got to do this
past weekend is so fucking unbelievable.

1168
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:06,010
I can't even tell you how I even went
down, but I did take video of it.

1169
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,280
And if you want to watch the video,
you can only go place everybody.

1170
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,060
And that's the MM podcast.com.
Huh? You like that?

1171
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:25,400
look@thatandexclusivemondaymorningpodcastvideothatwillonlybeshownonthemmpodcast.com

1172
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,180
of course, until some douche bag
takes it and puts it up on Youtube.

1173
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:34,540
So go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and
a watch a video of something that I got

1174
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:39,410
to do. And, uh, I, I don't even,

1175
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,810
I can't even begin to tell you how that
whole fucking thing went down and how I

1176
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:48,690
got to do it, but, uh, was one of
the great things I got to do in life.

1177
01:17:48,691 --> 01:17:49,800
So I got to do that,

1178
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:54,640
which I won't be telling you because I'm
trying to become a smarter businessman

1179
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:56,920
here.
All right?

1180
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,920
The only way you should hit pause right
now and go to the MM podcast right now,

1181
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:03,700
if you're not following along anyways.
Um,

1182
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,730
I got to do that unbelievable
activity. And then, uh,

1183
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,171
what did I do?

1184
01:18:10,171 --> 01:18:13,770
I did Letterman on Monday and then Monday
night I went down to the bitter end

1185
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:16,770
and I watched that fucking amazing guy,

1186
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:20,460
Oz noy this guitarist,
if you ever get a chance,

1187
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:24,540
if you ever in a New York
one Monday a night, this guy,

1188
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:28,230
Oz noy goes down and he, I don't know, I
can't even describe what the fuck it is.

1189
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:32,400
He does very, very unique
guitarist and he, uh,

1190
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,270
I don't mean you got to see him live.

1191
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,840
You have to fucking seem live as
youtube videos. Do not do him justice.

1192
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,970
He got to go down and seem live and um,

1193
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,590
and he's always playing with
these top notch musicians.

1194
01:18:44,591 --> 01:18:47,080
He had a will leave from the
Letterman band was there.

1195
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:50,950
Steve Ferrone from the average white
band actually went up and got a fucking

1196
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:53,860
picture with them and Shit,
uh,

1197
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,500
from the average white band and now Tom
petty and he's played with a zillion

1198
01:18:56,501 --> 01:18:59,620
other people. One of my drumming heroes
got to meet him that fucking night.

1199
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:01,851
And uh,

1200
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:04,550
the guy on keyboards is one of the
original guys from the East street band,

1201
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:05,780
but I'm not into the e street band.

1202
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:09,740
But this guy was the shit and I just
watched these fucking unbelievable

1203
01:19:09,741 --> 01:19:11,900
musicians and sat in the crowd.

1204
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,970
These guys were so fucking good that
actually had the comforting thought that,

1205
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:16,804
you know what,

1206
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:21,190
robots will never take over fully.

1207
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:25,950
Robots will never fully fucking take
over because they'll never be able to do

1208
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,870
what I just fucking saw.
I mean when he,

1209
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:31,100
you're gonna write a program for passion.

1210
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:36,970
God, no, some fucking egg head
with no passion is probably
figuring that shit out.

1211
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,440
Figure out how to make a robot sweat.
Will it plays fucking guitar?

1212
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,633
Yeah,

1213
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,620
that'll be,
that'll be the big fucking breakthrough.

1214
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:53,740
That's why drum machines never fully
took over cause it's just somebody

1215
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:58,210
programming the shit. You know,
it's not a human being playing it.

1216
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,540
Right. Is that where, I don't know.

1217
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,760
I'm too fucking hung over
to actually have a fucking,

1218
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,180
a fucking touching moment here in the
podcast all a couple of weeks ago I told

1219
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:13,050
you guys how to dump, how to get out
of a fucking relationship. All right.

1220
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:17,430
Um, and if you ever want to learn
how to not get into a relationship,

1221
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:22,820
go download a Andrew dice Clay's
live album at Dangerfield,

1222
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:26,860
did the, uh, the day the laughter died.

1223
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,730
And one of my favorite bits
of all time that he does is a,

1224
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,100
I think it's called hot n how
to not get into a relationship.

1225
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:38,580
So if you don't even want to deal
with how to get out of relationship,

1226
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:43,581
listen to dice Clay's bit on how to
not get into into relationship and a,

1227
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,020
but then if you fuck up
and you get into one,

1228
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,350
listen to my podcast from a couple of
weeks ago and I'll give you the blueprint

1229
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:52,480
on how to get out. All right? So anyway,

1230
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:54,390
so this brought up the
whole getting dumped

1231
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,290
and people have been sending me emails
about getting dumped or breaking up in

1232
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:01,960
the awkwardness and all that type of shit.
These are some great stories.

1233
01:21:01,961 --> 01:21:05,270
Here's one for you getting
dumped. Hey Bill, how's listening?

1234
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:10,420
Last week and wanted to tell you
about the worst way I was dumped. Uh,

1235
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:11,590
when I was in high school,

1236
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:15,580
I had a friend who was a girl and I
was in love with her in a pathetic,

1237
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:19,270
never getting laid way while she was
banging and half the football team.

1238
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:26,130
Oh Dude, that's like that movie last,
uh, last American Virgin, right?

1239
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,100
Then I already use that reference
on the podcast. I don't give a fuck.

1240
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:33,090
I'm hung over anyways. I, after
high school graduate graduation,

1241
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:37,680
we started dating even though we went to
different colleges, seven hours apart,

1242
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,200
um,
over I yeah,

1243
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:43,710
I love how she starts dating you then
because the football team left her and

1244
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:48,210
went to 47 different colleges, so
she just needed a dick to ride. Um,

1245
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:51,840
over fall break I went to visit her and
stayed at her place for the weekend.

1246
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,280
On the last night at midnight,

1247
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:58,281
she told me she was seeing someone else
and then expected me to stay at her

1248
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:02,590
house that night. Oh, what a cunt. Um,

1249
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:08,080
I got up and pack my shit
and as I was about to leave,

1250
01:22:08,081 --> 01:22:11,650
I did my best Brando impression
to let her know how she,

1251
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,250
how she fucked up.
Um,

1252
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,510
and as I started to go out the door
after making my dramatic statement,

1253
01:22:19,511 --> 01:22:22,420
she said,
don't you need your keys?

1254
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:26,080
Yeah.

1255
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,910
Oh, this poor bastard. He goes,

1256
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:31,300
I forgot my keys on the table
all the way across the room.

1257
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:35,560
So I had to walk all the way across,
back the pack,

1258
01:22:35,561 --> 01:22:40,561
across the room in shame to grab my
keys and then drove seven hours back to

1259
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:45,070
college in the middle of a, in
the middle of the night. Dude,

1260
01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:49,480
let me tell you something. You
got, you got half a victory there.

1261
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:56,840
Um, because you did leave
and you know, and you did,

1262
01:22:56,841 --> 01:23:01,280
you had the ability to walk all the
way across the room to get your keys.

1263
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:06,281
And at no point during that long
fucking did you break down in tears.

1264
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,440
You didn't. All right,
don't you need your keys?

1265
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:17,830
Ugh. Ah, that's fucking brutal.
That's like, that's like mean.

1266
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:22,030
Yeah.
Because you know what she thought,

1267
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:23,740
I guess that you were going
to stay there for the night.

1268
01:23:23,741 --> 01:23:26,380
So I guess she went mean there.
Don't you need your keys?

1269
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,780
Obviously you need your keys.

1270
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:33,890
If she was trying to let you down
easy when she'd be like, mmm,

1271
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:38,850
you forgot your keys here and just would
have the decency to look down at the

1272
01:23:38,851 --> 01:23:42,470
floor.
Don't you need your keys?

1273
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,513
Ugh,

1274
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,280
that this is what I want to know from
you on that seven hours drive back.

1275
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:53,910
How many different snappy comebacks did
you come with for don't you need your

1276
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:58,250
keys? I bet you were so fucking
distraught. They didn't even make sense.

1277
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:02,150
Don't you need your keys? Don't
you need your current, right.

1278
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:06,150
That doesn't even make sense. But
you know, it's something you'd say.

1279
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:11,820
Aww, you poor bastard, whatever.
You know what the good news is?

1280
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:13,980
She probably has three kids right now.

1281
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,550
Our bodies looking like she's standing
in a fun house mirror and she probably

1282
01:24:17,551 --> 01:24:21,930
has some sort of fucking STD.
So, you know, there you go sir.

1283
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:27,730
It all worked out in the end, didn't
it? All right. Uh, bad covers.

1284
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,030
This is from back in the day
we're talking about, um, when,

1285
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:34,780
when an artist comes
around like a lady Gaga,

1286
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:36,543
you know,

1287
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,550
when she comes around and
she wraps herself in toilet
paper and holds a fucking

1288
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:45,020
dildo and everybody's like,
she's thinking of fashion state,

1289
01:24:45,021 --> 01:24:48,850
but she shocking Middle America,
uh,

1290
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,030
holding like a black
baby while playing chess.

1291
01:24:56,690 --> 01:25:01,380
Is there anything worse than that?
Paint by numbers. Shock. You know,

1292
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:05,730
and then, then the fucking douchebags
who cover it, just stand right in line.

1293
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,310
She's pushing boundaries.

1294
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:13,520
She's rejecting what it is to
be a woman. Oh God. Shut up.

1295
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:18,080
She's wearing a silly outfit.
Isn't that what she's doing

1296
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:24,010
as a fan? Blowing on her Twat,
hanging off her belt buckle.

1297
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:28,090
And then I'm supposed to sit there and
be like, oh, I can't even process this.

1298
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:33,440
This is cutting edge art.
I mean,

1299
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:34,460
what is she really doing?

1300
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:36,503
Yeah.

1301
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,340
Oh,
good faith poke phase.

1302
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,310
Oh my God,
I can't handle it.

1303
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:51,250
This is like when Jimmy Hendrix came
out. No, it isn't. There's like,

1304
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:55,130
when Cindy Lopper came up,
she braided half her fucking head,

1305
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,330
right. And dance down the street with
their fucking shoulders going up and down,

1306
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,740
yelling at Captain Lou, I'll bottle.
It's, it's kind of on that level.

1307
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:08,270
I remember when Cindy Lopper did that
shit and then she didn't do anything.

1308
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,320
And next thing you know, she's
on, she's on that fucking, uh,

1309
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,970
who wants to be a CEO getting fired by
that guy who I don't even think has any

1310
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:21,770
money or any Donald Trump fans out
there. I don't think that guy is rich.

1311
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,620
I really don't. I don't. I don't
buy it. If this guy is such,

1312
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:28,220
if he so fucking rich and has
all these goddamn businesses,

1313
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,390
how does he have time to do a
reality show and in critique?

1314
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:37,080
Who's better at running a lemonade
stand? Cindy Lopper. Bret Michaels

1315
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:42,380
is,
is that what a fucking a

1316
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,060
fucking whatever the hell he is. What?
What is, what do you call a guy like that?

1317
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:51,140
He's, he's, he's a uh, a conglomerate.
A media conglomerate. What,

1318
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:55,250
what the fuck is he called? A
A, I can't think of the word.

1319
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:58,580
I'm too fucking hung over. It's not
like one of those ingenue names then.

1320
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,680
I know it's not that way. I know
what that, that's not what it is.

1321
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,540
A knew means you're a, you're a good
looking gore. Gore. Good looking whore.

1322
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,430
Who Someday
my brain is so fucked right now.

1323
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:15,380
I just combined good looking in horror
and she's a good, she's a Gore Al Gore.

1324
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:22,370
Al Gore. Who is a bitch or your fucking
body. Al Gore or fucking Bill Clinton.

1325
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:23,743
Both of them.

1326
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:28,670
They're big mother and hips sachet and
around the White House with their fucking

1327
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:32,870
suits on
Eaton Stouffer fucking pies.

1328
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,120
Um, I am so off the track right now.
Um, we're talking about bad covers

1329
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:40,910
now on this is,
this is,

1330
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:45,230
this is what I really believe about Donald
Trump for all his fucking Trump water.

1331
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:49,610
Trump tower, Trump casino,
Trump helicopter, Trump,

1332
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:53,210
te toenail clippers.
I don't think that that guy,

1333
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:59,270
if you gave him fucking,
if you gave him 12 hours,

1334
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:02,570
I don't think that he could come up
with more than 6,500 bucks in cash.

1335
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:07,340
I think he's just completely leveraged
out, but his projects are so big.

1336
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:10,640
He's like the banks. Like
he, he's too big to fail.

1337
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,380
Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I
talking about? Where the hell am I?

1338
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:20,030
Let's get back to bed covers.
All right. Bad covers.

1339
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:21,500
Here's one for you.
Uh,

1340
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,550
Madonna when she did a American pie,

1341
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:32,570
um, yeah, that song kind of sucked
to begin with. And then, um,

1342
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:36,830
just in case you didn't realize it's
sucked, Madonna came in and proved it.

1343
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,260
Yes.
This song did suck.

1344
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,390
Even if you completely switch it up
and put that club beat underneath it,

1345
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:48,800
it's still gonna fucking suck of Jesus.
I'm just running on a momentum,

1346
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:53,990
you know? Did I really just do a
lady Gaga impression? I'll fuck you.

1347
01:28:53,991 --> 01:28:57,580
You enjoyed it. You
enjoyed it. You know, you,

1348
01:28:57,581 --> 01:29:02,070
you do a podcast hung over. I want to see
how good you do. Yeah, I didn't think so.

1349
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,810
I didn't fucking think so. Um, here's
the youtube videos for the week.

1350
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,440
We're just blowing through the topics
here. Youtube videos for the week. A pug.

1351
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:14,770
Pug Sings Batman theme. Look
that one up there, right?

1352
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:16,530
Pug as in the dog.

1353
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,560
PUBG pug as opposed to a
Gore pug sings Batman theme.

1354
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,980
Um,
drunk ass knock out.

1355
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,670
A lot of this shit's going to
have to do with alcohol this week.

1356
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:33,750
A wasted guy at Coachella,
Coachella is CEO,

1357
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:38,580
c h e l l a.
And here's one for you,

1358
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,450
uh, do something difficult.
And you know what?

1359
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:46,710
I actually forgot the most
fucked up one of the week.

1360
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:50,670
I have to just bear with me here.
I have my,

1361
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,070
the microphone laying
on my chest right now.

1362
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,420
I want to say somebody used to
do that didn't like one of those.

1363
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:01,110
Those guys late at night when they're
trying to sell your shit before they came

1364
01:30:01,111 --> 01:30:05,540
up with the Janet Jackson
Mcdonald's drive through headset.

1365
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,650
Then they have like that hands free device
with the microphone just dangled from

1366
01:30:10,651 --> 01:30:15,330
your neck. I want to say that
they had that. All the other guys,

1367
01:30:15,331 --> 01:30:17,610
that's a movie coming
out that the other guys,

1368
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,410
I actually had an audition for that movie
and I got all the way down to the part

1369
01:30:22,411 --> 01:30:26,460
where the guy who got
the part was fucking he.

1370
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:30,330
I think he went in before me and killed
it. So now when I see that movie,

1371
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,690
I'm like, ah. It looks so fucking funny.
I could've been in there with eight lines.

1372
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:38,190
God dammit. All right, the fucking,

1373
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:39,850
all right.

1374
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:44,850
What's the name of this
video woman finds man in bed,

1375
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:49,590
something like that. Oh, here. Women.

1376
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:53,970
Woman wakes up to find
intruder in her bed.

1377
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,800
You got to see this one. It's so fucked
up. I don't even know if it's real.

1378
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:04,350
It looks like a fucking in living
color sketch. Um, all right.

1379
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:07,620
Overrated, underrated for this week and
the overrated underrated this week. Uh,

1380
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,980
you guys really took it to another
level here. This is fucking phenomenal.

1381
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,530
All right. Underrated. Ah,

1382
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,580
first kid in your junior high
that admitted to jerking off.

1383
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,350
That might be one of my favorite
underwriters of all time.

1384
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,650
What a fucking champ that kid was.
You know,

1385
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,780
you know some people are still trying
to find themselves at 35 or possibly 42

1386
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:38,520
like myself. That kid knew who
the fuck he was in junior high.

1387
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:44,850
Hey, jerking off I do it. Fucking
feels good. Fucking rub one out.

1388
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,380
Next class. I liked the teacher. She's
still with something for me. One,

1389
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:52,680
I'm the last guy in the, in the, in the
fucking row. Just don't turn around.

1390
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,660
You'll be fine.
I'm number two.

1391
01:31:54,661 --> 01:31:58,620
Whoever commented that Roger Ebert now
looks like one of the muppets from the

1392
01:31:58,621 --> 01:32:02,110
land of video. Jesus
Christ. On a side note,

1393
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,430
that is one of the creepiest
videos ever. Yeah, man.

1394
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:10,180
Poor Roger Ebert, Jesus Christ. You
know what I mean? How ironic is that?

1395
01:32:10,181 --> 01:32:14,860
That he spent his life criticizing people
and then he gets fucking mouth cancer.

1396
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,270
You know, and he's, he's still
criticized and shit. He's like,

1397
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:23,470
he's like the Goddamn a terminator.
Um,

1398
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:26,560
Jesus Christ. And if that's true,
what the fuck am I going to get?

1399
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:31,540
The fuck's going to happen to me. All
this shit that I spew. Um, number three,

1400
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,600
Leopold butter's Scotch

1401
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:39,700
next to Cartman the best
character on South Park.

1402
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:43,540
I hope I said the dude's name right.
I love South Park. I really love that.

1403
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:45,370
And I'm actually, I'm going to, uh,

1404
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,610
I'm starting to watch the boondocks
because everybody told me that's the shit.

1405
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:53,560
So watch it with me. And, uh, let's
watch a quality show together.

1406
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,500
What do you say people, anybody
else watching? Breaking bad?

1407
01:32:56,501 --> 01:33:00,490
I can't believe I've been watching it
for three fucking seasons and I haven't,

1408
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,530
um, I haven't, uh, haven't really
talked about it. I fucking love it.

1409
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,390
It's a God damn.
It's a great show.

1410
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,350
But I've yet to get into that
advertising a mad, mad, mad men.

1411
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:16,240
Mad Money. The fuck is it? I Dunno.
Everybody walks around smoking.

1412
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:21,070
Um, I heard it's great. And everybody
on that show is dressed in suits,

1413
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:25,720
which I like a number four underrated.
This is another great one. This is a new,

1414
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:30,490
this is, this is, this is this person's
first contribution to the podcast. And a,

1415
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:32,170
I think this person
should be a staff writer,

1416
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,560
is another fucking gem number four station
wagons in the 80s with the rear seats

1417
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:42,400
facing out the back window.
Kids have everything today,

1418
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,140
but they missed out on that one.

1419
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:49,580
Do you know my parents had an 83 caprice
classic maroon with the fake wood going

1420
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:55,150
down the side, top of the
line, the wire wheels, cloth,

1421
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:59,890
Maroon fucking, uh, interior.

1422
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:05,800
We drove all the way out to Chicago
one time, all the way up to Chicago.

1423
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:10,660
I was in the Middle Cup of my siblings
were sitting in the back and I was

1424
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:15,130
jealous that they got to sit, you
know, seeing what we just fucking saw.

1425
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:20,020
And then my parents sat in the front and
that bench seat that blocked the AC and

1426
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,720
they wouldn't let us put the windows.
Dad,

1427
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:26,500
my fucking dad would sit there with
his hands in front of the, you know,

1428
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,070
he's hands on the event,
like an inch away from the vent,

1429
01:34:30,071 --> 01:34:32,680
failing the AC coming out,
you know,

1430
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:37,480
completely fucking selfish. And
will they, can we turn it on?

1431
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:41,290
We couldn't put the windows down.
They're like, no, we got the AC on. Yeah.

1432
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:44,050
With the big cloth bench
seat is fucking blocking it.

1433
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,810
And we just sat there looking at farmland
wisdom by my brother's actually got to

1434
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:52,600
stick their heads out the
window in the back, you know,

1435
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:57,200
like a couple of fucking months
and I sat there in the middle,

1436
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,180
just had to sit there taking it all right.

1437
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:02,060
Number five under rated kids in the hall.
Absolutely.

1438
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:05,240
When people bring up the greatest
sketch shows of all time, you know,

1439
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:09,380
they'll say Mr show,
they'll say Dave Chappelle and uh,

1440
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,440
the people in the know also say kids in
the hall and I'd have to definitely go

1441
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:17,060
with that. Alright. Overrated
humping in the shower apps.

1442
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:20,750
A fuckin lutely. That's
exciting. When you're in college,

1443
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,680
you know that sensation of water,
you know?

1444
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:29,360
Yeah. Hopping in the showers. Weird.
Then the water's hitting her booty crack.

1445
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:31,700
It starts making a weird noise.
You know,

1446
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,840
as a water shoots up from
her fucking ass crack,

1447
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:40,580
it's hitting you in your lower jaw,
you know, who can concentrate. Um,

1448
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:44,990
number two, uh, bartenders that claim
to have created their own drink.

1449
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:52,400
Is it ever good? It's
never fucking good. Uh,

1450
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:57,350
overrated Bourbon Street I got to
go with yet. That is overrated.

1451
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,640
You fucking go down there.

1452
01:35:58,641 --> 01:36:01,790
It's a bunch of Goddamn tourist who
can't hold their fucking alcohol.

1453
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:05,540
And then there's a bunch of Goddamn
wolves on the side streets waiting to

1454
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:09,410
fucking stick a knife in your neck.
Uh,

1455
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:13,670
also overrated national spelling.
Bee contests are overrated.

1456
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,910
Uh, I dunno, I dunno if I go,

1457
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,830
I actually liked those ones and I think
it's great that those kids learn how to

1458
01:36:18,831 --> 01:36:23,090
fucking spell. It's something that
I wish I learned how to do and um,

1459
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,480
I root for him.
I want him to win the spelling bee.

1460
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:31,250
And I also want him to get laid before
the 36. Um, and here's a random one.

1461
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:36,251
Go on Google maps and you know when you
can hit satellite then actually looked

1462
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:37,520
down,
you know,

1463
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,490
and actually bring yourself down
on the street with that little man.

1464
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:43,970
Here's one for you in
the middle of France.

1465
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,940
This is what you want to look up his,
the address eight rue,

1466
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:53,530
which means Street d,
You have duct here.

1467
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,850
[inaudible] Doc, t. E u.

1468
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:05,110
R. G. R. A. N. D. J. And that
was one word, g. Uh, Grand Joel,

1469
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:09,520
which means big Joel. Um, five,

1470
01:37:09,521 --> 01:37:13,650
four zero, zero, zero Nancy, n.

1471
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:16,830
A. N. C. Y. I just realized how
long this is and now I can't stop.

1472
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:21,080
I've got to give you the
whole thing. Comma, m e U R t.

1473
01:37:21,081 --> 01:37:23,600
H. E. You guys write this down like

1474
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:32,190
Morse Code Dash e Dash M o. S. E.
L. L. E. And then Lorraine France.

1475
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:35,850
L. O. R. R. A. I. N. E. All right.

1476
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,720
Okay.
Google map that hit the satellite.

1477
01:37:39,721 --> 01:37:44,160
Bring the little man down on the street
and tell me what the fuck that is on

1478
01:37:44,161 --> 01:37:46,200
that porch.
Tell me that's not a fucking alien.

1479
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:52,270
There's an alien on the porch and the
satellite cut the picture of it. I Dunno.

1480
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:56,430
Who knows? It's probably a goddamn
beehive. That was a fucking way to go,

1481
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,570
but I like it.

1482
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:02,400
I think that has a lot to do to good
theme for this podcast. You know,

1483
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:06,150
for a hung over son of a bitch with
nothing in his, in his, in his stomach.

1484
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,530
Other than the two slices of pizza that
I ate at one in the morning. La Pizza,

1485
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:14,400
by the way. See, you know, it was good.
Um, you know, something I just realized,

1486
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,610
I feel like I haven't said anything
funny in the last 20 minutes.

1487
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:18,600
How long ago was that?

1488
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:22,230
Clinton Gore with they're bitchy bodies
sachet and around the White House.

1489
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,270
I know that, that was funny, Huh?

1490
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:29,520
The sound of their milk wide hips
hitting that fucking suit material.

1491
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,480
Nationwide healthcare.
She's walking around the Oval Office,

1492
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:45,390
both of them. Eh, you know
something I'm going to,

1493
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,330
I'm going to vote them
that in my lifetime.

1494
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,490
The too bitchy is that's the
bitchy is tandem. That is ever,

1495
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:58,240
ever been in the White House. You know
what I mean? I'll tell you right now, I,

1496
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,280
and I didn't vote for four,

1497
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,180
actually [inaudible] 96 actually in
[inaudible] 96 I did vote for Clinton,

1498
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:07,560
but after that I've just gone rogue
because then Clinton just turned out to be

1499
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:11,010
the same fucking dude that,
that, that, that other guy,

1500
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,290
the angry guy with the
pen bombed. All right? He,

1501
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:18,390
he did the same shit. They
all do the same shit. Oh,

1502
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:21,300
you fucking morons who voted for
Obama and now you're surprised.

1503
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:25,110
Can you believe he's pretty much
doing what Mccain would have done?

1504
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,970
And I'm not talking about the taxes.
Shit. I'm talking about the Afghans.

1505
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:33,930
Yana fucking, I don't even know what
I'm talking about, but I'm sick.

1506
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:36,360
All you douchebags bitching
about all the taxes.

1507
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:38,460
Do you really think you're
going to have to fucking wars?

1508
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:44,710
And at some point when all the rich
people get up from the table after that,

1509
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,580
they fucking chewing scroll.
And when you did that,

1510
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:50,670
you walked in with your buddies and you
ordered a big fucking meal and when the

1511
01:39:50,671 --> 01:39:51,690
waitress went up to bar,

1512
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:55,980
y'all ran out the door and you jumped
into your fucking AMC Gremlin and drove

1513
01:39:55,981 --> 01:40:00,570
away laughing, laughing your ass off.
And that poor broad had to pay for it.

1514
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:04,860
Do you know that there's
a place in Norwood,

1515
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:09,861
Massachusetts called the Cafe Venice
and I did that 20 years ago and I still

1516
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:14,400
feel guilty about it.
I went in there,

1517
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:17,610
and I'm not going to name names,
but it was a bunch of names.

1518
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:22,611
There's too many names to name and we
stood up and we were going to pay and we

1519
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:24,991
end.

1520
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:29,991
The waitress was just not there and we
just waited and waited and waited and

1521
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:35,430
waited and I'm like,
where the fuck is she?

1522
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:39,030
And then there was that
tension and there was somebody,

1523
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:44,270
there was this weird laugh and somebody
out of the group walked out the door and

1524
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:48,540
then there was that panic. Oh my God,
it was like that musical chair game.

1525
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:51,450
You didn't want to be the last one
standing when the music's playing,

1526
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,300
playing cause then you got to pay for
check and then we all just fucking

1527
01:40:57,350 --> 01:41:00,500
just bursted out the door.
And I remember,

1528
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,630
cause it was really
dark in the cafe Venice,

1529
01:41:02,631 --> 01:41:04,220
I don't even know if
it even exists anymore.

1530
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:06,410
And then we went out into the sunlight,

1531
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:10,970
couldn't fucking see shit just running
towards something that looked like the

1532
01:41:10,971 --> 01:41:13,640
shape of our car.
Just that young

1533
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,930
fucking energy that you had.

1534
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,700
We could actually be stuffed with food
and still run and laugh and still get

1535
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:22,570
away,
you know?

1536
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:27,450
And we just got in the car and just
laughed our asses off the hallway.

1537
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,121
And I immediately,

1538
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:31,240
afterwards I felt guilty because I
knew that she would have to pay for it.

1539
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,210
And uh,
this is how young I was.

1540
01:41:35,211 --> 01:41:40,100
I actually ordered a large
milk with my Italian meal.

1541
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:47,060
I was like 18 or 19 and I was one of
those guys who just never stopped drinking

1542
01:41:47,061 --> 01:41:49,640
milk. I didn't stop drinking
milk until I was like, I dunno.

1543
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:53,690
Somewhere in my fucking late
twenties. I used to drink. I loved it.

1544
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:58,340
I loved the nice cold glass of fucking
milk. And I had it with like every meal.

1545
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,220
And it was, you know, my first
time at 18, we're all the same.

1546
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:05,050
Not realize that you're
hanging out with the adults.

1547
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:10,051
I had just graduated high school and
everybody's ordering and they're going,

1548
01:42:10,381 --> 01:42:12,580
yeah, let me get, let me get a, you know,

1549
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:15,760
some folk eleague atony with
the fucking meat sauce over,

1550
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:18,700
then I'll get a fucking coke in a while.

1551
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:22,410
Every is ordering coke's a bear and
blah, blah, blah. And I was like, uh, oh,

1552
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:26,830
have this spaghetti and meatballs
and I a have a large milk.

1553
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:31,000
And there was this pause and then,
ugh, the ball breaking began in,

1554
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:35,500
it never fucking ended for the
rest of it, you know, and uh,

1555
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,440
whatever. I Dunno what the
fuck I'm saying. What the
fuck am I saying? Oh yeah,

1556
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:44,520
yeah. So they, they, we got to
fucking wars for eight goddamn years.

1557
01:42:44,521 --> 01:42:48,830
And then all the corporations got up from
the table, ran out to their fucking, uh,

1558
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,830
top of the line,
bulletproof SUV.

1559
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:57,630
And they drove off and yet they left us
with the tab and all you guys think that

1560
01:42:57,631 --> 01:42:59,040
we're not going to have to pay it back.

1561
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:03,090
You think the taxes aren't coming to
fuck. They're coming. Oh, they're coming.

1562
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:08,040
There you go. That was my fucking
what's going on with the world

1563
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,750
now?
Fuck you go fuck.

1564
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,310
Yourself's whatever. I made it to an hour.
I made another one. That's all it is.

1565
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,713
That's all it is.

1566
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:22,690
It's like the drew Carey show the last
nine seasons where they'd just go and

1567
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:27,290
whatever. It's syndication
money. Who gives a fuck?
Let's just bring in some fat,

1568
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:32,180
broad with crazy makeup and have drew
yell at her. When people watch it, great.

1569
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:37,100
We'll all get fucking paid.
We're all going to get fucking paid hate.

1570
01:43:37,101 --> 01:43:38,900
Anybody read that story in that magazine?

1571
01:43:38,901 --> 01:43:42,650
I think it was Esquire magazine about
that guy who fucking went on the prices.

1572
01:43:42,651 --> 01:43:47,650
Right and like a card counter.
He, he just fee broke the bank.

1573
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:52,160
He won both showcases in the 37
years or whatever. This shows the

1574
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,050
prices right,
has been on the air.

1575
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:59,110
No one has ever guessed
the exact amount of Ah,

1576
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,420
the showcase that they bid
on and this guy did it.

1577
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:04,420
And all you have to do is come
within 50 bucks or 100 bucks.

1578
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:08,380
And you went both showcases.
And this guy, he fucking,

1579
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,410
he nailed bullshit.
He hit it right on the head.

1580
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:17,170
And so the point they thought
he was cheating because
everybody was winning that

1581
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:21,250
day and they can't figure it out if it
was him or if it was this other guy in

1582
01:44:21,251 --> 01:44:24,400
the audience who was fucking tip and
people off because they were given away

1583
01:44:24,401 --> 01:44:27,850
cars. And I guess the price is
right, has to pay for the prizes.

1584
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:32,110
So evidently drew Carey didn't think
that the episode was going to air.

1585
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:35,080
So he was kind of a Dick
when he said you won both.

1586
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:38,320
And then I guess they ended up fucking
airing it during like a sweeps week.

1587
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:42,100
So he kind of looked like a dick,
but, uh, I guess, uh, prices, right?

1588
01:44:42,101 --> 01:44:44,540
People were not thrilled.
So is this,

1589
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,330
this whole article and he's saying the,
uh,

1590
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:50,860
he's only guilty of being
an avid fan of the show.

1591
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:55,740
And the prices right fucked up by,
they would have reoccurring prices.

1592
01:44:56,230 --> 01:45:01,070
I'm re re reoccurring prizes. Like they
had some sort of smoke around there,

1593
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:05,330
one of those eggs, smokers. You've
ever seen those fucking things. Um,

1594
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,140
and he knew the exact fucking price of it.
So when he was in contestants row,

1595
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:15,400
they will like the egg smoker and
somebody was like 1500 and he goes,

1596
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:19,360
you know, and if you don't know the
exact prices, suddenly says 1500,

1597
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:23,180
you think it's about 1500?
Usually go 15. Oh one. Okay.

1598
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,940
Or you say 1200 to try and get the
next, you know, 300 in your favor.

1599
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,010
He said like,
fucking a,

1600
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:35,020
I'm going to go with the
1478 and he nailed it first.

1601
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:38,530
Fred fucking flat. Am I really going
to go through the whole episode?

1602
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:40,390
It's out there people.

1603
01:45:40,391 --> 01:45:44,400
But we'll have go to the [inaudible]
podcast.com this weekend I'm going to be

1604
01:45:44,401 --> 01:45:46,770
down in La Jolla,
California,

1605
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:49,710
just outside of San Diego
playing the comedy store,

1606
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:53,790
my home away from home out here in La.
I'm going to do the one down in La Jolla.

1607
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:58,110
And, uh, bring your ass down
there. I got a brand new hour shit.

1608
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:01,180
And uh,
I cannot wait to go down there.

1609
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:05,430
I'm going to spend the fucking weekend
down there, get a sunburn on the beach,

1610
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,520
maybe do a little golfing. And,
uh, even though I don't golf,

1611
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,870
I just like fucking,
you know,

1612
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:14,840
going out there and slowing it down
for the other cuts on the course.

1613
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:19,940
And that's it. That's the podcast for
this week. God bless all he is. And, uh,

1614
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,420
by the way, in two weeks, I want to be
at the Newport Yannick Center in Newport,

1615
01:46:23,421 --> 01:46:24,080
Rhode Island,

1616
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,780
and I'm going to be at the Hampton
Beach Ballroom Casino in Hampton,

1617
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:30,050
New Hampshire. Uh, I got to
sell a ton of fucking tickets.

1618
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:33,050
So if you're not doing
anything for the love of God,

1619
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:35,900
you and all your friends come on down,
get hammered.

1620
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,960
If you're the waitress from the
cafe Venice, please show up.

1621
01:46:38,961 --> 01:46:42,830
I'll give you a DVD and I'll give you
the fucking hundred bucks with interest

1622
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,690

Oh yes,

1623
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:48,270

All right, everybody have a good week.
