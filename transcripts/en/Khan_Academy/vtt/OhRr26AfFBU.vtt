00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
 

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's do another problem from
the normal distribution section

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.867
of ck12.org's AP
Statistics book.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:11.700
And I'm using this
because it's open source.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.070
It's actually quite a good book.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.580
The problems are, I think,
good practice for us.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.809
So let's see, number
three, number two.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.350
You can go to their
site, and I think

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.740
you can download the book.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.540
Assume that the mean weight of
one-year-old girls in the US

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.479
is normally distributed with
a mean of about 9.5 grams.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.950
That's got to be kilograms.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.460
I have a 10-month-old son,
and he weighs about 20 pounds,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.840
which is about 9 kilograms.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.170
9.5 grams is nothing.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.782
This would be if we were talking
about like mice or something.

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:44.990
This has got to be kilograms.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.490
But anyway.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.340
It's about 9.5 kilograms
with a standard deviation

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.130
of approximately 1.1 grams.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.260
So the mean is equal to 9.5
kilograms, I'm assuming,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.240
and the standard deviation
is equal to 1.1 grams.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.520
Without using a
calculator-- so that's

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.620
an interesting clue--
estimate the percentage

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.990
of one-year-old
girls in the US that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.330
meet the following condition.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.680
So when they say that--
"without a calculator estimate,"

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.540
that's a big clue
or a big giveaway

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.820
that we're supposed to
use the empirical rule,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.630
sometimes called the
68, 95, 99.7 rule.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.916
And if you remember, this
is the name of the rule.

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.540
You've essentially
remembered the rule.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.550
What that tells us is if we
have a normal distribution--

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.540
I'll do a bit of a
review here before we

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.045
jump into this problem.

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:38.540
If we have a normal
distribution--

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.400
let me draw a
normal distribution.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.030
So it looks like that.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.280
That's my normal distribution.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.321
I didn't draw it perfectly,
but you get the idea.

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:47.620
It should be symmetrical.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.130
This is our mean right there.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.860
That's our mean.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.180
If we go one standard
deviation above the mean,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.760
and one standard
deviation below the mean--

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.960
so this is our mean plus
one standard deviation,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.780
this is our mean minus
one standard deviation--

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.100
the probability of
finding a result,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.690
if we're dealing with a perfect
normal distribution that's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.790
between one standard deviation
below the mean and one

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.050
standard deviation above the
mean, that would be this area.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.100
And it would be-- you
could guess-- 68%,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.190
68% chance you're
going to get something

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.780
within one standard
deviation of the mean,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.520
either a standard deviation
below or above or anywhere

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.630
in between.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.064
Now if we're talking about
two standard deviations

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:35.480
around the mean--
so if we go down

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.940
another standard deviation.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.030
So we go down another
standard deviation

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.140
in that direction and
another standard deviation

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.830
above the mean.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.330
And we were to ask
ourselves, what's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.320
the probability of finding
something within those two

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.870
or within that range?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.780
Then it's, you
could guess it, 95%.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.260
And that includes this
middle area right here.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.552
So the 68% is a subset of 95%.

00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:58.260
And I think you know
where this is going.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.240
If we go three standard
deviations below the mean

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.520
and above the mean, the
empirical rule, or the 68, 95,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.280
99.7 rule tells us
that there is a 99.7%

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.240
chance of finding a result
in a normal distribution that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.240
is within three standard
deviations of the mean.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.220
So above three standard
deviations below the mean,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.070
and below three standard
deviations above the mean.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890
That's what the
empirical rule tells us.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.004
Now, let's see if we can
apply it to this problem.

00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:33.170
So they gave us the mean
and the standard deviation.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.620
Let me draw that out.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.580
Let me draw my axis
first, as best as I can.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.720
That's my axis.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.250
Let me draw my bell curve.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.040
Let me draw the bell curve.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.540
That's about as
good of a bell curve

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.960
as you can expect a
freehand drawer to do.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.662
And the mean here is-- and
this should be symmetric.

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:55.870
This height should be the
same as that height, there.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.770
I think you get the idea.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.330
I'm not a computer.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.401
9.5 is the mean.

00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:03.400
I won't write the units.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.700
It's all in kilograms.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.420
One standard deviation
above the mean,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.750
we should add 1.1 to that.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.260
Because they told us the
standard deviation is 1.1.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.597
That's going to be 10.6.

00:04:17.597 --> 00:04:19.430
Let me just draw a
little dotted line there.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.870
Once standard deviation
below the mean,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.990
we're going to
subtract 1.1 from 9.5.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.540
And so that would be, what?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.520
8.4.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.680
If we go two standard
deviations above the mean,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.437
we would add another
standard deviation here.

00:04:40.437 --> 00:04:42.770
We went one standard deviation,
two standard deviations.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.920
That one goes to 11.7.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.110
And if we were to go
three standard deviations,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.935
we'd add 1.1 again.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.770
That would get us to 12.8.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.660
Doing that on the other
side-- one standard deviation

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.160
below the mean is 8.4.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.930
Two standard deviations below
the mean, subtract 1.1 again,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.050
would be 7.3.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.290
And then three standard
deviations below the mean,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.460
it would be right there,
would be 6.2 kilograms.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.000
So that's our setup
for the problem.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.374
So what's the
probability that we

00:05:10.374 --> 00:05:14.220
would find a one-year-old
girl in the US

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.790
that weighs less
than 8.4 kilograms?

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.760
Or maybe I should say whose
mass is less than 8.4 kilograms.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.190
So if we look here, the
probability of finding a baby

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.860
or a female baby that's
one-years-old with a mass

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.594
or a weight of less
than 8.4 kilograms,

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:31.760
that's this area right here.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.775
I said mass because kilograms
is actually a unit of mass.

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:37.130
But most people use
it as weight, as well.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.590
So that's in that
area right there.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.570
So how can we
figure out that area

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.300
under this normal distribution
using the empirical rule?

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.340
Well, we know what this area is.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.430
We know what this area between
minus one standard deviation

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.550
and plus one standard
deviation is.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.640
We know that that is 68%.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.890
And if that's 68%, then
that means in the parts that

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.370
aren't in that middle
region, you have 32%.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.590
Because the area under the
entire normal distribution

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.295
is 100, or 100%, or
1, depending on how

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:11.420
you want to think about it.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.620
Because you can't have-- well,
all the possibilities combined

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.800
can only add up to 1.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.600
You can't have more
than 100% there.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.980
So if you add up this leg
and this leg-- so this plus

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.620
that leg is going
to be the remainder.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.720
So 100 minus 68, that's 32%.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.510
And 32% is if you add up this
left leg and this right leg

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.400
over here.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.250
And this is a perfect
normal distribution.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.950
They told us it's
normally distributed.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.950
So it's going to be
perfectly symmetrical.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.980
So if this side and
that side add up to 32,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.640
but they're both
symmetrical-- meaning

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.630
they have the exact
same area-- then

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.260
this side right
here-- do it in pink.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.010
This side right
here-- it ended up

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.120
looking more like
purple-- would be 16%.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.880
And this side right
here would be 16%.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.590
So your probability of
getting a result more than one

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.410
standard deviation
above the mean--

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.790
so that's this right-hand
side-- would be 16%.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.900
Or the probability
of having a result

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.150
less than one standard deviation
below the mean-- that's

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.210
this, right here, 16%.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.100
So they want to know the
probability of having a baby,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.210
at one-years-old, less
than 8.4 kilograms.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.150
Less than 8.4 kilograms
is this area right here,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.530
and that's 16%.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.540
So that's 16% for Part
A. Let's do Part B.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.490
Between 7.3 and 11.7
kilograms-- so between 7.3,

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.460
that's right there.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.290
That's two standard
deviations below the mean.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.966
And 11.7-- it's two standard
deviations above the mean.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:50.590
So they're essentially
asking us what's

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.480
the probability of getting
a result within two

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.280
standard deviations of the mean.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.190
This was the mean, right here.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.290
This is two standard
deviations below.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.770
This is two standard
deviations above.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.270
Well, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.440
The empirical rule
tells us-- between two

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.160
standard deviations,
you have a 95% chance

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.310
of getting bad results,
or a 95% chance

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.260
of getting a result that is
within two standard deviations.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.980
So the empirical rule
just gives us that answer.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.590
And then finally, Part
C-- the probability

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.990
of having a one-year-old US baby
girl more than 12.8 kilograms.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.390
So 12.8 kilograms is
three standard deviations

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.860
above the mean.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.256
So we want to know the
probability of having a result

00:08:34.256 --> 00:08:36.380
more than three standard
deviations above the mean.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.200
So that is this area way out
there, that I drew in orange.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.030
Maybe I should do it
in a different color

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.450
to really contrast it.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.850
So it's this long tail out
here, this little small area.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.150
So what is that probability?

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.610
So let's turn back to
our empirical rule.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.300
Well, we know this area.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.640
We know the area between minus
three standard deviations

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.020
and plus three
standard deviations.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.995
We know this.

00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:05.620
Since this is the last problem,
I can color the whole thing in.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.380
We know this area, right here--
between minus 3 and plus 3.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.340
That is 99.7%.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.080
The bulk of the results
fall under there-- I mean,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.402
almost all of them.

00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:20.360
So what do we have left
over for the two tails?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.610
Remember, there are two tails.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.460
This is one of them.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.380
And then you have
the results that

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.180
are less than three
standard deviations

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.620
below the mean, this
tail right there.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.610
So that tells us that this less
than three standard deviations

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.870
below the mean and more than
three standard deviations

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.290
above the mean combined
have to be the rest.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.300
Well, the rest--
it's only 0.3%.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.110
for the rest.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.650
 

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.280
And these two things
are symmetrical.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.760
They're going to be equal.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.750
So this right here it has to
be half of this, or 0.15%,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.270
and this, right here,
is going to be 0.15%.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.150
So the probability of
having a one-year-old baby

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.740
girl in the US that is
more than 12.8 kilograms,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.640
if you assume a perfect
normal distribution,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.090
is the area under this
curve, the area that

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.480
is more than three standard
deviations above the mean.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.830
And that is 0.15%.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.720
Anyway, hope you
found that useful.
