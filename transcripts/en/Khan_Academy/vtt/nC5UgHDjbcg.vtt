00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:03.411
- [Voiceover] A particle moves
along the curve xy equals 16,

00:00:03.411 --> 00:00:05.180
so that the y coordinate is increasing,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.259
we underline this, the y
coordinate is increasing

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.569
at a constant rate of
two units per minute.

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.565
That means that the rate of
change of y with respect to t

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:15.588
is equal to two.

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:17.824
What is the magnitude,
in units per minute,

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:20.550
of the particle's velocity vector when the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.534
particle is at the point
four comma four, so when

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:25.617
x is four, and y is four.

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.093
So let's see what's going on.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.783
So, let's first just
remind ourselves what a

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:36.321
velocity vector, what the
velocity vector will look like.

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:40.274
So our velocity is going
to be a function of time.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.911
And it's going to have two components,

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.904
it's going to be what is
the rate of change in the x

00:00:43.904 --> 00:00:46.435
direction, and the rate of
change in the y direction.

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:48.670
So the rate of change in
the x direction is going to

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.460
be dx dt, and the rate of
change in the y direction

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.210
is going to be dy dt.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:59.545
And they tell us that this
is, that dy dt is a constant

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.057
two units per minute.

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:03.408
But they're not even
just asking us for just

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.028
the velocity vector for its components,

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:09.102
they're asking for the magnitude,

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.083
they're asking for the
magnitude of the particle's

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.416
velocity vector.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.650
Well, if I have some vector,
let me do a little bit of a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.483
side here, if I have
some vector, let's say a,

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:27.499
that has components b and
c, well then the magnitude

00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:32.032
of my vector, sometimes you'll
see it written like that,

00:01:32.032 --> 00:01:34.862
sometimes you'll see it
written with double bars

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.407
like that, the magnitude of my vector,

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:40.517
and this comes straight out
of the Pythagorean theorem,

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.714
this is going to be the
square root of b squared

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:45.572
plus c squared.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.004
The square root of the
x component squared plus

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:49.652
the y component squared.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:52.705
So, if we wanted the magnitude
of our velocity vector,

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:56.705
the magnitude of the
particle's velocity vector,

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:02.051
well I could write that
as the magnitude of v,

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:04.066
I could even write it as a function of t,

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.770
it's going to be equal to the square root

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.529
of the x component squared,
so that's the rate of change

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.356
of x with respect to time, squared,

00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:18.356
plus the y component
squared, which in this case

00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:24.075
is the rate of change of y,
with respect to t, squared.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:26.931
So how do we figure out
these, how do we figure out

00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:28.908
these two things?

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:30.975
Well we already know
the rate of change of y

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:32.745
with respect to t, they say
that's a constant rate of

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:34.263
two units per minute.

00:02:34.263 --> 00:02:37.166
So we already know that
this is gonna be two,

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:39.879
or that this whole thing right
over here's gonna be four,

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.056
but how do we figure
out the rate of change

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:42.993
of x with respect to t?

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:47.160
Well, we could take our
original equation that describes

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:52.054
the curve, we could take
the derivative of both sides

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:54.260
with respect to t, and
then that's going to give

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.912
us an equation that involves
xy and dx dt and dy dt,

00:02:58.912 --> 00:02:59.796
so let's do that.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.213
So we have xy is equal to 16,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.815
I'm gonna to take the
derivative with respect to t,

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:12.148
of both sides, we do that
in a different color,

00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:14.817
just for a little bit of variety,

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:17.638
so the derivative with respect
to t of the left hand side,

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:20.862
derivative with respect to
t of the right hand side,

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:22.589
now the left hand side,
we view this as a product

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.403
of two functions, if we say,
look, x is a function of t,

00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:27.258
and y is also a function
of t, this is we're

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:28.859
gonna do a little bit of the product rule

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.877
and a little bit of the chain rule here.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.805
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:36.722
derivative of the first
function, which is, so,

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:42.113
we'll first say the derivative
of x with respect to x

00:03:42.113 --> 00:03:45.854
is one, times the derivative
of x with respect to t.

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:47.702
Remember, taking the derivative
with respect to t, not

00:03:47.702 --> 00:03:51.157
with respect to x, times
the second function,

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:54.157
so times, times the second function,

00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:59.528
so times y, times y,
plus, the first function,

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.275
which is just x, times the
derivative of the second

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.184
function with respect to t.

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:12.104
So first what's the derivative
of y with respect to y,

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:15.004
well that's just one, and
then what's the derivative

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:18.504
of y with respect to t, well that's dy dt,

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:25.233
and that is going to be equal to,

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.275
that is going to be equal
to, derivative of a constant

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:29.358
is just zero.

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:32.735
So let's see, what does this simplify to,

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.873
this simplifies to, in
fact we don't even have

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:36.528
to simplify it more,
we can actually plug in

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:39.526
the values to solve for dx dt.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:42.609
We know that dy dt is a constant two,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.085
and we want the magnitude
of the particle's

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.601
velocity vector when the
particle's at the point

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:53.062
four comma four, so
when x is equal to four,

00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:57.229
so when x is equal to four,
and y is equal to four,

00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:01.024
and y is equal to four.

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:03.514
So now, it's a little messy right now,

00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:05.251
but this right here is an
equation we can solve for,

00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:06.473
there's only one unknown here,

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.115
the rate of change of x with respect to t,

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:12.154
right when we are at the
point four comma four,

00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:13.625
and so if we're able to figure that out,

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.180
we can substitute that
in here and figure out

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.627
the magnitude of our velocity vector.

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:19.516
So let us write it out,

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:22.349
so this gives us four, four dx dt,

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.621
plus what is this four times two,

00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:31.574
plus eight is equal to
zero, and so we have

00:05:31.574 --> 00:05:34.741
four dx dt is equal to negative eight,

00:05:36.197 --> 00:05:37.682
just subtracted eight from both sides,

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:41.463
divide both sides by four, you get dx dt,

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:44.630
scroll down, is equal to negative two.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.161
So when all this stuff
is going on the rate of

00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:52.832
change of x with respect
to t is negative two,

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:57.048
and then you square it, you
get a four, right over here,

00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:59.614
and so the magnitude
of our velocity vector

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:03.781
is going to be equal to the
square root of four plus four,

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:09.254
which is equal to eight,
which is the same thing as

00:06:09.254 --> 00:06:12.136
four times two, so this is going to be

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:15.553
two square root of two, units per minute,

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:20.763
so that's the magnitude
of the velocity vector.
