00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.010
A club of nine people wants
to choose a board of three

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.600
officers, President, Vice
President, and Secretary.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.520
Assuming the officers are chosen
at random, what is the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.390
probability that the officers
are Marcia for president,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.300
Sabita for Vice President,
and Robert for Secretary?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.510
So to think about the
probability of Marcia-- so let

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.795
me write this-- President is
equal to Marcia, or Vice

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:34.500
President is equal
to Sabita, and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.375
Secretary is equal to Robert.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.630
This, right here, is one
possible outcome,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.705
one specific outcome.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:49.240
So it's one outcome out of the
total number of outcomes, over

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.915
the total number of
possibilities.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.000
Now what is the total number
of possibilities?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.670
Well to think about that, let's
just think about the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.980
three positions.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.920
You have President, you
have Vice President,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.670
and you have Secretary.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.860
Now let's just assume that we're
going to fill the slot

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.060
of President first. We don't
have to do President first,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.370
but we're just going
to pick here.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.940
So if we're just picking
President first, we haven't

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.880
assigned anyone to any officers
just yet, so we have

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.630
nine people to choose from.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.950
So there are nine possibilities
here.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.530
Now, when we go to selecting our
Vice President, we would

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.330
have already assigned one
person to the President.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.740
So we only have eight
people to pick from.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100
And when we assign our
Secretary, we would've already

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.570
assigned our President and Vice
President, so we're only

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.830
going to have seven people
to pick from.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.190
So the total permutations here
or the total number of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.850
possibilities, or the total
number of ways, to pick

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.820
President, Vice President, and
Secretary from nine people, is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990
going to be 9 times 8 times 7.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.310
Which is, let's see,
9 times 8 is 72.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.890
72 times 7, 2 times 7 is 14, 7
times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.620
So there's 504 possibilities.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.789
So to answer the question, the
probability of Marcia being

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.080
President, Sabita being Vice
President, and Robert being

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.880
Secretary is 1 over the total
number of possibilities, which

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.960
is 1 over 504.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.780
That's the probability.
