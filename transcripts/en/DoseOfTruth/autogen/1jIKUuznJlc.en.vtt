and found exactly that and that the and
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770
and found exactly that and that the and
that the illiberal left was also high

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
that the illiberal left was also high
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.469
and orderliness
that's interests the authoritarian

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
that's interests the authoritarian
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.310
that's interests the authoritarian
exactly yeah and also kind of markedly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
