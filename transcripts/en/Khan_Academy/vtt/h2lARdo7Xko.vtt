00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.261
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:06.046
is explore the relationship
between local linearity

00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:10.295
at a point and
differentiability at a point.

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:13.407
So local linearity is this
idea that if we zoom in

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:15.264
sufficiently on a point,

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:17.888
that even a non-linear
function that is differentiable

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:21.302
at that point will actually look linear.

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:23.531
So let me show some examples of that.

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:25.504
So let's say we had y

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.421
is equal to

00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.404
x squared.

00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.517
So that's that there, clearly
a non-linear function.

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:34.862
But we can zoom in on a point,

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:37.486
and if we zoom sufficiently in,

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.063
we will see that it looks roughly linear.

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:43.221
So let's say we wanna zoom in
on the point one comma one,

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.289
so let's do that.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.285
So zooming in on the point one comma one,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:52.068
already it is looking
roughly linear at that point.

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:54.924
And this property of local linearity

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:56.526
is very helpful

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:59.824
when trying to approximate
a function around a point.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:01.403
So for example, we could figure out,

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:04.119
we could take the derivative
at the point one one,

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.348
use that as the slope of our tangent line,

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:08.438
find the equation of the tangent line,

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:11.735
and use that equation
to approximate values

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.568
of our function around

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.814
x equals one.

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.005
And you might not need to do that

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.141
for y is equal to x squared,

00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:21.859
but it could actually be very very useful

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.390
for a more complex function.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.807
But the big takeaway here,

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:27.479
at the point one one,

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.171
it is displaying this
idea of local linearity,

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:34.468
and it is also
differentiable at that point.

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:35.815
Now let's look at another example

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:38.508
of a point on a function

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:40.273
where we aren't differentiable,

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:43.152
and we also don't see the local linearity.

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:44.402
So for example,

00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:46.311
let's do the

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.440
absolute value of x,

00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:52.626
and let me shift it over a little bit

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.596
just so that we don't overlap as much.

00:01:56.596 --> 00:02:01.078
Alright, so the absolute
value of x minus one.

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:03.307
It actually is differentiable

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:06.140
as long as we're not at
this corner right over here,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.042
as long as we're not at
the point one comma zero.

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:12.131
For any other x value,
it is differentiable,

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.360
but right at x equals one,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.730
we've talked in other videos

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.052
how we aren't differentiable there.

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:20.258
And then we can use this
local linearity idea

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:21.929
to test it as well.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.158
And once again, this is
not rigorous mathematics,

00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:26.202
but it is to give you an intuition.

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:28.619
No matter how far we zoom in,

00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:32.221
we still see this sharp corner.

00:02:33.284 --> 00:02:36.256
It would be hard to construct
the only tangent line,

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:40.691
a unique line, that goes through
this point one comma zero.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.060
I can construct an actual
infinite number of lines

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.265
that go through one comma zero

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.563
but that do not go through
the rest of the curve.

00:02:48.563 --> 00:02:49.793
And so notice,

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:51.930
wherever you see a hard
corner like we're seeing

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.087
at one comma zero in this
absolute value function,

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:56.736
that's a pretty good indication

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:59.058
that we are not going to be differentiable

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:00.225
at that point.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.214
Now let's zoom out a little bit,

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:04.584
and let's take another function.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.767
Let's take a function where

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.252
the differentiability or the
lack of differentiability

00:03:09.252 --> 00:03:10.761
is not because of a corner,

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:12.944
but it's because as we zoom in,

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.314
it starts to look linear,

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:16.566
but it starts to look
like a vertical line.

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.725
So a good example of that would be

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:19.892
square root of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.742
let's say

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:24.742
four minus x squared.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:30.080
So that's the top half of
a circle of radius two.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.354
And let's focus on the
point two comma zero.

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:34.631
Because right over there,

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.930
we actually are not differentiable,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.903
and if we zoom in far enough,

00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:41.086
we see right at two comma zero

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.803
that we are approaching

00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:46.470
what looks like a vertical line.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.956
So once again,

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:54.600
we would not be differentiable
at two comma zero.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.086
Now another thing I wanna point out,

00:03:56.086 --> 00:03:58.617
all of these, you really
didn't have to zoom in too much

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.568
to appreciate that hey I got a corner here

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:02.263
on this absolute value function,

00:04:02.263 --> 00:04:05.769
or at two comma zero, or
at negative two comma zero,

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.603
something a little bit
stranger than normal

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:10.831
is happening there, so maybe
I'm not differentiable.

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:14.221
But there are some functions
that we don't see as typically

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.077
in a algebra or precalculus
or calculus class,

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:19.933
but it can look like a hard corner

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:22.023
from a zoomed out perspective,

00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:24.972
but as we zoom in once again
we'll see the local linearity,

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:28.223
and they are also
differentiable at those points.

00:04:28.223 --> 00:04:29.964
So a good example of that,

00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:32.170
let me actually get rid of some of these

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.515
just so that we can really zoom in.

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:36.598
Let's say y is equal to x

00:04:37.882 --> 00:04:41.179
to the, and I'm gonna make
a very large exponent here,

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:42.921
so x to the 10th power.

00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:45.707
It's starting to look at
little bit like a corner there.

00:04:45.707 --> 00:04:47.727
Let's make it to the 100th power.

00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:50.142
Well now it's looking even
more like a corner there.

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:52.580
Let me go to the 1,000th
power just for good measure.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.136
So at this scale,

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.505
it looks like we have
a corner at the point

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.755
one comma zero.

00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:00.731
Now this curve actually
does not go to the point

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.588
one comma zero.

00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:03.935
If x is one,

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:05.444
then y is going to be one,

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:07.464
and we'll see that as we zoom in,

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:09.624
this what looks like a hard corner

00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:11.551
is going to soften.

00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:13.385
And that's good because this function

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:16.845
is actually differentiable
at every value of x.

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:17.937
It's a little bit more exotic

00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:19.167
that what we typically see,

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:21.420
but as we zoom in,
we'll actually see that.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.045
Let's just zoom in on what looks like

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:25.483
a fairly hard corner,

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:27.573
but if we zoom sufficiently enough,

00:05:27.573 --> 00:05:29.732
even at the part that
looks like the hardest part

00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:30.847
of the corner,

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:33.169
the real corner, we'll see
that it starts to soften

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.701
and it curves.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.466
And if we zoom in sufficiently,

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:39.624
it will actually look like a line.

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:41.783
It's hard to believe when
you're really zoomed out,

00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:44.593
and I'm going at the point that
really looked like a corner

00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:46.613
from a distance.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:48.448
But as we zoom on in,

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.349
we see once again this local linearity

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.276
that's a non-vertical line.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.830
And so once again, this is true
at any point on this curve,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.198
that we are going to be differentiable.

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:00.568
So the whole point here is,

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.078
sometimes you might have to zoom in a lot,

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:04.516
a tool like Desmos which
I'm using right now

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.513
is very helpful for doing that.

00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:09.369
And this isn't rigorous mathematics,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.784
but it's to give you an intuitive sense

00:06:11.784 --> 00:06:13.641
that if you zoom in sufficiently,

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.242
and you start to see a
curve looking more and more

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.612
like a line,

00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:19.748
good indication that
you are differentiable.

00:06:19.748 --> 00:06:21.675
If you keep zooming in and it still looks

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:22.999
like a hard corner,

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.462
of if you zoom in and it looks like

00:06:24.462 --> 00:06:26.134
the tangent might be vertical,

00:06:26.134 --> 00:06:29.394
well then some questions
should arise in your brain.
