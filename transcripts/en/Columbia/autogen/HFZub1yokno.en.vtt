building rapport and it's occupied and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580
building rapport and it's occupied and
 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.950
building rapport and it's occupied and
it's a great project so I kind of put

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960
it's a great project so I kind of put
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.650
it's a great project so I kind of put
that on the back burner and when I came

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660
that on the back burner and when I came
 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.180

investigation into hu DC and essentially

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830
investigation into hu DC and essentially
 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.980
investigation into hu DC and essentially
shut it down and I should say that his

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990
shut it down and I should say that his
 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.480
shut it down and I should say that his
investigation was not the first

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490

periodically been investigated by the

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510
periodically been investigated by the
 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.090

city of New York as well as the state of
 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.790
city of New York as well as the state of
New York from the basically from the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800
New York from the basically from the
 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.030
New York from the basically from the
early 1970s onwards and and that was

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040
early 1970s onwards and and that was
 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.100
early 1970s onwards and and that was
another puzzle then how was it that an

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
another puzzle then how was it that an
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.740
another puzzle then how was it that an
organization that seemed to block other

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750
organization that seemed to block other
 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.330

organizations from doing anything in the
 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.420
organizations from doing anything in the
neighborhood and had also been the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
neighborhood and had also been the
 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.910
neighborhood and had also been the
subject of periodic scathing

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920
subject of periodic scathing
 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.720
subject of periodic scathing
investigative reports and to my mind

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730
investigative reports and to my mind
 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.400
investigative reports and to my mind
really had done nothing because

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410
really had done nothing because
 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.800

move into a little bit more about the

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:16.740
mean it really is a really ambitious and
so what I think I would argue is that

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:16.750
so what I think I would argue is that
 

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.900
so what I think I would argue is that
basically CDC's were basically put in a

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:18.910
basically CDC's were basically put in a
 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.819
basically CDC's were basically put in a
virtually impossible position from the

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:20.829
virtually impossible position from the
 

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.410
virtually impossible position from the
very beginning that is they were

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.420
very beginning that is they were
 

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.870
very beginning that is they were
expected to deliver so much when the

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880
expected to deliver so much when the
 

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.179
expected to deliver so much when the
reality given the structural conditions

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:27.189
reality given the structural conditions
 

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:34.019
reality given the structural conditions
was very limited the second thing I

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:34.029
was very limited the second thing I
 

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:36.749
was very limited the second thing I
really want I hope you can take from for

00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:36.759
really want I hope you can take from for
 

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:40.110
really want I hope you can take from for
my for my talk is again the notion of

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120
my for my talk is again the notion of
 

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.970
my for my talk is again the notion of
participation I talked about

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980
participation I talked about
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.590
participation I talked about
accountability but there's also the

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600
accountability but there's also the
 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.829
accountability but there's also the
element of participation again who is

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839
element of participation again who is
 

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.360
element of participation again who is
that community and how does that

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.370
that community and how does that
 

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.170
that community and how does that
community community get involved in

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180
community community get involved in
 

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.420
community community get involved in
developing or shaping that community and

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.430
developing or shaping that community and
 

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.540
developing or shaping that community and
what I found in my case studies is that

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550
what I found in my case studies is that
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.759
what I found in my case studies is that
CDC governance is not necessarily by the

00:10:59.759 --> 00:10:59.769
CDC governance is not necessarily by the
 

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.049
CDC governance is not necessarily by the
people it

00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:01.059

orientation and commitment so the people

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:06.009
orientation and commitment so the people
 

00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:08.879

that interviewed at hgtc felt that even

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:08.889
that interviewed at hgtc felt that even
 

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:10.829
that interviewed at hgtc felt that even
though they may or may not have lived in

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839
though they may or may not have lived in
 

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.109

Harlem they were working for Harlem

00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:13.119
Harlem they were working for Harlem
 

00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:16.039
Harlem they were working for Harlem
based organization and so therefore they

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:16.049
based organization and so therefore they
 

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:18.899
based organization and so therefore they
represented the the needs and desires of

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:18.909
represented the the needs and desires of
 

00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:21.779
represented the the needs and desires of
the community but it's one step removed

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:21.789
the community but it's one step removed
 

00:11:21.789 --> 00:11:24.239
the community but it's one step removed
and so again we have to ask yourself

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:24.249
and so again we have to ask yourself
 

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:26.029
and so again we have to ask yourself
well is that really the kind of a

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:26.039
well is that really the kind of a
 

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:28.399
well is that really the kind of a
participation that we should use to

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:28.409
participation that we should use to
 

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:35.839
participation that we should use to
evaluate and to use as a means of

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:35.849
 

00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:38.389
community other issue of grassroots

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399
community other issue of grassroots
 

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:41.039
community other issue of grassroots
involvement or non-involvement I think

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:41.049
involvement or non-involvement I think
 

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:44.039
involvement or non-involvement I think
again what has happened continuously and

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:44.049
again what has happened continuously and
 

00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:45.719
again what has happened continuously and
still continues to be an issue today is

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:45.729
still continues to be an issue today is
 

00:11:45.729 --> 00:11:48.869
still continues to be an issue today is
a feeling among many longtime Harlem

00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:48.879
a feeling among many longtime Harlem
 

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.999
a feeling among many longtime Harlem
residents that commune development is

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:51.009
residents that commune development is
 

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.159
residents that commune development is
something that happens to them it's not

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:53.169
something that happens to them it's not
 

00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:55.079
something that happens to them it's not
something that they actually engage in

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:55.089
something that they actually engage in
 

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.419
something that they actually engage in
that somehow projects are announced

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:57.429
that somehow projects are announced
 

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.879
that somehow projects are announced
things happen and then they have to sort

00:11:59.879 --> 00:11:59.889
things happen and then they have to sort
 

00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:02.339
things happen and then they have to sort
of react so they really I think the

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:02.349
of react so they really I think the
 

00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:05.879
of react so they really I think the
feeling is that while community

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:05.889
feeling is that while community
 

00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:08.639

development organizations are supposed

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:08.649
development organizations are supposed
 

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:10.619
development organizations are supposed
to allow for a more proactive stance

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:10.629
to allow for a more proactive stance
 

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:14.369
to allow for a more proactive stance
towards the development of a community I

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:14.379
towards the development of a community I
 

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.549
towards the development of a community I
think most ordinary residents feel that

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:17.559
think most ordinary residents feel that
 

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:20.729
think most ordinary residents feel that
they have no sort of say in what even

00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:20.739
they have no sort of say in what even
 

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:23.609
they have no sort of say in what even
commune development organizations do so

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:23.619
commune development organizations do so
 

00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:26.099

something like that and I think it
 

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:39.769
something like that and I think it

organizations I think we tend to think
of organizations as sort of being these

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660
of organizations as sort of being these
 

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.389

organizations come with a lot of baggage

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420

a particular political and social

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.690
a particular political and social
 

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.569
a particular political and social
context and so again that's what I

00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579
context and so again that's what I
 

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:04.429
context and so again that's what I
really want to emphasize about Community

00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439

Development Corporation's in general and

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699
Development Corporation's in general and
 

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:08.720
Development Corporation's in general and
particularly about HUD see is that it

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:08.730
particularly about HUD see is that it
 

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.059
particularly about HUD see is that it
really comes out of a particular moment

00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:11.069
really comes out of a particular moment
 

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.790
really comes out of a particular moment
in time and place and I think for that

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:13.800
in time and place and I think for that
 

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.400
in time and place and I think for that
reason alone you're the evaluation of

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.410
reason alone you're the evaluation of
 

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.470

how HUD HUD see performed is can be

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480
how HUD HUD see performed is can be
 

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.790
how HUD HUD see performed is can be
somewhat tempered I mean I don't think

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:22.800
somewhat tempered I mean I don't think
 

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.290
somewhat tempered I mean I don't think

we can be totally negative about it some
about its performance okay so

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.780
there are a couple sources when we think

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:34.790
there are a couple sources when we think
 

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.750
there are a couple sources when we think
about the about the sort about the

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760

and planners would endorse today but you

00:24:59.580 --> 00:24:59.590
and planners would endorse today but you
 

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.080
and planners would endorse today but you
know they really had a really

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.090
know they really had a really
 

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.110
know they really had a really
significant vision of what could be done

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120
significant vision of what could be done
 

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.720

these these programs another blow comes
and this is basically next thing gets

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:13.690
and this is basically next thing gets
 

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.410

kind of make their own way figure out
 

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.390
kind of make their own way figure out
what what are they supposed to do and

this very very difficult situation and

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640
this very very difficult situation and
 

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.570
this very very difficult situation and
in fact one of the things I talked about

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580
in fact one of the things I talked about
 

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.240
in fact one of the things I talked about
and what you know it's sort of out there

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:57.250
and what you know it's sort of out there
 

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.550
and what you know it's sort of out there
and I think I really a number of

00:25:59.550 --> 00:25:59.560
and I think I really a number of
 

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.990
and I think I really a number of
interesting studies have been done is

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000
interesting studies have been done is
 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.710
interesting studies have been done is
the plan shrinkage of New York City this

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720
the plan shrinkage of New York City this
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.960
the plan shrinkage of New York City this
was something i think it was first kind

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:06.970
was something i think it was first kind
 

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.790
was something i think it was first kind
of floated by roger star who died a

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:08.800
of floated by roger star who died a
 

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.770
of floated by roger star who died a
couple years ago which was the sense

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:10.780
couple years ago which was the sense
 

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.020
couple years ago which was the sense
that

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:11.030
that
 

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.640
that
you know New York City and other big

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:12.650
you know New York City and other big
 

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.470
you know New York City and other big
cities had gotten too big they were sort

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480
cities had gotten too big they were sort
 

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.900
cities had gotten too big they were sort
of obsolete and so really what needed to

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:16.910
of obsolete and so really what needed to
 

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.660
of obsolete and so really what needed to
be done was that cities needed to shrink

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:19.670
be done was that cities needed to shrink
 

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.080
be done was that cities needed to shrink
and the best way to shrink cities was to

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.090
and the best way to shrink cities was to
 

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.470
and the best way to shrink cities was to
withdraw services if you withdrew

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480
withdraw services if you withdrew
 

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.110
withdraw services if you withdrew
services you could get people to move

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120
services you could get people to move
 

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.520
services you could get people to move
out of those areas you can kind of

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:30.530
out of those areas you can kind of
 

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.320
out of those areas you can kind of
basically have an orderly shutdown of

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.330
basically have an orderly shutdown of
 

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.410
basically have an orderly shutdown of
cities now you hear this today and

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:35.420
cities now you hear this today and
 

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.310
cities now you hear this today and
you're thinking well that's not quite

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320
you're thinking well that's not quite
 

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.410
you're thinking well that's not quite
right and it's not quite right there's

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:38.420
right and it's not quite right there's
 

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.480

but they talk about the impact of this

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:45.500
but they talk about the impact of this
 

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.960
but they talk about the impact of this
plan shrinkage and one of the things

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:46.970
plan shrinkage and one of the things
 

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.660
plan shrinkage and one of the things
that they argue is that it in fact

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:48.670
that they argue is that it in fact
 

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.720
that they argue is that it in fact
helped make the AIDS epidemic even worse

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:52.730
helped make the AIDS epidemic even worse
 

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.870
helped make the AIDS epidemic even worse
because it so decimated public services

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880
because it so decimated public services
 

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.930
because it so decimated public services
that when this epidemic hit it really it

00:26:58.930 --> 00:26:58.940
that when this epidemic hit it really it
 

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.680
that when this epidemic hit it really it
was able to spread so HUD see again is

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:02.690
was able to spread so HUD see again is
 

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.180
was able to spread so HUD see again is
in this very very difficult position

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:04.190
in this very very difficult position
 

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.070
in this very very difficult position
because it's not even getting support

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080
because it's not even getting support
 

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.690
because it's not even getting support
from the city in fact the city wants

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:07.700
from the city in fact the city wants
 

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.020

areas like Harlem Coney Island bed-stuy
 

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.630
areas like Harlem Coney Island bed-stuy
to kind of in essence kind of disappear

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640
to kind of in essence kind of disappear
 

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.500
to kind of in essence kind of disappear
at least consolidate so again and again

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:17.510
at least consolidate so again and again
 

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.690
at least consolidate so again and again
HDC is still producing these plans and

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:19.700
HDC is still producing these plans and
 

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.310
HDC is still producing these plans and
still sort of showing them around but

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320
still sort of showing them around but
 

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.260
still sort of showing them around but
you know no there are no takers really

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.270
you know no there are no takers really
 

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.900
you know no there are no takers really
and there's sort of limping along and

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:25.910
and there's sort of limping along and
 

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.000
and there's sort of limping along and
they come upon this idea which is the

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.010
they come upon this idea which is the
 

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:29.670
they come upon this idea which is the
Harlem International Trade Center and

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:29.680
Harlem International Trade Center and
 

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.700
Harlem International Trade Center and
this was really attractive from I think

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:33.710
this was really attractive from I think
 

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.860
this was really attractive from I think
an emotional viewpoint the sense that

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:35.870
an emotional viewpoint the sense that
 

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.080
an emotional viewpoint the sense that
not only was Harlem the capital black

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.090
not only was Harlem the capital black
 

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.060
not only was Harlem the capital black
America but really in some ways who is

the mecca for Africans across the world

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:42.620
the mecca for Africans across the world
 

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.560
the mecca for Africans across the world
the African Diaspora and so they thought

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:44.570
the African Diaspora and so they thought
 

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.970
the African Diaspora and so they thought
if they had this International Trade

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:45.980
if they had this International Trade
 

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.650
if they had this International Trade
Center they could attract more

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:47.660
Center they could attract more
 

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.300

businesses certainly businesses that

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:52.310
businesses certainly businesses that
 

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.550
businesses certainly businesses that
would be interested in maintaining or

strengthening a link link with Harlem

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360
strengthening a link link with Harlem
 

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.230
strengthening a link link with Harlem
and with the African American community

and I think by this time there was a

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:00.770
and I think by this time there was a
 

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.470
and I think by this time there was a
realization I think among not only

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480
realization I think among not only
 

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.020

people in Harlem but in other inner-city
 

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.420
people in Harlem but in other inner-city
areas that any manufacturing that it

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:07.430
areas that any manufacturing that it
 

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.190
areas that any manufacturing that it
existed in the cities essentially were

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200
existed in the cities essentially were
 

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.000
existed in the cities essentially were
coming back and this really kind of

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.010
coming back and this really kind of
 

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.310
coming back and this really kind of
takes out one of the sort of goals of

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320
takes out one of the sort of goals of
 

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.640
takes out one of the sort of goals of
CDC's a lot of CDC's were created

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:18.650
CDC's a lot of CDC's were created
 

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.980
CDC's a lot of CDC's were created
especially in Midwest industrial areas

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:20.990
especially in Midwest industrial areas
 

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.380
especially in Midwest industrial areas
to bring back manufacturing

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:22.390
to bring back manufacturing
 

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:26.040
to bring back manufacturing
and it simply wasn't going to happen for

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.050
and it simply wasn't going to happen for
 

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.550
and it simply wasn't going to happen for
a variety of reasons cost space the

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:29.560
a variety of reasons cost space the
 

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.080
a variety of reasons cost space the
nature of manufacturing itself had

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.090
nature of manufacturing itself had
 

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.820
nature of manufacturing itself had
changed and you know if they weren't

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:32.830
changed and you know if they weren't
 

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.560
changed and you know if they weren't
going to locate in the u.s. I mean they

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:34.570
going to locate in the u.s. I mean they
 

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.330
going to locate in the u.s. I mean they
were going to locate in China or in

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:36.340
were going to locate in China or in
 

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.300
were going to locate in China or in
Mexico or over I mean wherever costs

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.310
Mexico or over I mean wherever costs
 

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.850
Mexico or over I mean wherever costs
labor costs and and other costs for

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:41.860
labor costs and and other costs for
 

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.130
labor costs and and other costs for

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:02.020
really was no way to i mean there was
 

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.130

really wasn't anything that it could do

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:11.850
really wasn't anything that it could do
 

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.280
really wasn't anything that it could do
and one of the reasons why i couldn't do

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:14.290
and one of the reasons why i couldn't do
 

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.870
and one of the reasons why i couldn't do
anything obviously was money but

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880

deep

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:52.129
 

00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:54.649
well what happens and that's a good

00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659
well what happens and that's a good
 

00:29:54.659 --> 00:30:00.320
well what happens and that's a good
question is that I think one of the

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.330
question is that I think one of the
 

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:05.269

ways this huge untapped potential
 

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.389
ways this huge untapped potential
secondly because of the crack epidemic

00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399

would be Harlem because if it's subway

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:37.590
would be Harlem because if it's subway
 

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.649

stock outside of some areas of Brooklyn
 

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.379
stock outside of some areas of Brooklyn
I mean really Harlem was the last area

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:45.389
I mean really Harlem was the last area
 

00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:47.180
I mean really Harlem was the last area
that had this sort of density of

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:47.190
that had this sort of density of
 

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.989
that had this sort of density of
brownstones of really nice potentially

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:50.999
brownstones of really nice potentially
 

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:54.820
brownstones of really nice potentially
nice brownstones as well as vacant land

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:54.830
nice brownstones as well as vacant land
 

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.330
nice brownstones as well as vacant land
so

00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:58.340
 

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.760
HUD see though you know one of the

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:01.770
HUD see though you know one of the
 

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.350
HUD see though you know one of the
things that happens with HUD see and I

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360
things that happens with HUD see and I
 

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.280
things that happens with HUD see and I
think one of the things that we have to

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.290
think one of the things that we have to
 

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.380
think one of the things that we have to
be aware of in terms of these

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:06.390
be aware of in terms of these
 

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.760
be aware of in terms of these
organizations is the question of

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:07.770
organizations is the question of
 

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.490
organizations is the question of
leadership there's the question of

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500
leadership there's the question of
 

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.750
leadership there's the question of
accountability but then also the

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760
accountability but then also the
 

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.910
accountability but then also the
question of well if there's no

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:13.920
question of well if there's no
 

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.260
question of well if there's no
accountability then there's no way to

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:15.270
accountability then there's no way to
 

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.120
accountability then there's no way to
sort of evaluate leadership and

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.130
sort of evaluate leadership and
 

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.610
sort of evaluate leadership and
sometimes quite frankly organizations

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620
sometimes quite frankly organizations
 

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.950
sometimes quite frankly organizations

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.170
the board was a sort of a kind of a
weird board it had a mix of permanent

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:00.180

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.940

just resistant to the notion of
 

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.800
just resistant to the notion of
a community development organization

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:37.810
a community development organization
 

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.160
a community development organization
that was explicitly designed to be under

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.170
that was explicitly designed to be under
 

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.650
that was explicitly designed to be under
the control of the community and it's

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:43.660
the control of the community and it's
 

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.770
the control of the community and it's
it's hard to tell I think it's partially

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:46.780
it's hard to tell I think it's partially
 

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.320
it's hard to tell I think it's partially
both I think that um there was a real

comfortable working with an organization

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.120
comfortable working with an organization
 

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.030
comfortable working with an organization
that really had such a strong stance in

that really had such a strong stance in
 

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.420
that really had such a strong stance in
terms of community control I think that

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.430
terms of community control I think that
 

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.160
terms of community control I think that
the organization itself didn't help its

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:05.170
the organization itself didn't help its
 

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.450
the organization itself didn't help its
own didn't help itself by its it's sort

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:09.460
own didn't help itself by its it's sort
 

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.920
own didn't help itself by its it's sort
of lack of focus and it's sort of

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:10.930
of lack of focus and it's sort of
 

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.930
of lack of focus and it's sort of
lethargy sort of it got older and got

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:12.940
lethargy sort of it got older and got
 

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:18.240
lethargy sort of it got older and got
sort of lethargic so I think that you

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.250
sort of lethargic so I think that you
 

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.860
sort of lethargic so I think that you
know ACDC was put in a very very

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:19.870
know ACDC was put in a very very
 

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:25.980
know ACDC was put in a very very
difficult position and I think that one

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:25.990
difficult position and I think that one
 

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.440

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:22.650
about David Dinkins so I think in many
 

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.520
about David Dinkins so I think in many
ways this was kind of that article was a

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:25.530
ways this was kind of that article was a
 

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.970
ways this was kind of that article was a
reflection of this kind of you know

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:27.980
reflection of this kind of you know
 

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.130
reflection of this kind of you know
these guys who we don't really like

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140
these guys who we don't really like
 

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.470
these guys who we don't really like
because they really don't see themselves

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480
because they really don't see themselves
 

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.579
because they really don't see themselves
as having to sort of kowtow to City Hall

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:36.589
as having to sort of kowtow to City Hall
 

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:38.960
as having to sort of kowtow to City Hall
that they see themselves as really kind

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:38.970
that they see themselves as really kind
 

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.810
that they see themselves as really kind
of separate from and not beholden to the

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:41.820
of separate from and not beholden to the
 

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.940
of separate from and not beholden to the
sort of city establishment so I think

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:43.950
sort of city establishment so I think
 

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.770
sort of city establishment so I think
that's that's part of what's happening

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780
that's that's part of what's happening
 

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.700
that's that's part of what's happening
in that in that article that said I mean

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:49.710
in that in that article that said I mean
 

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.329
in that in that article that said I mean
I think Percy Sutton and wrangle and

00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339
I think Percy Sutton and wrangle and
 

00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:56.599
I think Percy Sutton and wrangle and
Dinkins have been and probably still are

00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:56.609
Dinkins have been and probably still are
 

00:45:56.609 --> 00:45:58.950
Dinkins have been and probably still are
very politically powerful

00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960
very politically powerful
 

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.860
very politically powerful
and they think they really shaped a lot

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:01.870
and they think they really shaped a lot
 

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.550
and they think they really shaped a lot
of what kind of went on in Harlem

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560
of what kind of went on in Harlem
 

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.810
of what kind of went on in Harlem
especially you know during the 70's and

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:06.820
especially you know during the 70's and
 

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:14.180
especially you know during the 70's and
80's it does that answer your question

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:14.190
 

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:24.930
okay do I consider them being

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:24.940
okay do I consider them being
 

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:29.520
okay do I consider them being
obstructionist I think that I'm being

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:29.530
obstructionist I think that I'm being
 

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:36.690
obstructionist I think that I'm being
filmed so mm-hmm I mean I think that you

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:36.700
filmed so mm-hmm I mean I think that you
 

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.400
filmed so mm-hmm I mean I think that you
know certainly they have their own

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:38.410
know certainly they have their own
 

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:41.790
know certainly they have their own
business interests but i think they

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800
business interests but i think they
 

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.410
business interests but i think they
simply weren't willing to I mean I think

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.420
simply weren't willing to I mean I think
 

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.900
simply weren't willing to I mean I think
it's an issue of turf that they saw

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:48.910
it's an issue of turf that they saw
 

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.750
it's an issue of turf that they saw
Harlem as their turf and why should they

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760
Harlem as their turf and why should they
 

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.250
Harlem as their turf and why should they
sort of say okay you want to do this

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:53.260
sort of say okay you want to do this
 

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.820
sort of say okay you want to do this
shurfine whatever so yeah that could be

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:56.830
shurfine whatever so yeah that could be
 

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.450
shurfine whatever so yeah that could be
construed as obstructionist and

00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460
construed as obstructionist and
 

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.470
construed as obstructionist and
certainly from the point of view of the

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480
certainly from the point of view of the
 

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.550
certainly from the point of view of the
small development organization that I

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:05.560
small development organization that I
 

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.960
small development organization that I
worked for you know certainly having to

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:06.970
worked for you know certainly having to
 

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.450
worked for you know certainly having to
get their approval you know that was

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:09.460
get their approval you know that was
 

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.240
get their approval you know that was
definitely not great but on the other

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:12.250
definitely not great but on the other
 

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.770
definitely not great but on the other
hand I think they did see themselves as

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:13.780
hand I think they did see themselves as
 

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.050

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:17.380
 

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.730
specifically how do you split the

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:20.740
specifically how do you split the
 

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:31.510
specifically how do you split the
financer why on the well that's I think

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520
financer why on the well that's I think
 

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.740
financer why on the well that's I think
that's really it's an interesting

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:32.750
that's really it's an interesting
 

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.060
that's really it's an interesting
question in fact that's kind of a

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.070
question in fact that's kind of a
 

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.850
question in fact that's kind of a
separate article and it's a separate

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:36.860
separate article and it's a separate
 

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.140
separate article and it's a separate
issue which i think people haven't

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.150
issue which i think people haven't
 

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.960
issue which i think people haven't
really thought about is that basically

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:40.970
really thought about is that basically
 

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:44.110
really thought about is that basically
when federal funding essentially shut

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.120
when federal funding essentially shut
 

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.490
when federal funding essentially shut
off the state at some point steps in

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:47.500
off the state at some point steps in
 

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.570
off the state at some point steps in
start to offering money but really

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:49.580
start to offering money but really
 

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.950
start to offering money but really
there's not a lot of money and so what

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960
there's not a lot of money and so what
 

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.230
there's not a lot of money and so what
happens in the late eighteen nineteen

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240
happens in the late eighteen nineteen
 

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.850
happens in the late eighteen nineteen
eighties 1990s is this notion of

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:54.860
eighties 1990s is this notion of
 

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.760
eighties 1990s is this notion of
leveraging let's leverage money so you

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:57.770
leveraging let's leverage money so you
 

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.140
leveraging let's leverage money so you
have organizations like the New York

00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.150
have organizations like the New York
 

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:01.420
have organizations like the New York
City partnership you have an

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:01.430
City partnership you have an
 

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.160
City partnership you have an
organization called Liske low income

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.170
organization called Liske low income
 

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.780
organization called Liske low income
support corporation I think that's what

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:04.790
support corporation I think that's what
 

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.300
support corporation I think that's what
it is I could be I could be wrong and

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:07.310
it is I could be I could be wrong and
 

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.090
it is I could be I could be wrong and
there's actually another there's a

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:10.100
there's actually another there's a
 

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.850
there's actually another there's a
provision in the tax code where you can

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:12.860
provision in the tax code where you can
 

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.090
provision in the tax code where you can
actually sell some sort of a bond in

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:16.100
actually sell some sort of a bond in
 

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.450
actually sell some sort of a bond in
order to raise money for housing and so

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:19.460
order to raise money for housing and so
 

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:22.210
order to raise money for housing and so
what happens is that creating housing

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:22.220
what happens is that creating housing
 

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.450
what happens is that creating housing
becomes basically financing housing

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:25.460
becomes basically financing housing
 

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.540
becomes basically financing housing
becomes incredibly incredibly complex I

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:28.550
becomes incredibly incredibly complex I
 

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.950
becomes incredibly incredibly complex I
cannot tell you how complex it is

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960
cannot tell you how complex it is
 

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.040
cannot tell you how complex it is
basically you might have four or five or

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:33.050
basically you might have four or five or
 

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.790
basically you might have four or five or
six different kinds of funding stream

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:35.800
six different kinds of funding stream
 

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.710
six different kinds of funding stream

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720
coming in just to create a 10-unit
 

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.290

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:41.300
building I mean if you thi want to talk
 

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.760
building I mean if you thi want to talk
about inefficiencies and that's

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:42.770
about inefficiencies and that's
 

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.680
about inefficiencies and that's
inefficient to have ten different or

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:44.690
inefficient to have ten different or
 

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.540
inefficient to have ten different or
five different funding streams come in

five different funding streams come in
 

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.870
five different funding streams come in
for a 10 or 20 unit building the amount

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880
for a 10 or 20 unit building the amount
 

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.520
for a 10 or 20 unit building the amount
of paperwork that you have to do the

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:51.530
of paperwork that you have to do the

it's just it's it's it it's not it's not
 

00:49:57.499 --> 00:49:58.749
it's just it's it's it it's not it's not
efficient I don't think it's quite

00:49:58.749 --> 00:49:58.759
efficient I don't think it's quite
 

00:49:58.759 --> 00:50:02.769
efficient I don't think it's quite
rational but that it was and I think

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:02.779
rational but that it was and I think
 

00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:05.950
rational but that it was and I think
still is the reality is that you know

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960
still is the reality is that you know
 

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.420
still is the reality is that you know
foundations went through this phase

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:07.430
foundations went through this phase
 

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:09.069
foundations went through this phase
where they will really want to know

00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079
where they will really want to know
 

00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:10.839
where they will really want to know

organizations to show that they were
entrepreneurial and nimble and they

00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:12.979
entrepreneurial and nimble and they
 

00:50:12.979 --> 00:50:17.140
entrepreneurial and nimble and they
could go out and raise money so what you

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.150
could go out and raise money so what you
 

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.359
could go out and raise money so what you
have been is that the scramble to bring

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:19.369
have been is that the scramble to bring
 

00:50:19.369 --> 00:50:21.640
have been is that the scramble to bring
together money and then you also a

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:21.650
together money and then you also a
 

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:25.329
together money and then you also a
scramble to produce housing because you

00:50:25.329 --> 00:50:25.339
scramble to produce housing because you
 

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:28.660
scramble to produce housing because you
know it's bad now but I mean you had a

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:28.670
know it's bad now but I mean you had a
 

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.680
know it's bad now but I mean you had a
serious serious homeless problem

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:31.690
serious serious homeless problem
 

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.789
serious serious homeless problem
starting in the 1980s with

00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799
starting in the 1980s with
 

00:50:33.799 --> 00:50:35.950
starting in the 1980s with
gentrification and you know the

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960
gentrification and you know the
 

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.329
gentrification and you know the
continuing basically decay of housing

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:40.339
continuing basically decay of housing
 

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:42.370
continuing basically decay of housing
decay and abandonment of housing and so

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:42.380
decay and abandonment of housing and so
 

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.930
decay and abandonment of housing and so
all these groups are scrambling to

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:43.940
all these groups are scrambling to
 

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.769
all these groups are scrambling to
provide housing and hfd sees in some

00:50:47.769 --> 00:50:47.779
provide housing and hfd sees in some
 

00:50:47.779 --> 00:50:50.729
provide housing and hfd sees in some
ways are kind of you know little kind of

00:50:50.729 --> 00:50:50.739
ways are kind of you know little kind of
 

00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:53.200
ways are kind of you know little kind of
almost like holding companies if you

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:53.210
almost like holding companies if you
 

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.910
almost like holding companies if you
will to sort of put together the

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920
will to sort of put together the
 

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.339
will to sort of put together the
financing packages for housing and

00:50:57.339 --> 00:50:57.349
financing packages for housing and
 

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:59.799
financing packages for housing and
sometimes they were used for buildings

00:50:59.799 --> 00:50:59.809
sometimes they were used for buildings
 

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:01.420
sometimes they were used for buildings
that were renovated and then people

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:01.430
that were renovated and then people
 

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.309
that were renovated and then people
would be put in or these were actually

00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319
would be put in or these were actually
 

00:51:03.319 --> 00:51:06.609
would be put in or these were actually
buildings where people lived in and then

00:51:06.609 --> 00:51:06.619
buildings where people lived in and then
 

00:51:06.619 --> 00:51:09.099
buildings where people lived in and then
they sort of use this H of DC structure

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:09.109
they sort of use this H of DC structure
 

00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:11.309
they sort of use this H of DC structure
as a means of financing the

00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319
as a means of financing the
 

00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:14.259
as a means of financing the
rehabilitation of the building but I

00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:14.269
rehabilitation of the building but I
 

00:51:14.269 --> 00:51:15.400
rehabilitation of the building but I
think in some ways it was very

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:15.410
think in some ways it was very
 

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.529
think in some ways it was very
short-sighted that it was you know this

00:51:17.529 --> 00:51:17.539
short-sighted that it was you know this
 

00:51:17.539 --> 00:51:20.769
short-sighted that it was you know this
is the best way to sort of get the to

00:51:20.769 --> 00:51:20.779
is the best way to sort of get the to
 

00:51:20.779 --> 00:51:22.479
is the best way to sort of get the to
get the funding together and to get the

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:22.489
get the funding together and to get the
 

00:51:22.489 --> 00:51:25.089
get the funding together and to get the
housing developed and I think also I

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:25.099
housing developed and I think also I
 

00:51:25.099 --> 00:51:27.609
housing developed and I think also I
think you know not only for for all

00:51:27.609 --> 00:51:27.619
think you know not only for for all
 

00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:28.569
think you know not only for for all
sorts of things in the community

00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:28.579
sorts of things in the community
 

00:51:28.579 --> 00:51:30.849
sorts of things in the community
development world is that maybe I think

00:51:30.849 --> 00:51:30.859
development world is that maybe I think
 

00:51:30.859 --> 00:51:33.130
development world is that maybe I think
people think you know this is housing

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.140
people think you know this is housing
 

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.229
people think you know this is housing
this is a great bang and everyone's

00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:35.239
this is a great bang and everyone's
 

00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:37.959
this is a great bang and everyone's
going to act nicely and so I think

00:51:37.959 --> 00:51:37.969
going to act nicely and so I think
 

00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:39.999
going to act nicely and so I think
they're built with the best of

00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:40.009
they're built with the best of
 

00:51:40.009 --> 00:51:41.620
they're built with the best of
intentions they assume that people will

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:41.630
intentions they assume that people will
 

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.309
intentions they assume that people will
run them with the best of intentions but

00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319
run them with the best of intentions but
 

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:46.680
run them with the best of intentions but
unfortunately the world isn't like that

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:46.690
unfortunately the world isn't like that
 

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:49.120
unfortunately the world isn't like that
people don't necessarily act with the

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:49.130
people don't necessarily act with the
 

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.410
people don't necessarily act with the
best of intentions and I think this is

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:50.420
best of intentions and I think this is
 

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.900
best of intentions and I think this is
one of the tensions of these as though

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:52.910
one of the tensions of these as though
 

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.940

you know one of the organizations that I

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:54.950
you know one of the organizations that I
 

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:56.620
you know one of the organizations that I
looked at as another organization called

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:56.630

banana Kelly in the Bronx and one of the
 

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.180
banana Kelly in the Bronx and one of the

things that they quickly came to the
 

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.700
things that they quickly came to the
realization was that at the end of the

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:03.710
realization was that at the end of the
 

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.010
realization was that at the end of the
day essentially their landlords

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:06.020
day essentially their landlords
 

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.050
day essentially their landlords
and if someone doesn't pay their rent

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:08.060
and if someone doesn't pay their rent
 

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.450
