00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.680
We're asked to rewrite
the following two

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.720
fractions as fractions with
a least common denominator.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.260
So a least common
denominator for two fractions

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.250
is really just going to be the
least common multiple of both

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.630
of these denominators over here.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.480
And the value of
doing that is then

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.530
if you can make these
a common denominator,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.400
then you can add
the two fractions.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.046
And we'll see that
in other videos.

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.545
But first of all, let's just
find the least common multiple.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.920
Let me write it out
because sometimes LCD

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.400
could meet other things.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:48.160
So least common denominator
of these two things

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.360
is going to be the same thing
as the least common multiple

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.580
of the two
denominators over here.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.342
The least common
multiple of 8 and 6.

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:59.800
And a couple of ways to think
about least common multiple--

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.380
you literally could just
take the multiples of 8 and 6

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.370
and see what they're
smallest common multiple is.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.180
So let's do it that way first.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.760
So multiples of six
are 6, 12, 18, 24 30.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.050
And I could keep going if we
don't find any common multiples

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.360
out of this group here with
any of the multiples in eight.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.687
And the multiples of
eight are 8, 16, 24,

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:26.895
and it looks like we're done.

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.150
And we could keep
going obviously-- 32,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.490
so on and so forth.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.290
But I found a common
multiple and this

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.740
is their smallest
common multiple.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.050
They have other common
multiples-- 48 and 72,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.050
and we could keep adding
more and more multiple.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.841
But this is their
smallest common multiple,

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.400
their least common multiple.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.550
So it is 24.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.420
Another way that you could have
found at least common multiple

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.910
is you could have taken the
prime factorization of six

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.330
and you say, hey,
that's 2, and 3.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.810
So the least common multiple has
to have at least 1, 2, and 1, 3

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.700
in its prime factorization
in order for it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.440
to be divisible by 6.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.610
And you could have said, what's
the prime factorization of 8?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.190
It is 2 times 4
and 4 is 2 times 2.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.820
So in order to be
divisible by 8,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.760
you have to have at least three
2's in the prime factorization.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.607
So to be divisible by 6, you
have to have a 2 times a 3.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:24.190
And then to be divisible by 8,
you have to have at least three

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.900
2's.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.810
You have to have two
times itself three times

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.690
I should say.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.070
Well, we have one 2 and
let's throw in a couple more.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.830
So then you have another
2 and then another 2.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190
So this part right over here
makes it divisible by 8.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.260
And this part right over
here makes it divisible by 6.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.206
If I take 2 times 2 times 2
times 3, that does give me 24.

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:49.872
So our least common
multiple of 8 and 6,

00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:52.590
which is also the least common
denominator of these two

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.790
fractions is going to be 24.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.200
So what we want to do is
rewrite each of these fractions

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.570
with 24 as the denominator.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.790
So I'll start with 2 over 8.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.790
And I want to write that
as something over 24.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.180
Well, to get the
denominator be 24,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.350
we have to multiply it by 3.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.126
8 times 3 is 24.

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:16.500
And so if we don't
want to change

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.920
the value of the
fraction, we have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.560
to multiply the numerator and
denominator by the same thing.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.740
So let's multiply the
numerator by 3 as well.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.870
2 times 3 is 6.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.936
So 2/8 is the exact
same thing as 6/24.

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:31.310
To see that a
little bit clearer,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.040
you say, look, if I have 2/8,
and if I multiply this times 3

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.635
over 3, that gives me 6/24.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.970
And this are the same
fraction because 3 over 3

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.970
is really just 1.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.540
It's one whole.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.600
So 2/8 is 6/24 let's do
the same thing with 5/6.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.150
So 5 over 6 is equal
to something over 24.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.740
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.430
I'll do it in blue.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.590
Something over 24.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.910
To get the denominator
from 6 to 24,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.230
we have to multiply it by 4.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.240
So if we don't want to
change the value of 5/6,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.281
we have to multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.190
by the same thing.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.190
So let's multiply the
numerator times 4.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.610
5 times 4 is 20.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.820
5/6 is the same thing as 20/24.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.700
So we're done.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.902
We've written 2/8 as 6/24 and
we've written 5/6 as 20/24.

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:34.110
If we wanted to add them
now, we could literally just

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.849
add 6/24 to 20/24.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.390
And I'll leave you
there because they

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.140
didn't ask us to
actually do that.
