00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.460
 Calories come from fat, and almost half of them are saturated. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.369
 Or eight kilograms of bacon...should not surprise you! This is the amount of 44,000 kcal per year. In the United States alone, 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.570
 The industry that produces sliced ​​bacon is worth four billion. Even 65 percent of Americans say they support

 Bacon became their national dish. 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.620
 In fact, different countries in the world use different parts of the pig to make bacon.

 For example, Canadian bacon is made from pork chops, and British people use pork shoulders and ham. 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 Americans use pork chop. 11% of a standard weight pig can be used to make

 So why is bacon so fascinating? When the bacon is heated, the fat melts, sugar and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.170
 Amino acids produce unique chemical effects. This chemistry has produced

 Fresh, not naturally gray. It also affects a variety of health issues. 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.930
 These nitrites chemically interact with amino acids during cooking, producing nitrosamines. 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.329
 Nitrosamines are carcinogens that increase your risk of cancer. Absorbing a large amount 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.639
 Sodium nitrite will also weaken your body's red blood cells.

 Because we take every opportunity to learn about science and potato chips at the same time. 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.579
 This is a very interesting book. It is about the relationship between nutrition and taste and how we change food.
