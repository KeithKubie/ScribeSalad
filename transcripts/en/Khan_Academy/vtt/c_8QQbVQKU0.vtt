00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.580
After going through
many of these Indian

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.230
Institutes of Technology
Joint Entrance Exam problems,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.730
I realize that there are a lot
of problems where they really

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.264
just expect you
to know something.

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:11.430
So that's what I'm going
to cover in this video, one

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.513
of those things that they
just expect you to know.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.060
What we're going
to do is come up

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.840
with the relationship
between a conic section--

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.195
and a particular hyperbola
is what we'll focus on--

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.287
and a tangent line.

00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:23.870
We've done this in
a previous problem.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.370
But that wasn't in
the general case.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.270
So let's say we have a left
right opening hyperbola.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.140
So it'll have the equation, x
squared over a squared minus

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.730
y squared over b squared
is going to be equal to 1.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.920
And so if I were to
draw that hyperbola

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.140
it would look
something like this.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.020
That's the x-axis.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.610
That's the y-axis.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.850
And then it opens to the right.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.760
I could draw a
better bottom half.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.150
It opens to the right.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.970
And it opens to the left.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.950
And in case you're
curious, this point right

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.070
here, if you set
y is equal to 0,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.920
this point right
here is a comma 0.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.540
And this right here
is negative a comma 0.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.300
So what I want to
do is figure out

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.740
a relationship between these
a's and b's and the equation

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.970
of a tangent line.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.770
So let's say I have
a tangent line that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.100
looks something like this.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.530
Let's say it's tangent only at
that point right over there.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.840
And so it would look like-- let
me draw it a little bit better

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.830
than that-- it would
look something like that.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.890
And let's say the equation
for this tangent line

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.750
is y is equal to mx,
where m is the slope,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.110
plus-- instead of saying
b for the y-intercept.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.860
So normally, we would call
the y-intercept b for a line.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.910
We've already used the b here in
the equation for the hyperbola.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.390
So let me just call this c.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.750
So the c-- this is a
little unconventional.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.000
This is going to
be the y-intercept.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
So let's see if we can come
up with a relation between

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.220
the m's, the c's,
the a's, and the b's.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.780
And we already used it in
one of the IIT problems.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.369
And I suspect that the
next one I'm going to do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.052
will also use this.

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.135
If you all have seen a lot
of Khan Academy videos,

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:14.510
you know that I always
like to prove things

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.760
from first principles, because
in life, you can't just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.511
memorize formulas.

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.010
You won't know where
they came from.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.300
You'll memorize them wrong.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.470
You won't understand
what they actually mean.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.820
But if you're going to
take the IIT JEE exam,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.650
I would recommend that
you-- I have an appreciation

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.560
for how little time they
give these problems.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680
And if you have to prove
from first principles,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.890
you won't be able to prove them.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.750
So let's just come
up with the relation.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.110
Let me stop talking
without drawing.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.120
So let's just see
where they intersect.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.430
And the whole insight
here is that they're only

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.235
going to intersect in one point.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:52.070
So what I'm going to do
here is solve for y squared.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.810
So over here, we can multiply
both sides of this equation

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.640
by-- let's multiply both
sides by negative b squared.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.070
So you get negative b
squared over a squared

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.650
x squared plus y squared--
I multiply by negative

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.520
b squared-- is equal
to negative b squared.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.720
And now, let's add this thing
to both sides of this equation.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.600
And we get y squared
is equal to b squared

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.430
over a squared x
squared minus b squared.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.990
So I just rewrote the
equation for the hyperbola.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.515
And let's also write this
in terms of y squared.

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:34.390
And then we can set them
equal to each other.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.880
So over here in this
greenish yellow-like color,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.320
if we square both
sides, we get y squared

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.730
is equal to m squared x squared
plus 2 times the product

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.970
of those both terms.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.424
So plus 2 mcx plus c squared.

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:57.840
So in order for
them to intersect,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.110
they both have to be at the
same place at some x and y.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.267
So we can set this y squared
being equal to that y squared,

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:05.600
and then try to solve for the x.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.558
Obviously, we won't be
able to solve for the x,

00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:09.280
because there's
so many variables.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.780
We can find a relationship
between this a, this b, this m,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.620
and this c, so there's only
one point of intersection,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.230
which by definition,
it would have

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.100
to be at the tangent point.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.089
So let's do that.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:28.410
So we have m squared x squared
plus 2 mcx plus c squared

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.810
is equal to b squared
over a squared x squared

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.619
minus b squared.

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:38.160
And I've done a very
similar exercise

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.260
to this in a previous
IIT JEE video.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.990
But here, I just want to focus
just on the most general case

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.760
so that we have something that
we can add to our tool kit.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.130
So let's write this in terms
of a quadratic equation in x.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.110
So if we subtract this from
both sides, we get m squared.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.400
We have m squared
minus b squared

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.700
over a squared x squared.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.520
That's that term and that
term, right over there.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.840
And then my only just
first degree x term

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.790
is right over here.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:23.360
So plus 2mcx-- I'll
write it in-- plus 2mcx.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.249
And then finally, plus,
we have a c squared,

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:29.790
and then we're
actually going to have

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.670
a plus another b
squared over there.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:43.120
So this is going to be plus
c squared plus b squared.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.175
Now, in order for this equation
to only have one solution--

00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:48.050
let me write it down.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.110
This is going to be equal to 0.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.110
In order for this thing
to only have one solution,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.190
the discriminant of this
quadratic equation--

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.450
remember, when you do the
quadratic equation-- and these

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.280
are completely
different, so negative b

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.930
plus or minus the quadratic
formula b squared minus

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.240
4ac over 2a-- you're
only going to have one

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.340
solution if this
thing over here,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.290
if the discriminant over
there is equal to 0.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.110
If b squared minus
4ac is equal to 0,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.370
then you only have the
solution negative b over 2a.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.830
So in this situation,
for the tangent line,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.810
you can only have
one solution, one x

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.660
that satisfies this equation.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.660
So b squared minus
4ac is going to have

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.490
to equal 0 in the
quadratic formula.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.690
These are different
b's and a's and c's

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.320
than the ones we're using here.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.890
Over here, our b is
that right over there,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.820
the coefficient on the x term.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.690
So that squared is
4m squared c squared.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.480
And we're going to subtract
from that minus 4 times a.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.260
a is all of this
business right over here.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.990
And just to simplify things,
let me make this plus,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.300
and then multiply this
times a negative sign.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.680
And it'll reverse the sign.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.164
So I'll put minus 4-- I'll
put a plus here-- times,

00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:11.830
instead of writing, since I have
to multiply this by negative 1,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.600
it'll now be b squared over
a squared minus m squared.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.942
And then the c is this
term right over here.

00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:21.030
This right here is c, 4ac.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.400
c squared plus b squared.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.810
And this thing is going to
equal 0 if this line is tangent,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.000
if we only have one solution.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.610
So the first thing that
we can do to simplify this

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.150
is, we can divide both
sides of this equation by 4.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.690
And if we do that,
this becomes--

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.840
I wanted to do that in
black-- this becomes a 1.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.977
So we can ignore that.

00:07:45.977 --> 00:07:47.060
And then this becomes a 1.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.290
So that simplified our
equation a good bit.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.794
And now, let's multiply the
second part right over here.

00:07:52.794 --> 00:07:54.960
So we have b squared over
a squared times c squared.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.780
That is b squared c
squared over a squared.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.550
And then b squared
a squared times

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.440
b squared-- so plus b to
the fourth over a squared.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.190
Then you have negative m
squared times c squared.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.620
So let me do this
in another color.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.090
So then you have
for the m squared,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.230
negative m squared c squared.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.495
And then you have negative
m squared b squared.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.800
And of course, this is all
going to be equal to 0.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.910
And we have this m squared c
squared out front over here.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.480
And lucky for us, this
cancels with this.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.340
And what do we have left?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.430
Now, every term here is
divisible by b squared.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.450
So let's divide every
term by b squared.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.950
So this will just become a 1.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.230
This will become b
to the second power.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.660
And then this will
just become a 1.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.540
And then let's multiply
everything by a squared,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.280
just so we get rid
of the fractions.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.230
So when you multiply
everything by a squared,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.670
this term right over
here becomes a c squared.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.070
This term right over
here is just a b squared.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.562
And then all we have
left, and then we

00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:11.770
have this negative m squared.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.830
Remember, we're
multiplying by a squared.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:19.880
So minus a squared m
squared is equal to 0.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.260
Or we could add this to
both sides of the equation.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:32.470
We get c squared
plus b squared is

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.880
equal to a squared m squared.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.730
And what's really
neat about this is,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.710
we now have a very
simple relationship.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.600
If we know the equation of
the line right over here,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.830
we would then, if we
know what m and c are,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.190
we then have an interesting
relationship for a and b.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.690
If we know what a
and b are, we have

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.435
an interesting relationship
for the equation of the line.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:56.310
And maybe if we have a
few other constraints,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.920
we could actually
solve for them.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.420
But we'll actually
take this and use

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.740
this in the next IIT
problem we're going to do.
