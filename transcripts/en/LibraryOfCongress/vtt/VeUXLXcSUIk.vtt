00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.230
&gt;&gt; David Mao: OK.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.530
Well, good afternoon again.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.830
My name is David Mao.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.110
And I was supposed to be welcoming
the new ambassador from Mexico

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.120
to the United States, but he has
been detained across the street.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.010 position:56%
And as we at the Library of
Congress know, Congress comes first.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.350
So I'm told that he will
be joining us momentarily.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.150
So we'll go ahead and get started,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.900
and if Ambassador Sada
Solana is able to join us,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.160
he will at the end of the program.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.750
It's my pleasure, of
course, to have the ability

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.210
to celebrate something here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.030
And, you know, we celebrate
things all the time.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.630 position:56%
But this is particularly significant

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.090
because so many people have
worked so hard on this.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.000 position:56%
We're here to celebrate, of
course, the Spanish language version

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.640
of a very important tool
of the Library of Congress,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.610
and that is the website
that talks about Mexico

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.730
and its relationship
with the United States.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.640
We've had that information
available for quite some time

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.510
and we've been working even harder
to make it available in Spanish.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.290
And so that's what we're here
for today, and I'm very excited

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.960
that we're able to do that.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.980
I think all of you know here
what's available on the website.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.850
It includes a lot of
primary source information

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.840 position:56%
from the Library's collections,
whether it be prints or photographs,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.580
manuscripts, pages from rare books,
things like that, all digitized.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.030 position:56%
And perhaps more importantly it
includes text and commentary to talk

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.590
about this historic period
that defined the border

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.180
between the United States and
Mexico, and really was very,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.270
very instrumental in
defining the relationship

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.550
between our two countries early on.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.800 position:56%
And so I think it's really fantastic
that we're able to now provide

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.420
that information in Spanish.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.220
I have to congratulate
Georgette, of course,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.750
as the chief of the Hispanic
division for leading the team.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.050
And where's Barbara?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.350
I saw Barbara somewhere.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.650
Oh, right.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.950
Sorry. Right in front
of me, Barbara --

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.250
[ Laughter ]

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.550
-- former Mexican specialist.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.690
And Juan Manuel and,
Tracy, where are all of you?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.000
Oh, Tracy's over here.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.480
And certainly I saw Everett
[assumed spelling] somewhere --

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.360
oh, there you go -- former
head of the Reading Room.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.470 position:56%
All of you working together over the
-- how long has it been, actually?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.770
&gt;&gt; Eight years.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.070
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Eight --

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That we've been working together?

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.670
&gt;&gt; David Mao: No, no,
on this Spanish --

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.970
[ Laughter ]

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.270
-- language -- [laughs].

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.570
&gt;&gt; The Spanish part?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.870
Six years.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.170
&gt;&gt; David Mao: OK, six years.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.470
So that's how long it took
with all of these people,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.770
a couple of interns
thrown in there, of course,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.250
and certainly collaboration
with a lot of our colleagues

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.710
at the Library -- across
the Library.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.500
And many of you are
sitting here in the audience

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.720
to celebrate this terrific
launching.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.670
So congratulations to all of you.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.150
Welcome to -- all of you to
the Hispanic Reading Room.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.450
Is there anything else
I need to say?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.750
No, I'm delaying.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.050
I was hoping that the
ambassador would come in --

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.350
[ Laughter ]

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.940
-- so that I could properly
introduce him, but we'll have

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.240
to save that until the end.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.240
So let's turn it over now to
Georgette to give us a little talk

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.670
about it, and then we'll carry on.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.470
So thank you.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.730
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.270
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: An ambassador's
time is never his own, as you know.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.920
We are very honored to have you all
here in this historic Reading Room.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.120
As you know, this is the first
foreign area reading room

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.670
of the Library of Congress,
which opened its doors in 1939,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.910
and it's one of three
still in the same place.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.670
The others are the Rare Book
Room and the Main Reading Room.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.300
The Mexican Revolution was a very
important event in the history

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.120
of both Mexico and
the United States.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.640 position:56%
It changed the border, the frontera,
forever between the two countries.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.020
And this exhibit started
as an exhibit, actually.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.920
And then we couldn't raise enough
money for an exhibit as such.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.580 position:56%
So we decided to do a website, which
I think is much more interesting

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.370
because it's going to be here
forever on the web, and --

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.320 position:56%
so people from around the world will
be able to see these unique maps,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.260
films, photographs, manuscripts --
especially prints and photographs

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.330
from all over the area that are
here in the Library's collections.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.630
And I want to thank very
much Barbara Tenenbaum

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.040
and Everett Larsen [assumed
spelling] and Juan Manuel Perez

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.240
who spirited this wonderful
project with Tracy North.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.200
And so it took a lot of hard work.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.510
And with a number of interns,
whom I shall not mention

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.580
because there're probably 20
different interns who worked

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.040
on it for -- over the years.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.430
And the Spanish version
was very much supported

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.850
by the Mexican government
and the Embassy of Mexico.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.400
And I will now introduce
you to Barbara Tenenbaum,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.420
the former Mexican specialist
of the Hispanic division,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.940
who is still a volunteer, so
we still see her all the time.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.240
And I don't want to close

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.850
without thanking Beverly
Brennan [assumed spelling],

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.770
Sarah Duke [assumed spelling],
[inaudible] Motion Pictures and all

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.610
over the Library who've really
helped us with this exhibit.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.510
Barbara.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:24.950
[ Applause ]

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.250
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
Good afternoon.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.180
Thank you, David and Georgette.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.800
For Mexicans and for
people who love Mexico,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.070
the 10th year of every
century is a momentous event

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.560
because it commemorates both
the beginning of the movement

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.050
for independence from
Spain in 1810 and the start

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.980
of what would become the
Mexican Revolution in 1910.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.580
Given that the Library
itself was founded in 1800,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.150
I assumed that we would
have very few items relating

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.940
to the Independence.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.200
So working on something concerning
the Mexican Revolution was an

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.340
obvious choice for us.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.320
And it was a good choice,
since it turned

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.880
out that every single division
of this Library had something

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.950
about the Mexican Revolution.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.180
It was just absolutely amazing.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.200
It's been a long road from my
first thoughts on how the Library

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.010
of Congress could celebrate these
events from an actual exhibition

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.490
of some of the treasures
held here, to a website,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.520
to a bilingual website; the
first assembled by the library,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.440
assisted by a vital grant

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.670
from Mexico's Secretaria
de Relaciones Exteriores,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.240
better known as Mexico's
Foreign Ministry.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.160
Part of the reason the website
took a long time to complete was

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:10.680
that we found so much material
and with that so many surprises.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.900
Even observing copyright
restrictions that limited us

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.500 position:56%
to material published by 1924 or so,
we still found lots of treasures.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.640 position:56%
For example, who knew that President
William Howard Taft would write his

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.950
beloved wife, Nellie, after
meeting President Porfirio Diaz

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.330
for the first time --
and the last time --

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.820
that he hoped that the Mexican
president would outlive him

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.700
because he didn't want
to have to deal

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.000
with what might come after that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carlos Manuel Sada Solana: Sorry.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.600
Sorry for interrupting.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.580
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.880
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.180
Please.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.770
That the motion picture
division would have movies filmed

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.470
on location during the
Mexican Revolution.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.870
Who knew that Pancho Villa
didn't have battles at night

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.810
because they were impossible
to light?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.710
He made a contract with movie
companies so they could film him.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.180
I mean, he was no fool.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.340
[ Laughter ]

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.770
Who knew that the music
division would have sheet music

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.790
from the period, and
that some talented people

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.040
on staff would bring
these tunes to life?

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.900
Who knew that the manuscript
division would have original

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.270 position:56%
manuscripts by Brigido Caro who left
Mexico to live first in San Antonio

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.850
and then to Los Angeles in
the manuscript division?

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.540
We have six original
plays written by him.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:04.910
The site has already led
to Mexicans asking for copy

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:13.870
of Emilio Vazquez Gomez's La
Reeleccion Indefinida of 1890,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.750
and we sent a copy of
the 18-paged document.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.400
Or that a professor looking

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.020
at Chicano Theater would happily
see the works of Brigido Caro

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.210
and get very excited that
he could actually read them

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.120
in the manuscript division?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.930
We are currently working
with El Colegio de Mexico

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.140
to establish a two-month grant so
that a Mexican student can come

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.120
to the Library and work on
the materials alluded to

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.600
and found on the website.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.740
We hope that this will lead to
greater and greater interaction

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.780
between the Library of Congress --
the largest library in the world --

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.380
and Mexican institutions
of higher learning.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.670
Just as it takes a village
to raise a child, so, too,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.410
it takes many people -- and many
more because websites continue

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.410
to live, not like books -- it takes
many people to complete a website.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:21.070
I would like to recognize just
a few: my chief, Georgette Dorn,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.490
my colleagues, Dr. Everett
Larsen [assumed spelling],

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.450
Dr. Juan Manuel Perez,
and Tracy North.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.570
Colleagues throughout the library
also helped on this project.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.670 position:56%
In particular, I'd like to recognize
Karen Moses [assumed spelling]

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.180
from the music division.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.420
I didn't see her, so I
don't think she's here.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.070
Jennifer Cutting [assumed spelling]
from the American Folklife Center,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.600
Francisco Macias from
the Law Library,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.560
and many, many, many others.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.030
We had stellar interns
working on the project,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.370
including Jeffrey Helm
[assumed spelling],

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.140
Fenix Paz [assumed spelling],

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.900
Cristina Torrellano [phonetic],
and many, many others.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:09.590
So now it's time for you to see
the Spanish incarnation of the U.S.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.890
and the Mexican Revolution.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.510
So, Tracy North, you're up.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.510
[ Laughter ]

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:28.380
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.250
&gt;&gt; Tracy North: Thank you.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.410
So as Dr. Tenenbaum stated,
many people have worked

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.040
on this online exhibition
over the past several years.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.930
I came along toward the end
and have been involved just

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.700
in the final push to
launch the site.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.660
We did launch the English version
of the redesigned site in February

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.650
of this year, and we're here today

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.440
to celebrate the launch
of the Spanish version.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.030
Before I continue, I feel
like I have to confess

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.320
that you're not going to
be getting a live demo.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.580
It is screenshots only.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.240
So if you'd like to take out
your phones and follow along,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:11.030
the site is optimized for mobile
viewing and looks phenomenal

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:16.810
on phones, iPads, all the way
up through desktop computers.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.470
So please, after today,
go take a look at it.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.420
You will be impressed,
I guarantee you.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.600
So how did we make this happen?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.900
We consulted with our
colleagues in the exhibits office.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.810
Specifically, Betsy
Nahum-Miller and Vicki Fortuno,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.620
who has since retired, and others.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.050
And we've worked very closely
with the web services staff,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.320
Bill Tellum [phonetic], Tipp
Padavong [phonetic], Laura Moiseev,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.820 position:56%
and Collen Burn [assumed spelling],
specifically, all under the guidance

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.880
of John Barton [assumed spelling]
and the Director of Collections

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.560
and Services Helena Zinkham.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.520
So to conform to the Library's
standards, we filled in templates

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.790 position:56%
for the content and the descriptions

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.730
of the 100-plus objects
in this exhibit.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:09.010
Now you don't have to
look at me anymore --

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.310
[ Laughter ]

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.800 position:56%
-- you can just look at the screens.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.910
[laughs] So where do
you find a page?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.090
Well, you can follow the Library of
Congress on Facebook or on Twitter.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.420
You can follow our 4 Corners blog

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.920
where we highlight
international collections.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.070
In all of these places, we have
been highlighting this Mexican

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.250
Revolution project.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.140
And you can also visit
our website directly.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.790
If you go to the exhibitions home
page and then click on the link

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.530
for all exhibitions, listed on
the left-hand side of the page --

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.140
and keep in mind that this
site includes all current

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.810
and past exhibitions.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.340
So it's really true what Dr.
Dorn says, this will live

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.470
on past our lifetimes
here at the Library.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.110
Scroll down to M, and you'll
see the link to the exhibition.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.910
Once you arrive on the page, you're
greeted with a short introduction

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.970
and a sense of the
structure of the site.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.460
A link to the Spanish version,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.390
the version en Espanol,
appears on each page.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.740
I find the site very
easy to navigate.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.140
And like I said, I'd
like to have you join me

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.770
on a stroll through the exhibition.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:25.460 position:56%
First, some of the special
materials that surround the objects.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.490
We have included a
timeline that begins

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:33.490
with the 1908 Creelman interview
and goes through the early 1920s.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.290
We have a special feature
that offers an interactive map

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:45.130
of the tragic ten days of a revolt
in February of 1913 in Mexico City.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:51.340 position:56%
Now up until this point, Mexico City
itself had been excluded from a lot

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.370
of the battles of the Revolution.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.670
Not after this.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.520
So the way the interactive page
works, you click on a number

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.640
and it takes you down to a
blowup of that specific section

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.790
with a little more detail
about each of the events

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.660
that took place during
that tragic ten days.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.070
As has been alluded to, we
also have made available audio

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.100
and video files related
to the Revolution.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.720 position:56%
Now, these recordings cannot be
downloaded, but they can be streamed

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.210 position:56%
on your mobile device or on your PC.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.170
So getting right into the content,
the first section describes some

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:33.050
of the roots of the Revolution
in Mexico as well as other events

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.920
that were happening throughout
the world around the same time,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.260
and begins to describe
some of the relevant items

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.730
in the Library's collection.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.590
The next section goes into Porfidio
Diaz and the Porfiriato in Mexico

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.610
and then introduces the
presidency of Francisco Madero.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:57.400
Photographs, broadsides and
maps illustrate this section.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.740
Now let's say we were live and you
were to click on the photograph

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.220
that you're looking at there,
it would actually show you

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.080
that each object in the
exhibition expands to a full size

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.910
with a description
including the metadata

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.520
about where the physical
item resides

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.730
in the vast Library of
Congress collections.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.140
We definitely see this
site as a teaser.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.240
Just to let people know, are you
studying the Mexican Revolution?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.890
Here are a few things that we have.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.870
If you want to actually see
the objects, come on in,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.880
come take a look, you'll find
some other things as well.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.500
After the four chronological
sections,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.580 position:56%
one section looks specifically at
the role of women in the Revolution.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.920
This section includes portraits
of individuals as well as songs,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.540
newspapers, journal articles,
and personal correspondence.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.910
The section on the U.S. involvement

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.590
on the Mexican Revolution
is particularly rich.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.890
This seems like a good place

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.500
to mention the Library's
ongoing digitization initiatives.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.200
In fact, the papers of General
Pershing were just made available

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.340
on the Library's site.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.180
So in going with some of the
themes you've been hearing today,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.450
we will have the ability to add
additional content and links

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.940
to some other objects
that have been digitized,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.300
even since we're been
working on this presentation.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.370
So I'm not sure if you can
tell from my screen captures,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:33.940
but each section is divided into
subsections with relevant objects

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.850 position:56%
and explanatory text, as if you were
walking through a physical exhibit.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.410
This is but one example of how the
objects are displayed on the site.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.360
Now if you were to scroll down
through this particular page

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.180
and got all the way to the bottom
of the page, you would be rewarded

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.400
with an image of a letter written

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.620
by U.S. President Taft
to his brother, Charlie.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.840
I recognize that it's not very easy
to read from where you're sitting,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.800
but I can tell you that I've held
the object itself in my hands

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.040
in the manuscript division,
and that's what it looks like.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.060
[ Laughter ]

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.840
I'm sorry, but, you know,
we're doing the best we can.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.870
If you want to see it,
all you have to do is go

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.360
to the manuscript division, request
the box, pull out the folder,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.880
and you can have it
in your hands, also.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.570
Pretty special stuff.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.460
The last section describes
the end of the Revolution

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.630 position:56%
and alludes to the future of Mexico.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:40.970 position:56%
And it does include the Constitution
of 1917, which we have in full text

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.850
in the Diario Oficial,
published in 1917.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.080
So the Constitution of 1917,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.660
still enforced 100 years
later, has 137 articles.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:58.250
These define citizenship, organize
a government, mandate land reform,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.190
and enumerate basic human
rights for all Mexicans.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.550
It's divided into ten thematic
titles and lists human rights,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.620
national citizenship, as well
as outlining associated rights

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.710
and specifies freedoms of
foreigners residing in the country.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.320
It establishes the government,
public service, and social welfare,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.730 position:56%
and Mexico City as the capital, of
course, with the [inaudible] Federal

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.500
as a separate entity apart
from state jurisdiction.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.800
&gt;&gt; Carlos Manuel Sada
Solana: [Speaking Spanish]

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.100
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.400
&gt;&gt; Carlos Manuel Sada Solana: Well,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.700
it seems that everybody
speaks Spanish --

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.000
[ Laughter ]

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.610
-- so perhaps I can give very
brief remarks in Spanish,

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.580
but I'll [inaudible] -- it is a
unique occasion to be here today

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.980
and to be witnessing
what is happening

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:55.080
with these new presentation or
new document, new information,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.150
new possibilities to keep
discovering and learning

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.540
and understanding better
the relationship

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.520
between Mexico and
the United States.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.830
And as I always speak, and
as I speak and been in front

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.600
of that painting of Benito Juarez,
which was given to the Library

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.910
by a former president of
Mexico, Lopez Portillo,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:24.170
you understand how deep and
far way goes the relationship

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.360
between our two nations.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.660
And by looking at some of
the pictures, I was focusing

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:35.380
in particular on the
Francisco Madero who was one

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:41.990
of the ideologists of
the Revolution of Mexico,

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:47.310
and he presented his plan
precisely in San Antonio.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.430
And I'm just coming from the
Congress to having a meeting

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:59.790
with Joaquin Castro, who is one of
the congressmen, the twin brothers

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.280
that were born in San Antonio.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.920
And one of them, as you
know, is a congressman

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.220
and the other one a
Secretary of House in here.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.820
And we were talking
[inaudible] the relationship

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.870
with Mexico and the United States.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.730
And by looking at Francisco
Madero --

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.260
I lived in San Antonio
for a while --

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.290
if you go to Mexican politics
nowadays, if you see who is one

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:30.040
of the top hierarchies and persons
in one of the political parties

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.550
of Mexico, it's Gustavo Madero,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.730
which is the grandson
of Francisco Madero.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.030
But he looks exactly like him.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.330
[ Laughter ]

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.630
Exactly like him.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.930
He wears the same kind of beard

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.530
and he has the same way
of combing his hair.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.830
So --

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.130
[ Laughter ]

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.430
-- it was like I was seeing him.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.350
And I says, oh, this
is what history's about

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:55.540
and this is what we learn on a
daily basis of the relationship

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.840
that exists, that's so rich
a relationship between us.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.370
And this, no doubt, this
contribution is going

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:09.950
to keep helping us to understand
how deep goes this relationship.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.930
Now in this capacity I've been on
different fronts, different parts

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.150
of the United States representing
Mexico in consulate activities.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.830
I live close to the
border in San Antonio now.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.450
In this capacity, my
daily job is to really --

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.950 position:56%
trying to position and making people
understand how the relationship

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.850
between the two countries
goes on a daily basis.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:37.430 position:56%
I was today also with the Secretary
of [inaudible] of the United States.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.350
We were discussing the
waters of the Rio Corrales,

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:45.370
how it affects our two
nations, and the waters

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.490
of the Rio [inaudible], Rio Grande.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:53.500 position:56%
So every single day there is so many
things occurring in these unique,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.220
I would say, and multidimensional
relationship between our nations.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:05.690 position:56%
And I'm going to be referring to
this new contribution of the Library

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:11.370 position:56%
of Congress in order to go deep into
learning what happened in that epic

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:17.390
that marks Mexico and
makes us what we are now.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.790
And how many Mexicans came to
the United States at that time?

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.910
Your guess is as good as mine,
but it's in the millions.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.860
And that transformed
the relationship.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.040
So it is a crucial time and
crucial epic in the relationship

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.380
between Mexico and
the United States.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:40.200
And it changed, totally, what
Mexico was and what Mexico is now.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.830
The Constitution of
1917, it is unique.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:50.330
It was the very foundations
of what the country is about.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:55.540
And it is also a changing
of a regime that have lasted

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.890
with Porfirio Diaz for
more than 33 years.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:03.370
And that -- this is a personal
note -- I'm being from Oaxaca,

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.870
Benito Juarez was from Oaxaca,
Porfirio Diaz was from Oaxaca.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.850
It is not that all of
us are dictatorships.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.150
We are --

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.450
[ Laughter ]

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.750
-- or dictators, I am sorry.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.600
But actually, it is a part of
what some [inaudible] continued

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.200
to [inaudible] the relation of
Mexico and the United States.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.190
And I'm going to be one of
the first users of this.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.010
You provoke me, and --

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.310
[ Laughter ]

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.320
-- as soon as I get home,
I'm going to go internet.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.180
More of a form of the
short notes that I have:

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.290
it is indeed a great pleasure
to be here representing Mexico.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.870
The Spanish division has more

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.840
than 75 years maintained a very
close relationship with the Embassy

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.840
of Mexico and academic
institutions in my country.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.740
Thanks to its commitment to the
study of history and culture

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.560
of Latin America, and
in particular Mexico,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.310
the division has been a fundamental
source for Mexican academics.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.610
Since our nations became
independent, Mexico and the U.S.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.800
as neighbors have had a
very close and unique,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.050
and could mention controversial
sometimes --

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.080
[ Laughter ]

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.380
-- [inaudible] half.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.560
Many millions of documents
housed here have witness

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.250
to our shared vicinity
and the importance

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.130
and richness of our relation.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.130
The leadership of Georgette
Dorn in this division is --

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.790
of course, the devotion of our
dear friend, Barbara Tenenbaum --

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.270
thank you so much -- an
expert on Mexican history --

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.750
and she received the
Aguila Azteca --

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.690
she's a recipient of
the Aguila Azteca award

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.540
that they have nourished and
deepened the ties of collaboration

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.170
between Mexican experts
and academic entities.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.520
Also, for years the division
has recorded the voice

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.870
of the most important Mexican
writers and intellectuals,

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.270
which has broadened and enriched
the Library's Hispanic collection.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.970
An example of that collaboration is
the Spanish version of the webpage

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.440
on the United States and
the Mexican Revolution

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.920
that we'll now learn
what's it's about,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.300
developed with the cooperation
of my predecessors, in this case,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.010
Ambassador [inaudible]
and Eduardo Medina-Mora,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.880
and of course the Mexican
Cultural Institute.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.180
Here we have the director

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.870
of the Mexican Cultural
Institute, Alberto Fierro.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.170
Thank you for joining us.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.410
And I would like to single out
another important contribution

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.440
by the division to the libraries
and the scholars of the world:

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.670
the Handbook of Latin American
Studies, now in its 80th year,

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:46.230
which we cherish in Mexico and find
indispensable for doing research.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.680
My sincere congratulations to
the staff of the Spanish division

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.010
for having completed the
Spanish language version

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.660
of the Mexican Revolution webpage.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.460
Felicidades, muchas gracias.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.510
Congratulations.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.570
[ Applause ]

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.430
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
