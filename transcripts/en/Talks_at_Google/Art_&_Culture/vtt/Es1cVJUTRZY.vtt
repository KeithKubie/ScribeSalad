[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.640
EMMA FALLONE: I am so
pleased to introduce the very

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.850
special panel that
we have with us today

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.770
to discuss the results
of the incredibly

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.520
successful recent auction
hosted by Christie's, as well

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
as the continuing philanthropic
legacy of the Rockefeller

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.960
family.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.200
So to start, let me
introduce our guests who

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.110
will be speaking with us today.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.460
So first, at the end, we
have David Rockefeller Jr

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.250
is a longstanding businessman
and philanthropist.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.980
He has held many
significant positions

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.960
among Rockefeller-related
entities,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.870
as well as the nonprofits that
support the arts, education,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.322
and the environment.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.530
He is currently a trustee
of the Rockefeller Brothers

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.630
Fund and the David
Rockefeller Fund

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.600
and a member of Council
on Foreign Relations.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.240
A passionate supporter of
the arts, Mr. Rockefeller

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.670
has been a trustee of
the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.130
for nearly four decades, as
well as on the Asian-American

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.690
Cultural Council.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.239
He served as citizen chair of
the National Parks Foundation

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.090
from 1995 to 2005.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.200
And in 2013, Mr. Rockefeller
and two of his sisters

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
established the Peggy McGrath
Rockefeller Foundation,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.470
Stone House Grain, which
manages 2,000 acres of farmland

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.080
in Columbia County,
New York, and promotes

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
regenerative agriculture and
supporting young farmers.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.300
Finally, Mr.
Rockefeller's commitment

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.420
to environmental preservation
and his passion for sailing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
led him to found the nonprofit
Sailors for the Sea in 2004,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.380
now joined with the global
ocean conservation organization,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.880
Oceana.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.790
JONATHAN RENDELL: That's good.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.540
EMMA FALLONE: As
director, Mr. Rockefeller

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020
promotes the organization's
campaign driven work to sailors

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.250
worldwide.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.970
Next, Susan Rockefeller is
an award-winning documentary

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.940
filmmaker, artist,
and conservationist.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.630
Her latest endeavor, "Musings,"
is a digital magazine

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.490
that creates ideas
and innovations that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.550
pave the way for a more
sustainable future.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.070
Susan interviews thought
leaders and entrepreneurship,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.530
responsible innovation,
and social impact

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.620
to provide inspirational
calls for action and solutions

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.360
for positive change.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.370
A longstanding
philanthropist, Susan

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.190
sits on the boards of
Oceana, Stone Barns Center

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.340
for Food and Agriculture, We
Are the Family Foundation,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.380
Southampton Arts Center, and
Land and Garden Preserve.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.200
In her film work, Susan is a
principal of Louverture Films

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.730
and a member of
the film committee

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.680
of the Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.560
Her own original films
have aired on HBO, PBS,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.110
and the Discovery Channel.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.870
They include "Food for
Thought," "Food for Life,"

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.200
"Striking a Chord," "Making
the Crooked Straight,"

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.910
"Bach Star CafÃ©," and
"Mission of the Mermaids."

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.280
And then finally, we
have Jonathan Rendell,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.060
the deputy chairman of
Christie's Americas.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.850
Mr. Rendell drives senior
business development

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.620
and is a top level client
liaison in many areas

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.690
of Christie's business.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.240
He was on the core team
overseeing the collection

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.300
of Yves Saint Laurent and
Pierre BergÃ© at Christie's Paris

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.380
in 2009, which achieved a
record-breaking $483.8 million

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.640
in sales.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.236
Other notable
collections with which

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:15.360
Mr. Rendell was instrumental
include the collection

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.050
of Elizabeth Taylor at
Christie's New York in 2011,

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.360
and the sale of the
collection of Roger Hatfield

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.230
Ellsworth in 2014, which
made $134 million, also

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.850
record-breaking.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.609
Prior to joining
Christie's, Mr. Rendell

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.900
served as the head of the
print department of Phillips,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.580
the London-based auctioneer.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.110
He has published
and lectured widely.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.780
Most recently, Mr.
Rendell is a key member

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.220
of the senior
management team that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.340
oversaw the sale of the
Peggy and David Rockefeller

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.410
collection, which achieved a
record-breaking $832 million,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.010
the highest total ever for
any single-owner collection

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.580
at auction and the most
significant charitable auction

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.220
in history, as well as the
reason that we are here today.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.430
So Jonathan-- well, first,
let's welcome our presenters.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:04.430
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Thank you.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.890
EMMA FALLONE: Thank you.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.780
And Jonathan, to
get us started, I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.970
know this must have been a
pretty incredible auction

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.750
week with one historic
sale after another.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.540
Can you talk a bit about
the action, its goals,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.290
and its results?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.090
JONATHAN RENDELL:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.650
Less an auction week,
more an auction year.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.410
We had an
extraordinary privilege

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.770
in working with Mr.
Rockefeller's family

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.590
to put this sale together
over a period of time,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.840
which made a huge difference
to the way we approached it.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.820
I think for
Christie's internally,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.870
this was incredibly important as
the sale that really pushed us

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.060
forward on the
digital platforms,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.730
on many other different ways
of marketing the things.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.160
But what was also incredibly
interesting and important

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.810
for us was the philanthropic
aspect of this.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.810
This is the biggest charity
sale that's ever been held.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.040
And I think we all felt
a huge responsibility

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.220
whilst going through the motions
of putting a sale together.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.110
We've all done great big sales.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.870
But this was completely
different in that it

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.980
wasn't to profit an individual.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.440
This was to profit a whole
series of philanthropies, which

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.040
I think is an incredibly
important way forward

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.830
for a lot of our collectors.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.220
We've already started talking
to quite a lot of other people

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.870
about how they can adapt the
Rockefeller pattern to what

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.689
they want to do with their
collections going forward.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:43.730
EMMA FALLONE: Absolutely.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.726
Absolutely.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:46.350
The clicker doesn't
seem to be working.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.332
If you could advance the slides.

00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:54.380
JONATHAN RENDELL: I think
what might be interesting

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.470
for everybody is just
to see a short video

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.749
that we've been working
on that sums up the sale.

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.040
And then let's get into the
more interesting bit, which

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.357
is us grilling them.

00:06:06.357 --> 00:06:07.398
EMMA FALLONE: Absolutely.

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:08.886
Sounds good.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.810
JONATHAN RENDELL: Here comes
the first really important

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.250
question.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.570
What would they have thought?

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.670
What would Peggy and
David have thought

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.300
of this great
hoopla that ended up

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.540
with this extraordinary result?

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.400
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Well,
I've wondered that myself.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.330
My mother, who died
more than 20 years ago,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:28.050
and my dad, who just died last
year, they shared many things.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.610
They were both very competitive.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.500
So they would have
loved the fact

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.370
that this was the best
in many categories.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.049
They would have loved that.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.820
It also would have
been, I think,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:44.820
Jonathan, a testament
to their taste,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.530
which I always
thought was very good.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.970
It wasn't always my taste.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.990
But it was wonderful taste in
the things that they bought.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.850
So they would have loved that.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.830
And then they would
have been so pleased

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.580
that the institutions, 12 of
them at least, that they cared

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.970
about received so much
money, in some cases,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.105
twice as much as
they really expected.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.200
So anyway, that was
absolutely wonderful.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.970
And I think it's on
to the next question.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.261
JONATHAN RENDELL: It is indeed.

00:09:19.264 --> 00:09:20.680
EMMA FALLONE: And
you were talking

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.700
about those foundations
that will be receiving

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.290
the benefits of this auction.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.040
And I know that perhaps the
greatest Rockefeller legacy

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.790
is the family's commitment
to philanthropy, which runs

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.480
throughout the generations.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.010
So can you talk more a bit about
your family's unique approach

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.960
to giving over time?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.460
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Well, both Sue

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.120
and I come from
philanthropic families.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:53.020
But let me start, if I could, in
terms of my parents' philosophy

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.270
and the impact of this sale.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.090
I think what's
maybe most important

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.480
is their recognition
that endowment

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.750
is a critical element
in the nonprofit sector,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.340
having funds that are
actually releasing income

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.030
every year because earned
income and contributed

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.770
income is very hard to come by.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.680
So they were so
focused on endowments.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.070
And a very good example
of the power of that

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.750
is the Stone Barns Center
for Food and Agriculture

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.760
in Westchester County.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.320
Susan actually
sits on the board.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.060
And you can talk a little bit
about the content of that.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.067
But endowment was
very key to them.

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:37.021
Yeah.

00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:38.710
Would you like to
say a bit more.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.670
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Sure, I could say.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.410
I mean, what's great
about endowment

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.410
is that the
institutions can get on

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.440
with either the research
or the experimentation

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.340
and not worry about
extensive fundraising.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.190
So with the case of
Stone Barns, we now

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:59.110
have unbelievable opportunity to
continue the work in resilient

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.070
agriculture and research in
what we're calling slow tools.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.670
Because there is this resurgence
of small-scale farming,

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.740
and there's not a lot
of tools and technology

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.140
that actually is working
for the small-scale farmers.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.450
So it's this big sigh of relief.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.360
We can go into the board
meeting and actually

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.180
think about how we can
create more immersive

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.620
experiences, more educational
outreach from K to 12,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.250
to educating
next-generation farmers.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.960
So it's just
unbelievable that there

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.520
is that sense of freedom
that comes from building

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.149
an endowment like that.

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:39.190
EMMA FALLONE: Absolutely.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.080
And I feel like
this speaks a lot

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.180
to the idea of patient
capital, which is, I know,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.480
something that your family
believes in as well,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.060
the idea of open-ended giving.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.070
If you could speak
a bit to that.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.165
I know Stone Barns
is one example.

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.290
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Yeah.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.540
I mean, I think
patient capital relates

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.990
to not expecting instant
results, as often in business,

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.520
and particularly in
research-oriented businesses,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.850
it takes a long time for
something to germinate.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.010
And that's the same in much
of the nonprofit world.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.930
So not only having the capital,
but being patient with it,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.040
I think it's
extremely important.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.760
My parents also really
believed in the importance

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.660
of leadership, or really
three things together--

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.150
passion for whatever it was.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.040
That's the kernel.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.680
That's the key first step--

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:44.460
and then leadership, your
own leadership, hopefully,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.600
to guide the
institution, and money.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.890
But the three together,
philanthropy not just

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.267
being about the money.

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.600
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: And then
in terms of patient capital,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.800
just an example that there is a
saying that you aren't thinking

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.440
big enough if you can solve
the problem that you're

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.320
looking at in your lifetime.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.780
So whether it's some
of the philanthropy

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.780
that my family has done
with the Wilderness Society

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.110
and working to preserve
millions of acres of wilderness

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.610
in the United
States-- we're working

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.110
on peace in the Middle East
with an institute at Tel Aviv

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.240
University on the history
and philosophy of science

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.500
and ideas.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.830
Patient capital is really
that long-term view.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.620
And it's not something
that happens quickly.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.760
It's not a quick fix.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.000
And a great example is the
Peking Union Medical College,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.190
that it was one of the
oldest philanthropic--

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.110
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: You're
seeing it on the screen here.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.943
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
--gifts that you can see.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:43.510
And the work is still
sowing incredible rewards

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.627
in our travels to Asia now.

00:13:45.627 --> 00:13:47.710
EMMA FALLONE: Something
that has truly passed down

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.330
throughout the generations.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.416
JONATHAN RENDELL: And I don't
want to sound impatient.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.940
But what you see as
the immediate result

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.050
as opposed to the
long-term capital thing

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.510
is fantastic and
incredibly important.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.560
What will be the immediate
result of the sale?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.620
I'm constantly thinking about
what happens after the sale.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.820
How do we move onto
the next phase?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.225
So is there an immediate result?

00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:16.600
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: You know, I

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.960
mean there were 12
different institutions.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.760
And so you can imagine that when
a significant number of dollars

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.210
comes to a Harvard
University, they already

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.790
have a significant
number of dollars.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.410
My father was interested
in two particular things.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.310
And so they'll get guided
in those directions.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.110
One was urging all students
during their college years

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.890
to become familiar with
a culture not their own,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.310
hopefully a nation not
their own, and so to travel.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.880
And he provided funds for that.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.370
And then the other, related
but slightly different,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:15:00.280
was support of what's called
the DR Center for Latin American

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.590
Studies, his great interest in
the continent south of North

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.500
America and the Latin cultures.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.320
And so the result
will be that Harvard

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:20.380
will be pushed to be more
global and more hemispherically

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.930
inclusive.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.040
JONATHAN RENDELL: And Sue,
with your real interest

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.700
in the environment and the
future of the environment,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.710
how will it impact the immediate
needs of the world, which

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.200
is constantly challenged.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.700
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Well, I would say

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.120
that one of the most exciting
collaborative partnerships

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.420
that we're involved with is
the Peggy McGrath Rockefeller

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.140
Foundation and the 2,000 acres
of regenerative agriculture

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.430
in the Hudson Valley.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.110
So with that influx
of more funds,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.360
there'll be more opportunities
to really innovate.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.960
We're working with the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.660
looking at how the
carbon sequestration is

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.570
happening with the
application of cover

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.300
cropping on our fields.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.200
So there's a research component.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.790
And when you're experimenting
and innovating for a change,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.220
it costs money, and to
not have to seek funding,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.780
but actually have
it there so that we

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.050
can start sharing our findings
and actually find other people.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.490
There's a lot of interesting
work going on in California

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.200
in regenerative agriculture.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.280
And we have the ability to
actually do this research

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.527
and not be constrained by the
constant fundraising cycle.

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:35.860
So to me, that's super exciting.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.234
And then I sit on the board
of the Land &amp; Garden Preserve

00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:38.910
in Maine.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.690
And we have three gardens.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.350
And it really is looking at the
intersection of man-made design

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.710
and the beauty of horticulture
with the natural beauty

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.300
of Acadia National Park.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.070
So that too will be
endowed so that we

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.155
can bring more visitors.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:55.030
There's something like
three million visitors

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.590
that come to Acadia
National Park,

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.310
and to be able to leverage that
with the educational component

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.060
of what does it mean
to garden and create

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.099
beauty in a natural landscape.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.960
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
And to charge less.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.569
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
And to charge less.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.210
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: T0 the public.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.089
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.550
JONATHAN RENDELL: One of
the most significant things,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.910
I think, that we
at Christie's came

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.339
to learn during
this whole process

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.869
was the intertwining of
Rockefeller philanthropy

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:26.950
and social history in
America and elsewhere.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.510
I mean, obviously,
we talked briefly

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.490
about the Peking Medical College
and the importance of that.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.800
But if you could talk just
briefly about historically,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.740
the family's involvement,
not just your parents,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.420
which your parents' is enormous.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.570
But there is a whole
thing behind them,

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.980
which I think is very important
for people to understand,

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.230
this very long-term view of
how you make things better.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.910
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Exactly right.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.870
So it is often said that the
Carnegies and the Rockefeller

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.690
families were the
ones who, in a sense,

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.150
invented modern philanthropy.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.690
What does that mean,
modern philanthropy?

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.150
Well, I think what it
meant was sometimes what's

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.950
called scientific philanthropy.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:17.560
And charity was being
moved to give funds

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.680
to the immediately needy,
whom you could, perhaps,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.760
see on the street, a
wonderful human gesture.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.890
Scientific
philanthropy is to try

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.520
to figure out why there are
so many people on the streets

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.230
in the first place and
create a more systemic answer

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.030
to that problem.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.630
When we were seeing the slide
of the Peking Union Medical

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:46.150
College in Beijing, which was
founded about 105 years ago

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.130
by the Rockefeller
Foundation, one

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.700
of the first scientific
philanthropies,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.939
you were seeing not just a
response to sick Chinese people

00:18:57.939 --> 00:18:59.480
on the street,
although that may have

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.980
been an emotional
cause for the founding,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.210
but you were also seeing
a response to the fact

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:14.300
that, at that time,
medical practices in China

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.160
were very rudimentary.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.080
And so this was the first
modern hospital in China.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.790
And I'm so proud that
it still exists today.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.025
Susan and I have visited
it several times.

00:19:25.025 --> 00:19:26.566
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
A number of times.

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:29.130
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: So it's
a kind of a thoughtfulness

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.480
that obviously
companies like Google

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.790
need to be thoughtful about
what will business success mean

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.200
next decade.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.240
You can't sit on your laurels.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.680
And philanthropy
is really the same.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.180
JONATHAN RENDELL: And
over the past year--

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.090
I'm not looking for praise.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.477
But over the past year--

00:19:51.477 --> 00:19:53.643
although if you want to
offer some, I wouldn't mind.

00:19:53.643 --> 00:19:57.320
No, over the last year, while
we've gone on this journey

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.401
together, we've
changed as a company.

00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:00.900
Christie's has
changed as a company.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.800
It's changed the way that
we think about what we do.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.120
How has it changed things
for the two of you?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.760
What have you learnt?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.390
How do you feel about this
extraordinary gesture?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:19.850
I mean, the amount of money
involved is staggering.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:25.010
For that all to go at
once to the philanthropies

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.769
your parents cared
for is mind-boggling.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:28.810
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: It is.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.790
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Do you want to start?

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.590
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Yeah,
well, what I hope--

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.131
and it's something
that you mentioned

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:38.480
earlier-- is that other people
with significant collections

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.710
will start to think about
where they can take an auction,

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.670
where those proceeds
can go and also benefit

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.740
institutions that could
use more financial support.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.010
So if this becomes
a trend that there's

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.556
more people that will give--

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:54.680
And there's been a history.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.460
There was a Yves Klein that
went to Oceana, the proceeds

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.340
that Loic, who was
there, facilitated.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.780
It was a million
dollar painting.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.110
And Oceana got the
benefit to that.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.700
So finding people that have--

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.240
when you can marry your passion
with art and philanthropy,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.397
and then choosing
a few paintings--

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.230
it doesn't have to be
your whole collection.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.480
It's extraordinary
that the Rockefellers

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.500
had their whole collection
go to philanthropy.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:25.400
But at least to me, that's one
of the most exciting trends,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.490
if it does happen, that
there'll be more people thinking

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.030
in terms of, I have this
painting I bought for $10,000.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.670
It's now $150,000.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.270
Give it to an institution
or your alma mater,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.140
and think about broader
ways of making impact.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.650
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: It's like
giving a low base of stock when

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.470
the value increases
and you get the benefit

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.610
of the deduction for the
current value, not just

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.740
the lower value.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.810
I have a very different
answer, Jonathan.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.570
And it has to do with you.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.720
And that is to say that
when you've grown up

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.220
living with something in
an environment in which,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.320
as in my case, the
houses my parents

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320
had were full of all
sorts of objects--

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.350
they were very big on
tchotchkes, especially

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.630
porcelain tchotchkes.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.200
And--

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.150
JONATHAN RENDELL: Also known
as incredibly valuable pieces

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.836
of art.

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:21.302
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Yeah.

00:22:21.302 --> 00:22:21.801
[LAUGHS]

00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:24.950
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Which is
what I learned from Jonathan,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.120
that it wasn't just
odd little tchotchkes,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.550
but that they had a value
that was both monetary,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.840
but maybe, much more
importantly, aesthetic.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.420
And so by actually-- when
Christie's set them aside

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.040
in cases, or hung them
on a wall by themselves,

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.690
I really saw these pieces
in a very different way.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.420
And so that was a
great gift, Jonathan.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.560
Thank you for leading
the way on that.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.970
And I think it says something
about context and the way

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.050
that we see.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.550
You know?

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.420
I look out here.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.650
It's hard to see people.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:10.100
But it's an agglomeration
of faces I can't quite see.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.460
But each one of your
faces is very distinct.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.850
Each one of your personalities
is very distinct.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.590
That was true about
the collection too.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.490
So I really learned about that.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:21.586
Thank you very much.

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.960
JONATHAN RENDELL: Yeah, I
mean, always with a collection,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.710
it's a biography in objects.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.410
I get to know people
incredibly well,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.180
usually after they're
no longer with us,

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.825
because I know what they liked.

00:23:33.825 --> 00:23:35.700
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Isn't that interesting?

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.158
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
And I would just

00:23:37.158 --> 00:23:40.760
say that we spent years looking
at all this art that was--

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.520
there was beautiful curtains.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.200
And you couldn't
really separate it.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.610
It was just all part of the
decoration of the house.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.860
And I thought that Christie's
did such an outstanding job

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.370
on lighting everything and
being able to really take

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.600
that moment.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.010
And the other thought is that
Christie's is about-- we're

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.450
both conservationists.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.280
And it is the best reuse of
the most beautiful objects

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.830
that your family enjoyed.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.070
And now it's gone on to
either private collections,

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.500
or private collectors,
or museums.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.496
And the value of that
beauty is timeless.

00:24:20.496 --> 00:24:22.620
JONATHAN RENDELL: And
another extraordinary aspect,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.940
of course, is not just
you, the two of you,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.280
who we've been talking to
a lot during this process.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.790
It's your siblings.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.220
It's the next generation
of the Rockefellers.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:40.680
There is this DNA that
you have of philanthropy,

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.030
which sets you somewhat
apart from other people.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.020
But I know that you are both
very strongly personally

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.150
involved in
philanthropies that aren't

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.044
necessarily the ones that
were the ones favored

00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:54.710
by your parents.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.440
And I wonder if you could talk
for a little while about what

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.940
your interests are and
how you differ from them

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.350
in your interests.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.300
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: That's good.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.290
I have a very close relationship
to a Unitarian Church called

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.810
All Souls on the
Upper East Side.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.950
And I love it because of their
commitment to beautiful words,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.580
including poetry and great
sermons, and beautiful music.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:26.460
We have an amazing choir, and
a resident chamber quartet,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.570
and a fantastic
community program,

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:37.160
two nights a week feeding
250 individuals, who

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.560
live not far away, but
don't have regular meals.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.400
And that's such a
wonderful thing.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:52.960
And it really binds us to that
community and that church.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.500
It's very personal.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.610
We are donors.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.790
We're active with the church.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.150
And so that's a
very different thing

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.030
from being on the board of the
Museum of Modern Art, which

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:11.000
I've also been, as Emma
mentioned, for nearly 40 years.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.520
That's such a large
institution, such a large board.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.740
We've just enlarged
the board to 70 people,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.040
whereas the church is really
about something much more

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.820
immediate.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.950
And both are wonderful,
and very different.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.980
And so you have this wonderful
community connection to We

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.830
Are Family, among other things.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.800
That's so different.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Yeah.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.160
So I mean, we do a lot
together as a couple.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.110
But I also sit on
the board of We

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.760
Are Family
Foundation, which is--

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.400
I don't know if people
here know Nile Rodgers, who

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.020
wrote the song "We Are
Family and "Let's Dance."

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.210
He's a amazing
musician and composer.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.690
And I made a film with him
way back, a long ways back,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.630
called "Striking a Chord,"
on our troops, and PTSD,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.140
and using music as a way to
help with the healing process.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.600
And this is a very
small foundation.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.730
There's about 12
of us on the board.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.360
And it's about
training and mentoring

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.720
next generation leaders.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.460
So if you know anybody in
their teenage, early 20s

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.830
that are looking
for great mentors,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.650
we bring people together from
around the world for one week

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.780
of intensive training.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.440
And you know, we would love
to see that next generation.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.360
And they are really addressing
and taking on these challenges.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.120
And every time I go
to this board meeting

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.730
and I meet these
young people, I am

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.430
so excited because
they are innovating

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.160
on the environment,
and with bullying,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.650
with internet innovations.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.940
And it's just-- it's remarkable.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.810
So I think that's something
that your parents wouldn't

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.150
necessarily have
supported, but it is

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.780
global in its network of youth.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.360
JONATHAN RENDELL: And joint
ventures which you do together?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.790
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Well,
I think the principal one now

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.400
is really about
ocean conservation.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.360
A lot of ocean news these
days-- it didn't used to be

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.205
so, but whether it's
sea level rise--

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:14.150
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Plastic pollution.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.649
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Acidification,

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:16.550
plastic pollution.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.060
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Decline in fish.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.460
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
A decline in fishing,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.930
or fisheries and fish.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.720
The oceans are under stress.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.570
So it was mentioned
earlier about my Sailors

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.710
for the Sea effort,
a smaller entity that

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.720
lives in Newport, Rhode Island.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.130
That's just been merged up
into the larger Oceana, where

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.800
Sue already was on the board.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.970
Now both of us are on the board.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:46.430
And it's a fantastic global
campaign organization

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.630
to protect the oceans.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:48.950
But you should say more.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.120
You've been on for a
longer time than I have.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.410
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Yeah, it's
the biggest NGO solely focused

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.790
on ocean protection.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.990
And we invite all of you
to become Wavemakers.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.220
Anyone can sign on--

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.040
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: No cost.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.570
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: No cost.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.950
And you'll learn
all about what's

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.930
happening with the oceans.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.110
And they're just
making a difference.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.416
They're saving the oceans.

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:11.790
We have a campaign to save
the oceans and feed the world.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.790
We're working on
plastic pollution.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.300
We go country by country.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.140
And it's really just--

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.160
what we find is 71%, as you
know, of our Earth is ocean.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.640
And over a billion people rely
on fish for their major source

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.400
of protein.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.510
So we want to keep
the oceans healthy

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.140
and keep the levels
of fish abundant so

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.610
that we don't have to
cut down more trees

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.910
and have more cattle.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.340
The whole idea is that, from
a climate change standpoint,

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.130
we really want to keep
our oceans abundant.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.790
So we love working
together on Oceana.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.860
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Including fundraising.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.900
And Christie's was several
times the host of a fundraiser

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.410
both for Sailors for the Sea--

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:55.940
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Yeah, and Oceana.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.080
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Or Oceana.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.150
And there'll be another
fundraiser in New York

00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.900
this fall.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.120
And Sue is the chair
of that effort.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.300
So as a board
member, you give what

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.220
you can, either in time,
or talent, or treasure,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.490
as they say.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.840
And one of your responsibilities
is to help fundraise.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.789
And Sue is a very good one.

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:20.330
So watch out.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.135
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: I'll
send you all invites.

00:30:23.135 --> 00:30:24.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.812 --> 00:30:25.770
EMMA FALLONE: Fabulous.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.630
So I know just talking
about the ocean efforts

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.760
that you're related to, given
that we are here at Google,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.850
I'd love to talk a
little bit about the ways

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.550
that technology
in particular can

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.740
aid in philanthropic giving.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.510
Can you talk to some
of the projects that

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.760
have a technological bent that
you've been involved with?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Sure.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.780
So one that actually
has Google at its source

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.970
is something called
Global Fishing Watch.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.620
So here we go.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.340
There's a slide.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:58.350
So Global Fishing
Watch was basically

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.300
created with Oceana,
SkyTruth, and Google,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.780
and primarily funded through the
Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.950
He was one of the lead
transformational funders

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:10.450
for this.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.450
So we are very grateful to him.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.460
And what it does is it
allows, in almost real time,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.620
surveillance of
global fishing vessels

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.280
so that you can help with--

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.260
and anyone, NGOs,
governments, activists

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.760
can look and see if vessels
are in illegal waters,

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.430
so that it will help
with transparency,

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:37.470
with IUU, illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.230
So it is just a game changer.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.720
And our goal is to really
bring it to global scale.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.240
So I think technology plays a
huge role in the surveillance

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.850
aspect, especially if
you don't have funding

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.576
for enforcement on the ocean.

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:57.075
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: You can't
really have a police force--

00:31:57.075 --> 00:31:57.960
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
You can't police them.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.793
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
--on the entire ocean,

00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:01.770
which covers more
than 70% of the globe.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.260
And so this is a way,
instead of having

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.697
a vast set of police
boats out there

00:32:07.697 --> 00:32:09.030
that you have this surveillance.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.520
So if a ship--

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.670
and mainly, we're focused
on large fishing boats--

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.380
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Large
industrial fishing vessels.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.755
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: --is
either in an area it shouldn't

00:32:18.755 --> 00:32:22.770
be, as in a marine protected
area, or taking stocks

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:28.320
that it's not licensed to take,
the surveillance catches them.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.781
And they can be punished,
which until recently,

00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:33.780
they really couldn't be.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.350
So thanks to Google.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.900
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
Thank you, Google.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.610
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Yes, yeah, exactly.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.859
EMMA FALLONE: And do you see--

00:32:39.859 --> 00:32:42.480
I know the additional
funds will obviously

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.070
help support this technology.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.410
But can you also see
kind of more of the funds

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.005
that have been raised even
expanding this technology,

00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:51.150
or allowing technology
to play a larger

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.859
role in some of your other
philanthropic efforts?

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:56.650
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
It's a good question.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:03.090
And as many of you know, some
of that same GPS technology

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.400
is being applied to agriculture.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.950
And so when fertilizing
machines, or seeding machines,

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:16.390
are going over a
piece of terrain,

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.720
there's information
about the chemistry

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.660
of the soil that they're passing
over, the fertility of it.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:29.790
And so in real time,
with this technology,

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.340
a single driver could
be passing over.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.550
And the field has
been mapped as to what

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:40.320
needs more of one chemical,
what part of the field

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.670
needs more of one
chemical than another.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:49.350
And so you don't just apply
the same coating of everything

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.310
everywhere.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.110
But it's really customized.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.909
I mean, that never--

00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:55.200
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: That's huge.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.866
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
--happened before.

00:33:56.866 --> 00:34:00.330
And so it's a wonderful
way in which technology is

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.020
helping the production of food.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:06.720
In fact, you might say that both
of these technological examples

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.015
are ultimately about
healthy food for us humans.

00:34:11.015 --> 00:34:13.620
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: And it's
called precision agriculture.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.070
So you can pinpoint
what parts of the field

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.037
need either more water,
more nitrogen, more--

00:34:21.037 --> 00:34:23.620
if you're doing regenerative,
it would be manure [INAUDIBLE],,

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.659
or inputs.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.409
But you're not adding
so much input that--

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.530
so it's game changing as well.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.050
So--

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.659
EMMA FALLONE: Absolutely.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.210
And it's so exciting to think
of how much more we can enable

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:37.500
as technology gets better,
and as the philanthropic work

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.820
continues.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.190
So I know we've talked a
lot about the momentous

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.479
scale of the action.

00:34:46.479 --> 00:34:49.020
I think that's one of the things
that has obviously generated

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.610
so much buzz and attention.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.499
But I think there's also a lot
that I would hope to learn,

00:34:54.499 --> 00:34:56.040
that I would hope
others would learn,

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.490
on a much more individual,
kind of even everyday basis.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.880
And you both are so
experienced in philanthropy

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.710
on various scales.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.840
So could you give maybe any
practical advice or tips

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.840
for people who are looking at
this, who are reading the news,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.000
and wanting to get more
involved in philanthropy

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.705
in whatever ways they're able?

00:35:14.705 --> 00:35:17.190
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Do you want to start?

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.530
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Sure.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:22.130
Well, first of all, both
of us really believe--

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.630
and I'm sure all of you--
that passion is key.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.700
So if you're working a day job
and it's not your passion--

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.220
hopefully it is-- but you
want to find something

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.070
that you are passionate
about because that's

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.220
going to keep you going.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.740
And a lot of the issues and
the challenges that face us

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.180
are not easy to solve.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.670
So you want to have
that tenaciousness,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.320
and stick-to-itiveness to
really stay with an organization

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.910
and take that long-term view.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.050
So once you identify
what the passion is,

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.685
it's just researching
the options.

00:35:55.685 --> 00:36:01.280
There's a lot of groups involved
in ocean conservation, land

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.760
preservation,
education, whatever

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.940
it is, hunger, immigration
issues, voter rights.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.410
I mean, there are so many.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.240
And to just do your homework and
find out who the leadership is.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.060
I really believe that
finding those leaders that

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:22.910
are really at the forefront of
being efficient, and effective,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.670
and charismatic are the
ones, at least for me,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.890
that I get attracted to.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.970
But I would say the
passion, the research,

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.540
and then engage in whatever
way, whether it's your time,

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.350
volunteering, donating.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.150
Obviously, many of
these organizations

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:47.180
need social media and some
of the skills that all of you

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.770
have here.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.380
So it's just finding your way
and seeing what's the best.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.660
But I really do think so much
of philanthropy comes from--

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.730
the root of it is love
of mankind or humankind.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.950
And I think it's finding
what it is that you truly

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.840
want to engage with,
and connect with,

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.200
and following that path
because I really do believe--

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.410
I'll give you an example.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.490
I was passionate
about Alaska and also

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.990
passionate about gardening.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.440
In my early 20s, I
went up to Alaska.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.850
I still love Alaska.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.350
I was involved with
a foundation there.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.860
20 years later, I
end up meeting David

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.890
because we both had
a passion for Alaska

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.900
and ended up making
a film together.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.360
So I think if you
follow your passion,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.330
it takes you on a path
that is quite remarkable.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.500
And just to have faith
in that passion and just

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.842
see where it takes you.

00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:43.550
EMMA FALLONE: David,
do you have anything

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.602
to add from that, from
maybe your experience

00:37:45.602 --> 00:37:47.310
of the charities that
you've worked with?

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.685
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Yeah, no, I

00:37:48.685 --> 00:37:52.980
think that's a wonderful
answer that Sue gave.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.745
Yeah, no, I don't think that I--

00:37:54.745 --> 00:37:56.120
I don't think that I do.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:04.220
I think so many people
feel that philanthropy

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.020
is about big dollars.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.165
And big dollars are great.

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:09.230
And if you have them, wonderful.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:15.130
But it really is
also about impulse,

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:20.832
and research, and serious
purpose of giving.

00:38:20.832 --> 00:38:22.290
So I think that
was a great answer.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.560
Thank you, Sue.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.059
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: I could say
one thing about social impact

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:27.380
investing.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.170
There are many interesting
hybrids happening now

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.970
with social impact investing.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.140
And I can talk to one.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.470
I'm an advisor to a nonprofit
called Food System 6, which

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.360
is based out of California.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.430
And they have a
nonprofit arm where

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.240
they identify entrepreneurs
that are looking for food system

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:44.930
change.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.140
So it could be anything
from cricket farming,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:53.840
to pasture map, renewal
mills, looking at food waste.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.450
And they mentor them and
give them the business skills

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.630
to then meet with
venture capitalists.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.180
And they come together.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.590
And it's been an
unbelievable success

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.320
of marrying both that
nonprofit incubator

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.130
approach of mentorship
with the venture side.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.044
So I think you're going
to see more of those.

00:39:13.044 --> 00:39:14.710
And I think it's very
exciting because I

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.860
know that's part of what
the next generation is very

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.920
interested in, not just
the NGO, but how can they

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.200
actually take their
dollars and put

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.200
it to work in a
philanthropic way, but also

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.540
an entrepreneurial way as well.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.728
EMMA FALLONE: Absolutely.

00:39:30.728 --> 00:39:32.360
Thank you.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.730
So I know we do have
time for questions.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.240
And there are mics
on either end.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.420
So I'd love to invite the
audience members to start

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.180
coming up to ask questions.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.160
But before that, I did
have just one a bit

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.539
more fun of a question to
ask as people are coming up.

00:39:48.539 --> 00:39:50.955
I was fortunate enough to be
able to see the collection as

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:54.080
well before it went to auction,
and like everyone else,

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.690
was completely blown away by
all of the different pieces

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.780
and the incredible job that
Christie's did with presenting

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.022
it and really showcasing it.

00:40:02.022 --> 00:40:03.980
So I would love to hear
from each of you-- what

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.422
was one piece that
you particularly--

00:40:06.422 --> 00:40:07.880
not a favorite,
but maybe something

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.770
that had more meaning to you, or
something that you particularly

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.910
were drawn to.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.200
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Gosh, there were so many.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.540
There was a beautiful desk.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.690
And Jonathan can describe
it in greater detail

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.890
certainly than I can.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.910
And it sat in what was
called the morning room.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.410
I think it was
where the light was

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:34.660
good in the morning in my
parents' New York brownstone.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.690
And my mother, who was
a great letter writer,

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.300
would write letters
every morning.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.850
And she had quite a few
letters to write people,

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:48.520
to thank people, to probably
solicit funds from, et cetera.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.180
And she would go to
this beautiful desk

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.100
and write every morning.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.610
So if I got up as early
as she did some morning,

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.830
I'd find her down there
with her cup of coffee

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.330
and her pad of
personal stationery,

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.370
and writing letters.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.330
And that desk-- and you know
which one I mean, Jonathan--

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:14.960
went for more than 10 times,
I think, what was expected.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.650
JONATHAN RENDELL: Which
was great for you.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.960
And also, I think part of
the interest that the family

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.530
actually had for everybody, that
this was extraordinary moment

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.420
not just for the Rockefeller
family, but for everybody else,

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:35.760
and what Rockefeller
represented, you know,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.110
the national parks, all of the
things that we learnt about

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.696
and tried to push out
there, all the things that

00:41:44.696 --> 00:41:45.820
the Rockefellers have done.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.510
It meant something
really serious

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.307
for somebody to go and spend
that much money on a desk.

00:41:51.307 --> 00:41:52.640
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Wonderful.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.260
JONATHAN RENDELL:
She also taught

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.340
you to write very good letters.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.980
I'd like to just
throw that out there.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.890
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
He's a great writer.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.180
I would say for me, the
decoys were really, really

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:01.900
exceptional.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.240
And we collect decoys.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.480
But to see the way
that Christie's placed

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.630
them was just spectacular.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.560
And it really spoke, I
thought, to that blend

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.675
of sculpture and observation.

00:42:16.675 --> 00:42:17.920
We're birdwatchers.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.120
So we go out, and wherever
we travel, we look at birds.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.190
We both have a
particular interest

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.960
in sort of the
sculptural aspects

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:31.520
of the decoys, and the care, and
the carving, and the details.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.690
So I just loved how
Christie's put that together,

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.440
that whole room.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.060
And I think you said there were
a lot of people, surprisingly,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.475
that were very
interested in the decoys.

00:42:39.475 --> 00:42:41.224
JONATHAN RENDELL: Who
stayed up until 2:00

00:42:41.224 --> 00:42:43.453
in the morning to
actually buy duck decoys.

00:42:43.453 --> 00:42:46.750
Who knew that there would
be such an interested group

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:47.736
of new enthusiasts?

00:42:47.736 --> 00:42:48.860
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Exactly.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.550
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: That's wonderful.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.550
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: That's great.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.806
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Yeah.

00:42:51.806 --> 00:42:55.030
EMMA FALLONE: All right, we'll
start over here with questions

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.619
then.

00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:56.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.250
I'm Tina Daniels.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.680
I work in the LCS Agency team.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.810
Thank you so much
for this presentation

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.510
and also for your
service to the world.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.660
I have a question about the
preparation and planning

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:13.000
that you maybe gave to the
agencies and nonprofits that

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.230
received the money.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.830
But if I could ask
a two-part question.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.670
The last conversation
just made me think.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.820
I wonder, was there
any sentimentality

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.120
in this experience that
made you sad, to give up

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.350
some of these family
heirlooms or works?

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.150
And I'm presuming it was never
much of a decision to do this.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.750
Or was it?

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:38.699
And do you miss some of the art?

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:40.490
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
It's a fair question.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:43.060
And I think each
member of the family

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.190
would answer it differently.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.240
But I'll answer it my way,
which is that what I miss

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.610
is really the gestalt, the
entire feeling of being

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:59.290
in the three houses that
principally held the art,

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.510
not so much about
individual objects.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:05.770
But as a child, you
grow up, and you

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.500
have a feeling about the
place that you grow up

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:13.600
in-- your own
room, or the warmth

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.520
of the kitchen in the
morning, or whatever it is.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.420
So it's not being able to
go back to those places

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.280
that I miss.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.350
And luckily, some of
the wonderful pieces--

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.290
not the ones that went
through the auction--

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:30.960
have gone to museums.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.580
And so I have visitation
rights at MoMA, at the National

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.790
Gallery, and the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston,

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.460
and some other places that
have wonderful pieces.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.050
And I will visit them.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.750
AUDIENCE: So I'm most
curious about how

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:53.140
you helped prepare these
nonprofits to receive

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.970
the money that they received.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.820
And I think about my
own experience chairing

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.160
a small nonprofit in New York.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.890
And I can imagine
we would absolutely

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.590
thrilled to receive a
substantial amount of money.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.860
But also, some are
paralyzed by it.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.870
And how did you work
with them to ensure

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.850
that they were prepared
to receive the money

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.560
and it would be spent
in accordance with what

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.119
you wanted.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:17.910
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
It's a good question.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.140
So my father was a
very orderly person.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:29.960
And both of my parents were also
very loyal to the institution.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.860
So these weren't
sudden connections

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.950
to the 12 charities.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:40.150
It was also true that my
father's will was public.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.760
And the 12 were
named in the will.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.870
He died in March of last year.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.320
So between the
publication of the will

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.350
and the receipt of
dollars, each institution

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.530
knew what number was
written down for them.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.180
So they could begin to prepare.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.620
And you're absolutely right.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.680
As wonderful as it is
to receive new money,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.080
are you prepared to invest it?

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.140
Have you got an idea of how to
use the-- if it's going to be

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.360
endowment--

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.830
the income?

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.916
Does that mean you're
going to hire more people?

00:46:14.916 --> 00:46:18.520
And it won't really probably
be until later this year

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.930
that all of the funds
will be received.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.780
So there's a little
digestion time.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.510
But it's a very good question.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.030
And these institutions,
now that they're

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:32.260
beginning to learn that they may
be having even more than what

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.510
was in the will
coming to them, thanks

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.640
to the great success
of the auction,

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.920
they may be
scrambling a bit too.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.270
But it's a good problem to have.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.132
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:46:43.132 --> 00:46:44.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.400
First off, Susan
and David, thank

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.605
you so much for all
the work you have done.

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:51.220
And I really appreciate
you taking a long-term view

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.420
in supporting the charities.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.530
And I actually
have two questions.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.382
So the first question
is for Jonathan.

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:04.660
So you has mentioned the auction
has changed how Christie's does

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.230
the work as well.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:09.740
Can you elaborate on that,
like exactly what changes

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.300
has happened since the auction?

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.080
And then my second
question is, what do you

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.960
think governments
and big corporations

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.210
like Google can do more in
supporting philanthropy?

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.610
JONATHAN RENDELL: I think
for Christie's, what

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.800
was really interesting was
to talk with my colleagues

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.960
about how this was different
from every other big sale we

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.506
had done.

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:37.880
There have been
other sales which

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:42.890
have got large charitable
contributions coming from them.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.600
In this particular case,
it was the entire thing.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.090
And corporately, we felt
different in that there

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:54.140
was a real
responsibility that came

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.500
with the privilege of
having the sale, which was,

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.840
we had to make this money.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.790
The money had already been
organized by Mr. and Mrs.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.530
Rockefeller.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.080
And we knew we were
going to be OK.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.810
I mean, you know when
you get a sale like this,

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.310
you can taste it
almost immediately,

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.250
that it's going to be a success.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.630
You know there's a buzz
that begins to build.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.260
And it may begin with
six of us sitting

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.420
in an office talking about it.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:27.680
And then the whole company
took hold of what was going on

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.094
and became proud.

00:48:29.094 --> 00:48:31.010
And there were people
who were willing to stay

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.900
till 2:00 in the morning to
do phone bidding with clients

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.040
and feel proud
that they were part

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.150
of this great corporate effort.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:45.380
The pressure was on us to
see how much more we could

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.690
raise than the required funds.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.320
How much was what we
were doing individually

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.280
contributing to
raising yet more,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.440
an additional, well,
almost $200 million

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.370
that will go to the charities,
that will go the philanthropy.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:10.490
So that, no pressure, makes a
difference when you're giving,

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:15.440
in my case, the 50th
guided tour of the week,

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.210
walking people through
the collection.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:18.860
You have to stay enthusiastic.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.680
You have to stay
on top of things.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:27.350
My colleagues who were producing
Instagram posts every day

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.090
and trying to make it
interesting and attractive.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.720
And it was all about
how are we going

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.420
to make this even better than
we know it's going to be?

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.880
How are we going to, as
a company, get together?

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.340
And there's also a
great unifying thing

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.520
when a company is working
on something like this.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.220
Everybody feels involved.

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.380
In our case, from the
maintenance staff right the way

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.340
through to the chairman's
office, I mean,

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.640
everybody in the company felt
that they had a role to play.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.880
And we made sure that
everybody had a role to play.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.692
And I think corporately
that made a huge difference.

00:50:03.697 --> 00:50:05.072
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Do you want

00:50:05.072 --> 00:50:07.660
me to start on the other
part of the question, which

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.132
I think was about government
and corporate philanthropy?

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.930
Let's just take in
the US at the moment.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:22.550
The belief system of the current
administration in Washington

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:27.050
is so different from
previous belief systems.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.540
What that means is
that, because we're

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.900
in the field of
environment, there's

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:39.440
going to be more emphasis on
corporate and philanthropic

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.040
help for environmental causes.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.160
And so that scene
has really shifted.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.600
And it puts a lot of
pressure on philanthropies

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.940
and corporate
philanthropy as well

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.920
to pick up part
of the burden that

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.130
used to be in the
government's pocket.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.222
So that's a very
important switch.

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.680
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER:
And I would just

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.670
say that I hear
about people getting

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.560
their interviews for
Google, and that everybody

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.540
wants to work here.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:15.290
So the intelligence, the
IQ factor is top level.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:19.010
And there's so much
opportunity for the employees

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:22.910
here to make a difference.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:23.830
So we were thrilled--

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.050
Oceana was thrilled that Google
partnered with us to come up

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.330
with this innovative
surveillance system

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:36.170
to really make sure that we
could curb illegal fishing.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:39.140
I think there's a huge amount
of opportunity for Google to get

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.750
involved using their
technological know how

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.450
and their reach.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.060
And I would leave it up to
the ingenuity and creativity

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.590
of the people here.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.300
And I don't know
exactly what kind

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:58.250
of CSR or philanthropic arms you
have a place to really mobilize

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:02.000
some of your employees to
do programs or get involved

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.890
in certain initiatives
or activations.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:07.280
But I think just having
that conversation

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.450
and seeing where we can go.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.460
And I know you have
Google X and you

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.250
have a lot of really
interesting funding vehicles,

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.610
especially in food,
I know in California,

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.330
because I am hearing about
that through Food Systems 6.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.050
So I think harnessing the
technological know how

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.510
and capacity of what
you can do here,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:32.390
and addressing some of these
global problems in agriculture,

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:36.260
with climate change,
it would be wonderful

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:40.109
if you could streamline
those efforts.

00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.942
EMMA FALLONE: Great.

00:52:40.942 --> 00:52:44.250
And I think we have time for one
more question, maybe two if we

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.610
make it fast.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.160
So--

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.915
AUDIENCE: You were
first if you want to.

00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:48.540
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.749
I just have a quick question.

00:52:49.749 --> 00:52:51.373
My name's Matt, a
long-time New Yorker,

00:52:51.373 --> 00:52:52.910
so I've always grown
up appreciating

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.840
everything you've done for
the community in New York.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.700
I actually had a
question about art.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.700
You hear and read
more and more today,

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.970
and I'm sure you guys
see it, that art is now

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:07.700
being touted as an
investment vehicle

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.120
more so than ever
previously before.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.480
And I'm curious as to what
you guys think, and see,

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.760
and in the circles
that you guys run in,

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:22.910
in terms of, is this a positive
or a negative effect in the art

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.670
world, where folks are now
looking at art as something

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:28.160
that can appreciate, rather
than just the ability

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.810
to appreciate art.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:34.390
And what's this going to
do to art in the long term?

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:35.640
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR: Big one.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:42.060
Well, there are pluses
and minuses, I would say.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.850
I mean, for me, the most
important thing about art

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:51.240
is its ability to move us, to
impel us to greater heights,

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.650
to help us look into
the human condition, all

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.280
the wonderful things
that art does.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.760
And I'm talking about not only
visual arts, but all the arts.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.130
On the other hand, as
art in the visual field

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.930
has gotten so expensive,
it puts it out

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.910
of reach of a lot of people.

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:15.270
You can only have
so much in museums.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.650
And I think it, for some
people, does make art

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.940
a commodity instead of a
great human expression.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.140
So I think that it's wonderful
for the artists who are selling

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.950
their art at great prices
and dispiriting for those who

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:32.790
don't.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.470
There's so many
things in our culture

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.350
where the split between
the highest and the lowest

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:38.070
is so great.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.840
And art now has become
one of those areas,

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.810
you know, professional sports,
corporate executives, whatever.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.670
So it's another example of that.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:53.610
And that part of the equation,
Christie's benefits from.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.460
Our auction benefited us from.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:02.100
But is that piece of art
one million times better

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.240
than that piece of art just
because the price says so?

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.950
Not necessarily.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.470
JONATHAN RENDELL: I think
individual ownership is not

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:14.310
necessarily the way in which
you should judge a work of art.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:15.800
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: Here, here.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.850
JONATHAN RENDELL:
That some people like

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.930
to own very expensive objects.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.340
And there will always
be those people.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.010
Thank god, because
that pays my bills.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:32.400
But it's equally possible to
get that feeling of elevation

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.760
that a great work of
art conveys to you

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.130
by going to see it in
a museum, by looking

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.840
at a great piece
of architecture,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.924
by listening to music.

00:55:41.924 --> 00:55:43.590
I mean, there are so
many different ways

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:49.180
that are not to do with the
capitalization of the object.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.463
So I think we live in a very--

00:55:52.463 --> 00:55:56.790
I live in a very rarefied
world in which people spend

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.740
a lot of money on objects.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.720
Do I identify myself
in that world?

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.320
No, not necessarily.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.940
I am equally happy
going to a museum

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.071
and looking at an object.

00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:10.320
And I too have visitation
rights on some of the things

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.300
I've sold in the
past at museums.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.780
And that's a huge satisfaction
because you've put

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.970
something in the public arena.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:22.470
So I think that the art market
is not necessarily related

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.670
to the true art world.

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:28.750
SUSAN ROCKEFELLER: Can I just
say that you can go to museums.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.220
No, I thought that
was very good.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.200
But also, I think it's great
just to go to galleries.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.330
Go to the Lower East Side.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.020
Go to Brooklyn.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.780
Go look, and train your eye.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.160
And if you like something, I
mean, there's a lot of art.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.360
This is about emerging art.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.570
And you could make
a small contribution

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:51.830
to someone's art career that
can totally change their lives.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:55.990
And I agree with you that
some art has this crazy price

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.680
tag to it.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.420
And then there's other artists
that are unbelievably talented.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.410
They will never-- well, maybe.

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.030
Doubtful that many
of them will ever

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.960
get to the heights of some of
those that were auctioned off.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.780
But that doesn't mean that they
aren't unbelievably talented,

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.090
and that you can enjoy
looking at the pieces.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:16.420
So I'm one for really
looking at emerging arts.

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.500
And we support arts
whenever we travel.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.690
We will buy something.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.790
And it can be ceramic.

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:23.050
It could be a carving.

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:27.610
It could be something that's
been repurposed from Coca-Cola

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.190
cans, sort of upcycled art.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:33.730
And then those become some
of the memories of our lives.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.610
And if they end up
having value, great.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.510
But we love living with them.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:39.010
So--

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.700
DAVID ROCKEFELLER
JR: That's nice.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.742
EMMA FALLONE: Then
really quickly.

00:57:43.742 --> 00:57:45.200
AUDIENCE: My question
was answered.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.760
EMMA FALLONE: All right, well,
that's a pretty fabulous note

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.259
to end on.

00:57:48.259 --> 00:57:50.877
Does anyone have
any final thoughts?

00:57:50.877 --> 00:57:52.710
DAVID ROCKEFELLER JR:
Thanks for being here.

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.160
EMMA FALLONE: Well, then,
thanks so much for being here.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.060
And thank you.

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.410
