&gt;&gt;Male 1: Ok, hi
&gt;&gt;Male 2: --Hi

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.969
&gt;&gt;Male 1: This talk --
&gt;&gt;Male 2: -- is called

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.759
&gt;&gt;Male 1: --no you go first. [laughs]

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.759
[audience laughs]

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.340
&gt;&gt;Male 2:"How to Lose Friends and Alienate
People", we're not gonna read slides to you.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
That's not what we do. But yes, if you're
here its hopefully because you want to hear

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.120
something about social aspects of software
engineering, which is what we usually talk

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.120
about.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.080
And before we move on, we should talk; we
had a very confusing URL. We replaced it with

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.730
this wonderful "alienjoy" URL. You can go
on, do backchannel talk, if you have questions

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.600
you can put them there, discuss, do whatever
you wanna do. Let's, let's get started.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.440
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Ok. We'll start off with, "Who are
we?" My name is Brian Fitzpatrick and I go

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
by Fitz.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.960
&gt;&gt;Ben: My name is Ben Collins-Sussman. I go
by Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.820
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And we are former engineers and recovering
managers and, or leaders, as you might say.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.050
We haven't been doing this but for four or
five years and so, maximum, I guess. So, we're

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.960
not experts in it. These are mostly; this
is mostly entirely conformed of our opinions--

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.069
[Ben laughs]

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:11.120
and we're perfectly fine if you want to disagree
with them. But, you're gonna have to get your

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.880
own talk somewhere else.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.260
[Ben laughs]

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.640
[audience laughs]

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.350
If you really weren't sure that--

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:31.960
&gt;&gt;Ben: But, we've been working together for
like, 12-13 years now; various Open Source

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:56.350
project. A t one point I worked for him, then
we worked on subversion together and--

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.390
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --Sorry about that.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.140
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, you can throw tomatoes if you
wish.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.960
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We use Mecurial now, it's ok.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.340
[Ben laughs]

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:22.959
&gt;&gt;Ben: And then, after doing Subversion, we
went to Google at the same time and we started

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.980
the Chicago Engineering office and now we
sort of have evolved into management.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.749
Not necessarily intentionally, but it's been
on our mind a lot. Like, alright, "How do

00:02:39.749 --> 00:03:03.159
we become managers? Is that good or bad? Is
that ok?" And we wanna talk about some of

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.120
the things that we've discovered, I guess,
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --Sure.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.689
&gt;&gt;Ben: -- in the process of becoming leaders.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:30.109
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, who are you? Can I get a quick
show of hands? Who here manages people?

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.450
&gt;&gt;Ben: Ok, wow. Wow.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:48.799
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Wow. This is gonna be like a support
group, isn't it?

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.419
[Ben and audience laugh}

00:03:53.419 --> 00:04:00.430
Fitz: Hello, my name is Fitz. Hi, Fitz.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.430
[audience laughs]

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:13.480
How many people in here are, are tech leads,
or technical leadership roles? All right.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.970
How many people here thought this was a different
talk? Alright, ha!

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.009
[audience laughs]

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:34.310
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, so we're, we're gonna take a couple
different angles with this, but first thing

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:45.710
we wanna do is sort of, if we wanna a-, attack
this, if we wanna define what the problem

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:56.599
is. And, a-, as we see it, that oftentimes
leadership isn't intentional. Some people

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:04.340
don't really wanna get into it, but no matter
what happens, there's always gonna be someone,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.860
sort of, leading the way.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.159
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. I mean, if you take a bunch
of engineers and you put them on a project,

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:20.270
even if no one is assigned to be the leader
what you will find is after awhile there's

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:28.010
some self-organization that happens, right?
And somebody starts becoming the person with

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:36.840
the big picture; the person who becomes sort
of the main point of contact, right?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.090
It starts maybe inadvertently organizing people,
dividing up tasks, right? I mean, even if

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.500
they don't have official authority, it, it,
they sort of fall in to that role and people

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.800
give them that authority, right? Because it
has to be done; it doesn't scale otherwise.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.379
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, they start resolving conflicts
and, and driving things toward consensus.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:11.210
But, the-, they step into the role of the
big picture person because every project really

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.740
needs someone to do that.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.850
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. And I guess, I, I've, I've been
thinking about this because I see it happens

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.960
to a lot of people. I know it happened to
me when we were working on the Subversion

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:31.599
project for five years. It started out with
just a few of us in a closet writing code

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:41.150
and by the end of it, it, I was an I-R-C all
day long eff-, effectively managing Internet

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.960
volunteers who were working on the code.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:07:00.039
I wasn't much code in myself anywhere; I was
just organizing people and noted that, they're

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:07.250
not my reports, right? But, I was leading
them anyway. And I, I call this the "accidental

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.039
manager"; I guess maybe that's the best way
to put it. And is, has anyone had that experience

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.530
here? Like, become accidental managers? Yeah,
right, I mean you're like, "How, how did I

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.039
get here? What happened?" And we're here to
say it's not a big deal. It's not; it's not

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:21.289
the end of the world. It's actually ok.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:22.460
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.629
&gt;&gt;Ben: So--

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:32.960
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And so, but first we wanna talk semantics,
ok? And I'm not talking about the Semantic

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.301
Web here, but, I have an issue with the word
"manager", ok? And--

00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:39.301
[Ben laughs]

00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:47.560
do the Will Smith thing that's manager is
wh-, is old and busted and "leader" is the

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.740
new hotness, ok?

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.740
[laughter]

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.639
So, old and busted; new hotness, right? Manager
really is a four-letter word, ok?

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:00.139
&gt;&gt;Ben: Why is it a loaded term?

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:06.509
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, it, it, it evolved out of the
Industrial Revolution, right? You didn't have

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:08.970
managers three-four hundred years ago, or
project managers, or people looking to maximize

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.970
their resources.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.970
[Ben laughs]

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.711
Management is, is, it came out about the Industrial
Revolution, the assembly line, right? If,

00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:19.173
if you're gonna have somebody in a line stuffing
meat into a can, you need somebody--

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:20.173
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yum.

00:08:20.173 --> 00:08:23.690
&gt;&gt;Fitz: to manage people stuffing meat into
a can.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.830
[audience laughs]

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:33.240
But this works. It's very effective, this
sort of carrot and stick routine when you

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.310
have people doing something by rote, right?

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:43.719
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. You want to maximize efficiency
by waving carrots and sticks at them.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:47.100
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And you want people to be compliant
and listen, ok?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yup, yup.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:57.430
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, this is, and al-, this is some
of the stuff we're talking about here comes

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:05.580
a lot from Dan Pink. If you haven't seen his
Tech talk we highly recommend it. We'll talk

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.470
a little bit more about that towards the end.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.910
&gt;&gt;Ben: Great stuff.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:17.149
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, so this traditional management
mechanism works really well when you're managing

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:18.360
people like this. Ok?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360
[laughter]

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:29.980
It's really great if you have nothing that
requires any sort of thought, but it's a colossal

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.560
failure if you're managing something that
is, is complex, or requires any sort of creativity.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.300
&gt;&gt;Ben: Like software engineering.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.470
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Like software engineering, exactly.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.470
[Ben laughs]

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.810
And so, as a result, this creates conflict.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:50.050
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's also a reason why, why managers
are hated, right? I mean, there's this, i-,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:10:01.820
in engineering, just the word manager. "Oh,
do you have a manager?" It's like, it's almost

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:15.130
like the word itself implies conflict or attention,
right? And so, I mean, there's a lot of reason

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:28.389
for that. We have, there's a reason Dilbert
has this stereotype pointy hair. Actually--

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:33.480
&gt;&gt;Fitz: You could do that pretty easily.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:40.970
&gt;&gt;Ben: I can almost; I can almost make my
hair pointy if I pull it out, right? I mean,

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.600
th-, lets talk about that Dilbert manager
stereotype, right? They have no technical

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:55.290
ability, they're insecure, they get no respect
f-, because of that, from their reports. They

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:02.649
don't respect the reports back. They ignore
any past accomplishments of their reports.

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:10.470
They're, they're hired like zookeepers, to
sort of caged people, like you don't trust

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.880
them. And, yeah--

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.950
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, and a lot of them are concerned
with their own self promotion and, and survival

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:30.449
as opposed to removing obstacles for their
team, which is really what a manager should

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:38.490
be doing. But, but for all these reasons this
is why that most engineers don't wanna be

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:55.870
managers. I, I mean, I, I sort of became a
manager. I mean, my thought of managers was

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.910
always management according to the Peter Principle,
right?

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.320
[Ben laughs]

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:12.120
That's the principle that you always get promoted
one level beyond your capabilities, ok?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:23.959
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, give me, give me an example of
that because I discovered a lot of people

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:31.050
have never heard of Peter Principle. We're
just old.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:36.300
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Like, an example of that?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:45.810
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, I answer, I mean, I mean the
classic example is you have a software engineer

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:53.639
who is an amazing programmer and they keep
getting promoted because they're an amazing

00:12:53.639 --> 00:13:04.449
programmer. But, then the way most businesses
are set up, management is "higher" than software

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:19.790
engineering so you get to the top of the programming
chain, and if you want to get promoted then

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:27.290
you have to become a manager, right? And suddenly,
now you have the world's worst manager and

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.220
you've lost the world's best coder.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.220
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.590
&gt;&gt;Ben: And that's, that's the classic scenario--

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.079
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Double failure.

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:43.620
&gt;&gt;Ben: that you see happen over and over,
right?

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.899
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But th-, but the general thing is
most engineers don't consider management to

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:56.100
be real work. You feel less productive. When
I first met-

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.100
[Ben laughs]

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.639
moved from engineer to tech lead and then
eventually managing people, I felt like I

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:12.190
did nothing. I came home the other day and
said "What did I do all day?" I'm like, "I

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:18.060
talked to people and I sent email." I'm a
human router, right?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.060
[Ben laughs]

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.959
It was just like, it's awful, I mean--

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:25.829
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's hard to measure. It's really hard
to measure.

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:29.899
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --It, it, it's almost impossible to
measure other than your general sense of malaise,

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:30.899
right?

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:34.760
&gt;&gt;Ben: Or perhaps, what I discovered is maybe
it's something to can measure on a long-term

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:44.360
timescale, right? If you're an engineer, you
can sit down at the end of the week. "Oh,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.120
I wrote this much code and these features
have solved 15 bugs", right? When you're a

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.990
manager, it's like, "Well, over the quarter,
our team achieved this." And I think it's

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.350
partially my fault.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.350
[laughter]

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.350
Right? So, so it's harder.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.350
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, well, let's talk about what,
what an engineering leader is.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.350
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:14.440
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Ok? When y-, and I wanna really switch
more to the general leader thing. But, a,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:23.810
a leader is not a General in this case. You're
not talking about Patton. It's not somebody

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:32.060
who barks orders at people, it's not someone
whose team is there to serve them; a real

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.990
leader is someone who is there to serve, right?

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.990
[Ben laughs]

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:44.579
It's someone who serves the team, ok? Y-,
you're role as a leader is really, more than

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:53.440
anything else, to remove obstacles for your
team. So, to grease the wheels, to give advice

00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:07.959
and guidance when it's l-, asked for, to help
people with their careers as well. It, but

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:11.560
it's, it's not about this just barking orders--

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.769
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:18.190
&gt;&gt;Fitz: there's gotta be an element of trust
there.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:25.370
&gt;&gt;Ben: Absolutely. And, and the other thing
you need to think about, as a manager, is,

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:32.140
is y-, you're responsible for two things;
both the technical and the social part of

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:41.850
the team, right? And what, a, a lot of places
where I'll see an engineer promoted to management

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:49.990
accidentally, they're only still focused on
the technical side and they ignore the social

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:55.709
issues. And they're actually important.

00:16:55.709 --> 00:17:06.140
If you ignore the social problems, you will
have morale problems, the team will fall apart,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:19.860
you'll, you'll, people will be fight-, I mean,
you don't think it's possible but then you

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:35.020
start managing people and you notice it happens.
And a lot of people put blinders on, right?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:42.470
Likewise, you don't want a manager who's purely
social, either, right? A manager should have

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:48.179
some technical skill, should be able to engage
the team, right? And--

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:51.179
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Understand what they're doing and--

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:52.179
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yep.

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:58.710
&gt;&gt;Fitz: and be smart enough to get, get their
nose out of it, right?

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:08.360
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, you need a mix of both. You need,
you need to really think about both things

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360
all the time.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.159
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. So, so to touch on the, on
the group therapy aspect of this--

00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:17.309
[Ben laughs]

00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:27.630
leadership is not a waste of time. It's a
very important role and it's a way of getting

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:35.020
more done than you can do by yourself. So,
it's a way of scaling yourself, right?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:47.650
&gt;&gt;Ben: I remember one of my, one of my first
managers I asked, I said, he had just into

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:53.841
management, right? And I said, "You're not
writing code anymore, how you feel about that?"

00:18:53.841 --> 00:19:00.350
And he's like, "Well, I realize now by, by
managing you guys, like, way, way more code

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:08.659
is being written than if I were just jumping
in and, and coding with you."

00:19:08.659 --> 00:19:09.740
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:17.670
&gt;&gt;Ben: Like, that's the impact I have. So,
you can actually, it's hard to quantify, but

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.870
it's real, right?

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:28.950
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. So, so that sets the stage
when we talk about. And the best way, I think,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:37.200
to sort of explain what we're talking about
here is what makes a good leader. Again, according

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.140
to our opinions and we have very little experience
here, so you shouldn't listen to us,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.500
[Ben laughs]

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.720
is to talk about the negative side, right,
the antipatterns.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.020
&gt;&gt;Ben: We'll start with antipatterns.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.910
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Ok, we'll start with antipatterns.
Number one--

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:08.460
&gt;&gt;Ben: Hurray! Be everyone's friend. And this
is tricky, right, especially if you manage

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.830
a friend--

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:17.970
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Especially if y-, you're in a team
and you're suddenly managing the team or leading

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.970
the team.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:29.230
&gt;&gt;Ben: --To suddenly switch from peer to manager.
Sometimes it's a problem, sometimes it's not

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:38.669
but, it's actually possible to lead the team
with a soft touch. Like, I always say the

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:46.770
best kind of leadership is leadership you
can't really see if it's happening, but it's

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.970
not obvious, right? And that, that's fine.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.311
I think that works and it's not about becoming
everybody's best friend, but it's not about

00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:59.440
being distant, either. One of the best pieces
of advice I've heard is like, eat lunch with

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:07.760
you team, right? Don't, don't sit in your
corner office with your door closed.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:21.789
You need to be hearing what they, what are
they talking about, what are they struggling

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:35.620
with every day? Like, and that, that's like
the same as being their friend, but--

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.860
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.510
&gt;&gt;Ben: but it is being involved, right?

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.970
&gt;Fitz: You can, the point is you can communicate
and--

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.970
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:51.940
&gt;&gt;Fitz: be social with your team without necessarily
being their friend. If you're, if you're someone,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.909
everyone's friend, it really destroys the
ability to sort of, sometimes you have to

00:21:54.909 --> 00:22:02.919
sort of have to be stick and not the carrot,
in some cases, and even--

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:05.730
&gt;&gt;Ben: To deliver bad news or--

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:13.230
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Or deliver bad news or, or just push
someone in, in, in a general direction.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.230
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.960
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, so, the next thing is the parent-child
relationship, right? Ok?

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960
[Ben laughs]

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.529
People will, will behave the way that you
treat them, ok? Now, so if you put a bunch

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:29.640
of bars up, up, on the windows and lock all
the doors, everyone's gonna behave like a

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:37.409
bunch of caged animals. If you treat people
like children then they're gonna behave like

00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:41.000
children, ok? W-, there's a conference--

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.200
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yes.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:52.490
&gt;&gt;Fitz: that we put on in Chicago and I, I
got the conference facility all set up and

00:22:52.490 --> 00:23:07.240
I went over and talked to guy and he showed
me around and he said, "Here's the keys. I'll

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.539
see ya, I'll see ya in three days."

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:14.570
&gt;&gt;Ben: To the whole building.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:23.289
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah, and he's like, "This is where
this is." And that sort of thing. And it was

00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:34.150
an incredible amount of responsibility put
upon me and there, and I was very appreciative

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:45.480
of that but I knew that I was, I was the one
who had to take care of the place to make

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.550
sure nothing really bad happened and that
sort of thing.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:58.299
&gt;&gt;Ben: What about, one of the things I like
about working at Google, the way our IT department

00:23:58.299 --> 00:24:03.740
works, its set up as a service to help us
rather than to cage us. Like, most IT departments

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:10.299
treat you like naughty children and how can
we stop you from doing the bad things, right?

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:15.861
And we're gonna restrict you in every corner.
And Google's IT department is, well, no, we

00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.720
think you're a grown up and if you need something
come and ask, and we'll give it to you, right?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.731
Otherwise, we trust you to behave and I think
that's a--

00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:34.130
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And, and, there's some controversial
s-, apar-, a, some controversial pe-, ideas

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:43.370
in here, too. Like, you may have heard that
Netflix has no vacation. Their, their vacation

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:52.870
policy is you no fixed number of vacation
days. You take it when you need it, right?

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:59.910
And that's, that's, I think it's really interesting
and I think it's really, I'd love to see how

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.910
that works--

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.540
&gt;&gt;Ben: Peer pressure?

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:11.790
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, it's, it's a little bit of everything
but you're not treating people like children

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.740
there, it's, it's an extreme, but it's something
interesting to contemplate.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.320
&gt;&gt;Ben: More antipatterns. Micromanaging, I
don't think there's a lot to say here, right?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.360
This is the ultimate sign--

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:36.590
&gt;&gt;Fitz: What I want you to say here is it's
about distrust.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.039
[Ben laughs]

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:43.929
&gt;&gt;Ben: That word, right?

00:25:43.929 --> 00:25:48.970
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That word right there.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:58.610
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. So, it's about distrust, right?
This is, this is the classic Dilbert situation.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:06.279
And honestly, if, if, if you start micromanaging
people, again, they get used to it, right?

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:17.240
They start behaving like children, like they
stop doing work unless you poke them every

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:24.081
day. Are you done, yet? Are you done, yet?
Are you done, yet? It's not what you want.

00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:29.799
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, it can be tempting if you're
very, if you're a very technical person that's

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:34.600
moved into this role, it can be very tempting
sometimes because you possibly understand

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.631
more than someone who's just starting, or
someone's who's a little more junior. And

00:26:40.631 --> 00:26:44.809
the temptation, in some cases, is to give
them A-B-C-D type directions.

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:48.539
&gt;&gt;Ben: Instead of letting them figure it out.

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:49.539
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Exactly, exactly. But that leads us
into the next thing. Sometimes, micromanagement

00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:54.620
is necessary if you follow the next pa-, antipattern,
which is hiring a bunch of pushovers.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.690
[Ben laughs]

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:05.310
You wind up, basically, with a team that can't
move on its own and they, they require on

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:13.480
you to make every move. And, you need a team
that's gonna power itself, that's not gonna

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.929
wait for commands. And so my general rule
of thumb has always been

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:20.929
[Ben laughs]

00:27:20.929 --> 00:27:27.340
since I, I, I first started managing about
12-13 years ago but then quit because I had

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:32.590
this horrible experience, which is why I'm
here today. But, it was, I hire people smarter

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:38.570
than me, which isn't too hard for me, but
you get people who are gonna just get things

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.419
done, who are gonna make things happen, where
you don't have to worry about them not understanding

00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:47.590
what's going on. It, I, at the time, I, I
worked with another guy who, who made a, he

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:54.100
actually embodied this anitpattern. I hired
all these people that were smarter than me

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:03.130
and they went off and did amazing things and
he hired a bunch of people that he could push

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:11.529
and poke around. And he loved it because he
had this team of flunkies that he could just

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:13.919
push and poke around.

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:16.890
&gt;&gt;Ben: Like a power trip, right?

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:24.430
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah, and as his team got bigger,
he started working longer and longer and longer

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.399
hours. And he would just sort of--

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:30.660
&gt;&gt;Ben: It doesn't scale.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.490
&gt;&gt;Fitz: It doesn't scale, right?

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.629
[Ben laughs]

00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:41.120
And he was sort of miserable and eventually
wound up leaving. But--

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:56.610
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, I, I, sort of I think related
to this is the next pattern which is to compromise

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:08.640
when you hire. A lot of, a lot of companies
will see, "We're, oh gosh; we're short-handed

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:17.470
on this team. We need two people, so let's
interview 20 and we'll just hire the best

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.150
two no matter what."

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.170
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Bad idea.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.510
[Ben laughs]

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.190
&gt;&gt;Ben: Very bad idea.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:40.559
&gt;&gt;Fitz: B-, because performance and your quality
is gonna go way down and if you have really

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:49.980
good people on the team, they're gonna go
way away from you.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.550
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yep.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:30:00.980
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And they're just basically gonna leave.
So, that ties a lot in again to the next antipattern,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.150
which is to ignore low performers.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:12.091
&gt;&gt;Ben: Holy cow. Has anyone ever worked with
a low performer that nobody did anything about?

00:30:12.091 --> 00:30:22.660
Right? There's nothing more, yeah, wow, there's
a lot of you. There's nothing more aggravating.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:33.890
Its like, "Oh my gosh, this person is dragging
down our whole team, and I can't say anything,

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:44.380
and why isn't the manager saying anything
to this person, or doing anything about it?"

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:52.020
I mean, like you said, it will cause the best
people on the team to leave and find another

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.580
team or another job.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:07.279
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, and this is probably the hardest
thing to do as, as a leader of, of a team,

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:19.080
is to work with low performers. I, I think,
there's a couple reasons for it. The main

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:29.159
reason that I've seen is you wait too long.
You sort of like, if I don't look over there,

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:30.940
they'll get better, right?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.269
&gt;&gt;Ben: Hope-, hopefully.

00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:35.370
&gt;&gt;Fitz: It's gonna get better, yeah, hopefully.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.370
[Ben laughs]

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:43.360
Hope, yeah, code powered by hope. I-, i-,
it's just gonna get better and what happens

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:50.429
when you do that is you wait until it's too
late. And you eventually reach a point where

00:31:50.429 --> 00:32:01.919
it's hopeless and the only thing you can see
is, "How do I get rid of this person?" Ok?

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.440
So, if you sort of--

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:13.450
&gt;&gt;Ben: And then that's the first conversation
you have--

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:14.450
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.590
&gt;&gt;Ben: with that person, when you've already
decided that it's doomed. How do you even

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:27.870
rehabilitate or give them a chance to get
better? So, you've already made this decision.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:38.380
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, you, you made this mental sort
of step in your head where you can't, can't

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:50.909
think about that. So, if you step in early
you can actually help to manage them up or

00:32:50.909 --> 00:33:01.399
out, as opposed to just like, "How do I get
rid of this person?" Ok? It's not just gonna

00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:07.000
get better. There's just, there's just doesn't
happen.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:19.990
&gt;&gt;Ben: I think, I think the next point sort
of is a generalization is which we talked

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:28.309
about earlier is just there are human problems
on your team. Not every problem is software

00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:34.559
development, is about writing code, or technical
problems, right? People, sometimes people

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:36.850
don't get along. Sometimes--

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:42.019
&gt;&gt;Fitz: People problems are much harder than
code problems.

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.019
[Ben laughs]

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:44.019
&gt;&gt;Ben: Much harder.

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:51.590
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I have yet to find a bug that's as
hard as a people problem.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:34:00.950
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, cause, it's, it's fuzzy. People
are fuzzy and grey and computers are not that

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.950
way.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:05.200
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Compilers are so much more consistent.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:15.670
&gt;&gt;Ben: Exactly. Sometimes, well, I would,
I guess well, this is a, this is a, sort of

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:26.520
a scary story. But, one of the things I see
missing sometimes and th-, if you have like

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:34.000
a manager who's all technical, not interested
in social aspects at all, the thing that,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.020
that always lacking is just simple empathy,
right?

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:48.290
That's sometimes all you need just to keep
the social wheels greased. I had a friend

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:57.190
who was working at a company, he had his first
kid, got a couple weeks off on paternity leave,

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:04.130
came back was still very sleep-deprived, discombobulated
and he basically, was only working with one

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.110
other person in his office.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:18.870
There was just the two of them. And he said,
"You know I'm gonna be working from home and

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:25.060
doing I-R-C and chatting." And his manager
found out and said, "No, you cannot work part

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:35.440
time from home at all. No, no, you have to
be in the office." And why not? And basically

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:42.950
said, "Look, you have to be in the office.
If, it's more important and--" What was the

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:43.950
phrase he said?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:49.510
&gt;&gt;Fritz: He said, "People have kids all the
time."

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.030
&gt;&gt;Ben: "Get over it."

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.290
[audience laughs]

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.820
&gt;&gt;Fritz: "Get over it."

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.530
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's like, what? I mean, that's amazing
to--

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:04.290
&gt;&gt;Fritz: So, I can see the point of wanting
someone to come into the office and work,

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.970
but that's just the wrong motivational thing
to say.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.420
&gt;&gt;Ben: Not, yeah, not understanding. So,--

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.330
&gt;&gt;Fritz: It's the rage button, the rage--

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.380
[Ben laughs]

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.890
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, happiness level--

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:24.100
&gt;&gt;Fritz: So you have to pay attention to happiness
levels--

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.100
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:33.810
&gt;&gt;Fritz: You have to pay attention to the
happiness levels of your team and it sounds

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:40.790
all like, fluffy and crazy, but you know,
you really have to understand what, to be

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:47.700
able to, to have a productive team and be
a, a good leader, the thing to understand

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.460
are people happy with the product, are they
happy with where they're going, with how much

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.760
they're working, with the company. I mean,
it's a lot of different things you have to

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.260
be sensitive to.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.910
&gt;&gt;Ben: What do they call it? E-Q?

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:07.470
&gt;&gt;Fritz: E-Q, yeah, Emotional Quality, Emotional
Quotient or something like that, yeah. Something

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.470
completely unmeasureable and fuzzy that engineers
love.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:17.750
&gt;&gt;Ben: Let's, let's talk about good things
you can do, which I guess we've sort of been

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.960
doing it implicitly.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.740
&gt;&gt;Fritz: This is the boring part. You can
check your email--

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.740
[Ben laughs]

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:29.020
&gt;&gt;Ben: Honesty is one of the biggest foundations
for everything, right? If, if you're stuck,

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:39.790
if you don't know what to do, go ahead and
say so, right? Nobody expects you to be perfect

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:45.810
or to have all the answers, right? Well, actually,
you should talk about the compliment sandwich.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.910
This is the, the thing--

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.600
&gt;&gt;Fritz: The compliment sandwich--

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.260
&gt;&gt;Ben: the, the dishonest way to get heard.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.765
&gt;&gt;Fritz: How many people have heard of the
compliment sandwich? Ok.

00:37:57.765 --> 00:37:59.530
&gt;&gt;Ben: Let's watch, something

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:08.400
&gt;&gt;Fritz: --Ok, so for the rest of you, so
the compliment sandwich is this, it this traditional

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:16.310
management technique for delivering harsh
feedback. You come into the room and you say,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:26.610
"Ben, you know, you've done a really good
job, you've been a great team member and all,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:33.080
your code is really, really low quality, but
I like your beard." Ok?

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.590
[audience laughs]

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:39.000
And Ben walks out going, "He likes my beard
and I'm a good guy."

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
&gt;&gt;Ben: Awesome.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.120
&gt;&gt;Fritz: The compliment sandwich is a lie,
ok? It's like the cake, it's a lie.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120
[Ben coughs]

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.420
It's just a bad idea and I, I personally think
that it's better to be constructive, straight

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:59.670
forward, and direct while still having that
empathy for the person that you're giving

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:08.690
it to. I like nothing better than to receive
very constructive feedback if I've done something

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:11.070
wrong. And I mean--

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:17.750
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. But you have to be tactful when
you do it, right?

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.150
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:24.740
&gt;&gt;Ben: Honestly does not mean compliments,
I mean--

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Give an example of that.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.350
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, yeah. Wha-, what's a good example
of this? So--

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:39.340
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, here's, we had a guy, we had
a guy that, that we worked with years ago

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:45.100
who was really technically strong, wanted
to argue absolutely everything, ok? Everything

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.020
was an argument, ok?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.940
&gt;&gt;Ben: --Great coder though.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:56.410
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --Solid coder, right? Ok, so the nonconstructive
is they say, is stop being a dick and fighting

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.200
with everybody, ok?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:07.340
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right, not the way, the way to deliver
the message.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:13.620
&gt;&gt;Fitz: What do you think, where do you think
that's gonna get you? They say, "Oh, wow.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:19.450
I was being a jerk. I should stop this."

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.830
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right, right.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.660
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, so that's--

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:28.290
&gt;&gt;Ben: What's, what's the better way, the
way you do it. I like the way you--

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:36.980
&gt;&gt;Fitz: The, the, the better way is, and this
was explained to me by one of my previous

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:47.950
managers, is that you're in a station and
a train's gonna come by every ten minutes

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:59.120
all day long, ok? Now, you need to pick which
train you want to step in front of, ok?

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.790
&gt;&gt;Ben: You can't stand in front of all the--

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:15.600
&gt;&gt;Fitz: You can't step in front of every train
or you're gonna be flattened, ok? Every time

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:28.810
you step in front of one of these trains,
the engineers gotta slam on the brakes. Some

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.500
of them might hit you, but they're gonna be
annoyed because you're throwing them off schedule.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:38.910
&gt;&gt;Ben: I think it's a way of saying "choose
your battles", right?

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:50.800
&gt;&gt;Fitz: It's a way of saying "choose your
battles," right? But, it sounds more fun when

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.070
you're talking about trains, right? Everybody
loves trains.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.070
&gt;&gt;Ben: All right, let's, let's talk about
the next pattern--

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.830
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, but the other thing about the
honesty that I wanna leave this on is there's

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:04.010
no such thing as a temporary lapse of integrity.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.530
&gt;&gt;Ben: I like that.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:12.330
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's, that's something that, that
was a piece of advice that I was, and all

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:19.910
this stuff really, a lot of this advice is
coming from advice that we've gotten from

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:26.970
our mentors who taught us. But, that's one
of the most important things I, I, I think

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.290
I've learned is the temporary lapse.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.290
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yep. Temporary lapse.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.230
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Temporary lapse of integrity ess-,
that means you have no integrity. So, that's

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:37.770
where I think that the honesty really comes
in as important.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:44.400
&gt;Ben: Speaking of folks that we, that we admire,
there's, there's a manager at Google who we

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:50.280
love and we always refer to him as a Zen Master,
right?

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:58.880
&gt;&gt;Ben: We think of him that way because he,
we're talking about, exudes calmness, right?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880
I--

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:06.530
&gt;&gt;Fitz: In, in, in utter chaos, I, we, we
see someone come running into his office and

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:18.450
say, "Somebody's bombed 19 of our data centers,
oh my God!" And he's just lean back and say,

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:23.670
"Hmm, I wonder why they didn't do 20?"

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.980
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.290
[audience laughs]

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:27.290
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's, you know--

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:34.690
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, right. So he, you want to ha-,
have, this is something that we strive for

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:41.250
as well when we're having one-on-one's with
people, or, or in any kind of meeting, right?

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:52.570
Is stay calm, stay focused, ask the team what
they can do to measure the problem, how they

00:43:52.570 --> 00:44:00.530
can be more productive, how, that, what, what
kinds of solutions there are. When somebody

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:11.510
asks you for direct advice, if you have a
direct opinion, you should give it, but if

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:19.650
you don't have an opinion you can do the psychologist
thing, right, and respond with more questions.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:20.650
Maybe--

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:21.650
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well--

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.650
&gt;&gt;Ben: help them Socratically.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.380
&gt;Fitz: I think you should respond with questions
off the bat first--

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.580
&gt;&gt;Ben: Off the bat?

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:36.400
&gt;&gt;Fitz: instead of, cause it's, i-, it's really
tempting to solve it. I mean, we're sol-,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:41.450
problem solvers by nature. Anyone who is an
engineer, you're paid to pr-, solve problems,

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:50.210
ok? My wife loves this when I come home and
she's like, "Oh, I had a terrible day." And

00:44:50.210 --> 00:45:00.850
I'm like, "Let me fix it for you! Let me fix
it for you!" And she's like, "Just listen.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:06.010
Please. Don't fix it; I want you to hear me."

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.680
[audience laughs and claps]

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:15.680
&gt;&gt;Ben: That's, that's the Mars-Venus thing,
right?

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:25.530
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's the Mars-Venus thing, yeah.
But if you, a, a lot of the time they don-,

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:31.400
they don't really wanna hear your solution
to this. They wanna talk about it and you're

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.630
solution might have nothing to do with the
problem.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.350
&gt;&gt;Ben: No, but you're a sounding board--

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.630
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.720
&gt;&gt;Ben: and it's ok.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:51.230
&gt;&gt;Ben: And it's good and if you can calm them
down and, and just emotionally get them focused

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:55.600
again. It's a huge value, right? You're greasing
the wheels again.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:03.510
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And a part of this extends beyond
your team, right? Ask your team how you can

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:11.070
be more productive and then measure that,
ok? Outside of the team you need to build

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:19.150
relationships across the company and y-, you're
gonna be that bridge to other teams and that

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:20.150
sort of thing.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.200
&gt;&gt;Ben: This, this next pattern we've talked
about in other talks; lose the ego. And, and

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:36.090
people, people misinterpret what we mean by
this. We don't mean be a dead fish, have no,

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:48.090
have no confidence. It actually just means
don't be egotistical, is what we're really

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.090
saying.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.090
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:56.830
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, we have, we have particular i-,
examples of losing ego, right? Actually trusting

00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:00.900
your team. They're down in the trenches every
day doing stuff. It's ok. They know more than

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.970
you. They probably should know more than you,
right? If they tell you something is or isn't

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:08.030
possible, listen. Because they know, right?
And you're not down--

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:13.380
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But when it comes to the details of
the particular--

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.880
&gt;Ben: The details--

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.380
&gt;&gt;Fitz: area, right?

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.830
&gt;&gt;Ben: Have some respect for their abilities,
for the accomplishments that they've done

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:26.000
so far, for, for what they've learned, what
they know, what they're able to tell you from

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.920
being down in the trenches.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:39.990
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Then, and the next one is, is something,
Appreciate Inquiry. You should always actually

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:46.970
accept when someone gives you feedback or
criticism. And try not to be territorial about

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:57.090
things. Try and think big picture. Now, I
think this is really important in the, in

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:04.220
the high-tech world when you're writing software.
I learned the hard way that this isn't necessarily

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.400
appreciated in other domains. I--

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.400
[Ben laughs]

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:16.250
I had a, a friend of mine and an electrician
helping me rewire the basement in my house

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.580
and I was so excited about this cause I'm
learning about stuff electrical. And I asked

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.610
this electrician about seven thousand questions.
And, and I'm thinking, "Wow, I'm learning

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.960
all this cool stuff!" And he's thinking, "This
guy doesn't trust me at all." Right?

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:38.910
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, in, in our, in, in high tech
again, when you're working on software development

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.000
this is something that's really important
to, to listen if someone, if someone's questioning

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.640
something you're doing it's good to talk through
it because they might actually have a good

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.210
idea for you.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:54.530
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, usually it's curious interest,
right?

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.780
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:03.830
&gt;&gt;Ben: That's, that's, maybe that's part of
hacker cultures that, when somebody asks you

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:08.430
lots of questions it's usually cause they're
just interested, not because they're questioning--

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:14.480
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. But, but annoying the hell
out of somebody leads great into the next

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.240
thing which is to apologize.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.880
&gt;&gt;Ben: Apologizing. There's, it's, it's so
crazy that we have to put this slide up, right?

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:28.190
But so many people are just afraid to apologize.
I see this all the time where they messed

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:33.930
up, they know they messed up, and the manager's
usually the last person to apologize, right?

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:40.150
And it's ok, it's really, again, it's about
being, it's about having some humility.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:44.530
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, that's about being a human, right?
I mean, everybody certainly make mistakes

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:51.380
and, and especially if someone gives you constructive
feedback, you go like, "Wow, I can't believe

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.920
I did that. I apologize."

00:49:52.920 --> 00:50:03.630
&gt;&gt;Ben: I know it when, when, when my managers
in the past have apologized it just increases

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:11.370
my respect for them, right, all the more.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:18.491
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah, so, ba-, back, again to stress
the humility part, this doesn't mean you have

00:50:18.491 --> 00:50:19.690
be a doormat.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.780
[Ben laughs]

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:24.410
This doesn't mean, it, it's not the same as,
as being unconfident, right? If, you can still

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:30.720
have self confidence and have opinions and
this is the fine line. This is a lo-, this

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.590
is a really hard thing I think for some people.
Some people have no problem with it, you know?

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.590
[Ben laughs]

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:39.590
But--

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:45.110
&gt;&gt;Ben: Part of getting some respect from,
from peers also, like we've said before, is

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:51.580
getting your hands dirty. Like, effectively,
it's ok to go down in the trenches sometimes,

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.890
or maybe you're curious, or maybe you wanna
learn, or maybe you wanna help. And I think

00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:04.130
it's good to occasionally do that if you have,
if you have the time and the bandwidth, right?

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:13.070
Cuz it'll help you understand the problems
that your team are dealing with more.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.290
&gt;&gt;Fitz: You get a lot of respect and it, it
shows that you're not just here to contribute

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.290
advice.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.290
&gt;&gt;Ben: The next thing--

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:33.570
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And that's, that's again, and that's
if you have time. If you're like swamped out

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:38.300
of your mind and doing way more than you can
already do.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:47.670
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. But the next thing is actually
hard for, for new managers. I know it took

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:53.540
me a long time to figure this out is that
people don't delegate, right? The classic

00:51:53.540 --> 00:52:00.220
new manager is like, "Ok, I'm in charge of
like, instead of this charge of one thing,

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:09.920
I'm in charge of ten things now. So, I'm gonna
try and do it all myself and ask people to

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:15.650
help me." And like, no, you still can only
do one thing, which is to make sure the other

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.820
ten people are doing the ten things, right,
that you delegated, right?

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.141
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, and you, you see something,
you'll see a task that one of your junior

00:52:20.141 --> 00:52:21.720
guys is gonna take three weeks to do when
you can do it in three days and the temptation

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.220
is overwhelming to, to do that thing for them.
And that's when you need to stop, right? Deep

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.540
breath, back up a little bit. But that leads
into the next thing of, of delegating. If

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540
you get a team that's doing enough stuff--

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540
&gt;&gt;Ben: Self powered.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540
&gt;&gt;Fitz: that's self empowered, right. And
there, you hire people a little smarter than

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.540
you, right? Just look to replace yourself,
ok?

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.540
&gt;&gt;Ben: Sounds crazy but that's what sys admins
do, right? Try to replace themselves with

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.540
shell scripts so they can play, play games
at work.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.640
&gt;&gt;Fitz: If you can replace yourself in a shell
script, that's great, too. You can find something

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.000
else to do, I'm sure.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
[Ben laughs]

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.100
Anyone writes a management shell script, please
email it to me. That would be great.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.100
[audience laughter]

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:51.560
&gt;&gt;Ben: But this is, but this is, I think this
is, this is a measurement of success in management,

00:52:51.560 --> 00:53:00.050
right? If you can take a team that is not
performing well at all; lots of fighting,

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:05.900
lots of confusion and you can sort of push
people in different ways.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.510
So, they're still self powered, but they've
become this well-oiled machine to the point

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:16.220
where you can almost just step back and you
barely need to touch that machine anymore.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.150
You're done, right? That is what they're paying
you to do. That's what it means to be a leader.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:22.630
And then you can move on to another team,
right?

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:26.630
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right, and if you have, so you have
these capable peo-, if, bas-, what I think,

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:29.540
focus on what people can do and try and always
give them a little more responsibility than

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.540
what they can actually d-, take, take on.
Without killing them, right? You don't wanna

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.340
like, drive these people into the ground but
you just want to give them the opportunity

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.340
to grow into that.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.490
If they feel a little bit overwhelmed, or,
or push back and realize they can't do that,

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:44.680
then that's ok. You should always give them
the chance because if you cave somebody, they're

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:50.810
never gonna be able to show you what they
can do. And, and you'll often be surprised.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.430
&gt;&gt;Ben: Your successor usually comes from within
the team.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.570
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:57.440
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's a great thing.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:04.910
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, I wanna talk about, briefly about
making waves, ok? Know when to make waves.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:05.910
[Ben laughs]

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:06.910
Right? Th-, that's, I was told that piece
of advice and for, because I was basic-, well,

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.910
I don't wanna talk--

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:08.910
&gt;&gt;Ben: Google Wave?

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.910
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Not these kinda waves, I'm sorry.
It's, it's these kind of waves. I had someone

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:10.910
who I, who I, who reported to me who was making
my life complete hell and I was hoping it

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:11.910
would go away. This ties into the sort of
hoping things will get better, right? There

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.910
are times when you're leading a team that
every ounce of your soul is gonna tell you,

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:13.910
"Just be that calm center of the world."

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:14.910
&gt;&gt;Ben: Don't rock the boat.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.910
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Don't rock the boat. There's something
crazy going on, you just mellow out and it'll

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:16.910
be ok. And that's the time when you should
be just like cannonball and jump right in

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:18.040
and, and make some waves in that team. You
should attack it head on, again in a constructive

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.040
manner, but it's one of those things that's
not gonna wind up--

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040
&gt;&gt;Ben: Or sometimes, sometimes it's beyond
your team. Sometimes it's things happening

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.160
in teams adjacent to you or within the company
and if you ignore it, you're in trouble, right?

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:30.650
So, yeah, it's hard to break that inertia,
that the, the instinct to just curl up and

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.130
just focus and stay safe.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:35.360
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. And that, and another thing--

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's easier.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.360
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We, we, we've sort of touched on this
already but shield your team from distractions

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:44.830
from outside of your, outside, right? Usually,
there's a lot of crazy things going on in

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:45.830
the bureaucracy of the company or in the upper
echelons, and you should, or politics, bureaucracy,

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:46.830
that sort of thing. And basically, allow your
team, give them the luxury of focusing on

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:47.830
what they wanna get done.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:48.830
&gt;&gt;Ben: This next idea is actually, I think
it's more about language, its, it's a very

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.690
specific language tip. The, the worst thing
I've seen happen is maybe your service falls

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:52.100
over and it's one person's fault on the team;
they messed up, right? Took down your whole

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.100
service.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.100
The, the wrong thing to do is to say, "Our
service was down because of Joe." Right? And

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.430
you embarrass that person in front of the
whole team, right? That is not the way to

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.830
do it. What you, what we talk about is when
somebody messes up, they know, right? And

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:00.850
you have, and--

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:01.850
&gt;&gt;Fitz: The team knows.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:03.770
&gt;&gt;Ben: The team knows and you know and the
person knows, right? And you don't need to

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.420
publically humiliate or shame somebody. That's,
that's a stick, right? That's Industrial Revolution

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.560
stick mentality. What you do is you; you talk
about it in private, in a one-on-one. And

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.210
say what happened and blah, blah, blah, you
know, what can we do to stop it in the future?

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:17.840
So, I mean, when talking openly to your team
or talking to the company about your team,

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.852
you talk about we succeed and fail as a, particularly,
you do public praise of an individual, but

00:55:21.852 --> 00:55:22.852
you privately criticize someone, right? So,
"Hey, our team succeeded. Isn't that great?

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:23.852
And super thanks to this person for helping
out in this way, right?" Or, "Oh, our service

00:55:23.852 --> 00:55:24.852
went down and we failed as a team, we'll get
better at that."

00:55:24.852 --> 00:55:25.852
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

00:55:25.852 --> 00:55:26.852
&gt;&gt;Ben: And then you take that one person aside
in private and talk about it, right? So, it's,

00:55:26.852 --> 00:55:27.852
it's just, it's just the way you handle it.
There, there's a tactfulness that's important.

00:55:27.852 --> 00:55:28.852
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. And another thing you should
look to do as a manager is to, is to build

00:55:28.852 --> 00:55:29.852
consensus, right? You need to be that cata-,
catalyst that people can help make things

00:55:29.852 --> 00:55:30.852
happen, right? You, if know, if, you need
to know when to get your team unstuck, ok,

00:55:30.852 --> 00:55:31.852
or when to take a risk, but, but also, you
should be there to take responsibility for

00:55:31.852 --> 00:55:34.500
the failures if you're pushing things along.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.660
&gt;&gt;Ben: Being a teacher, or a mentor. This
helps if you're older, I guess, or have some

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.760
more experience. But, especially when you've
got new people on the team, right? Either

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.130
assign them a mentor, or try to mentor them
yourselves. Letting them, we've talked about

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.240
this a few times already, but letting them
make mistakes and not jumping in and doing

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240
it for them. Letting them goof up and learn
and--

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: It's the whole failure is an option
thing, right? Failure is ok as long as you're

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.240
not failing at the same thing over and over
and over again.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: You should tell your antidote.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: There's a, well, there's a, there's
a story about the, the senior executive that

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.240
made a big business mistake and lost his company
ten million dollars and he comes in the next

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240
morning. He's all depressed cause he's gonna
lose his job and the secretary calls him,

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240
"The CEO wants to see you in his office."
So, he goes into the office, he's like, "I

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.240
suppose you'd like my resignation and here
it is." He says, "Resignation? Why would I

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.240
want your resignation? I just spent ten million
dollars training you." Right?

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.240
[audience laughs]

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.240
So, that, that's a bit of a severe example
of a failure or mistake, but--

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: But letting people iterate and fail
is important.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But I guarantee he'll never make that
mistake again.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.240
[Ben laughs]

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240
Ok? And so, just, just to, to move on here,
set, this is getting a little bit long here

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.240
but--

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's a good story.

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Set clear goals. Your, your team needs
to agree on the plans and you really, I think

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.240
a mission statement is one of those corporate
double-speak things that people freak out

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.240
about. It's really important. If you sit down
and try to come up with like a quick sentence

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240
to convey what you're doing, it's gonna really
cause you to come up with a moment of clarity

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.240
in your team, and you'll probably find out
you don't all agree on where you're going.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's, it's surprising, actually. I
mean, if you took a survey of your teams and

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.240
said, "What is the mission of this thing we're
working on?" You're gonna get different answers

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.240
unless you've already sat down and, and written
a mission statement together and it, it sounds,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240
it sounds hokey?

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: But it makes a huge difference in getting
focused, right? And we're not talking about

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.240
hiring a business consultant, spending weeks
to, to tal-, just have, sit down over lunch,

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240
or sit down for a couple hours and have this
conversation. Because it's amazing when things,

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240
your, you're bombarded with distractions all
the time, right?

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240
Other teams telling you we want this feature
or that thing or we're gonna do this, and

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.240
if you have a written mission statement, it's
very easy to know what is in your scope and

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240
what isn't, right?

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: The Google Web Toolkit--

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's a huge time saver.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: You know, I worked with the Google
Web Toolkit team four years ago now to wor-,

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240
with their mission statement and I was talking
to Bruce Johnson who, if you've ever met him

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240
he's a fantastic guy, I told him, I said,
"I really wanna tell ya-" he said, he told

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240
me how great that was for their team. He's
like, "I never realized how unfocused we were

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240
until we came up with that." And I said, "I'm
really appreciative of you being so supportive

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240
of me at the time to do this because I know
some of your team members didn't want to do

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240
it." He said, "Oh, I really thought it was
a waste of time." He said, --

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: --At the moment, right?

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: "But at the moment I wanted to give
you a try." And it turned out to be one of

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240
the greatest things that--

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.240
[Ben laughs]

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240
that sort of helped them to focus and say,
learn when to say no and when to say yes and

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240
that sort of thing.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: And this, I, this, this is the last
pattern, I think? Yes, yes--

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I hope so.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Finally.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Are we done yet?

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: When we've mentioned this before, right,
about your job is not just to, technical health.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240
It's the social health as well. Right? Have
a happiness meter. Ask yourself; meet with

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.240
your reports once a month. Before you go into
your meetings or one-on-ones with them, say,

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240
"Is this person happy?" And then ask them.
Say," Are you happy?" I mean, it's, it's a

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240
crazy question and a lot of people are taken
back and they'll say, "Yes, I am." or "No,

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240
I'm not and, and here's why. I've been afraid
to tell you." Right? I mean, it's, it really

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240
matters.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: One of the, the scariest questions
I've ever been asked by a person in management

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240
to me is, "What can I do for you? What do
you need from me?" And the first time I was

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.240
asked this, I was just like, "What kind of
question is this?"

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240
[Ben laughs]

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240
What are you supposed to say? But I thought
about it a lot and the next time they said,

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.240
"What do you need me?" I was, man, I was ready.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.240
[Fitz laughs]

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.240
[audience laughs]

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: But, but sometimes I've seen managers,
who are very technical, who take this to heart,

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.240
but the way they deal with it is a very super
technical solution. They'll make a spreadsheet

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240
and they'll track, you know, here's all the
people on the team and here's all the tasks,

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240
and these tasks are fun, and these tasks are
horrible, and I'm gonna assign the tasks this

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.240
way and then the next week I'm gonna rotate,
I'm gonna ro-, so everybody gets a chance

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.240
to, to be miserable and happy and everything's
fair. And that's fine. If it, if it works,

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240
that's great, right? But then, at least, he's
still monitoring the happiness level, right?

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, what Ben's saying is spread the
misery around.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Spread the--

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.240
[Ben laughs]

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right?

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240
[audience laughs]

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240
But, but, by doing this you actually give
everybody a chance to be seen by others outside

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.240
of the team and a lot of times--

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: --to grow.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's also important, right?

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Absolutely.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, ok, enough with the patterns.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Let's, let's do our wrap up which is
longer than the middle, no, I'm kidding.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.240
[Ben laughs]

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: No. So, I think I should tell you
a, a story that, that, this is my mother-in-law's

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.240
philosophy, ok? My, my wife is the last of
six children and my mother-in-laws philosophy

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.240
is about kids is that, and I think it applies
to engineers as well, ok? So, engineers are

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.240
like plants. Everyone needs something different.
Some engineers need more water. Some engineers

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.240
need more sunlight and some engineers need
to be buried in bullshit, ok?

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240
[laughter]

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.240
Your job as their caretaker or leader is to
know who needs what, ok? Applying the same

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240
amount of water, sunlight, and bullshit to
everybody means that some people are gonna

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.240
get way too much of something they don't need
and some people are gonna get way too little

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.240
of something they don't need.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Now, now let's do the spreadsheet version!

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.240
[Ben laughs]

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Spreadsheet version.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: This is, this comes out of various
management classes that we've seen and you

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240
might have seen as well, right? Putting people
on this matrix; are they excited about what

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.240
they're doing or are they bored? Are they
very good at directing themselves and knowing

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.240
what to do next, or are they just scatterbrained
and you just have to constantly tell them

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.240
what to do?

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240
And, what you really want is you wanna get
everybody into that sweet spot in the upper

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.240
left corner. How do you get there, right?
Look at each person individually. More water,

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.240
more light, what do they need? If they are
totally disorganized you need to give them

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.240
some direction, right? Not all direction is
micromanagement, right?

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.240
Some people actually need micromanagement,
as long as it's just for a little bit, right?

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.240
Not, not if it's all the time, if they need
it all the time, something's wrong, but bits

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.240
of direction here and there are great. Get
them, get them self-supporting, right?

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And you might have some people that
aren't challenged enough, or aren't--

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: regularly focused on what they're
doing, or--

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Or they hate what they're doing.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. And so, they're gonna need
some inspiration, right? They're gonna need

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240
some sort of, you're gonna have to figure
out some way to motivate them and we'll talk

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.240
a little about--

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Let's talk about, let's talk about
motivation--

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: About motivation.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: This is, this is the stuff from Dan
Pink's talk, right?

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: This is a great picture; by the way,
it's a carrot on a stick.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240
[Ben laughs]

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240
So there's the carrot and there's the work
you just beat with the stick.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240
[laughter]

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240
Ok?

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240
[Ben coughs]

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.240
So that doesn't work in this place, right?

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, how many people have heard "Intrinsic
vs. Extrinsic Motivations?" It's a trendy

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240
topic now, right? The idea is that these carrot
and stick work faster, that's, that's extrinsic

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.240
motivation, right? It's, its motivation coming
artificially from the outside and on now the

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.240
cool thing in management, which I believe
in, which science confirms, is that--

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --Science!

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: --Science!

00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: --It works!

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. Is intrinsic motivations, in
other words, getting, getting people motivated

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240
internally, right? And it's not about waving
money in front of them, right? It, it's getting

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240
them to actually care about what they're working
on and there's, there's three big parts to

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.240
this that you can name--

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, but you can never get anyone
to, to, to work as, as hard, or care as they

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240
do extrinsic mot-, intrinsic--

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: extrinsic motivations, right? And
this is the whole Dan Pink thing, right?

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.240
&gt;Ben: So what are the three big intrinsic
motivations? The first one is autonomy, right?

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.240
In other words, trusting people to work the
way that they work best, right? If that means

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.240
working from home once in awhile, if that
means having some flexibility in, in who they're

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.240
working with, or how they're doing their work,
that's fine. There's a, there's a, let them

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.240
get their work; they know how to work best,
right? You can't shoehorn--

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, the 20 percent time is an example
of that, right? The, we, we, they get 20 percent

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.240
time to engineers at Google. A lot of the
time, there's, the, they always talk about

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.240
what products came out of 20 percent time.
But, a lot of time it's just permission to

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.240
go chase something down that's bugging you,
right? If you have an idea in your head and

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.240
you sit around and think, "This is this great
idea, it's a great idea. It's just gonna rot

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240
there."

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.240
And, and you go on thinking, "I have this
great idea." And if you took four or five

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240
hours, you might actually get to realize,
"Well, it wasn't such a great idea but it

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240
was interesting and I learned this, this and
this. Now I can go back to everything else

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240
and focus more." And just, you have that sort
of freedom to pursue.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: The, the next motivation is, is what
we call mastery. Giving people the opportunity

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.240
to learn and grow, right? I mean, it's great
to be an expert in something and maybe some

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.240
people view it as job security, but let me
tell you, you get really bored after awhile,

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.240
right?

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240
And if you're not, and if your manager isn't
giving you a chance to learn new things and

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240
get better at something, then, then you're
gonna be frustrated, right? And if it's like,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.240
you're really interested, if there's a chance
to learn something new, you're gonna get,

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.240
you're gonna get excited.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, how many people in this room
participate in the hiring process where they

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.240
work? Ok. Whoa. A lot, that's great. I, there's
a, there's a analogy that I like to use is

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.240
that we're all out there looking for the sharpest
knife in the drawer, right?

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.240
[Ben laughs]

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.240
We all wanna hire the sharpest knife, ok?
There's two things you can do once you get

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240
that knife in your hand, ok? You can go outside
and you can grind it in the sidewalk until

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.240
it's dull.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.240
[Ben laughs]

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240
And then you say, "I have a dull knife." And
you throw it away and you go looking for another

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.240
knife, and, "I have a sharp knife." And then
you grind it down, right? And there's this,

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.240
this sort of burn, this is the process of
burning people out and not giving them a chance

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.240
to learn and grow. You wanna focus on getting
that sharp knife, but keeping it sharp.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.240
Give people opportunities to learn new technology;
to learn new things. Sometimes, it doesn't

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240
even have to be directly related to what you're
doing. We're, we're doing a thing in our Chicago

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.240
office right now, we're having robot contests
now, right? We're building Mindstorm robots

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.240
and--

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yup.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: pitting them against each other in
various ways. Arguably, I don't think we're

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240
gonna be shipping any robots any time soon
for, for our projects in Chicago--

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.240
[Ben laughs]

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.240
but, this, it gives people a chance to get
to know each other, they're learning new stuff--

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Work together.

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: they're working together, etc. And
it's just one example of many, right.

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, the last, last intrinsic motivation
is just giving people a sense of purpose,

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.240
right? We, we've talked in other, in other
talks about letting people drive the bus,

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.240
right, and not just one driver. Let them work
on something they care about, give them a

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.240
sense of ownership or stake, right? And it
isn't just some thing that's being handed

00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.240
down from the highest levels of management
and they're just a cog in, in the machine.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.240
Let them actually have an opinion, have a
voice, direct where it's going, right? Take

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.240
turns giving the direction.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right, cuz if you follow all of this
stuff and you hired really smart people who

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.240
are really motivated, they're gonna wanna
work on something really big like that. I

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.240
interviewed a guy once and I said, "If you
could do anything in the world, what would

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.240
you wanna do?" And he sat there and he looked
up and he thought for a second and he said,

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.240
"I just wanna add value." And I was horrified
by that--

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: [laughs] I wanna add value.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Really, that's all you can come up
with? I give you any opportunity to do anything

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.240
and you want to add value, add value to what?
I mean, are you an adding machine?

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.240
[audience and Ben laughter]

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.240
So, reverse Polish engineering. So, that's,
that sort of sums up the majority of the advice

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.240
of being a manager and leading other people.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Can we say the words? Autonomy, mastery,
and purpose, right?

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right?

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Thank you, Dan. So, let's, let's, let's--

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We have a secret extra session that,
that we're not gonna tell anyone else about

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.240
outside of this room, except for YouTube.
And that's the Managing your Managers section,

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.240
right?

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.240
[Ben laughs]

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.240
This is, this is how to, it's about a couple
of things, right?

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, well how did we come up with
this section, right? Someone actually told

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240
us when they heard an intro version of this
talk, they said, "You know I walked away from

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.240
your talk saying 'I'm a software engineer,
I'm not managing people, what do I get out

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.240
of this talk? What can I walk away with? What
can I do, as an engineer to help my manager

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.240
help me?'" And we said, "Oh, that's an interesting
take on something, right?" Help me to help

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240
you to help me.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And, and, and this isn't about any
sort of evil manipulation and that, that only

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.240
really works if you have a really crappy manager,
alright? And we're not gonna teach you about

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240
dealing with a crappy manager; manipulation,
you can figure that out on your own.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.240
[audience laughs]

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.240
This is, this is about how to make yourself
easier to manage, improve relations with your

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240
good leaders, so to speak here, and how you
can help them lead you.

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. So let's, let's just give a
few, a few takeaways for engineers--

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We'll do those pretty quickly.

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: This--

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: You're all gonna be, you're gonna
say, "This is so obvious." I'm gonna get obvious

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.240
now.

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So obvious, right, right, right. First
of all, act like a grown-up, right? Don't

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.240
expect to be micromanaged, get your work done
on time without someone poking you, right?

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240
And, well what, what's your story?

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I, I had a new engineer starting.
He was a really senior guy and he's a, I,

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.240
I, I still work with him to this day--

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.240
[Ben laughs]

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.240
and as his first day--

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: --Much smarter than us.

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And, exactly, much smarter than me.
And he came in his first day, at the end of

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.240
the day; he came to my office at like a quarter
to five and said, "I gotta head out now. I

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.240
have an appointment that I set up like, months
ago for a doctor and, you know, I just like"

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.240
and he's just going on and on and I'm just
like, "Why are you telling me this?"

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.240
[Ben laughs]

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.240
And, and I said, "Look, don't tell me these
things." I said, "You come to work when you

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.240
come to work, you go home when you go home.
As long as you work 70 to 80 hours a week,

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240
I don't care."

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.240
[audience laughs]

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.240
And he looked at me and said, "Wow, I'm gonna
have so much free time at my new job!"

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240
[laughter]

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240
But, I, I sort of gave, try to give them like
this sort of joke at the end there, but, I

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240
mean, the, the purpose of the matter is that,
look, I'm not here, I, I'm not gonna judge

00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240
your productivity by how many time, hours
I see your butt in that seat.

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right. But if, if you were, get your
work done and if you're not people will notice.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240
But, don't expect to be nagged to get your
work done.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: The next thing you can do is to, and
this goes with the mastery, right? Pursue

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240
new things, pursue responsibility, don't just
fall into your old, little world and put up

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240
with a stick in a cave and this is what I
know and I'm not gonna do anything else, right?

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240
Show some forward growth; show some interest
in other things. Go to your manager and say,

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240
"I want to work on something new, or I wanna
be responsible for this new thing."

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So you step out of your comfort zone,
right?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yep, yep.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Another thing is to allow mistakes,
ok? Remember that failure is ok; take calculated

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240
risks. If you screw up or something happens,
write a post mortem, identify what went wrong,

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.240
identify what you've learned from this--

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Absolutely.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: and, and move ahead. And again, the
whole "failure is ok" thing is, is really

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240
important as long as you're not failing at
the same thing and use it as a learning opportunity.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: The other thing you can do as an engineer
is, is to, to talk. Just let people know what

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.240
you're thinking. Let your teammates know what
you think, let your manager know what you

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240
think. Nothing, nothing is, is more frustrating
to me, at least as a manager, is when somebody

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240
goes, "Ok, I got my task. I go off in my cave,
see you in a week." It's like, well, are,

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.240
are you frustrated? Or is it going ok for
you, is it not going ok? Like, what do you

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240
do? I don't wanna just talk to you once a
week.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, they just expect that you're
omniscient; you're just gonna figure it all

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240
out.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, yeah. So, so, share, share what's
going on, right? It helps if somebody is sitting

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.240
next to you and you can turn around and say,
"I'm really frustrated right now." Or, "This

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240
is great."

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Or I have a great idea for something,
that sort of thing.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Pointing out obstacles is also, also
very helpful.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: It ties in.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah, don't, it's, it's sort of that
constructive, almost criticism of the product,

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240
in that case. Don't be shy; don't be afraid
to point out that this is what's a problem

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240
that you see because--

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Your manager is not omniscient.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So many obstacles that need--

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And this is something that's really
important to me is, is argue, ok? I don't

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240
want yes-men working for me. I, I, cuz I probably
got way too much going on for me to get all

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240
the details right and someone would ask me
a question and I, I would interrogate them

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240
a bit and I'll say, "Yeah, what about this?"
And they'll be like, "Yeah!" And they'll go

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240
off and do it when I, what I really wanted
to do was have more of a dialogue and hear

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240
more of what they're thinking.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right, but dialogue is the way you
solve problems, not, "Here's my idea." "Yes,

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240
sir." That doesn't solve--

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.240
&gt;Fitz: Wait, I'm gonna admit that I'm wrong.
My mind is changed; I changed my mind and

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240
if, if I deserve it, then criticize me. Certainly.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Let's finish up.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.240
&gt;&gt;Ben and Fitz: Is anyone still awake?

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Ok, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. So, let's talk about three concepts

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240
you can walk away with, right? Here's the
three things to remember when you leave the

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.240
room. First of all, being a manager is about
serving people, not having them serve you.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.240
You serve them.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240
Second thing, all the patterns and antipatterns
somehow trace back to mutual respect, right?

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240
You respect them; they respect you back, vice
versa, right?

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.240
And the third thing is think about what people,
what's motivating them, right? It's not carrots

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.240
and sticks. It's whether they actually care
about what they're working on, are they growing,

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.240
are you giving them autonomy and trust to,
to, to do what they need to do?

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And with that, so stop being a manager
and start being a leader.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: That's it.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And with that, thank you guys for
joining us today.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Thanks.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
[applause]

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Everybody's like, lunchtime, they're
out of here. If you have a question, just

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
step up to the mic.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: No, I think they're hungry. Or we'll
let the hungry people leave. If anybody has

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240
questions, we'll stick around.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Oh, he's got a question.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience1: Hi. I got a question on,
on the Wave?

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: It is on the Wave, we didn't see it.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240
&gt;&gt;audience1: There, there are a couple of
questions you can check, too. Managers invest

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240
a lot of effort in sharpening the knives,
or keeping them sharp. And the problem I'm,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240
if that, if you're a good manager and you
have your, all your knives are sharp, other

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240
managers start looking for your sharps. So,
what would you recommend for your sharp knives?

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.240
So, what would you recommend for improving
the, the team, I don't know how to say it

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240
in English, like fidelity or, or people--

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Cohesiveness, you're trying to retain
your people?

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240
&gt;&gt;audience1: Wanting, wanting to stay in your
sharp drawer and not someone else's.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, the questions about if you have
a drawer full of sharp knives, how do you

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240
retain them?

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.240
&gt;&gt;audience1: Yeah.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Without other people, --

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: How to keep other chefs out of your
knife drawer?

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: I'm not sure I like the, I'm not sure
I like the underlying assumptions there, right?

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.240
There's a territorialness that, it's a little
odd. I mean, I, I know that's sort of the

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.240
norm for corporate culture is to have managers
fighting with each other over people.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I think, I think that the, the real
solution to that is to turn it around, is

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240
to focus on making, making your, the, work
environment and the culture of your team,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240
and focusing your product, no matter what
you're working on as being compelling and

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240
as interesting as possible for people. And
let, if someone decides they wanna go somewhere

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240
else, or they want a change of venue, or need
to move somewhere or something, they're gonna

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240
do that and--

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: And try to make it not your fault,
though.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.240
[Ben laughs]

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yes, exactly. Try to make them leave
because they found a more attractive knife

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240
drawer, not because they hate yours.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, or, or they're bored with your
project or something.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: This analogy is just not going that
far, right?

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240
[Ben laughs]

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240
&gt;&gt;audience1: Thank you.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240
Next question?

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience2: Hey, this is on the Wave,
too. Do you guys do anything different for

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240
volunteer projects versus managing a team
at a paid organization?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Do we do anything different for volunteer
projects compared to a big organization? In

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240
my experience, it has not been very different
but then again, Google is not a typical company,

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240
either, right? It's sort of run in a very
open source-y kind of way.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I think, I think it can be harder,
the, I think it's always harder at, in an

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.240
environment where its paid and I, even at
Google. I would argue just because people

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240
who are volunteering are there because they
want to all the time and I feel like they're

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240
excited and happy because they're part of
that team because, the interview processes

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240
is what gets you into the company and you're
just dumped into a team, in a lot of cases.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240
When you join a volunteer project, like--

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: They're intrinsically motivated already.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right. When you join a volunteer project,
you're not only intrinsically motivated, but

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240
you, you're typically, the culture sort of
selects for you, right? So, it takes a certain

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240
amount of, it's sort of like a transmission.
You have to get up to speed and mesh gears

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.240
before you're gonna join that team, or they're
gonna accept you. And so, if you, if there,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.240
if there isn't that gear meshing and people
don't see it as a, more of a privilege to

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240
be on a team, then I think it, I think that's
what makes it harder.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: I see it as volunteers are intrinsically
motivated so they typically need more direction,

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240
where when you're in a company, you're getting
paid no matter what. I think people need more

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240
intrinsic motivation, and less direction.
I guess that's how I would weight it.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Yeah.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Other questions? Come, come to the
microphone.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience3: Please, please, last question.
It's not very clear for me i-, what happen

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240
if one person of your team is, is your real
friend, is a best friend for you. What do

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240
you do in this case?

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: What do you do when one per-, well,
what do you do when the person standing next

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240
to you on stage reports to you? Hmmm, what
did we do? Well, I mean, in our case, it was--

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: We dodged a bullet.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240
&gt;&gt;audience3: What do we do when we lose--

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, Ben actually reported to me
for awhile because Chicago needed someone

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240
to run the engineering office. And, it, it,
at first, I think we both thought it would

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240
be a little bit awkward, but it, I don't think
it was because, it was easy in our case because

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.240
Ben is very intrinsically motivated--

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Right.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: and, and doesn't need a lot of direction.
If it had been the other way, I don't know

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240
how easy it would've been.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: If it's like, if, if your peer is not
performing well and you're supposed to deliver

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240
news, I honestly I would get out of that situation
I guess. I would've gone, if I ever found

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240
myself in that situation, managing a friend
who is not performing well, I would've asked

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240
to, to, for my manager to change the situation.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Sort of recu-, you recuse yourself
from management in that case.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah, yeah.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's probably would have been the
best thing to do.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: If the persons just an awesome performer
then you can just turn a blind eye and it's

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.240
not a problem.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Right, cause you're running to keep
up with them anyway.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: [laughs] Right.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: One more question?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience4: You're advice was don't
ignore the humans element in your team, which

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240
is very good advice, but sometimes your team
members have personal issues outside of work

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240
between themselves. And there's this very
thin line between trying to intervene in their

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240
personal lives and it's also affecting their
work. So, I know this is probably not an easy

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240
question to answer, but, have you had any
experiences where your teammates had personal

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240
issues between themselves outside of work
that is affecting their work?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: So, if, the question is have we had
problems with teammates having interpersonal

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240
issues outside of work affecting work? How
do you deal with that?

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well--

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Without crossing a line.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: There's, I, its, its, it's very careful,
its, it's a very, its, it's a problem that

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240
be, that has to be handled with care and with
empathy, I think. But, the, it's not like

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240
you get them both in a room. I'm gonna lock
you in this room and you're not coming out

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240
until you both write 25,000 lines of code
or something, or work your issues out. I think

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240
the real answer there is that you, you can
look to see if there's, if it's possible to

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.240
easily and simply move someone to another
team--

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: That's what I would do.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: That's, that's the easy way out. But,
the, the fact of the matter is I would probably

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.240
sit down in a very cour-, short and frank
conversation with both of them and say, "Look,

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240
you know, what I'm seeing here is some sort
of issues working with so-and-so."

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: --Which is impacting the rest of the
whole team.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: "Which seems to be impacting the whole
team. Can you tell me why that might be?"

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.240
Ok? And this is a, this is a great technique
that I learned--

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Socratic.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: on, on delivering hard feedback, is
to sort of ask them questions. "Why is it

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240
that you're having, that there's an issue,
that I perceive an issue with it? Why do,

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
why do you think I'm seeing that?"

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: "What do you think we should do about
it?"

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And, and then just keep asking questions,
they'll give your answer. And I would talk

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240
to both of them quite frankly about that,

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: And then compliment their beard.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: And then compliment their beard, right.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240
[laughter]

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240
&gt;&gt;Male audience5: It's interesting that, this
is some famed, renowned company right now,

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240
so I'm deeply, personally involved in the,
figuring out the question. R-, the answer

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240
to this question but it's interesting that
you spend a lot of time talking about "team",

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240
but every company I've worked for in the past,
at the end of the quarter it's, "Who's the

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
employee of the month?"

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
And to me, that's the number one destroyer
of team because, well, I helped that guy a

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
lot solving his problem and he got the recognition
and I didn't. So, one of the things I-, I've

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240
really thought about is I'm trying to build
a culture of my company is there will be no

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.240
individual awards. There will be team awards
with one person designated as helping, with

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.240
the team deciding how to distribute the reward
because as soon as you have an employee of

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240
the month, it's all about me now.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: So, you're creating one winner and
a whole bunch of losers--

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: With the leader awards, right?

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.240
&gt;&gt;audience5: Exactly, right. It's, this--

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: I think I like Google's solution to
the problem which is to have peer bonuses.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240
Like, if somebody you, you run into somebody
at Google who does something amazing, way

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240
beyond the call of what you expected from
that person; could be on your own team, could

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.240
be some other team. You can actually nominate
them for a peer bonus and usually it'll get

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240
approved and then they, it may not be announced
to the whole company, but that person feels

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.240
appreciated, feels like they went above and
maybe it's just private between the two of

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240
you, right, and the manager, and that's it.
I think that's, it's pretty effective without,

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240
without getting into the whole superstar--

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: But, but there's, it, in summary,
yeah, I agree with you.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240
[Ben laughs]

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240
&gt;&gt;audience5: I was hoping you had a insight,
but I like the peer award--

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We have no insight at all really.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240
[Ben laughs]

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240
I think we're fresh out of insight. No, I
mean insight on how to basically build culture

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240
in that set-, in that setting.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.240
&gt;&gt;audience5: Well, how, how to reward, how
to reward without picking, like you said,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240
who, who gets to be up on stage and who doesn't?
Who gets the recognition and who doesn't,

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240
right? Which is a very, like you missed the
cutoff by like, point one percent kind of

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240
thing, or something stupid like that. Only
one person can be valedictorian.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: I think the, the way that I reward,
I reward top performers that are working with

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240
me are, is, basically with more opp-, more
opportunity. I, I focus really hard on what

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.240
I can do--

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240
&gt;&gt;audience5: Hold up, I'm gonna interrupt
you. I'm not talking about the top performers;

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240
I'm talking about the people that enabled
the top performers to be top performers.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Well, I think I recog-, ok, so, I
also help them, I mean, it's again, anyone

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.240
who's working toward the betterment of the
team is a, is a good performer, a good, solid

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.240
performer, ok? So it's not about, there aren't
any awards that are sort of extrinsic motivations,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240
like, "You're gonna get two carrots, and you're
gonna get three carrots." Right? That sort

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240
of thing. I, so, we can chat more about that
later.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: We're actually; we're actually out
of time.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: We are out of time.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: W-, w-, we'll go in the hallway--

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Ok.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: if you wanna keep chatting.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240
&gt;&gt;Fitz: Thank you all. Have a good day.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240
&gt;&gt;Ben: Thanks.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:51.241
[applause]
