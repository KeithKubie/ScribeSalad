00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.670
&gt;&gt; This piece is a 1789
imprint by the New York printers

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.730
and booksellers, Hodge, Allen,
and Campbell of the acts

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.890
of the first session
of the first Congress

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.330
under the Federal
Constitution of 1789.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.820
On the title page of this
item appears the signature

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.900
of its former owner, George
Washington, the first President

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.940
of the United States under
the new Constitution.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.640
An interesting feature about
this item is its inclusion

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.250
of the twelve proposed
amendments to the Constitution,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
ten of which would
become the bill of rights.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150
Another interesting feature of
the Library of Congress copy

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.010
of the work is an ad
placement found on both sides

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.960
of the printed leaf which
solicited subscribers

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.090
for what would be the
first American edition

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.210
of what was known
as "Brown's Bible"

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.780
or "The Self Interpreting
Bible."

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.760
Brown's Bible was an
immensely popular study bible,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.240
rich with notes and commentary,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.490
assembled by the Scottish
theologian, John Brown.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.220
The advertisement
promises its readers

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.610
that the edition will include
a list of the subscribers

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.360
who made its printing possible.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.930
The printers made good on their
promise when Hodge, Allen,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
and Campbell produced
the bible in 1792,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.610
the list of subscribers
included some

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.180
of the most well known people
in America of that time.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.720
Among those, one stands out,
literally, in large letters

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.640
above the list appears
the name and title

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.170
of the first subscriber,
George Washington,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.120
President of the United States.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.730
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.160
of Congress, visit
