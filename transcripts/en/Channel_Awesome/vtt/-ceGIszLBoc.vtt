00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.010
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.129
I remember it so you don't have to. Let's be honest,

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.079
If you took Pixar out the equation Disney would still be putting out some damn good CGI films.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.500
From Tangled to Wreck-it Ralph to Frozen  to Moana, Disney has been making smash after smash winning over both audiences and critics

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.800
Some of them are even among the highest-grossing movies of all time. It's amazing the quality of films. They're pushing out

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.879
God, did it not start that way.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.589
Being Disney's second computer animated film without Pixar, Chicken Little is among one of the most awkward, uncomfortable

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.790
mean-spirited movies they've ever made and don't get me wrong

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.990
I love mean-spirited Disney. Whether it be their villains, creepy imagery or, whatever Christ this is.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600
But that's not what Chicken Little is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.419
It's supposed to be bright, colorful, and upbeat but instead it's eerie, disturbing and as upbeat as an animated series

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.640
on The Good Son. How does such a thriving CG empire hatch from such an ugly rotten egg?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130
Well, we're here to take an unfortunate look.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.999
Let's see why our IQs are falling with Chicken Little.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.269
So, the movie is so unclear with its tone that it actually has three false starts. Once upon a time...

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.029
How many times have ya heard that to  begin a story?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.499
No, I don't think so. It sounds familiar. Doesn't it? Oh, no. No, not the book.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.199
How many have seen opening the book before? You know naming cliches surprisingly doesn't make you above them.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.850
You have to actually do something with them.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.499
It's like if I start off a movie with this: The movie starts in a store-- no a house--- no a bar

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.679
Sorry, sometimes I type my post-it notes into the script.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.279
So, they decide to go with, I guess, no intro as we just cut to Chicken Little telling everybody to run for cover

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.529
leading to some already confusing jokes.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.820
I guess what's supposed to be funny is rabbits have a lot of kids how they all fit into one stroller is at least an

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.419
abstractly forced joke. How's this for world building? A universe comprised entirely of animals is watching Indiana Jones.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.190
This universe is as coherent as a VR chat room. Nothing is established. But hey a giant water tower knocks out cars honking Old MacDonald

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.830
Get it? I don't. As if all of this wasn't aggressively nonsensical enough, keep in mind

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.550
we're not even two minutes in. Nothing is properly established except Zootopia's direct-to-dvd sequel clearly needed 10 more rewrites.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.889
Don't tell me the main character's name. I was happy in this anarchy of confusion.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.360
This is 12 year old Chicken Little voiced by 30-year old Zach Braff.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.610
I know it's a piece of the sky somewhere. That matches as well as Dr. Claw voicing Ariel.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.719
Says the sky is falling but everyone thinks he confused it for an acorn. It doesn't help either. They start saying gibberish for

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.450
never any established reason.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.649
I wonder what that is backwards, I still stand by Garden State fool

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.720
so the town makes a movie about him as towns do

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.589
That's just one year later and littles father voiced by Gary Marshall

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.829
Constantly reminds him of his failure would be better for you just to lay low don't call attention to yourself, right? Yes

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.170
It's it's like a game a game of hide-and-seek except the goal is never to be found

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.160
Ever the important thing is you feel no love from me like my audiences reaction to the other sister

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:15.989
Are we don't make eye contact? Okay, he rung a bell not decapitated a student book burnings have more tolerance than this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.499
After discovering even traffic won't stop for him

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.470
He makes it to class where Patrick Stewart plays his greatest role since a pile of shit as the teacher who reads off the students

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.959
Names, it just happened to be descriptive phrases Foxy Loxy present pretty and punctual runt of the litter

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.490
fish-out-of-water

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.840
Abby Mallard

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.490
Ugly Duckling. AAAah

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.419
Hello, hello, this is the 1950s we'd like our cartoon sound effect at something ugly back. I'm sorry. I have no control over that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.819
Oh, well, who does they suppose the people who made this movie but they made it in 2005, right?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.360
Yeah, when they have moved on to newer material by then, well, what would think for Disney Oh God Disney used that joke

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.469
They must be in Arad. Well, they will be for a while, but believe it or not. They do pull out

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.470
why am I still going with this joke has

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.700
Anyone noticed by the way, the animation moves like a choppy cut scene from a PlayStation 2 game

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.449
Everyone is either spastic or has more Mali in them than the movie ghost

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.810
Split into two teams

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.950
popular versus unpopular move over George Orwell

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.520
Someone else has beaten you for best commentary. Coach .Yeah, un popular? shouldn't we review safety guidelines

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.820
Sure, hit the pig kids

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.680
Why do I feel like this world is one step away from man in the high castle

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200
Just do what Fish is doing

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.770
Waste copyright money on a song for a joke that blows?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.520
Chicken Little tells Ugly Duckling played by Joan Cuzac that he wants to do something great to get everyone's mind off the goof up

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.889
They made a year ago and make his dad proud again

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:03.449
But she doesn't think it's a good idea the nut needs to be cracked open.  bam smashed bits of emotion flying everywhere anger frustration

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.089
Denial fear you see what I'm saying?

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:16.170
Character over explains something that nobody understands. Classic outdated comedy. Now comes the  part where we throw our heads back and laugh. Ready?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.600
No

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.920
There's a whole section about it in this month's modern mallard

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.529
She says he needs closure with his father but fish-out-of-water uses the cards that fall out of her magazine to build a skyscraper

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.320
I

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.779
Thank this movie for allowing me to reference loaded weapon one by asking the question you stole from loaded weapon one

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.600
Little tells the bullies to stop picking on them, but he's flung against the window adding to the good cheer

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.869
This film has to offer. I guess this is done while the teacher is gone

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.800
But really wouldn't it be encouraged while the teacher was there? This world is pretty sick

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.200
He sets off the fire alarm though, of course getting blamed leading to his father called to the principal's office

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.950
Now look buck. You were buck Ace. Cluck our school baseball star your kid

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.409
He's nothing like you at all

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.250
that

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.520
In no way connects to anything, but it's good to know the principal's as big a dick in this world as anyone else

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.980
Little decides to sign up for the baseball team to try and make his dad proud when he's constantly benched

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.289
until his big break up next

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.860
Chicken Little

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.040
You're gonna fail and we don't love you

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.119
Surprisingly though he makes a hit immediately winning over the town's bottomless pit of shallow attention even his asshole dad

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.420
Congratulate his athletic achievement with passive-aggressive praise

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.759
I guess that puts the whole sky is falling incident behind us once and for all

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.379
My love for you was like a grocery store staff constantly shifting depending on convenience

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.920
But things change when apparently a piece of the sky falls, but he keeps it a secret so people don't mock him again

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.589
So he calls ugly duckling and runt of the litter who are singing beautifully dated. Karaoke if you wanna be my

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.919
Foot size joke in frozen gets a PG but singing about the qualifications of being someone's lover every toddler should see that

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.949
Or how about this nugget of family okayness?

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:23.150
Remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky and it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.629
It's frozen pee. I love my kids films to have towns getting pissed on. I really need more of that in Winnie the Pooh

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.850
He shows them the device but it accidentally sucks up fish out of water and they go to save him

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.099
What was that about oh

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.130
It's amazing how none of this is like the original source material at all. I hope this doesn't become a thing

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.170
The kids go into the alien ship where they find fish out of water as well as apparently an evil plan to destroy the earth

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.639
Either that or they're just marking off places. They've already been I cross off a day on my calendar. I didn't destroy the day

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.819
The aliens find the kids though and try to attack gee I wonder if a crop circle joke is coming up

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:35.219
Great just throw a door at them and a glass of water and they'll be beat for life

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.000
Chicken Little rings the bell alerting the town, but of course the aliens go away and no one believes him again

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.719
It's the Acorn thing all over again. Yeah, there's no story here. Well, at least we can sell the video the chickens gone wild

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.100
I don't know what's more disturbing.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.359
The fact that there's a show called chickens gone wild or the fact that a little boy qualifies to be in it

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.849
Mommy take away your Streisand collection. Okay, can the remainder of this review just be me speculating?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.940
What kind of animal Streisand is in this world? I'm gonna say anteater

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.859
Of course, he looks to his dad for support who completely turns his back on him yet again

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.039
I I'm really sorry about this everyone looks like this is just a big crazy misunderstanding

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.899
They designed him with two apple seeds for eyes. It's amazing. He sees anything at all

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.420
One of the aliens is left behind though

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.709
And I do have to give credit that they could have gone with just a generic alien design

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:38.099
But they do get creative by putting Rainbow Brite shoes on troll hair

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.059
Let's be honest Kingdom of the Crystal Skull would have been a little better if this was the alien

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.959
Thus he ends up befriending little his name is Kirby. They left him behind

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600
Darth Vader's Luke's father. Oh

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.670
Come on, Lucas films are the only human movies we get out here. How aren't we talking about them more?

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:59.369
But the sky breaks apart for all the town to see and the aliens start invading looking for their kid

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.620
We gotta go. No, wait dad. I gotta tell you something. What what I know. I know you were right alien invasion

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.870
I see that now look up okay for the amount of asshol-iness. We've been putting up with that's not enough

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:16.169
We need like the entire town to bow down to him like Return of the King. You keep getting copyrights for other songs

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.170
How about how a source scored from that moment?

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.860
Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.860
son

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.220
Son forget it buck. It's chicken town

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.909
Where they play chickens gone wild seriously. What was that?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.389
Well, obviously ripping off Spielberg's War of the Worlds though apparently not obvious enough as they literally have to tell you

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:38.560
It's like War of the Worlds out there

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.010
And this isn't a parody of the matrix

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.389
Buck catches up to Chicken Little and they try to work things out you're never there for me

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.070
I mean you were you were there when I won the big game, but not when I thought the sky fell. your mom

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.650
she was you know, she

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.140
Was always good with stuff like this

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.460
I'll never forget the day. She never came back from Panda Express

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.029
But you need to know that. I love you

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.640
And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like that was something you had to earn

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:09.820
No, I mean granted any love I've shown for you has clearly been done through earning it, but that's not what I

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.660
 

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.280
That's what I intended. Oh

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.720
And he kisses ugly duckling because their relationship was so special they decide to spring it on you at this very moment

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.039
That's closure. Now Foley. You showed how it started

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.430
By the way for the amount of aliens looking for this kid

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.719
How can they not spot Conan O'Brien's pubic hair running through this gray colourless city?

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.940
Even when they do find him they don't turn him over

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.950
I think it's a safe bet any of these ships will get him to his parents, but they're anything like chicken littles dad

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.019
I'm just assuming they disowned him already

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.320
They make it to the roof and try to get the alien to the literal mothership

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.280
But they get beamed up and talk to the aliens dad release the child

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.600
You have violated intergalactic law 90210

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.100
 

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.670
I recognize that number. That means it's funny

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.630
it'd be

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.810
Nice if there was some connection to that zip code that gave it some relevance but just me recognizing it is enough

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.090
Writing words are hard

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.669
But the Son comes in to save them and returns the town  to how did willy wonka  put it a normal?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.519
Terrible old selves that is except for Foxy Loxy who seems to have lost her bully tomboy ways

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.210
Way to put her back the way she was Oh

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.550
Little girl her parents raised is dead, but show tunes

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.509
Darling look at the time we better get a move on I

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.920
Guess I shouldn't be shocked that Disney merchandising has made it to planets

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.670
off the map but having Mickey with the third eye, isn't that kind of like alien blackface?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.999
I like to see the movie they make about you now

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.890
I just hope they stay true to what really happened. Oh son. These people are from Hollywood

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.600
This irony's so thick

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600
Tony Stark is making a suit out of it. the movies

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.720
of course overblown

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.889
Ridiculous and has no connection to the original tale and the film version

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.430
They watch isn't that good either now, you can throw your head back and laugh. I

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.439
Gotta give credit to casting Adam West as macho Chicken Little though

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.700
It may be the only funny scene in the movie. The sky is

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
Please call me

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.969
Ace and yet, it's still more accurate than the blindside

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.560
Chicken Little the dad and the audience are happy with the movie though proving

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.329
This film's moral the facts and deeper meaning don't mean shit as long as you're satisfied for the moment

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.469
The credits roll with runt and foxy singing a duet because

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.319
That's really funny, you know because of all their interactions that they had with each other and now they're complete opposites

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.490
oh, you know what the interactions like this couple seconds and no we're goddamn else Chicken Little it's about

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.040
relationships

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.770
Question mark five explanation points

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.160
Yes, this is not only an unfunny film. It's just kind of a rotten film

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:15.390
Everyone is so needlessly cruel and not in a fun way had the world characters or environments then better realize are defined

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.049
Maybe the meaner jokes could have worked but it just tosses you an awkward cruelty after awkward cruelty. Yes

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.089
There's a good lesson about parents and kids listening to each other, but it's done with such bland and/or

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:32.789
Unlikable characters that it's hard to take reasonably and on top of that. It's just not the story

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.620
It's like if the tortoise and the hare had aliens and the moral is never trust a wolf in sheep's clothing

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.070
It just doesn't add up

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.479
I hear a lot of people grew up liking this and if that's the case

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.589
I can't fault the message it's trying to get across but as Disney films go. This is a spoiled egg worth passing on

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.589
I'm the Nostalgia Critic and next week. I better get a better bird movie

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.370
That's not based on a phone app game

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.590
Piggy-corn of all flat

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.410
Hey, I'm Doug Walker doing the charity shout out and if you see this you probably know what charity I'm doing today

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.410
It's the children's health fund

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.960
yeah, I know you've seen that Red Nose campaign here and there and it's for a good reason the children's health fund is committed to

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:59.519
Ensuring high quality health care to America's most disadvantaged children. They achieved this through expanding access to comprehensive primary care

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.100
reducing health barriers to learning

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:09.930
Responding to the needs of children impacted by major public health crisis and improving the health and well-being of children through efficacy and public

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:17.729
education efforts over the years they've replicated this approach across the country today the national network provides care through

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.719
24 innovative pediatric care programs and affiliates that serve children in poor rural and urban communities

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.650
Across the country if you look at their site in their YouTube channel

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:34.080
You can see just how hard they work to make sure as many children as possible get the care

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.599
They need get your red nose on and donate to an organization working hard to help so many
