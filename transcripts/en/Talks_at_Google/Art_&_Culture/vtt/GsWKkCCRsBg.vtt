[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.782
ANDY WEGST: Thank you.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:11.490
Hello, everybody.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.350
Everybody can hear me OK?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.400
All right, excellent.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.140
Thank you, Michelle,
and I thank you,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.150
[INAUDIBLE] for making
this all come together.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.610
It's been a long journey,
but we finally made it.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.660
Excellent.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.350
Thank you all for
coming this afternoon.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
As she mentioned, I'm a
photographer, cinematographer,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.490
who currently specialize
in animal conservation,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.280
wildlife conservation.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.430
I've been doing animal
films for a long time,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.140
but only in the last
three or four years,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.960
have I've been focused
solely on conservation.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.790
Today, I'd like to give
you a presentation I

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.040
call the "Struggle of Beauty."

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.620
It's a series of
about 40 photographs

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.870
that I've spent the
last, say, three or four

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
years shooting mostly in
Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.010
There's a couple other
outliers, but mostly

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.050
those three countries.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.000
And I've focused
on these countries,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.650
because of an
organization that I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.840
work with in San
Francisco called Wild Aid.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.700
What we do is we work to
reduce the illegal demand

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.550
for trafficked wildlife parts.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.640
So elephant ivory, rhino
horn, shark fin soup,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.450
pangolins, you name it,
sea turtles, tigers,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.940
all kinds of animals
that are bought and sold

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.300
for mostly bones or skin
or things like that.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.970
In my work in Africa
with Wild Aid,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.330
we do local campaigns in these
countries, Uganda, Tanzania,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.660
Kenya, and now we're
starting Zimbabwe

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.660
and Mozambique and Gabon,
where I'll be next week.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.340
And we encourage people there
in Africa on the supply side,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.690
sadly, to take a broader
interest in their wildlife

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.180
and in their natural resources
that they have right there

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.260
in front of them.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.120
Surprisingly, a lot
of people in Africa

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.390
who live next to, for instance,
Amboseli National Park,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.500
this photo here, have never
seen an elephant in real life

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.924
or a lion or a rhino.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.340
And so we encourage
these people--

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.520
we have a campaign in Africa
called Poaching Steals From Us

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.539
All.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.190
And what we try
to do is encourage

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.820
people to recognize the
wealth of their own backyard.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.070
The other part of
our work is in Asia,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.700
where the demand side
mostly is, and there,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.340
we carry out large
media campaigns, focused

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.420
on changing cultural
attitudes, raising awareness,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.850
those kind of things,
that buying these products

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.140
is really not such a great idea.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.330
So with that, we'll get started.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.870
Just to begin with, this is
a lovely herd of elephants

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.250
in Amboseli National Park.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.830
You can see Mount
Kilimanjaro sort of shrouded

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.660
in the background there.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.660
Has anybody been to Kenya
and seen a good view

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.160
of Mount Kilimanjaro?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.960
It's a rare day when you get
to see a nice view of Mount

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.460
Kilimanjaro.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.580
This is an elephant
in Serengeti.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.250
Who's been to Africa?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.750
Wow.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.070
That's great.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.920
That's awesome.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.890
And just shout out
what countries?

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.520
South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.690
That's awesome.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.470
Rwanda.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.850
Wow, excellent.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.270
And most of those have been
vacations, safari vacations,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.740
things like that?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.210
Has anybody gone for like other
kinds of work or anything?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.560
Excellent.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.520
Well, part of the point of this
exhibition or this presentation

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.130
is to peel back the curtain a
little bit on what most of us

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.340
normally see when
we go to Africa.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.500
Normally, when we book
a trip to Africa, say,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.590
South Africa or
Kenya or Tanzania,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.210
we go, we get off the plane,
we're met at the airport.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.330
We have a wonderful
safari driver.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.710
We stay in beautiful lodges.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.790
We eat great food,
get up in the morning,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.610
take pictures of
beautiful animals all day,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.340
come home, have a drink,
look at our photos,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.790
Facetime our friends, and
start all over the next day.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.560
And that's a
wonderful experience.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.780
And it can really
give you a vision

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.550
of the world that's really
hard to get anywhere else.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.820
And Africa has that
sort of majesty

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.520
and that sort of
magic that sucks you

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.130
in when you're on safari,
that first elephant you see

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.410
in the morning, that
first lion that you see

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.130
is just like, whoa, there
is a lion six feet away.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.240
I mean, that's an amazing thing.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.820
But sadly,
unfortunately, there's

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.500
a lot of issues
in Africa that we

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.080
don't see when we're on safari.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.930
There's a lot of problems that
are just sort of over the hill

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.360
or around the corner
or maybe tucked away

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.550
in a little metal shed
somewhere that we drive

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.590
by on the way to our lodge.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.420
And part of the point
of this presentation

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.540
is to peel that curtain back a
little bit and talk about some

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.290
of those issues that are a
daily occurrence in Africa.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.620
And a lot of those
issues, there are

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.810
a ton of NGOs trying
to help solve,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.930
but the reason I'm excited
to be here at Google today

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.120
is that there's so many
great minds at Google

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.192
that I think a little
bit of thought here,

00:05:01.192 --> 00:05:02.650
I think we could
come up with a lot

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.140
of other innovative solutions
on some of these problems.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.460
Some of them are
super easy problems.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.570
They look super easy.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.520
How to keep elephants away
from crops, for instance,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.820
how to keep lions
away from livestock.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.640
There's all sorts of people
trying all sorts of things.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.120
Other problems or more sort of
endemic and economic and larger

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.420
scale problems.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.900
But at any rate, that's why
I'm here today as sort of--

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.920
to give you a little taste
of all of that stuff.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.990
Obviously, one of the
biggest problems in Africa

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.210
today is elephant ivory.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.170
Elephant ivory is still
a widely traded product.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.360
An elephant is killed on
the continent of Africa

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.570
roughly every 15 minutes,
and those are always

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.250
killed for ivory.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.930
And the sad thing
is, it doesn't matter

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.760
how big or old or
young the elephant

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.510
is, if there's any ivory
at all, it will be taken.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.260
The good news is in
partnership, Wild Aid

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.090
has sort of led
the fight on this,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.540
China has in the last year
banned the sale of ivory.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.190
Hong Kong has banned
the sale of ivory.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.530
Taiwan recently banned
the sale of ivory.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.230
Singapore is about to
ban the sale of ivory.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.670
So there is progress being made.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.490
The price of ivory
is dropping per kilo,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.910
but it's still an expensive
product that people buy.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.810
Japan, if you didn't know,
Japan is the last legal market

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.830
for ivory left on the planet.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.810
And we're working hard
to shut that one down.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.140
An animal a lot of
people love, zebras.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.890
I'm sure you all saw zebras
when you were in Africa.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.040
I hope you did, anyway.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.230
They're everywhere.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.820
Zebras are doing well in Africa.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.120
But there are three
subspecies of zebra

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.675
that number less-- well, two
of them number less than 800,

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.360
and one numbers less than 4,000.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.710
The main zebra is about
200,000 left on the continent.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.280
They're wonderful animals,
but the problem with zebras

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.450
is they're running
into a lack of habitat.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.130
As ranching expands,
zebras are now

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.149
cohabiting with cows and
sheep and all sorts of things.

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:12.690
And so when you
drive through Africa,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.090
you'll see a lot of zebras
outside the conservancy areas,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.590
hanging out with cows
and all kinds of stuff.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.020
But zebras are a--

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.740
who love zebras?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.390
Everybody loves zebras, right?

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.900
How many stripes
does a zebra have?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.475
One.

00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:28.850
Think about it
just for a minute.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.150
Rhinos, unfortunately rhinos is
another big problem in Africa.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
Rhino poaching for the horn.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.500
The horn is worth more by
weight than diamonds, gold,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.870
and cocaine.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.460
Currently, the
price of rhino horn

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.970
is somewhere around
$15,000 to $20,000 a kilo.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.850
At its height, it
was $60,000 a kilo.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.700
So the good news is the price
of rhino horn is falling.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.960
But the bad news is
about three rhinos a day

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.060
across the African
continent are poached

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.130
for rhino horn, three a day.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.599
There's only about 25,000
rhinos left in the wild.

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:09.390
So you do the math.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.090
In the last few years,
something like 6,000 rhinos

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.260
have been poached.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.530
So if the current
trend is not reversed,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.800
rhinos could be extinct in the
wild in about 20 years, which

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.900
is a sad thing.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.090
The rhino poaching
peaked in the '70s,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.400
and then went down in
the '80s, and early '90s.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.900
And then beginning in the 2000s,
a new market opened in Vietnam

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.390
for rhino horn, and they were
claiming that it cured cancer,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.049
that it was an
aphrodisiac, that it

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.780
did all these wonderful,
magical things.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.010
Rhino horn, for
your information,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.830
is made of the same thing
as your fingernail, keratin.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.290
So if you really
want rhino horn,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.330
just bite on your
fingernail or your toenail.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.650
There's more of it there.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.140
So what we try to do
is we try to discourage

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.890
sales of rhino horn in Asia,
which is a difficult thing

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.070
to do.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.030
There's a lot of solutions
people have proposed.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.150
Some conservancies
shave off the horn.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.760
Some conservancies
poison the horn.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.370
But this involves a
very expensive process

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.180
of tranquilizing the animal
with a vet, bringing it in,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.840
and even with a horn
cut off a rhino,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.350
poachers will still kill the
rhino for the stump of horn,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.390
it's worth that much money.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.720
This rhino is named Najin.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.020
She is one of two
remaining Northern White

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.280
Rhinos left on the planet.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.590
She and her pen mate, out of
the photo, are the only two

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.660
of this species
left on the planet.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.056
The male died earlier this year.

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:42.180
You may have read about it.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.900
His name was Sudan.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.580
I have a picture
of him coming up.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.320
She is too old to breed,
and so is her friend.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.970
They are kept under lock and
key, 24 hour a day armed guard.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.770
Most conservancies
in Africa that

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.360
have rhino populations
in Northern Africa--

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.460
just as an aside,
my work, today I'm

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.175
going to talk about sort
of Central Eastern Africa.

00:10:05.175 --> 00:10:07.800
I'm not going to really mention
South Africa or Botswana or any

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.760
of those other places.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.040
The experience here
is in central Africa.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.160
But these problems are
all across the continent.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.290
The problem with having
rhinos on your conservancy,

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.610
it's very expensive.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.550
You have to have 24
hour a day armed guards.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.960
So rhino conservation
is a pricey thing,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.550
but it's important.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.560
You guys all saw rhinos
when you were in Africa?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.660
Pretty amazing animals.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.500
Gorillas.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.040
Who's been gorilla trekking?

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.940
Yay!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.110
One person.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.780
Gorilla trekking, if there's
one thing you do in Africa,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:46.920
if you go back to Africa, and
there's one thing you do, this.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.130
Go see a gorilla.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.010
It's a lot of work.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.060
It's a lot of money.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.710
Take some time.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.850
Take some effort.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.510
But it is the most magical thing
you will ever do in your life,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.060
and I guarantee you.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.610
This guy was about six feet
away when I took this photo.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.360
This was in Uganda in
the Bwindi Impenetrable

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.100
Forest, which isn't
so impenetrable,

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.740
because I got there.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.557
There are about 950
mountain gorillas,

00:11:11.557 --> 00:11:13.390
highland mountain
gorillas left in the world

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.680
in the sort of corner of
Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.140
in that little area.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.370
They're squeezed in there in
three different national parks.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.310
And gorillas face a
lot of challenges,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.880
habitat loss, deforestation.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.660
They're occasionally
killed for bushmeat

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.560
and occasionally killed just
for sport, which thank God,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.530
not a lot happens.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.280
But occasionally, they are.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.930
These are not the kind of
gorillas you'll see in a zoo.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.560
The gorillas in a zoo
are lowland gorillas.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.050
Mountain highland gorillas
don't do well in captivity.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.840
That's why you'll never
see them in a zoo.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.850
But when you see
them in the wild,

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.980
this guy was-- like I
said, he's a young male,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.680
I think a male, young male.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.655
He was about six feet away.

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:01.030
When you trek with
gorillas, they

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.821
allow you to have an
hour with the gorilla.

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:06.280
So basically, I was just
sitting on the forest floor.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.640
And right before I shot this
photo, the large silverback,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.980
the large male of the group,
who's maybe 400 pounds,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.200
he was off five or six feet
away from me, and he got up,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.700
and I was lying
down with my camera.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.230
He got up, and he started
walking towards me.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.650
And I was a little intimidated
with this very large animal

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.149
coming.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:26.680
So I stood up, and
I was about to move

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.559
and the guide behind me,
the Ugandan guy behind me

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.850
just kept whispering in my ear.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.280
He was like don't move.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.616
Don't move.

00:12:34.616 --> 00:12:36.490
And the silverback went
right in front of me.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.230
I could have reached
down and pet him.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.813
But the whole time
that was happening,

00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:44.331
my guide just kept saying over
and over and over, don't move.

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:46.580
So when you see a gorilla,
it's an amazing experience.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.420
I strongly encourage you if
you ever go back to Africa

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.100
to do it.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.990
From a tourism point
of view gorillas,

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.900
for instance, are the largest
grossing tourism activity

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.530
in Uganda.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.970
So the money that they
make from gorillas

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.360
actually goes back into
the economy in a good way.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.300
The corruption
isn't so bad there.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.680
So the money you spend, you have
to get a gorilla permit and all

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.180
of that.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.830
But it's a lot of money,
but it's worth it.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:15.820
Giraffes.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.570
Another favorite.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.890
Who loves giraffes?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.430
Yeah.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.020
Who doesn't?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.120
Everybody sort of takes
giraffes for granted

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.720
when they go to Africa.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.800
But giraffe populations in
Central and Eastern Africa

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.980
have declined 40% in
the last 30 years.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.710
Not very many people sort of
take that into consideration.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.960
This is a reticulated giraffe
at a private conservancy,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.500
Old Yogi in Kenya.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.080
Giraffe populations are
in trouble in Africa.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.600
Why?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.440
They're poached for their
skins, occasionally meat.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.700
Their tails are used
for fly swatters

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.210
and mostly for their
skins and meat.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.470
Unfortunately, also, they're
running out of habitat, food,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.490
all sorts of problems.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.280
If you ever get a
chance to do a walking

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.880
safari with a herd of giraffes,
I highly recommend it.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.490
When they run, it looks
like they're in slow motion.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.327
It's one of my favorite
things to watch ever,

00:14:17.327 --> 00:14:19.410
but a lot of people don't
realize the giraffes are

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.520
in big trouble.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.590
All across the continent,
they're in big trouble.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:25.830
Elephants.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.010
Again, this is a herd of
elephants in Amboseli National

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.900
Park in Kenya.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.230
Elephants are a huge driver
in the economy in Africa.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.480
It's estimated that
one elephant can

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.600
bring in over one million
dollars of tourism

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.710
revenue in its life, versus
a few thousand dollars

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.440
for the poacher
who gets the tusk.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.510
Poaching is an
interesting thing.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.910
They will take the mothers--

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.340
elephant herds are
matriarchal societies,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.440
so they're run by the ladies.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.470
When the guys get to be
teenagers, they're booted out,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.640
and the ladies stick together
the rest of their life.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.450
Poachers will take any tusk
and leave the little guys

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.950
as orphans.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.180
There is a great orphanage
in Nairobi, the William,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.110
or the Daphne
Sheldrick orphanage.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.600
Has anybody been there?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.830
Yeah, it's great.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.207
Last year, they had
some awesome news.

00:15:19.207 --> 00:15:20.790
It's the first year
in their existence

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.190
they haven't taken
in a new orphan.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.640
So that means poaching is
down, which is great news.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.750
The way poaching works,
as I understand it,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.630
there's usually one
guy in a village who

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.560
owns the gun and the bullets.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.560
And if you want to poach
an elephant or a rhino,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.940
you go rent the gun, buy a
few bullets, and off you go.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.634
Mostly, you get your
friends with you.

00:15:40.634 --> 00:15:42.300
And when you sneak
into the conservancy,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.980
you take the gun
apart, and each person

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.435
has a different part of the gun.

00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:48.010
You ride your motorbike in,
you put the gun together,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.040
you find your animal, shoot it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.570
Gun disappears.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.990
Boom, out you go.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.240
That's normally how it's done.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.130
You actually buy the
bullets, and they're not

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.600
very good shots.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.400
And that's why,
unfortunately, in a lot

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.620
of cases when an
animal is poached,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.350
it's a long, horrible process,
because the people aren't very

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.270
good at what they're doing.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.620
Some of them are.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.640
Anyway, you can see in some
places you go in Africa,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.720
elephants are very
wary of people.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.690
They'll sort of shy back
from you when you get close.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.870
In other places in Africa,
where for instance, in Uganda,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.360
where there's not so many
tourists and the poaching

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.669
isn't too bad, the elephants
are much more aggressive

00:16:23.669 --> 00:16:25.710
towards you, and they'll
come right up to the car

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:31.870
and sometimes even chase
you, which can be exciting.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.760
Any part of
conservation in Africa

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.640
must include the local people.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.290
You can't get anywhere without
the local people on your side.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.140
You have to give them
a reason to be invested

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.060
in the conservation program.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.640
You have to give them
a reason to care.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.275
You have to give them a
reason to be involved.

00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:53.650
You can't just come in and
say, this is what we're doing.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.900
Here we're going to do this,
this, and this, and this,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.680
and you're going to
be happy about it.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.090
You have to be really on
board with the local people

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.180
for any long term
conservation plan.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.880
Unfortunately, wildlife
conservation in Africa

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.069
is not just like a 10 year
deal or a 20 year deal.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.180
It's forever.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.460
It's a forever deal.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.430
If the animals are going to
survive past our lifetimes,

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.410
in your children's
lifetimes, it's

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.250
24 hours, 24/7 conservation
for the foreseeable future.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.280
And the only way
that's sustainable

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.950
is by getting local
people on your side.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.160
These two lovely
ladies are Samburu,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.400
right outside the Samburu
National Park in Kenya.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.470
And they work with
an organization

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.940
called Ewaso Lions.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.220
It's a small
organization in Kenya,

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.800
run by a fabulous
woman, Shivani.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.030
And what she does is she finds
women in the village, who maybe

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.950
are a little older,
maybe they're divorced,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.460
maybe they've lost
their husbands,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.310
their children are
away, they really

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.830
don't maybe have too much
to do, or not involved

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.385
that much in the village.

00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:56.260
She'll take them out.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.210
She'll teach them how to drive.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.860
She'll teach them
how to use a radio.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.230
She'll teach them
how to use a GPS.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.600
And they become lion guardians.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.690
So they drive around,
and they look for lions.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.660
And when they find a lion,
they report that to the village

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.000
so that they can move
the livestock out

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.240
of the way of the lion,
and it gives them purpose.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.590
It gives them purpose
to protect the animals.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.350
It gives them purpose
in their village.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.640
It gives them responsibility.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.520
It gives them skills that maybe
other villagers don't have.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.660
So these small programs,
Wild Aid partners

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.380
with several small NGOs,
Ewaso Lions being one of them,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.880
and they really are-- it's a
very sort of micro conservation

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.450
efforts, just in
one little area.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.110
So not all conservation is like
WWF or something like that,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.010
worldwide.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.250
A lot of conservation is
just very small, little bits

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.920
here and there,
getting the job done.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.340
But these ladies were great.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.240
I spent all afternoon
with them and bought

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.860
some of their jewelry.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.220
Very interesting people.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.140
Chimps, another
of the great apes.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.180
Most people think
chimps are doing OK.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.040
You really don't hear
much about chimps.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.830
The chimps are under a
lot of pressure in Africa.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.140
This particular chimp
is part of a group

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.110
of chimps called the Bulindi
chimps in a region of Uganda

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.940
called Hoima.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.000
This chimp is-- there's
five families of chimps

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.410
in this area of Uganda.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.990
Uganda has about
5,000 chimps left.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.144
But this chimp is part of
a family of about 20 to 25.

00:19:28.144 --> 00:19:30.310
And they have been-- because
of habitat destruction,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.450
they've been reduced to about
two acres of forested land, two

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.230
acres.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.611
So it's about, maybe the
parking lot out here.

00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:38.110
That's it.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.970
That's all they have.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.600
And the area runs-- it's not
just one nice block of forest.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.220
It goes sort of down a stream
between everybody's yards.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.600
So these chimps are now stranded
in an island of humanity,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.610
and the only way they
can eat is to raid

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.670
farmer's crops is to
interact with people

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.430
is to cross busy highways, is--

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.250
basically, it's a
wild family of chimps

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.680
stranded in a sea of humanity.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.950
There are five such
families across Uganda.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.630
What is the cause?

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.460
Well, in traditional
African families,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.010
the family gets a plot
of land, and then,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.990
as they have children,
they divide that plot

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.002
of land up for their children.

00:20:19.002 --> 00:20:21.210
And so the plots get smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.280
and then as the children go
to school, they have to sell--

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.860
they cut the wood down
to pay for school fees,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.536
to pay for the books, the
uniforms, blah, blah, blah.

00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:30.910
And unfortunately,
what that does

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.660
is it creates less and less
habitat for the chimps.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.400
The chimps get more
and more desperate.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.400
The chimps interact more and
more with people and problems

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.330
arise.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.850
There's a great little
foundation called The Bulindi

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:48.040
Chimps, B-U-L-I-N-D-I. And it's
a one guy and his girlfriend,

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.582
and he's trying to
save these chimps.

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:52.540
He's a great guy, if
you're looking for a place

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.000
to donate $5 for $10 for
Christmas, he's great.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.190
And it'll help these chimps.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.610
This chimp, when I
was photographing her,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.630
she was picking sticks off the
tree and throwing them at me,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.219
trying to nail me
with the sticks.

00:21:06.219 --> 00:21:07.010
It was pretty good.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.110
I have one of the sticks
at home in my apartment.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.030
She was a good--

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.630
she had a good arm.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.702
But anyway, it was a really
sad day to film some of these.

00:21:14.702 --> 00:21:16.660
You have to have--
unfortunately, sometimes you

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.300
have to have a good sense
of humor in my work,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.520
because you can see a lot
of not so great stories.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.920
The great wildebeest migration.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.630
Has anybody seen that in Africa?

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.550
Yes, it's pretty amazing, huh?

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.540
It's unbelievable.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.020
So this was last February
in Ndutu, which is

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.230
next to Serengeti in Tanzania.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.810
For those of you who don't
know, the wildebeest migration

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.320
is the largest
remaining overland sort

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.870
of migration of animals left.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.760
There's a large one in Alaska,
the porcupine herd of caribou,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.317
but this is a little bit bigger.

00:21:52.317 --> 00:21:53.900
It's about 2 million
animals, and they

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.660
make this circular
track of 500 miles

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.370
in search of food and water.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.200
They're zebras.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.220
There's wildebeest.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.090
There's antelope.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.382
There's all kinds of animals.

00:22:03.382 --> 00:22:05.090
And when you watch
them, you can't really

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.190
tell who's making the decisions.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.030
But somebody is.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.614
I mean, there'd be
a little line going

00:22:09.614 --> 00:22:11.988
that way, another line going
that way, another line going

00:22:11.988 --> 00:22:12.530
that way.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.270
The reason I show this picture
is because it's uncertain

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.420
where this migration will
end up in 30 or 40 years,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.570
because of climate change.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.840
Right now, most of the
area of the migration

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.980
is in protected zones
in Kenya and Tanzania.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.530
They sort of do a big circle
between Kenya and Tanzania.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.970
But the question
is will it shift

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.560
because of climate
change, will that

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.080
habitable zone sort
of shift around?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.630
And if it does, what will
happen to these animals?

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.700
Will they start migrating
through Nairobi?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.490
That would be quite a scene.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.390
So that's another issue that
we work with at Wild Aid.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.510
We do climate change programs,
for instance, in Asia,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.040
to get people to
ride more bikes,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.930
to eat less meat,
things like that.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.164
So it's really a holistic thing.

00:23:00.164 --> 00:23:01.580
When you look at
conservation, you

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.050
have to look at
these big problems

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.760
of climate change,
these little problems

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.990
of the villagers, everything.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.640
Lions.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.720
Who doesn't love lions?

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.460
I love lions.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.420
Unfortunately, lions are
not doing well in Africa.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.870
There are only about 20,000
lions left on the continent,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.950
and they're being killed mostly
from human wildlife conflict.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.620
They will attack a farmer's
livestock or something

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.620
like that, and the farmer will
retaliate and kill the lion.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:35.630
This lion I shot at
sunrise in Tanzania.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.800
It was Serengeti in Tanzania.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.650
And she was looking at me for a
while and then got up and left.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.170
Lions are incredible creatures.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.510
And they need our help.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:49.480
Lions could be extinct in the
wild in 10 years or 20 years.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.110
So it's a dire situation
for a lot of lions,

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:58.050
and another part of the problem,
as with tigers in India,

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.310
these animals are relegated
to small conservation islands,

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.160
sort of, conservancies here
and there, all over the place.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.470
And it's very difficult for them
to get from one to the other.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.570
So the DNA pools are getting
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.380
and smaller and smaller.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.780
So there has to be a good way
to try to intermix these lions,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.240
and it's becoming more
and more challenging

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.330
as more development comes
across Africa, and by the way,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.790
the tigers in India, which
are doing really well,

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.960
have the same problem going from
one tiger reserve to the other

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.460
in India.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.340
Local people.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.700
Again, local people
are incredibly

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.000
important when you think
about any conservation plan.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.790
These are some Maasai herders
in the Ngorongoro Conservation

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.990
area just on the other side of
Ngorongoro crater in Tanzania.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.780
This is sort of the
back side of the crater,

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.960
and this sort of slopes
down to the Serengeti.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.100
This is called a Boma.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.620
It's their village
where they live.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.780
And these are young cattle.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.400
The older cattle were
off in the hills.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.790
But this is another organization
we work with called cop

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.900
lions, which is right in the
Ngorongoro Conservation area,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.520
and they work with
Maasai tribes to--

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.800
in some Maasai culture--

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.370
make sure I get this right--

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:29.280
a young man, to go from a child
to a man, he kills a lion.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.660
Is that correct?

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.640
And so the cop lions
works with the young men,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.610
and they train them
not to kill the lions,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.070
but to protect the lions,
just like the women

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.130
in the previous photo.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.150
So they go out, and
they guard the lions,

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.370
and they take pride
from not killing a lion,

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.926
but from saving a lion.

00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:50.050
And this is very important.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.590
Again, it's a very small
organization called cop lions.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.610
And they only work in the
Ngorongoro crater area.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.480
But it's working.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.800
It's having a positive effect.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.310
Another problem with
livestock growth

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.540
is that the villagers will push
their livestock after they've

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.440
overgrazed a certain area
outside the conservation zone.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.630
The livestock will
get slowly pushed

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.630
inside the conservation zone,
where the vegetation is better,

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.130
where there's better food.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.800
What that does is it pushes
the livestock closer and closer

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.410
and closer to the
lions, and then you

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.500
end up having inevitable
problems with lions

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.710
attacking sheep and cattle, and
then the villagers retaliating.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.340
So that's an issue
where there's a lot

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.940
of smart minds around the world
trying to figure out high tech

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.320
enclosures for sheep and
cattle, for instance, how

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.840
to keep livestock safe in the
middle of nowhere from lions.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.290
We work with
organizations that use

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.220
advanced solar power, sort
of motion detector lighting.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.050
We work with some
villagers in Uganda,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.560
who've cooked up this, like
for instance, elephants raiding

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.400
crops.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.920
They've cooked up this
elephant repellent, which

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.880
is elephant dung and
chili pepper and ginger

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.079
and rotten eggs all mixed up and
then fermented for like a week.

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:12.870
And then they run
around, and they spray it

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.280
all over their crops.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.540
It is the most foul
thing you've ever seen.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.090
But the elephants hate it.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.779
So the elephants stay away.

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:23.070
I mean, how you came up with
that recipe, I don't know.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.840
I had to film it one day,
and it was like not easy.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.100
Not easy.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:35.340
Anyway, those are situations
where simple ideas like this

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.392
can go a long way.

00:27:37.392 --> 00:27:38.850
So if you're bored
at home thinking

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.950
how would I keep a
lion away from a sheep,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.680
or how would I keep an
elephant out of the crops,

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.960
you know, just any idea--

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.820
there's organizations
all across Africa

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.210
trying basically anything
that works to try

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.232
to mitigate this problem.

00:27:53.232 --> 00:27:54.690
Yes, it's a lovely
photo of zebras,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.398
but that's not why
I'm showing it to you,

00:27:56.398 --> 00:27:58.140
and it's a lovely
Egyptian duck here,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.790
for you birders out there.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.570
This was shot in a private
conservancy, Old Yogi,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.140
in Kenya.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.550
It's a beautiful,
beautiful place.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.354
It's Tom Hanks'
favorite vacation place.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.770
It's a very expensive
place to go.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.540
If you rent the
whole place, you're

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.110
guaranteed to have
6,000 acres on your own.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.740
But anyway, they let us
come and shoot one day.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.290
And I was lucky enough to have
these zebras line up like this.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.900
The reason I'm showing you this
picture is because of water.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.290
Water is a huge
issue everywhere.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.190
Here, water is a big
problem, but in Africa, it's

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.170
a large problem as well.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.950
There's wells being
drilled all the way--

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.700
it's kind of like the
Central Valley here.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.930
They're depleting the water much
faster than it is replenished.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.800
And that's another thing that
great minds could focus on

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.990
is how we keep
water coming fresh

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.570
and on a daily basis for all
these people that need it.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.620
A lot of animals have to travel
long distances to find water,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.110
and then they end up competing
with the livestock and all

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.830
that sort of stuff.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.920
So it's an issue.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.080
Another big problem in
Africa is deforestation.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.150
The continent of Africa
is being deforested

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.040
at about twice the rate
of the rest of the planet.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.260
Why?

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.040
This.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.140
Charcoal.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.590
If you drive around rural
Africa, at least parts

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.840
of Africa that I've
been to, you'll

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.690
pass hundreds of
these bags of charcoal

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.130
on the side of the road.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.980
And people buy them,
like for instance,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.710
truckers when they've gone
out into the countryside,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.020
deliver their load on the
way back into the city.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.311
They'll buy a bunch of charcoal
and fill up their truck

00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:41.860
and truck that into the city.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.060
This is in the port of
Zanzibar in Tanzania.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.090
These guys are unloading
sacks of charcoal

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.810
from traditional dhow sailing
ships in the port of Zanzibar,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.590
which has changed very
little in about 900 years.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.700
So this is what it would have
looked like even 500 years ago.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.960
Somebody told me that just
alone on the island of Zanzibar,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.140
20,000 sacks of
charcoal a day are used.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.200
Now, why people won't use
natural gas or propane?

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.810
There's a lot of NGOs that
have tried to introduce

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.250
those kind of stoves.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.470
It's because it's a very sort
of ingrained cultural practice.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.500
For instance, in
Uganda the local people

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.500
believe that in order for
your beans to taste right,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.040
you have to slow cook them
for four hours over charcoal.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.390
You can't hot cook them over 20
minutes in a propane pressure

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.470
cooker.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.420
So it's a very
difficult process.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.870
It's very-- oh thank you--

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.850
changing these cultural beliefs.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.650
But unfortunately
Africa, like I said,

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.710
is being deforested
at a huge rate.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.659
And sooner or later,
like everything else,

00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:46.950
we're going to run out of wood.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.900
If you drive around
Africa, you see it.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.960
It's all over the place.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.860
For instance, if you go
trek with the chimpanzees

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.550
or the gorillas in the
Bwindi Impenetrable Forest,

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.230
as you walk to the
edge of the forest,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.380
it's nothing but deforested
hillsides, and then

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.600
all of a sudden, where
the national park starts,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.100
it's a shear wall
of forest canopy.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.560
Bushmeat is another
major problem in Africa.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.040
Bushmeat is any animal
that is consumed

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.660
for either food
or economic gain.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.240
Mostly, they are
animals like this.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.730
This is a hartebeest in
Murchison Falls National

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.990
Park in Uganda.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.540
Mostly they're antelopes
that are hunted for meat.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.200
For instance, on the way to
the park, on the day before,

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.970
there was a guy
walking down the road

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.330
with the hind quarter of one
of these animals over his leg,

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.440
over his shoulder.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.370
It's illegal to
hunt these animals,

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.690
but they're a huge source of
protein for people and money.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:50.980
They're sold to restaurants
locally and exported abroad.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.120
Unfortunately, the only way
to get a lot of bushmeat

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.010
is to go into the
conservation area,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.370
the national parks, set
traps, harvest the bushmeat.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.110
But as you'll see
soon, those traps

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.300
do devastating damage
to other animals.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.980
Gorillas, again.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.750
This was a gorilla I
shot the first time

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.220
I trekked with gorillas.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.570
I've done it twice.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.540
This gorilla and I were both
enjoying a torrential rain

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.230
storm.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.156
As you can see,
she's very happy.

00:32:18.156 --> 00:32:19.530
The great thing
about gorillas is

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.988
if you spend enough
time with them,

00:32:20.988 --> 00:32:22.625
or actually a lot of
animals in Africa,

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.000
and this is
something I encourage

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.210
you to do if you go back
to Africa, spend time

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.150
with these animals.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.210
A lot of time.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.210
A lot of safaris, they
pull up, they see a lion,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.459
they're like, oh look lion
[MIMICS PHOTOS BEING TAKEN]

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:36.320
and off you go.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.010
You don't really learn
anything about a lion.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.540
You get a picture, selfie.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.260
But that's about it.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.590
I strongly encourage you
if you go back to Africa

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.506
or if you haven't been to
Africa, when you go on safari,

00:32:49.506 --> 00:32:52.130
ask your driver when you find an
animal that you're really into

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.500
or really like,
just sit and wait.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.590
Other Jeeps will come and
leave and come and leave.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.260
But then sooner or later,
you'll find yourself alone

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.430
with that animal, and you
will see unbelievable things.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.320
If you just sit
still, you will see

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.109
animals are so much like us,
and there's so many things

00:33:12.109 --> 00:33:13.650
that they do, which
are entertaining,

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.600
far more than your
house cat or your dog.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.210
Believe me, a 400 pound
gorilla is way more

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.980
entertaining than your cat.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.490
So I just encourage
you as a person,

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.550
if you're a photographer,
or you're into nature,

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.720
just sit with the
animal, just sit.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.310
Tourism.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.400
Like I said earlier, gorillas
are the biggest source

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.650
of tourism income in Uganda.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.510
Tourism is a double-edged sword.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.310
It brings in badly
needed economic revenue,

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.300
but on the other
hand, the effects

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.570
it has on the national
parks and the animals

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.280
is not really settled.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.720
For instance, this photograph
I shot in a place--

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.880
in a national park called
Lake Mburu in Uganda.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.210
It's a beautiful
little national park.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.920
Normally, when I
travel in Africa,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.320
I have an armed
national park ranger

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.469
with me almost all the time.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.889
These people had rented their
own car, which you can do,

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.840
and they had driven it off road.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.909
As you can see, she's
very excited about getting

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.310
her iPhone photo of something.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.610
And the problem is when they
drive off road, a lot of times,

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.520
tourists don't
respect the wildlife.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.570
They get way too close.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:31.800
They speed down the road.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.320
They kill animals on the road.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.699
So if you go to Africa, if you
choose this mode of safari,

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:39.840
do it responsibly.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.350
Or if you go to Africa and do
any safari, do it responsibly.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.322
Make sure that they're not--
if you get an off road permit--

00:34:46.322 --> 00:34:47.030
you can get them.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.080
They're difficult to get.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.788
But you can get an
off road permit, which

00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:53.159
allows you to drive anywhere.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.190
Don't be these guys.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.790
Do it right.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.434
Respect the area that you're in.

00:34:57.434 --> 00:34:58.850
You wouldn't want
people over here

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.490
driving through your front
yard to look at your dog.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.590
Again, tourism is a
double-edged sword.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.820
Sometimes, when
you go to Africa,

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.870
you'll be blessed to have the
experience all to yourself,

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.510
but more than likely,
this is what you'll see.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.840
This is in Ngorongoro
National Park in Tanzania,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.040
one of the most amazing--

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.520
it's kind of the
Disneyland of Africa.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.720
Tanzania has, I
think, if I'm right,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.500
the densest population of
animals anywhere in Africa.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.400
So if you go on safari,
Tanzania is a good place to go.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.200
Unfortunately, in the
Ngorongoro Crater area, itself--

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.840
it's not that large, it's
large, but not huge--

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.140
on any given day, there can be
about 300 Jeeps in the crater.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.010
So just trying to get a
perfect shot of an animal

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.320
can be very difficult.
And a lot of times,

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.450
you'll find a lion or
something like this,

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.640
and the Jeeps will
just follow the lion.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.320
There are rules
about how long you're

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.060
supposed to spend with an animal
and all that sort of stuff.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.970
But a lot of times,
they're not followed.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.660
So again, nobody's really
sort of done any studies

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.980
that I'm aware of the effect on
animals, except that sometimes,

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.350
for instance, when
you follow a kill,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.570
if you're tracking
a cheetah or a lion

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.640
in Africa, trying to
photograph the kill,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.550
and you interrupt
that kill by putting

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.730
your car in the wrong place,
the animal will stop the kill

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:23.080
and move on and perhaps
miss a badly needed meal.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.605
Again, here's a sample photo.

00:36:24.605 --> 00:36:26.230
For those of you
who've been on safari,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.680
you've probably seen this.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.250
This is inside the
crater, Ngorongoro Crater,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.260
and inside here
somewhere is an animal.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.960
As a filmmaker, I've
been doing, like I said,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.630
wildlife films for a long time.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:45.280
When I see this, I just tell my
driver, let's just keep going.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.810
We'll find something else.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.840
And the amazing thing is if
you're super into photography,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.740
and you want to get some amazing
shots of animals in Africa,

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.780
you got to go out really
early before everyone else

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.890
and stay late.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.362
And the minute you
find an animal,

00:36:58.362 --> 00:37:00.820
get your Jeep in the right
place and start taking pictures,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.310
because you've only got 5 or
10 minutes before the guy gets

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.340
on his radio and says, hey,
we've got a great lion here.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.900
So unfortunately, like I
said, the money from tourism

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.510
is a badly needed resource,
but nobody's really

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.430
quite sure of the
long term effects,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.610
and tourism is just growing and
growing and growing and growing

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.960
and growing.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.610
Another big problem
in Africa people

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.730
aren't aware of too
much is vultures.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.250
I bet you didn't know vultures,
some species of vultures

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.560
have declined by 90% in
three generations in Africa.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.890
90%.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.990
Vultures are now a
threatened species.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.610
Why is that?

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.490
Who wants to kill a vulture?

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.170
Nobody wants to kill a vulture.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.840
The problem is when
a lion kills a sheep,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.110
the farmer gets mad at the lion.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.930
He knows the lion will come
back to eat that sheep.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.840
So he poisons the
sheep to kill the lion,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.830
but who eats the
sheep before the lion?

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.990
The vulture.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:05.990
Vultures are dying at a rate,
mostly due to poisoning.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.840
And this is another side effect
of human wildlife conflict.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.830
This is why so much energy is
being put into Africa right now

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.130
to mitigate human wildlife
conflict, because of species

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:22.010
like vultures, who are dying as
innocent bystanders, basically.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.610
So you'll think twice now the
next time you see a vulture.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.870
And the vultures
here, they had just--

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.060
this is a dead wildebeest
in Serengeti in Tanzania.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.247
It's amazing to watch
them fight over it

00:38:33.247 --> 00:38:34.330
and fight with each other.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.060
I sat and watched these
guys for about 45 minutes

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.150
before my driver got-- he
was like, what are you doing?

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.184
Nobody watches vultures
for 45 minutes.

00:38:42.184 --> 00:38:43.600
He's like, let's
go look at lions.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.670
I'm like, no, we're
going to stay right here.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.150
Leopards.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.770
Another favorite animal.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.320
Did everybody see a leopard
when they went to Africa?

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.352
Yeah, good.

00:38:54.352 --> 00:38:55.060
Good, good, good.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.560
Leopards are hard to see.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.640
They're very elusive.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.192
They're very shy creatures.

00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:01.900
The best way I look
for a Leopard is they

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.280
like to sit in trees like this
is look for the tail dangling

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.770
down there below the branch.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.039
If you look far away from
it, you'll see a tree,

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:12.580
you won't be able
to see the leopard,

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.590
but you'll be able
to see the tail.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.230
That's the way I
try to spot them.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.410
There are only about 12,000
leopards left in the wild.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.620
They're hunted mainly for
their skins, their skulls,

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.060
their bones, their teeth.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.080
It's unfortunate, but leopards
are a prized animal still

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.520
to this day.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.460
Occasionally, they're
even trapped and sold

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.860
to wealthy families
in the Middle East

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.650
as pets, along with cheetahs.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.330
But if you're lucky enough--

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.540
this was in the
Serengeti or Ndutu

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.430
near in Tanzania,
about 6:30 at night.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.980
That's when you best
see a leopard is

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.040
very early in the morning
or very late at night.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.540
Unfortunately, like
I said, leopards

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.080
are prized for their
skins and bones.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.580
Another big problem
in Africa, which

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.000
we have here in San
Francisco, is development.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.980
Where do we put all the people?

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.950
This is a big problem
in Africa as well.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.550
Cities are growing rapidly.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.320
The population is
growing rapidly.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.990
The wealth is growing rapidly.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.640
People want nice places to live.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.560
They want nice cities.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.020
This is Nairobi in Kenya.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.230
This area in the foreground
is Nairobi National Park.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.780
It's a small national park
just outside of Nairobi,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.840
where you can go just for
the day and see some animals.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.460
Unfortunately, if you go
to Nairobi National Park

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.260
and drive around
for the day, you'll

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.530
see that the animals aren't
in really great condition.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:39.130
They're under a lot of
pressure from the city.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.960
In fact, if you
spend a day there,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.470
you'll see people driving their
car, flying down the road,

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.700
and there's lions right
on the side of the road.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:50.110
So it's sort of an endemic--

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.870
it's a good little
microcosm to see

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.285
what's happening with
development all over Africa.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.330
This is sort of a sad
moment in our journey here.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.410
This is Sudan.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.870
This was the last
Northern White male rhino

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.540
left on the planet, who
died earlier this year.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.340
I had the chance
to visit him twice

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.450
over the last three years.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.400
He was 45 when he died.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.500
A normal rhino lives to be
about 30 something 36, 37 maybe.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.320
If you ever get a
chance to pet a rhino,

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.570
they love to be scratched
right behind their ear

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:28.650
there and right under their leg
here, sort of their underarm.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.512
Rhinos are actually
very gentle creatures.

00:41:31.512 --> 00:41:32.970
You have to be
careful around them.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.889
They weigh a lot.

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:36.180
If you're standing next to
a rhino and the rhino moves,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.660
you kind of got to move with it.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.820
But they're incredibly wonderful
creatures, and even this rhino,

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.810
at this advanced age,
the only one of his kind,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.250
they sawed his horns down
to make him less attractive

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.020
for poachers.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.900
He was in a walled enclosure
under 24 hour a day

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:02.340
armed guard his entire
life, because of his horns.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.070
Unfortunately, he was
not able to breed,

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.054
and the two females that are
left are too old to breed.

00:42:08.054 --> 00:42:09.720
They did take a lot
of samples from him,

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.240
and there are some organizations
here in the United States

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.910
and in Germany working
to clone rhinos.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.376
I don't know-- there's
no news about that yet,

00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.500
but I know that there are
two organizations working

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.417
to clone this species of rhino.

00:42:22.417 --> 00:42:24.000
But I think if you
look at this photo,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.400
you'll see a wonderful
creature and be reminded

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.380
that extinction is forever.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.930
Once these animals are
gone, they're gone.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.610
They're not coming
back, and that

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.800
is a big problem
in Africa, and it's

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.260
a big problem you could
see in your lifetime,

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.240
your children could
see in your lifetime.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.450
No more lions, no more
rhinos, no more giraffes.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.280
Can you imagine taking
your child to Africa

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.250
and not being able
to see a lion?

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.270
I mean, that's Africa, a lion.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:52.510
So think about
that for a minute.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.000
This is what I was talking
earlier about bushmeat trade.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.450
These are the
snares that are set.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:02.560
This is one ranger
facility in one corner

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.575
of a national park in Uganda.

00:43:04.575 --> 00:43:05.950
This is the amount
of snares they

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.540
collected in just six months.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.610
These are all made out
of just thick wire.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.250
They're set like a
noose in the bush,

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.730
and as the animal steps into
it, it tightens around there,

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.060
and then one end is attached to
a tree, and they can't get out.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.330
And then the hunters come
by and kill the animal.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.174
Unfortunately, this snare
doesn't care what it catches.

00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:30.090
So say you're out to
catch a hartebeest, which

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.250
is a large antelope creature,
and you want to eat that.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.450
Well, you might end up
with a cape buffalo.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.830
You might end up with a lion.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:41.270
You might end up
with an elephant.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.100
Another problem in
Africa with bushmeat

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.860
is homemade spring traps,
you know, the big kind

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.740
of old bear, Alaska bear traps.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.620
They are placed all
over the bush as well,

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.290
and they harm not only
the wildlife, but rangers

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.080
as well on patrol have to
be very careful of stepping

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.820
into these large traps.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.180
They'll pull you--
as you can see here,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.110
severed the foot right
off of an antelope.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.430
And here is a pile
of range of us snaps,

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.800
snap traps in the
same ranger station.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.260
This is about a six
month supply of traps

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.790
in one ranger station in one
corner of one national park.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.770
So you can see that
made out of leaf springs

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.270
for cars, all sorts of things.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.580
So this is the point
of showing you these.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.940
It's how we get people
weaned off of bushmeat.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.200
It's economic issues.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.520
It's food issues.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.510
It's cultural issues.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.020
It's all sorts of things.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.260
But we need to get
people convinced

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.770
that these animals are worth far
more alive than they are dead.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.810
That's the trick.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.540
Here's what happens when
an animal gets in a snare.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.180
Here's an elephant
with a normal trunk.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.490
Here's an elephant missing
his trunk because it

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.470
got chopped off in a snare.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:55.010
The morning I filmed
these guys in Uganda,

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.090
there were four young bull
elephants, male elephants,

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.060
and three of the four
had damaged trunks

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.620
from snares, three of the four.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.990
This was the only
one who was normal.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:15.170
This is a lion caught
in a snare from Uganda.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.310
The snare has
actually been cut off.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.400
They tranquilized the lion
and put on a GPS collar,

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.490
but this is the scar
left over from the snare.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:29.340
So you can see that these
are incredibly damaging

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.210
simple things.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.570
It's just a wire in the bush.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:35.850
But obviously, the people
don't want to catch lions.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.440
They're not trying to eat lions.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.110
They wanted to catch
some sort of antelope.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.020
Another problem with bushmeat,
this is a cape buffalo.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.530
So you have guys running around
with spears and bow and arrow

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:51.060
and basically any weapon
they can come up with.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.390
This was in Uganda as well.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:56.230
I'm not sure whether this animal
was the target of the attack

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.880
or whether he
charged the hunters,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.610
and the hunters threw a
spear in self-defense.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.370
I'm not sure.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.441
But at any rate, that
spear is not coming out,

00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:05.440
and that animal is going
to live with that spear

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.380
for the rest of its life.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.790
So these are the
sort of problems

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.980
that you don't see
when you're on safari,

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.530
or maybe you will see
an animal with a spear,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:19.400
but there's not a whole
lot of questions there.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.470
Ivory, again, is
a major problem.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:27.110
This is a habituated sort of
socialized bull elephant in Old

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.550
Yogi Conservancy in Kenya.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.049
He's 12 feet tall.

00:46:32.049 --> 00:46:34.340
So when I was taking this
photo, I was about this close

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.850
to that elephant, hoping
that he wasn't going to move.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.480
Elephants, again, are an
iconic species in Africa,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.890
and we need to work very
hard to curb the ivory trade

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:51.790
and make sure that, you know,
that anything ivory related

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:52.720
doesn't belong on you.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.845
It belongs on the elephant.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.060
This is a good example of
how ivory fuels conflict

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.100
across Africa.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.770
The wildlife trade
conservatively

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:08.360
is estimated to be about
$20 billion worldwide,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.190
the trade in illegal parts.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.290
For instance, Boko
Haram in Nigeria

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.450
has been well funded
through their trade

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:19.240
of ivory of Nigerian elephants.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.150
This is in a ranger
station in Uganda as well.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:28.020
This markings on the ivory here
is dried blood and some AK 47s.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.530
So you can see that there's
all sorts of sizes of ivory.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.900
And again, they'll take
any size or whatever.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.670
But ivory, not only--

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.020
it's like drug running
in South America.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.325
It fuels violence, and it fuels
instability in these countries.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:49.040
Again, this is that same bull
elephant in Old Yogi in Kenya.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.220
I just love this guy, and it's
a great photo of the ivory.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.430
You can see how in the
natural environment, how ivory

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.772
gets chucked up quite a bit.

00:47:58.772 --> 00:47:59.480
Here's an animal.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.771
Does anybody know what this is?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.870
Pangolin.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.650
Pangolin is the most
trafficked animal

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.550
on the planet, the most
illegally trafficked animal

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:13.280
on the planet.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.945
It's the anteater family.

00:48:14.945 --> 00:48:16.570
These little guys,
when they're afraid,

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:17.989
they roll up in
a ball like that.

00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:19.030
It's about like this big.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.520
If you were to hold them
by the tail and unwrap it,

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.500
it would be about that long.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.690
But their meat is
considered a delicacy

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.970
in many Asian countries,
and their scales

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.850
are dried and ground up
and considered medicinal,

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.840
have special
medicinal properties,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.880
none of which have
ever been proved.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.730
These three pangolins
are the only pangolins

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.410
I have ever seen alive.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.760
They're very elusive animals.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.690
Nocturnal creatures.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.789
You can go all day in
Africa, I mean, for a year

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:47.830
and never see a pangolin.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.111
Have you seen one?

00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:49.610
Yeah.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.540
Yeah, they're very hard to see.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.230
Yeah, they're very hard to see.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.570
I've looked and tried and
tried and tried and tried.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.080
This was in a bushmeat
market in Yaounde, Cameroon,

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.750
which is the capital
city of Cameroon.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.760
Here's the lady who
was selling them.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.660
That's her foot.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.610
You can get an idea
of how big they are.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.150
She was selling each one of
these pangolins for $10 each.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.240
I offered to pay her
$10 to take the photo.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.190
I took this photo
with my iPhone,

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.750
because I was there
pretending just

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.750
to be a tourist with
my Cameroonian guide.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.610
As soon as I gave
her the $10, all hell

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.150
broke loose in the bushmeat
market, and we left.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.910
So I was able to get one
photo of these poor pangolins

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.540
in a very sad state.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.670
There were about 20 pangolins
in this bushmeat market,

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.270
all in various stages
of consciousness.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.090
That is one activity I
highly discourage you

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.980
from doing if you're
ever in Africa

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.750
is to visit a bushmeat market.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.650
It might sound
fun, but it's not.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.630
Anyway, pangolins,
do some research.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.780
If you don't know much about
pangolins, do some research.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.450
The BBC just came out with a
really funny little pangolin

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.720
movie about three or four
months ago about a woman

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.790
in Zimbabwe, I think, who
runs a pangolin orphanage.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.420
It's a really cute movie.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.450
Unfortunately, this is the
result of the leopard trade.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:12.980
Here you can see the
leopard skin and the teeth.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.280
This is in a ranger
station in Uganda.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.340
This is the largest
stockpile of ivory

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.430
left in the world in
Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:26.410
It's about 50 metric ton
or 80 metric tons of ivory,

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.810
worth about $50 million
on the open market.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:34.760
This is one shelf inside
of two gigantic warehouses.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.240
The good news and the bad news.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.910
About a year ago, Kenya
had a similar stockpile,

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.530
and they burnt it.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:44.236
They made a big
deal of burning it.

00:50:44.236 --> 00:50:45.610
There are a lot
of organizations,

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.400
Wild Aid included,
pressuring Tanzania

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.380
to get rid of this ivory.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.060
One of the suggestions
we've given them

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.630
is to grind it up
and create a monument

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.910
to elephants out of it,
and they're considering it.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:00.100
I met with the Tanzanian
tourism minister

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.650
when I was over
there this spring.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:08.950
And he gave us a little tour
of the ivory stockpile here.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:10.660
It's kind of sad to see.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.960
But the reason they don't
get rid of this ivory

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.800
is because it's like
money in the bank.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.030
It's like gold in the bank,
because it's still worth

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.630
quite a bit of money.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.890
OK, we're winding down here.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:25.300
This is just a
quick shot of ivory,

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.880
and hippo teeth are
also a big traded item.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.000
You can see that this
tusk is four kilos, which

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.180
is about eight pounds, a little
bit more than eight pounds.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.270
And I show you this,
because 100 years ago,

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.410
tusks weighing 180
pounds were not unusual,

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.060
like taller than me.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.570
Nowadays, tusks weighing eight
pounds are what they trade,

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:51.390
and those are from
young, young elephants.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:55.652
Sadly, here's the result
of a poached elephant.

00:51:55.652 --> 00:51:57.110
This is what happens
to an elephant

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:58.520
when they take the ivory.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.800
This is in Uganda,
in a field in Uganda.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.670
But there is hope.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.400
Rhinos are making a comeback
in some parts of Africa.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.130
This is at a
conservancy in Uganda,

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:15.450
where rhinos were extinct in the
'80s from Idi Amin's soldiers,

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.460
driving around and
shooting wildlife,

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.500
getting drunk and
shooting wildlife.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.500
There is a conservancy in Uganda
called Ziwa Rhino Conservancy.

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.110
They started with six,
and now they have 24.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.410
Brenda and I were lucky
one day to see all 24.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.170
This is a one-month-old baby.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.630
So there are organizations
working very hard

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.810
to bring these animals back,
but each one of these rhinos

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:41.190
has an armed guard 24 hours a
day, every single one of them.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.600
So it's a very
expensive proposition.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.040
There are other countries in
Africa doing good conservation

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.580
work.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.534
Botswana is doing well.

00:52:49.534 --> 00:52:51.200
And there are other
countries in Africa.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.410
They're really pushing
hard for conservation.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:57.840
So again, people
in Africa, this is

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.710
a young girl from the
Ngorongoro Maasai tribe.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.920
The population in Africa
currently is 1.3 billion,

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.440
but it's projected to
double in the next 30 years.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.307
So a lot of minds
need to get together

00:53:11.307 --> 00:53:13.140
to figure out where all
the food comes from,

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.860
the water comes from,
the land comes from.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.260
There are challenges
ahead for sure.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:24.210
But this was a beautiful village
I visited in the Ngorongoro

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.070
conservation area.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.950
Lions, again, what's
the history, or what's

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:30.090
the future for lions?

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.440
This is the same lion I
photographed earlier you saw.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.440
This is after she got
sick of me and just showed

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.110
me the back of her head.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:37.660
And elephants.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.480
This elephant is
in the Nile River

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.910
in Murchison Park in Uganda.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.580
The ivory trade is coming down.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:49.260
Wild Aid recently got Sotheby's
and another big auction house

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.020
to no longer sell
animal products,

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.790
like rhino horn,
things like that.

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.350
So little incremental steps.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.190
But that's what we have to
do, just keep the pressure on.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.700
And these are some elephants
in Tarangire National

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.540
Park in Tanzania.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.464
It's a great place
to see elephants.

00:54:05.464 --> 00:54:07.380
If you ever go there,
and you want to see just

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.079
see elephants,
Tarangire National Park.

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:10.620
So that's it.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.120
That's me.

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.000
Here's my website.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.390
Here's Wild Aid's website.

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.240
You can write me an email
if you have any questions.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.630
I strongly encourage you to
find a way to get involved.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.980
Visit Wild Aid's website.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.130
Visit some of the other
organizations I talked about.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.870
The next time you
go back to Africa,

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:31.470
find a way to do eco-friendly
safaris or safaris that

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:34.870
give back to the community,
things like that.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.429
And I'm happy to
take any questions

00:54:36.429 --> 00:54:37.470
if there's any questions.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:39.180
I know we're just
about out of time.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.080
Thank you.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.050
AUDIENCE: In terms of
conservation efforts,

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.550
which African
country would you say

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:55.530
is leading the efforts, like
the government actually doing

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.970
a good job?

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:58.740
ANDY WEGST: I'm not
that well versed

00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.970
on the politics of all that.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:04.177
I know that each country has
its own unique challenges.

00:55:04.177 --> 00:55:06.010
Some countries are doing
better than others.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:09.900
For instance, Tanzania
really recognizes the value

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.780
of tourism, as does Kenya.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.220
Uganda is coming up.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.510
They see it.

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.810
But it's very difficult to get
that sort of infrastructure

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.780
in place, the
hotels, the airports,

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.250
all that sort of stuff.

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.980
A lot of countries see
that tourism is a future,

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.026
and their wildlife is important.

00:55:28.026 --> 00:55:29.400
But the problem
is they need help

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.730
sort of generating that
foundation, where tourists will

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.530
come, because you
need the hotels,

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.120
you need the airports you
need all that sort of stuff.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.290
So there are a lot of countries
sort of moving that direction.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:43.140
And when you travel
through Africa, I mean,

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.140
it's obvious when you visited
a country like Cameroon, which

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.260
basically has next to zero
tourist infrastructure,

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.359
and then you go to a
country like Kenya,

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:53.650
where you can stay in beautiful
hotels and restaurants,

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.410
and so--

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.940
it's a varied picture
across the continent.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.020
Some countries do
better than others.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.030
But it's just a matter of
trying to pull everybody along.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.370
And unfortunately, corruption
is a big part of it.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.124
So it's a challenge for sure.

00:56:07.124 --> 00:56:09.540
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, do
you have any recommendations

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.320
for finding some of these
eco-friendly safaris,

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.880
or how to--

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.580
ANDY WEGST: I can't give you
the name of any specific safari,

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:20.520
but if you're interested
in traveling to Africa,

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.764
there are some companies
that do better than others.

00:56:22.764 --> 00:56:24.180
There are some
companies that give

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:28.020
a certain percentage of profits
back into the local community.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.170
There are companies-- there are
lodge companies, for instance,

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:35.640
in Tanzania that only hire local
people to work at the lodges.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.417
There are-- so I would just do a
little research when you travel

00:56:39.417 --> 00:56:42.000
and make sure you're going with
a company that gives something

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.730
back, that involves a
community that provides--

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:47.710
they're not bringing in their
workers from somewhere else.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.830
They're employing local people
and all that kind of stuff.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.400
Thank you very much for
attending, and I appreciate it.
